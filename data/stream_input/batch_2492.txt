B00B5ARKDE|5.0|At first I thought this movie would be kind of like \\"The Avengers.\\" The movie turns out to be very different! All the Marvel superheroes and everything else are made out of Legos. It is more focused on Batman as a man and other heroes like Robin, Super Women, Super Man, the Green Lantern and many others.<br /><br />This move has a mix of comedy which I've noticed is in every Lego movie. It has action, adventure, great actors and even a lifelong lesson - sometimes you can't do things all by yourself, you need help. There are some pretty cool structures and machines. All these structures are built out of Lego bricks so you can really build them yourself if you knew how!<br /><br />The adventure begins when Bruce Wayne wins the \\"Man of the Year\\" award. If you don't know who Bruce Wayne is, he is Batman undercover. Then, the Joker commits a crime and Batman and Robin have to capture him once again. As they are trying to achieve their goal, Superman helps him. Batman gets annoyed with Superman but, at the end they work together and call in all the superheroes to defeat the Joker! If you want to know what happens at the end you must watch the movie.<br /><br />What I love about this funny, action-packed film is how it shows the relationship between Robin and Batman as somewhat difficult. This isn't very good for a side-kick and a hero. At the end though, they become good friends. Also, it shows all the heros' powers like Superman's strength and Batman's throwing skills. The best part for me is how everything is made out of Legos. And, as in most Lego movies, there are cool animations, good actions and great voiceover actors.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when the bat cave gets destroyed. It's action packed and shows Joker's \\"funny\\" side with his strange humor and his pie bombs. Superman helps them. But, the Joker and his partner Lex, who is running for president and using Joker to win election, gets away. Would you like to know how he was able to defeat Superman's power? Get a copy of this wonderful film and find out!<br /><br />I recommend this film for ages 3 and up. There's really no violence or harsh language in this movie. \\"Lego Batman the Movie\\" is extremely kid-friendly. I give this movie 5 out 5 stars. You can find it on DVD everywhere now.<br /><br />Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. Video review available at kidsfirst.org?

B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I love Daft Punk, and though saying that I know I'm still only a casual fan (in comparison).  I don't own all their music, but I like a variety of EDM, including their TRON and TRON: Remix.  Anyway, I was looking forward to anything new from the duo.  I came here this morning to listen to the samples and didn't find myself all that intrigued.  Actually, I was unhappy that something I'd looked forward to wasn't up to snuff.  I thought I might buy one or two of the songs, and skip the rest.<br /><br />My wife ended up buying me the album for my birthday and I love just about every song.  If you like Daft Punk, you'll like this.  Yeah its a bit disco, but forget that.  It still has the beats that move you (they just aren't featured in the samples).<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />-Giorgio by Moroder<br />This sample is completely wrong.  The song after the intro is exactly the kind of stuff you want from Daft Punk<br /><br />-Lose Yourself to Dance<br />Does exactly as the title says.  You can't help but run, or whatever, to this music<br /><br />-Contact<br />Epic uplifting tones that make you feel like your in an electronic cathedral.
B000TGCR3I|4.0|Fans of flawless anime characters may be initially repulsed by Tekkon Kinkreet; it doesn't fit the mold of things that usually roll out of the factories in Japan and, increasingly, Korea; the vision, and the character design, especially, are definitely NOT the norm, but don't let that stop you from enjoying a wondrous story, beautifully told.<br /><br />Complex characters literally jump off the screen at you; interwoven story lines, typical of the genre, do not disappoint; beautiful, thoughtful and truly appropriate music underscores the entire work. I tried to find the OST to no avail, but will keep looking...it's just that good.<br /><br />This is one that should not be missed.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved this game. It was so entertaining and interesting. Worth the money to purchase the whole game. Out of all the kindle games tried this is by far the best.
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|I'm not sure if my copy has a bug, but I cannot advance past the first move.  The game doesn't appear to freeze, as menus still function, but I certainly cannot go any further.  And, yes, I have read the help and understand how the game is supposed to be played!  It just doesn't work on my Droid 2.  This game defines the 1-star rating.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Quick and smooth download on my kindle fire. It does what it says with no problem. Has large buttons and easy to read numbers. Very useful if you are not a math whizzed.
B00B4804KS|5.0|What can I say. Its in 3d now. Most movies I would not watch again, but in 3d I will.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Really enjoy the excellent acting in this film.  The only thing better would be Blue Ray.  If you like Rita - also buy &#34;Blood and Sand&#34;.
1439170916|3.0|This book is a very scholarly book on cancer in general, and on specific cancers, and the history of<br />treatment of cancer.  It is a bit too scholarly for me.  I have not completed the reading of it.
B0043U98RY|5.0|The Rumors are true. This is one of the BEST SHOWS!!! I literally just started watching it, and Im hooked. Its like 300 meets Gladiator. Incredible acting and if I might say so..erotic! Definitely worth the purchase. :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill Climb has finally come out on kindle fire. I have only known it to be on android devices one of which I don't have. The kindle's screen is much bigger than a phone's so it is easier to play. Anyways I would totally recommend this game for everyone. It might seem hard at first but then you get upgrades plus there are hardly any ads. I give this app 5 stars.
0790731509|5.0|This is my favorite Paul Newman movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. Paul was a clever character and he provided great entertainment to all who watch this movie.
B00BT0ZS52|5.0|If you believe in past and future lives and the way we work on themes in each lifetime, you will love what the Wachowski siblings have done to make this movie. It is long and deep and intense, but how else to bring the story across?<br /><br />I  highly recommend this movie to deep thinkers and dreamers.<br /><br />Enjoy!!
B00006J9OT|5.0|This is an excellent selection of recordings.  The tonal quality is excellent.  It gives you the change to get into the mood and move to the music. Voice quality is outstanding.  Simply, a great choice.
B009JVSAVM|1.0|This review serves as a warning to those who purchase items from this seller and wish to send back a valid return on sealed DVD movies/tv shows/etc. I contacted the seller about my return of the Big Bang Theory seasons 1-5 DVD set and informed them it was sealed and unopened which meets their criteria for a valid return.  They asked if the item was still sealed and I said &#34;yes&#34;.<br /><br />After that they completely IGNORED my return requests.  I filed a case with Amazon and they are doing an A-Z Guarantee which will hopefully get my money back.<br /><br />They have TERRIBLE customer service and I will NEVER purchase anything from them again!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|What a ride!<br /><br />Taken by itself, this meets the highest standards of SF/action movies. The cast was great, even if Kahn sort of stole the stage from the Enterprisers. Effects and CGI can't be beaten, especially the various starships in distress. The plot moved well and kept the pace up right to the end.<br /><br />As a part of the Star Trek canon, it works pretty well. The various actors representing the younger versions of McCoy, Uhura, Scotty, and the rest had close-enough physical resemblances to the originals to keep the continuity believable. I'm not a die-hard fan, so I have no complaint about how this script fits with the rest of the Star Trek universe.<br /><br />That said, the highest standards of SF/action movies tend toward weak spots in a few areas. Would it have been that easy to forge official Star Fleet papers, not once but twice? Would Scotty's approach to that other ship have gone un-noticed? Would ... well, lots of things. Is it just me, or do recent movies demand more in the way of suspending disbelief?<br /><br />No matter, it was an evening very well spent.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B004GYY714|5.0|I work at a computer all day and like to listen to the radio. This free app lets you search for free stream by location, genre or show. Since we have an open wi-fi where I work this allows me to choose stations from local, interstate and international stations. It's almost like having satellite radio: I live in Arizona but grew up in the NY area and during football season, this allows me to listen the the NY sports stations to get my team's info rather than the local team's. Same with talk radio: some of the programs are delayed here, recorded and replayed hours later, so I can listen live to the east coast feeds.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Don't listen to the 1 stars. That is not even a necessary rating for this game. For this game to be on the tablet the only word I can use is AMAZING!!!  this game looks and plays really good. The driving in the game is awesome when you have to turn your tablet, however, it may be relatively hard to handle especially when running from the cops. But do not fear, the changeable control scheme is here. Instead of having to turn the tablet you make it where there is a little control stick, which is the way i like to play. The gas can also be changed from using using the throttle bar to simply just using the thumb press and drive. I personally, like the throttle, but they are both equally comfortable. The guns are very cool,especially the golden deagles. You can also fly helicopters, jets and planes.There are also boats of a thick variety including the jet ski. The fighting scheme seems to be quite similar to the gta series, in comparison to how to the way your character would kick them on the ground and punch like his arm is broken. Overall this game may have some really minor issues, such as the way you have to shoot by touching the enemy then firing. But that is just my opinion. That does not stop me from saying this game is definitely worth the money and the memory usage. 5 stars enjoy!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is terrific in that it has many, many versions and has audio. But... it has been &quot;force closing&quot; a lot lately when I try to use it. I've been using it to study the Catholic Bible on here (some good stuff to know) and it crashes. Otherwise works great and I'd reccomend. Note that I've had it for over a year before it started crashing just today.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This story is fun for all ages, until the twelfth time in a row you little one asks to read it. It's a very good book though.
B004VRK436|5.0|Very convenient to have both blu ray and standard dvd in this package.  Our son has Autism and loves the book, board game and especially the movie.  Many thanks, for making a little boy's day!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I like the more traditional tiles.  The game is visually appealing.<br />It's a great way to relax and play.  I recommend this version.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. Challenging but not impossible. Difficult enough to be interesting but not so much as to be frustrating. Can't wait for next installment. Brilliant!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|A  good novel.  Set in the south.  Well written.  Causes one to again question the issues if race and class systems
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was a quick but enjoyable read. Mitch Albom is a fantastic story teller. Dor was a lovable and believable character as Father Time. Such an interesting and creative tale about the coming to be of Father Time and humanity's obsession with time.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I love having all my favorite blogs post in one place. my inbox doesn't get full anymore. And I like I can save all my favorite posts and organize them by subject.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Best book ever!!!!!!! I loved this book so much I read it 25 times or maybe 27 times all I can say is that it's an awesome  book.
B009GED3HS|4.0|I know a lot of people get tired of shows as they wind down, but I just never get tired of HIMYM.  I feel like the characters only get deeper by the 8th season and it makes me sad that we don't get to watch it forever even past the &#34;meeting&#34;. I still find it just as funny and rewarding. For an 8th season, I liked that although there was the major story lines throughout, there were still individual shows with sillier lighter-hearted side stories.  It does get old when they do TOO much of just the main stuff.  SPOILER: Barney's proposal was amazing. I can admit I was a total girl and cried. The ONLY reason I took off 1 star is I don't like the Ted/Robin stuff STILL dragging out when we know he doesn't end up with her.  Get over it Ted!
1609611543|5.0|I READ THE BOOK, AM FOLLOWING THE ADVICE, GAVE UP THE WHEAT AND I'M LOSING THE WEIGHT AROUND MY WAIST LIGHTENING FAST!
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I loved \\"A Whole New Mind\\", so expectations were high. Pink did not disappoint.<br /><br />I'm a CPA and I could not agree more with the idea that I am in sales. Lots of firms do what ours does, and in order to win new customers and retain current customers we must provide a high level of service and make it personal. We are rarely a low bidder on new work, which makes our pitch important. We are in nonsales selling.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone. We sell in nontraditional ways everyday.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I am surprised how long the batteries have lasted, and how consistently well the sensor works.  The sensor works perfectly!  (I think it takes AA batteries -- so I'm surprised mine is still going strong).<br /><br />This thing is exactly what I needed for our attic staircase.  We have to go up a flight of stairs to get to the first light switch in our attic.<br /><br />I hung this in the middle of the attic staircase, and it lights up when I get to the second or third stair, and gives me plenty of light to get to the top of the steps without worrying about tripping or walking into the wall up there, looking for the light switch!<br /><br />I plan to get another one for my basement stairwell.
B002ZG974M|5.0|Bought to show my parenting class, was interesting to watch and compare lifestyles and how babies grow and develop in different surroundings.
0385349947|5.0|This book is amazing and I only wish it had come out when I was trying to figure my career goals out in college. It will definitely help you put things into perspective and give you the confidence and push you will need.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|First off if your looking for leftover or Cinderella cast off tunes you will be dissapointed. But if your looking for a good solid rock album well then this is the album for you. Influences for this album included rock, blues, pop, and country. Very good solid album all in all. My surprise album of 2013. I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Recommend highly.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|The stories are laboring on past my point of interest. He's introduced so many new characters and story lines that I don't even care to read on to the 5th book.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This is a cute movie, but I don't recommend it for children under 7 as there are parts that are scary and upsetting.  It also deals with death and loss, so make sure your kids can handle this.  Even if you think your kids will be okay, I would suggest watching it with them for an initial screening just to gauge their reaction.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|A movie I first saw when I was 16, and it still is worth the time to watch. Though only very lightly based on the true story, it is entertaining, funny, and serious when need be, as it happened in a time when madmen ruled.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Great for history buffs.  I am not a history buff, and instead watched a very boring movie where pretty much nothing happens punctuates by occasional Tommy Lee Jones hilarity.  I hope that was intentional, as it was the only thing that made this snoozer watchable.
B004EWFUQY|2.0|While some people have lost weight with this diet, I could not really stay with it because I just don't like meat that much.  I'm a carbo lover and it was going to be several days before the diet included any normal grain products.  Veggies were introduced after the initial phase of just protein -but that's not enough for carb lovers.  I have found that I need to do a variation of this diet and another diet which allows some carbs -you have to count servings though.  I do agree that an effort to continue the diet throughout your life is necessary -once a week.  But its very hard to get past the initial phase and lose the weight needed.  I may try it again later but as of right now its not in the plans.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, as I had heard some positive reviews and bringing back old arcade characters got me very excited.  The movie isn't very funny, and the Ralph character is oftentimes crass and unlikeable.  The storyline is difficult to follow and the characters are poorly developed.  I rented it to see if I wanted to buy it, and I am glad I did.  Not only do I not want to see it again, I am actively repressing memories of this movie as we speak.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This was a good couples movie. Would be good for expecting or new parents to watch as a couple. Wife and I really enjoyed it together. As a guy I wouldn't watch it by myself, but with her its ok.
B00C061I3K|4.0|I enjoyed this cd. It was fun. It has it's moments. But it's not the old daft punk. It's them experimenting on a new level. I loved it. They're doing it right.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Babel, at it's heart, is the story about a japanese girl that just really, really needs to get laid.<br /><br />Spoiler:  it doesn't happen.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A situation that is hard to imagine bringing any happiness or comfort, but it does. What brave young adults and wise parents.
B00C061I3K|4.0|1. Received this CD on time. Self-purchased, not a gift.<br />I bought it because I want to listen to the highest fidelity I can, but as I received it at work and have no CD players here, I made the purchase to get the AutoRip MP3 files to listen to as well.<br /><br />2. It is listed on Amazon as an AutoRip product.<br /><br />3. Amazon states: &#34;Buy an AutoRip CD or Vinyl Record, Instantly Get the MP3 Version for FREE&#34;<br /><br />4. It does not appear on my Amazon Cloud Player account, but Amazon shows on the SAME PAGE that I purchased it on the ads to the right of the player.<br /><br />No response from multiple Amazon sources. I will never rely on AutoRip again.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|If you believe, as I do, that there is an afterlife and that the major events that happen to you on this earth happen for a reason, you will love this movie.  If you don't, you will be disappointed that the two main adult characters do not meet until the end of the movie.  This is not a traditional love story.  It is a gentle story about grief and loss, about coming to terms with oneself and accepting one's gifts, and about discovering and uncovering a new way of looking at the world. I was surprised that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, since I don't think of him as particularly sensitive to these subjects, but he is a terrific director and does a terrific job here.  The acting is all first-rate.  This is a rare movie that treats the paranormal as something other than a source of terror.  I recommend it highly.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|RIP Andy Whitfield. His portrayal of Spartacus was some amazing acting. I'd recommend this show to anyone. Violence, great acting and a story you find yourself caught up in, can't stop watching to see what happens next.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really works your brain. Love figuring out puzzles &amp; contraptions. I really hope they make a lot more rooms soon.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A masterpiece of imagination. With vividly described scenes and believable characters, the reader feels as if he stands at the authors shoulder as events unfold.<br /><br />Hard to put down.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|wow! this was pretty much 1000% better than i thought it would be! Loved the story and the way they portrayed witches as a wide variety of creatures....plus hansel is sexy as hell!
B00CE004XM|5.0|My wife and I just finished listening to the cd - twice. It does set the speakers and the body on fire! We are in our 60s and this sounds like much of the music we grew up on. Joe and Beth have really brought soul music back to life. This is rhythm and blues at its best!<br /><br />Heh, Heh, my wife and I also did \\"It\\" while listening, and it was a lot of fun doing \\"It\\" while listening to Seesaw!! It really took us back years but the sound is 110% modern - crisp and clear. You will enjoy doing \\"It\\" too.<br /><br />Beth and Joe make a perfect musical pair. Her voice is strong enough to hang in with his guitar. Beth Hart is one of the best singers I have ever heard in my life. Sexy too! My wife and I really had a blast listening and grooving to this music!<br /><br />NOTE: my screen name comes from the former Jimi Hendrix Hey Joe list that was on Yahoo in the early years of the Internet. It was a great bunch of Hendrix and guitar fanatics.
B005DOKL3E|4.0|I thought this was a cover that you could attach your kindle to. This was disappointing, but nothing I can do about it.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|This is such a cool movie!  Follows the book which I had read and loved.  She is perfect for this part and what can you say about Daniel Craig!  I went ahead and bought it although I had already seen it and love seeing movies I love over and over (as I did the Jesse Stone movies I could only buy to see, still cheaper than going to the move)!  Can't go wrong!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I obviously loved the first and second season enough to buy a third. This show has such amazing writers. What is so great is that they manage to stick to the shows roots of the brothers hunting day to day monsters while at the same time coming u with a main antagonist per each season. The format is quite similar to that of the 'Big Bad' the 'Scooby Gang' would face in every season of Buffy The Vampire Slayer. The show has developed so well and as long as you can tolerate the overacting it's a great one to sit down and relax with. We love it, the kids love it, it's just overall a great form of cheap entertainment.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|really good game for an magic the gathering fan awesome gameplay and really exciting its somethinv like chess but with 100% more fun
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is an awesome game, if you haven't. downloaded. and played it you should. so go ahead and get the game! what are you waiting for? go now hurry!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Even after reading this time and time again I find that there are more lessons to learn for the character in this book. It's so nice to see my kids pick up on some of these great lessons too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works the way it is supposed to. I looked at several apps and this one seemed to be the one that worked best.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|She is just an awesome girl that can sing and sing and sing all kinds of moving songs! thanks Judith
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Easy read but the story kept you sucked un the whole time...of course you'll root for the underdog and it's so worth it...
B006M4F67A|5.0|good game to play, hard to see the levels of the tiles, have to try clicking on them to see if it works
1477428690|1.0|The subject and content are good. But it is very poorly written. The worse thing is that there were lots of grammar errors. Please, check the grammar before publishing the book. Readers are annoyed by it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game fun but not as many things as on Pc and I am going to make more films on youtub at Jerome ASF.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever! It is so addicting! I literally  can't stop playing it!! You so should get it!!! I'M SO NOT KIDDING!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I used to play them a lot long ago and I love that this is the sort of game I remember from Big Fish.  I recommend it if you like HO games.
B006DHAT5K|4.0|OK, i'll admit i am NOT an anna farris fan:  she is SO wrong for this flick; looks OLD and a bit worn around the edges.<br /><br />the REAL draw for this flick is chris evans:  he is charming, funny, sexy; everything a ROM-COM male lead should be and then some.  evans steals every scene he is in with his winning smile, comic chops, and screen-chemistry; dude looks great (he is pure eye candy).  i had no idea evans had this kind of screen charisma; have only seen him in action-adventure and serious flicks.  note to chris evans:  MORE sexy rom-coms, dude.<br /><br />the ex-tended version is better than the theatrical version.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|I have always loved James Taylors music and I am so pleased with this Christmas album.<br />It is a very nice selection of songs and sung so well by James. This is definitely the perfect album to play for our family gatherings or just the lay back relaxing times. I absolutely love this album - a James Taylor item no fan can be without!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app. Great love love love fun for everyone. Can't wait yay. Wish I could have free gems though.
0316223239|5.0|I started \\"Room\\" yesterday evening and finished it as soon as I arrived home from work today. It's an intense, beautiful, enlightening story, told through the eyes of a five year old little boy who has lived in this \\"Room\\" all of his life. It's one of those novels you pick up and can't put down until you're through. I was enchanted with \\"Jack\\" -the little boy who tells the story- and quickly grew to love him as a colorful, honest, and heartfelt character. \\"Room\\" was all he ever knew for his first years and it is incredible to hear him describe his and his ma's survival of their captivity there, but also his wonder and awe at the 'outside' when they finally escape. Truly moving and totally captivating, I would reccommend this to anyone for a great read.
2707306959|5.0|I bought this for a French reading club and was happy to find it at a reasonable price because French editions are usually expensive.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Another classic to add to the collection although I did forget that there is smoking in this movie but other than that great animated movie
B009HUB40Y|5.0|A quick game everyone enjoy it, children love to play with it. Your design have make good purpose, we are appreciated.
030758836X|4.0|The book is very long. But it very interesting. You won't be able to put it down. I recommend it.
B005721W9O|4.0|Good relaxing entertainment and a blast to watch.  The actors are perfect for their roles.  If you know anything about the mania that surrounds Star Trek, you'll love this movie.  Highly recommend.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Fun game love the oz theme. Works great on my kids tablet and they love it as well. Fun game.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson does a great job bringing the Last Battle to life.<br /><br />The way he describes tactical manauvers is plausible and logical.  The battle scenes are large, and violent, with the earth itself being torn asunder as the armies of dark and light clash.  Characters I have grown to respect and love shine in the moment, and one in particular goes down in a kamikazee last ditch that is amazing to behold.  The ending did feel a little bit rushed, but I feel that maybe Sanderson was constrained a little having to stick to Jordans vision, perhaps not having the leisure of embelishing the prologue as much and he, and I might have wanted him to.  For some reason, I wanted to see Nynaeve back in the Two Rivers as a healer again, offering healing to the Asha'man still afflicted by the taint (so far, only she can cure it).  And wouldn't it be amusing to see Lan struggling to play the farmer beside her!  Alas, the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, so in my mind scenes such as this must remain.<br /><br />Thank you Joran for such an amazing series, and thank you Sanderson for bringing it to it's completion!
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark, in my opinion is still one of the best mystery writers in the world.  She is right up there with Agatha Christie.  Can't wait until her next book comes out!
1623420148|5.0|I can't remember the last time I had this much fun reading a book.  Learn from my mistakes and don't try drinking a caramel macchiato while reading!  This book is so well written from the hero's point of view.  It's witty, smutty, and funny...in other words it's the perfect read:) Highly recommend!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I am greatly biased toward Columbo.  I absolutely adore the late, great Peter Falk and have been a fan of his most famous character since childhood.  There really isn't much one can say negative about this series except that with just 69, there were too few episodes/movies!<br /><br />Peter Falk was always brilliant in everything he was in.  He was equally as comfortable in a flat-out comedy role as he was drama.  He brought all of his characters to life and you cared about them because they had that something special that a truly good character always does.<br /><br />Lt. Frank Columbo was no exception to that.<br /><br />The good Lt. always had an idea from the start who the murderer was.  The joy of each episode was watching him expertly lead the killer into giving him/herself away.  It didn't matter how carefully they thought they had planned out the crime, once Columbo was on the case, he would exploit their greatest weaknesses and end up letting the bad guy catch himself.<br /><br />Along the way, there was a lot of humor to lighten the atmosphere, but the shows never turned into a comedy.  Let's face it, murder isn't exactly a light-hearted thing so it can always be welcome when our hero can bring a smile into an otherwise dark situation.  Whether it was always commenting on what he and Mrs. Columbo enjoyed or liked (Mrs. Columbo has to have had some of the most eclectic interests and tastes of any human being as she was a fan of everyone and everything!), Columbo whistling &#34;This Old Man&#34; or even bringing Dog along on the investigation, he could always make you smile.  Rarely did he lose his temper and even when he did, you couldn't fault him for it.<br /><br />The &#34;Columbo&#34; series can also boast something that so precious few series of today can:  superior writing.  A good mystery is nothing if the writing is poor and doesn't have the characters to back it up.  The crimes in &#34;Columbo&#34; were unique for their time and kept you on your toes looking for that one thing that told Lt. Columbo that his prime suspect was guilty.  The supporting characters were just as well-written as the regular series characters.  None of them were there just for the sake of bringing in a big name guest star.  They had background and could be pretty complex.<br /><br />And about those guest stars.  Some of the biggest and best names in Hollywood were on the receiving end of Lt. Columbo's razor-sharp wit or were the victim he fought so hard to find justice for.  Leonard Nemoy, George Hamilton, Patrick McGoohan (he also directed five episodes), Robert Culp, Robert Vaughn, William Shatner, Jeanette Nolan, Ray Milland, Jack Cassidy, Ida Lupino, John Dehner, Leslie Neilson, Dean Stockwell, Dabney Coleman and dozens of others.  To say &#34;Columbo&#34; was 'star-studded' would be an understatement.  We even get to see Peter Falk's real-life wife, Shera Danese in six episodes.<br /><br />Along with well-known actors and actresses, some of the cream of the Hollywood crop worked behind the scenes.  Steven Speilberg, Steven Bochco and Johnathan Demme served in roles of directors and writers.  Two of the episodes were based upon two of Ed McBain's &#34;87th Precinct&#34; novels.  Even Peter Falk himself served a double role as actor and director for the last episode of the first season.  Henry Mancini and Mike Post were two of the many, and very talented, composers who worked on the show.  Over the course of its run, Columbo won thirteen Emmys and two each of Edgar Awards and Golden Globes.  Well deserved recognition for such a fine show!<br /><br />There is a reason why &#34;Columbo&#34; ran from 1968 to 2003.  The quality of the acting and writing was top-notch,  The story lines were unique and compelling.  It was a pleasure to learn a new Columbo movie was on the network schedule because you knew that the two hours you would spend watching the show meant a great way to spend an evening with good entertainment that challenged your mind.<br /><br />Oh, and just one more thing...you'll really regret it if you don't add this brilliant complete series to your DVD collection.  Anyone who is a fan of well-written, brilliantly acted drama would be proud to own this collection!ntertainment that challenged your mind.<br /><br />Oh, and just one more thing...you'll really regret it if you don't add this brilliant complete series to your DVD collection.

B002ZG976U|5.0|Cher is perfect for this part. On stage as well as off, she dignifies sexuality and exquisitely puts it to music and video. Christina and all, puts an excitement if not sizzle into the characters and burns heat into the performances. If the movie could give off their perfume, woooooow, we may not need the live stage but just this screen (ya right) . Morays play a part in any review, whatever, but Burlesque is a wonderful American-French invention and must be treated with respect.
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|Sadly another Amazon app that will not run on my generic tablet.  It shows the start screen for an instant then jumps to a game board but won't do anyting. There is no menu or instructions.so maybe it does work but I'll be danged if I know.
B00CDXOXB4|1.0|If you've read the book, you will hate this movie. They changed the names of characters and key elements from the plot. It might as well not even be based on the book. Additionally, the acting was terrible.
0525951652|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading Follett's books, and am eagerly anticipating his last in this trilogy. Fascinating and engaging, and I think an interesting historical account brought to life through fictional characters. I like how Follett weaves his characters and their stories into the timeline of the first world war, and is able to keep it accurate, at least how I understand it. A good read.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Loved the movie in IMAX theatre, went there alone while my husband watched our babies and then we switched and he went to watch it too while I was watching the babies. The release to Internet gave us a chance to watch it together. Looking forward to the rest of this wonderful story. We know the Tolkien's Hobbit almost by heart, it was fun to see this movie, even though Tolkien's Hobbit is a story for children while the movie is made to be a more grown up 'prequel' to The Lord of the Rings.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Well I waited for reviews of other readers, just to make sure I was not the only one totally shocked by this book!<br /> I mean what happened to Bill? She was the love of his life, and Sookie never loved anyone with the same fervour as Bill! (book 1). And her Boss, he was a great friend. The truth is, I don't even remember what the story in this last book is, just that it ends abruptly! With no emotion what so ever. I was very disappointed.
B0057GYO9K|5.0|The 291 people that gave \\"Nevermind\\" 1 star should be shot. How is it that Kayne West's 1st album is 4 and a half stars but Nevermind is only 4?
B009R659L8|4.0|Hated to put it down.  Another MHC classic, just too many characters to keep track of.  The suspense was not drawn out as in many of her other books.
B0001AP12G|1.0|There are 2 good songs on this album, the rest is mediocre at best. If you are thinking about buying it, don't. Download it instead.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena was amazing and slept you wondering what was going to happen next! Can't wait for the sequel!
098555780X|5.0|I bought it and love it, as described in the description,<br />thanks..will buy some more when my friends interesting,<br />think they will love it too...
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Not really a memoir, in the same way Old Man and the Sea is not really about fishing. A midlife musing full of jokey jokes, literal gags, and modern Greek anecdotes doused with feminist perspective on the comedic Never Never Land inhabited by mostly clever boys who write sketch comedy for appreciative, but not nearly as clever TV viewers.<br /><br />Recommendation: Come for the Italian Rum cake* and stay because her mom would want you to and Mr. Fey is a bada*s who might come after you if you don't.<br /><br />* joke reference; see last chapter
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is always my go to game when I have nothing to do or I'm bored.  I think it's great.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|The program was well written and directed. The casting was also well done and it was easy to feel the identity of  each of the main characters. Yes, I have already recommended the show to others.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album has some intangible qualities that make it just stick in your head.  I love Daft Punk, however this is a change for them.  Something totally different that caught me off guard but it is a master work of techno trance fused with the sounds of the 50's-70's with classical running through it's veins in a subtle undertone that just makes you go wow.  Different isn't always good but this is a home run at the bottom of the ninth at a tied up seventh game of the World Series.  Just my thoughts.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|I struggled to follow the story-line, and as I sit here trying to summarize, I still can't tell you what was &#34;going on&#34; in this film. Visually stunning, VERY well acted (especially Tom Hanks).But the average movie-watcher (me) spends too much time trying to make sense of it all to really enjoy it.<br />  Perhaps if you went back and watched &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; a few more times it would start to connect. I won't.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Gorgeous, well built men...dancing and taking their clothes off!  Seriously?  What's not to like?  I saw this in a theater, and wanted to have the DVD so I could catch what they were saying.  Don't know who the idiot was who thought this needed dialogue, but thought I would see what they have to say.  Watched it twice, and still haven't heard a coherent sentence.  Maybe I need to quit fast forwarding it through where all I see moving is their lips.  I don't think I loved the ending.  I'll have to watch it again, and listen this time!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I can not find gyroscope button in my kindle 2 while another kindle devices got it? Could you tell me how to turn it on.  It makes me feel more realistic. Btw, it's a good free game.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|Interesting and funny.  I really enjoyed Tom Cruise, he played the part well.  I'm a rock fan, so I enjoyed the music.  I missed it at the theater, and wanted to see it.  I'm glad I bought it, even though it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's totally a page turner. I can barely even put it down because it has things that you wouldn't see coming.
0425252868|5.0|loved every minute of this book from start to finish.i hope it get's made into a film insperational 5 star's all the way a must read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I actually rarely read fiction. My job requires me to read a great deal, but I was looking for something that would hold my attention and provide a good &#34;escape&#34; from work related reading. This book was GREAT! Never a dull moment, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns. Very well written and interesting up to the very end. I loved the fact that it was unpredictable but not unbelievable. I'll definitely read more by this author!
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|Dexter continues to stun me!  This season seems to be taking a different turn focusing on the relationship between Deb and Dexter, in the wake of last season's finale.  The plot, thus far, has been interesting and I am excited to see where it goes despite a lack of a well defined villain in the early part of the the season.  I am sure, however, it won't disappoint!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I will start out by saying that I am not a fan of Helen Hunt.  Not her work, but just her in general.  I enjoyed this movie so much, I actually started liking her a little.  It was a beautiful, sad, and sometimes amusing story of love.  I come away knowing that everyone in this world needs, and deserves at least one person to love them.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|This movie pleased the whole family!  It has great voice acting, an interesting plot and great animation.  What an idea to take the standard holiday and fairytale characters and mash them up into an evil fighting team.  In the end, there were even some 'tearjerker' moments.  Definitely worth the time to see!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is the first time I've bought and used an aftermarket cooler and I couldn't be happier with it! I don't overclock, however, I still want to keep everything nice and cool and this does it right. be warned, while it isn't difficult to install, it is much more intensive than a stock cooler.<br /><br />As a side note, I installed this in a system with an ASRock Extreme6 mobo and I am able to utilize all four slots for memory without issue.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Same David Boreanaz is great, if you like crime shows and love storys then these are the series for you
B0087EVHVW|5.0|I have always been an AMD guy when it comes to building my own PC. Lately I have been thinking about jumping ship and I decided to try my luck with this processor. I couldn't be happier with the results! This processor hit the sweet spot in price for performance for me and it beats the pants off my old AMD 955 BE. Games run extremely well and video editing is smooth is quick. Very happy with this proc!
B0053O89IS|5.0|Love David Boreanaz and this about this is about the best series he has been in, if you like him then you will like this
B0053O89KG|5.0|Beckett and Castle are such a great pair!  I have enjoyed watching this series from the beginning.  I hope it continues for a few more seasons.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Bones is the best crime and love series if you love those kind of shows then this is the series for you
0596009208|5.0|I really liked this book.  It did an excellent job of providing the context and rational for the language features that were presented.  It is written in a style that helped comprehension and retention.  The exercises were very useful in helping the brain engage and think more deeply about what was being written about.  I highly recommend this book for anyone new to Java, and needs to learn quickly.
B009O2XY12|3.0|All of a sudden it stopped wworking but when i was playing it i<br />was so determined to keep going
B009NY43NY|1.0|This has to be the most common question being asked right now.  It truly is as bad as some of the early reviews said.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|This is a wonderful movie especially since it was filmed in my birthplace Southport NC<br />Amazing Makes me miss my family there
B00CL50KDY|5.0|This is a great movie for my teenager and even me.  We enjoyed it so much, it was funny and if you like the zombie stuff it was definitely a new twist on the zombie movies.  Again we loved this movie.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I tryed to get access to my Nexues 7 tablet thru here and it did not work I tryed everything  I wanted to order books but can't
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i personally think that subway surfers is a better version of temple run. It has better power ups and mostly everything is better. I will definally rate this as a solid 5 out of 5.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Oddly, among the Duke's many westerns, this one often gets overlooked in favor of other critically acclaimed pieces like The Searchers, Red River, Rio Bravo and the John Ford cavalry trilogy. Personally, I think this one rates right up there with the best of them. Well written, tightly directed, beautiful cinematography and a great cast including Robert Mitchum and James Caan. Though the film is sometimes considered a direct remake of director Howard Hawks' 1959 movie, Rio Bravo, especially as the plots have so many overlapping themes, I agree with Hawks himself who always asserted they were similar but different. The themes in this one mirror much more closely 1960s values as opposed to 1950s, including feisty strong and independent women (beautiful too); blurring lines between good and evil (Christopher George as the master gunfighter Mccloud is superb as he exhibits \\"professional courtesy\\"); and an overall more easygoing flowing style including the fun bantering dialogue. A fine film, hugely underrated and well worth seeing.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I absolutely loved this story of the &#34;Hillbilly&#34; Alvin York. as portrayed by Gary Cooper. Mr. York, a simple hard working man with great moral courage. A man with an overwhelming love for his country, and for his God. Not wanting to profit from the service to his country.
0345803507|5.0|Amazing reading, can't put it down even if I wanted to.  My inner goddess didn't let me...<br />Get it, you will love it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game for all ages. Easy to play and provides fun while traveling and at home. Grandkids like it and so do I.
B004UOCF3W|3.0|I'm a big fan of Foo Fighters, but for some reason this album just didn't cut it for me.  They have others that I enjoy much more.
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Arnold is awesome in it although he probably shouldnt have picked a character that is old and semi-retired as his first comeback movie, but this is a Clint Eastwood kind of role and he nails it !  awesome action from Kim Jee Woon
B005AERS74|5.0|I can listen to this album over and over again and not get tired of it.  This is such a great album.
B00BAXTYDK|4.0|Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan reinvigorated the franchise and hit what is pretty much universally acknowledged as a high note with its strong characterization, flamboyant villain, and an emotionally gut-wrenching finale. But, where to go from there? This was the question put before producer Harve Bennett and star/director Leonard Nimoy when it came time to produce the third Star Trek feature film.<br /><br />Perhaps inevitably, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock somewhat lacks its own identity, being a film that resolves many of the narrative loose ends of its predecessor and restoring order to a universe in chaos. The story revolves around restoring Spock's essence (or katra, as its called here) to his body and reuniting the crew of the USS Enterprise. If Wrath of Khan focused on aging and death, Search for Spock rather explores the nature of friendship and life. Worthy material, to be sure, but Spock's reputation as one of the odd-numbered Treks is not one of the highest in the franchise. We have elements that don't quite work: a bar scene that invites comparison with Star Wars' Mos Eisley cantina (and it is not favorable), some lackluster effects work for the Genesis planet that breaks suspension of disbelief, microbes evolving into worms, Vulcan puberty subplots, and Christopher Lloyd's surprisingly incompetent Klingon villain. None of these are truly awful, but the lack of polish in their execution brings a level of hokum to the film that was mostly absent from its superior predecessor. Yet the film also has many fine moments: the old crew going rogue and stealing the Enterprise to rescue their old friend, Kirk reacting to another devastating loss, the noble destruction of a series icon, and of course the long-awaited reunion at the finale; these moments resonate deeply. Ultimately, even if it struggles to escape the shadow of and lacks the narrative finesse of the second film, Search for Spock accomplishes its goal of restoring balance to the Trek universeand is a worthwhile film.<br /><br />With rather pleasing transfers of the first two films in the series, it's unfortunate that Search for Spock's transfer is somewhat disappointing. While still clearly high-definition, the smoothness of the transfer betrays substantial digital scrubbing of the image, and as a result the level of visible detail is somewhat lacking. The lossless audio track fares better, really coming to life in the third act as the Genesis planet falls apart all around Kirk and the Klingon commander.<br /><br />Extras replicate the [[ASIN:B00006G8HX two-disc special edition DVD]] while adding a new commentary by Trek writers Ronald D. Moore and Michael Taylor and two additional HD featurettes on ILM's effects work for the series and the actors who played young Spock in the film.<br /><br />Overall, a good package of a pretty good film. Recommended.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I have always liked columbo and was glad to find this deal on amazon. Me and my son have started from season 1 and have almost watched the whole thing. Good clean detective show with some humor.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is one of the best photo editing apps available for free. I have it on my Kindle, and on my Android phone and I honestly use it every day, if not a few times a day. It's super easy to use, and even lets you share your finished photo with just about everything.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I like the Hobbit it is a little different than the others but i like it.  It is a little<br />scareier than the others  I don't think I would let the younger grandkids to watch it.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great theatrical elements. Great time killer if you can stay away from the clues.<br />Really has super graphics and easy to spend hrs figuring this out.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Columbo has always been a favorite of ours. My wife and I have watched it whenever we could on the television. For years, we have missed Mr. Falk, but now we can watch this quality program anytime we choose. This is a must for mystery lovers.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Homage to the old school h&amp;s games.  I highly recommend this game to anyone longing for the glory days of rpgs like diablo and medieval.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The show is amazing, the quality of the set is amazing, and I bought it for $30 brand new with every copy in every format that's not VHS. If you're a fan of the series and want it to own this is a no-brainer. Great service, speedy delivery, I think I took advantage of these nice people. Great bargain doesn't even do them justice. Thanks!!
B00B05Z77U|5.0|I bought this for a high school senior who is graduating this month.  He's brilliant, very quiet and this book describes him to a tee.  I haven't presented it to him yet but I think he'll love it.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|It was a decent movie but it fell short in the story. The characters were not that relatable and the story was predictable. It was worth renting on demand but I would not buy it.
0345803485|3.0|This book was good with a few parts that drag a bit.  If you looking for something to turn you on, it may work if you can get past the poorly written book.  It is somewhat repetitive and predictable.  I am still left wanting the second book just to see where it goes, but am also expecting the book to be poorly written as well.
B007MDB71O|5.0|The movie is not as good as the book.  With that said it would be hard to match the level of the book. This movie touches on all things imperative in the book to continue the series. The time lapse in the book makes more sense than the rushed pace of the movie but the movie still does justice to the overall meaning of a wonderful book series.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book I don't think I've ever laughed so much while reading a book. I even bought a 2nd copy and gifted it to my mom to read before I made it out of the 1st chapter. Its just one of those books you can start reading being pissed and before you get through the 1st chapter you'll be cracking up laughing. Its such a great story line I totally recommend :-D
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|This album has lived up to all the hype it was given. \\"Instant Crush\\", and \\"Doin' it Right\\" are songs that I keep on repeat. This is a short review and it doesn't do this album justice but, YOU WILL DEFINETLY NOT BE DISAPOINTED!
193700788X|1.0|After reading the reviews posted I realized I could save some time with this simple statement.  Miss Harris doesn't care so why should you?
B0089AD8IO|5.0|This was my introduction to Doctor Who, and it made a big impression. As great as any subsequent actors are in the role, Christopher Eccleston will always be The Doctor in my mind.  The show has great, imaginative stories, skilled actors who bring out the humanity of their colorful characters, and it's all so very British!  I don't know what took me so long to get into this long-running franchise.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I liked this! Some of the reviews were not so good. I am an avid Pratchett reader and this did not disappoint. In fact I thought it was deeper and more thoughtful than some earlier books while keeping the humor and intelligent satire. It is always great to learn more about a character. Pratchett is a more British, less vulgar, and a bit more intelligent, satirical look at the world that reminds me of South Park. Hmmm.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I've been buying Next Generation Blu-Rays as they come out and have not been disappointed. The picture and sound are absolutely gorgeous, and it is around this time when the show found its legs and soared. The extras are pretty cool too.  I listened to a commentary track and learned some interesting things that went on during the production.  This is a labor of love and it shows. Well worth it for this Star Trek fan!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Takes a while to put the pieces together in this one.<br />A quick read because u don't want to stop<br />Smartpork
B0073RBQY2|5.0|Nice. Bought this about 6 months ago. It's one of my 4 year old's favorites and he has oh, about 100 dinosaurs. He likes to fly it around all the time. No scratches on it from rough play. It even goes in the bathtub.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|The one good thing I have to say about this movie is the acting was really good.  The actors had to play different characters in the various time spans/eras depicted in the film, and they did a great job of it.  Other than that, the film was very long, very slow, and just got more and more confusing as it went along.  I really tried to stay with it for the first two hours, but after that I was just so lost I turned it off with 20 minutes to go.  There just wasn't enough to tie the threads of the story together.  The only point I got from it was what happens in the past affects the future.  Well duh, everybody knows that.  No earth-shattering revelation there.
B0057RCFQS|4.0|DVD version gives better clarity to the movie I have enjoyed for years.  If you enjoy adventure movies this is a good one.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Can't go wrong with these movies on DVD and with Blu-ray.  Only draw back is that there aren't any bonus materials on any dvd.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I'm sad because I finished this book, and it's the last book in the series. :(  There should be another book explaining things more, lime what happened to Gale and Haymitch and Effie.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|well worth watching, cause it have action scenes, it show how a father and son got along, it was just a good movie
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Only on second level and very entertained! Must like puzzles and be aware of details.  Will continue to look for a second edition.

B00466HN6S|4.0|love cartoon, this is really not a cartoon but  liked it anyway. It was well worth watching becasue of the easter theme
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. Purchased all except the third season and am gong back to purchase that one as well.<br />If you like the story you will enjoy the version of the younger Merlin. A lot of humor between Arther and Merlin thrown in for good measure. They have taken some twist and turns within the story that keep you guessing.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|good movie, I collect all kind of dvd's movies and this one was just a added collection, but it was good
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|This is a feel good Rocky type movie and is currently my son's favorite. We have watched this over and over
1623420148|4.0|[[ASIN:B00CW665VI Tangled (The Tangled Series)]] was a fun read! It's  a light read and perfect as a summer or weekend read. The writing's good, the story is LoL funny and Drew (our main character) is definitely engaging!<br /><br />For fans of romance and rom-com's READ THIS BOOK!
0385341008|5.0|This is a heart-warming and educational book providing the reader with some insights how folks survivored in isolation during  WWII.  I couldn't put the book down!
193700788X|3.0|First off, note that this is not an Amazon Verified Purchase. That is because I waited to get this book from my library instead of buying it. The last several books have been such stinkers, I knew not to waste my money buying this.<br /><br />That said, I am glad this series is over (hence the 3 stars-for the mere act of ending it so I no longer have to read more of these books!). It is wrapped up and that is all I wanted since after the books started going downhill (book 9 and onward). I am pleased to have read it and now I have closure and can move on.<br /><br />My criticisms are nothing new. Just an extension of the past several books. Harris destroyed Eric's character by making him do things he never would have done per the earlier books. As I did not recognize him toward the end of the series, I was pretty ambivalent about a HEA with Eric and Sookie. I knew it wasn't going to happen going into this book and accepted it. I am not sure why Harris felt the need to distort his character into someone her readers could no longer identify. My best guess is that she didn't want him to be Sookie's HEA and was too lazy (or burned out) to create a story line that made sense as far as their romance was concerned.<br /><br />The romance in this book was blah. Really blah. I was not excited about it, nor did I care for it. Again, Harris has managed to lull me into complete ambivalence about what happens to her characters. The one sex scene was kind of gross actually. The wording left much to be desired (seals? ewww). There was no chemistry to speak of either between the two characters. I liked seeing some of the old characters again but there wasn't much there really. All of a sudden Sookie's past friends, frenemies, lovers, etc. all descend on her house to help her solve a mystery. Sookie's attitude in the past several books was so dark, gloomy, and pissy I can't believe she had any friends left! She never really made amends with Amelia. That was all brushed under the carpet. Like, \\"thanks for your help! I might give you a call sometime. Maybe.\\" No one seemed all that worried about Bob. Quinn was in and out for no apparent reason. Nothing came together well at all.<br /><br />I am sad for Harris actually. I could continue to criticize, but deep down I feel less angry about this outcome than I feel disappointed in this writer who started out strong, had such fantastic ideas and such success, then flushed it all down the toilet with a few books. This series is now closed, and there is no going back for a rewrite. Readers will always have a bad taste in their mouths about the ending. Harris really ruined the reading experience of tons of fans. She brought the characters to life and then let everyone down when it was most important not to. A bad book in the middle of a series can be forgiven. A bad book ending a series, never. It is a huge black smear on her reputation as a writer. I am not sure what happened here, but I doubt she will ever be able to live this failure down. I know Harris is trying to convince herself it is because we didn't like what happened to the Eric story line, but it goes way beyond that. I feel duped by the sloppy writing, lack of continuity, by the loss of any excitement or imagination at the end of this series. For the last book, I would have loved to read something interesting and exciting that left me feeling like Harris redeemed herself. If only this book had the same feeling that drew us into the early books with such fervor. What a shame.<br /><br />Well, CH, it's been fun (kinda), but I can't say I am sad to see this series end. I hope your next series brings you joy and that you can convince some of your readership to come back and give you another chance.
B008220DGE|1.0|Given all the great reviews when The Master came out, I was excited when I finally got a chance to watch it. I should have checked with Amazon reviewers first, who have overwhelming given it 1 star. I agree with them, what a waste of my time.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I never saw the series in the movies, but I wanted to see the last one before it was gone, so I ordered this to see first... I was happy that I ended up seeing the whole series...
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|COLUMBO might not be for the mystery lover who sits on the edge of a chair, biting his/her nails. But if you want to enjoy a unique character - always wearing his 'tell tale' raincoat, in a great range of situations....and solving the problems (often) in amazingly &#34;simple&#34; ways, you will really like Columbo. You might even say: &#34;now why couldn't I have thought of that?&#34;  It is really enjoyable DVD.
B009RH9FR6|3.0|The case was actually below my expectations.  The quality of the leather is very good. However, the rotating stand does not work.  The stand keeps falling when I set it up in the stand mode. There is not enough stability. Therefore, I only use my kindle while lying on a flat surface.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|This DVD of Les Miserables comes with high ratings (like 8 academy award nominations&#34; and even &#34;Best Picture of the Year) so you are led to look forward to a LOT.  And yes, it is excellent---very touching, with amazing &#34;ups and downs&#34; that sometimes bring tears.  It is a musical--so it helps if you are a music lover. The moving story will stay with you always!  It is not for small children because of some violence but history lovers will truly love this one!  I did!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game was fun yet challenging at the same time I think that I challenged your brain to see how fast you can make your move
1609611543|2.0|By the time I read through to the middle of the book I lost interest since it was so repetitive.  I was looking for something simple to follow.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I am a huge fan of the show and Clark for sure!!!! The action and emotion in this season in particular is at an all time high. I was so pleased with the flawless viewing of the entire season. The CD and picture quality were top-notch. There was not a scratch in sight. I watched the entire season in only a few weeks...which is a really short period of time for me! :)
B007SGM084|5.0|I was never one to sit down and read a book, but I had to see what all the fuss was about so I decided to just go ahead and read it. Not only did I read this entire trilogy once, but I've now read it 6 times consecutively! And will be starting again because I just can't seem to get enough! Yes this is erotic romance, but it is so much more, my love for this story is more about how their loved helped him realize his fears and overcome what he thought was impossible. Add in all the drama and action, and of course the incredibly well described erotic parts, these books are fantastic!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I downloaded this as it was free and I love anything to do with space/astronauts etc but wasn't really expecting that much.  Actually this turned out to be the best read for ages - funny, really clever, well researched and I couldn't stop reading - definitely the sort of book you sit up till late to finish and I thoroughly recommend it.  Read somewhere that The author has got a deal which I think is well deserved.  Think this would make a great film.  Will definitely be looking out for AW's next book.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I haven't used it very much yet, since I have a Kindle Touch that &#34;lives&#34; in my purse for reading purposes.  After I downloaded the app, I tried it out, and everything seemed to work just fine.
1616550414|5.0|It's a pretty big book, I haven't finished it yet but so far I'm loving it. Very vivid images, a fan's collectible.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|The movie really explains why K's relationship with J. The show melded well with the story line from the first two MIB's.
0062068423|4.0|I havent started with Harry Hole from beginning and this is my 3rd book from the series. I liked it the most and it explained me a lot about Harry.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I had never watched the made for TV movies that were the pilots for the series.  While I found them to be a little campy, I loved the great story lines, and had a great time recognizing all the guest stars that I forgot were part of the show.  This brought back so many memories.  I only wish I had kept my action figures from my childhood!
B000024KRO|5.0|I'll start this review by saying \\"Vavooooom\\" wow Purpendicular is an awesome effort by this line up. 14 tracks of great music. It rocks, its well produced, its got melody, and the price was decent. This is the best effort by far with Morse on guitars. This one is a must for any Deep Purple fan. This review comes after reviewing \\"Now What?!\\" Comparing the two \\"Purpendicular is far superior, not that Now What? is bad, its just not as loaded as this one. Get this cd, you won't be sorry.
B009UZBLSG|4.0|It does what it is supposed to do: pumps out video to a big screen. Being able to charge the phone at the same time is a nice plus. I wish the micro-USB side didn't have such a large plastic housing, however; as others have noted, it is too big to fit with the Google-standard Nexus 4 bumper case installed.
B00BR0SGN0|3.0|In my opinion the cuts on this cd are a bit lackluster except for the cut Vincent Price, nothing on this cd stands out. I believe they could have put out a better product after 8 yrs. I also have to mention that Purpendicular, Rapture of the Deep and Bananas in that order are much better than Now What?! So I disagree with most other opinions concerning this cd. The production and sound isn't that great, the guitar playing sounds a bit hidden. I write this being a big DP fan and I have all their output since 69. I bought this to keep the collection complete. So their you have it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like every thing about yahoo the features-security and safety.<br />I recommand this product to every one. I can not compare this product with any other because this product is very understanding unlike other products. I have had this product since 2002 and I have no reason to change it for other products.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|Never noticed how crooked Tom Cruises teeth are in this movie until I saw it in Blu-ray.haha.  This is a great movie and even better in hi-def
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Great cast playing a terrific cast of charters. Has a bit of the flavor of Under The Tuscan Sun. I watched it more than once.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great game! Not of the best match games! You can play and beat it over and over never get bored!
B0019OP0GU|3.0|I got this for my daughter - age 6 - who loves Harry Potter, and wanted to see &#34;Hermione&#34; doing someting else. It's above her age. She didn't finish watching it. However I think it's a good family movie, but for ages around 10.
B00915G6YE|5.0|Very clear picture and sound.<br />Nice to see Yvonne introduced to this series.<br />Dexter just gets better and better.<br />Excellent set. ZONE A only.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Loved this book possibly better than the Guardians of Ga'Hoole series!  I give it 5 stars (*****) because everybody loves Greek Mythology right?
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great action reaction game tests your reflexes and judgement also adjusts to your abilities great for people of all ages.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|BETH HART AND JOE BONAMASSA RETURN WITH THEIR FOLLOW UP OF CLASSIC BLUES AND SOUL COVERS, HOT ON THE HEELS OF 2011's SUCCESSFUL \\"DON'T EXPLAIN\\" ALBUM.<br /><br />Beth's got a touch of Janis joplin, Etta James and a smashing of Billie Holiday in her and it shows in her soul-baring performances on this release. Paired with Joe again delivering another stellar performance. \\"As Joe Bonamassa grows his reputation as one of the world's most masterful guitar players, he is also emerging as a charismatic blues-rock star and singer-songwriter of stylistic depth and emotional resonance.\\" This one is all covers but that doesn't matter Joe kills it as usual.<br /><br />The song list of covers is by an A-list of artists.....<br /><br />\\"Them There Eyes\\" a 1939 Billie Holiday classic is sexy and fun, \\"Close To My Fire\\" from Slackwax is performed by Beth in an \\"oh so sultry\\" way, perfection.<br /><br />\\"Nutbush City Limits\\" by Tina Turner and Al Kooper's \\"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\\" are burners. Joe amazing guitar shines through.<br /><br />Their talents do well to compliment one another, as if they could do any wrong. Hart's range is exemplified on the album, as Joe's guitar dances hand in hand.<br /><br />The back-up band as usual, Anton Fig (drums and percussion), Blondie Chaplin (guitar), Carmine Rojas (bass), Arlan Schierbaum (keyboards), Lenny Castro (percussion), and Michael Rhodes (bass on \\"I'll Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\\").<br /><br />Lucinda William's \\"Can't Let Go\\" is next oozing with southern appeal, then \\"Miss Lady\\" by Buddy Miles, performed to perfection even though so vocally demanding.<br /><br />A sultry, jazzy rendition of \\"If I Tell You I Love You\\" by Melody Gardot has a great vibe and \\"Rhymes\\" by Beth's idol Etta James is next, it has attitude and showcases Beth's low end singing.<br /><br />\\"Sunday Kind Of Love\\" is another Etta Jame's classic, with a special meaning to Beth as it was a special song to her mom. Beth's quivering vibrato casts a spine tingling spell making this cover exceptional.<br /><br />\\"Seesaw\\" the title track, is a really fun song, high energy, with a lot of attitude. It is a Don Covay/Steve Cropper composition from Aretha Franklin's 1968 album Aretha \\"Now\\". A feisty horn section powers 'Seesaw', stomping its uplifting zest all over the song with a booty shaking swing.<br /><br />The album comes to a close with \\"Strange Fruit,\\" a song that began as a poem about American racism and lynching by Abel Meeropol and made famous by both Billie Holiday and Nina Simone. Beth adds her special twist to the song.<br /><br />From power ballads to edgy growls, the album is sure to please fans of soul and blues alike. JB's subtle playing and his flip side bad attitude paired with Beth's singing is smoke and fire perfection. What's next? The mind boggles with the exciting possibilities. Tours would be spectacular. More covers albums, definitely essential. How about a collection of Hart & Bonamassa originals?<br /><br />Never a dull moment when these two pair up.a spine tingling spell making this cover exceptional.<br /><br />\\"Seesaw\\" the title track, is a really fun song, high energy, with a lot of attitude.

0765325950|4.0|Some characters kind of get short shift in the conclusion, but it's hard to imagine any fan of the series not finishing it. It's a worthy conclusion.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Seasons 1-5, never a dull moment.  I'm so glad Amazon has showcased Stargate Atlantis in HD I have watched it...more than 4 times and still I see something new every time. If you are a Stargate fan and have not watched Stargate Atlantis seasons 1-5, do so and I am positive you'll love it as I do.
B00BHXUC8E|5.0|Three CD set. One with &#34;In Studio&#34; recordings, which is always awesome to hear. You hear the band being themselves, comments, BS, you name it, the fun stuff and the music. The next CD, live music, always great with Whitesnake. And the third the live Video, a great show to watch. Not as good as being there of course, but a good taste of what its like. A CD well worth having in yor collection.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|Percy Jackson is the teen version of Clash of the Titans. What was the reasoning the Ghostbusters claimed New York is like a Hell mouth for supernatural occurances? Did it start with War of the Worlds (radio broadcast)?<br />This movie is predictable only because it follows the Grecian tale.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|At first, we loved this app.  But the more we played, the worse the ads became.  I will be deleting this app.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|The film itself had an interesting premise but was shot more like a TV series/mini-series. You were left craving far more than a film should leave its audience. If that was the intention, to make us want more, it should have been made more grandiose. Even when Star Wars first came out, it started in the middle of the trilogy. This film has a weak beginning, a question filled middle, and an action laden third quarter. Movie over? Yes... Movie over roll credits. I can say that I'm glad I saw this movie on DVD not silver screen, because I would be pissed at how much I paid.
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|I am a true little Wayne fan!!! He does it again. Love the album and can not wait to see him perform some of these songs live.
B003GRWBW4|5.0|Harold and Maude is one of my all-time favorite movies. I love the characters played by Bud Court and Ruth Gordon. And now I have a digital copy :)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book hits home and finds the soft spot in every reader. I read this in a day and a half because I simply needed to find out what happened. This is definitely on my top ten list to read, make that top five. One of the best novelists I've ever read. Ten out of five stars..
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really fun game.  Hints are just enough to keep you going but not too much to ruin the challenge. Enjoyed playing.
B0067EKYS6|4.0|Note: my review is of the regular version of the film as I did not see it in 3D.  I have had to read The Great Gatsby in both high school and college so it was a story that was burned into my subconcious.  Additionally, I had seen the original with Robert Redford and Kathryn Lee Scott (those are the two actors I remember) when it first came out.  This film is far superior to the original as it is a lot more fun.  The director did take a lot of liberties with the film having some modern songs put in but the director did an amazing job where you can feel the energy of Gatsby's parties and the visual effects just seemed to transport the viewer back to the 1920's.<br /><br />This version of the film does follow the book story very closely, in fact, Toby McGuire as Nick narrates a lot of the film, quoting directly from the book.  DeCaprio is excellent as Gatsby however, my only beef with him is that he looks a little bit too young (remembering Redford in the original appearing to be a little bit more mature looking) to have served in the military and then waited the five years building up a fortune and hoping to woo Daisy from her husband.<br /><br />The shots of New York City are stunning, even better than what I remembered from King Kong.  The one thing that the director kept showing and I wasn't sure of were some guys working with shovels in what I am assuming is Queens.  Queens is depicted as just a bunch of junkyards and also serves as the stopoff point where Daisy's husband goes for gas and to meet his mistress.  It is not clear how he gets away with seeing her without her husband knowing though.<br /><br />Nick narrates the story while he seems to be treated in a sanitarium.  Even watching the movie it is not clear why he eventually ends up there.  Don't remember if this was specifically explained in the book.  Nick seems to be the \\"nice\\" guy that everybody likes and he acts as the go-between between everybody especially between his cousing Daisy and Gatsby.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of 3D but I would like to see this film again in 3D just for the excellent visual effects.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|My 3 yr. old son LOVES this movie!!! We recently bought it for our nephew, now it's his favorite too.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I don't know what the critics were saying in their preliminary reviews.  I loved this film from start to finish and am looking forward to the next installment.  As the whole universe changed when Nero attacked Kirk's father's ship in the first film and that Vulcan was wiped out, one cannot expect that these movies should follow anything that the original series and movies did.  And because of the way Spock felt his race die, he will certainly have more \\"human\\" emotional outbursts at times.  It is only \\"logical.\\"<br /><br />When the movie starts, the Enterprise is on one of their first missions and two things go wrong.  Namely Spock needs rescuing and in doing so the Enterprise makes itself visible to a primitive group of people.  This violates the Prime Directive of non-interference in developing cultures (when was this ever a big deal in the original series?  All they did was interfere).  Kirk does not record anything in the ship's log but Spock does, because he can't lie.  (If you remember Taggart in the Beverly Hills Cop movie you will have an idea how this will play out later).<br /><br />Kirk is briefly demoted and told to report back to Starfleet Academy for remedial training (I was wondering if he was going to meet up with Finnegan).  This lasts until a terrorist attack on London wipes out a bunch of senior Starfleet officers.  Kirk is told to get the terrorist (Harrison who goes by another name that us oldtimers know well) who has hidden himself in the Vulcan sector of space by Admiral Marcus.<br /><br />The movie moves at breakneck speed as the Enterprise goes to bring back \\"Harrison,\\" despite the lovers spat that is going on between Spock and Uhura.  Mr. Scott seems to be on the \\"out\\" with Kirk and after an argument, quits the Enterprise and Mr. Chekov has to get Engineering up to speed.<br /><br />The character that steals the movie is McCoy.  The new McCoy goes overboard with spewing cliches that would make DeForest Kelly proud to the point of getting onKirk's nerves.  He is also worried about Kirk's health and will pick the \\"wrong\\" times to examine him.<br /><br />Note possible spoiler - there is a brief mention of having to take care of Mudd's ship, so of course we will see a familiar furry friend make an appearence.<br /><br />I really hope that Abrams will continue with a third installment of this film.  If this film is any indication, then the Star Wars franchise is in good hands!
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Love th soft touch in all his songs.<br />I do miss the swing sound or two from his past cd's that could have been added.
076421120X|5.0|n this beautiful new devotional by singer, songwriter, worship leader, author and speaker, Darlene Zschech, we find a beautiful devotion for each day of the year filled with Scriptures, wisdom, food for thought and prayers.<br /><br />Separating each month, is a lovely page with the words of a well-known hymn or praise song with a thought preparing your mind and soul for the new month of devotions. On the left-hand page, you read, \\"The Gate: Jesus is the Gate by which we are saved.\\" On the right-hand page, is the hymn: To God Be the Glory with an emphasis on the line that says, \\"So love he the world that he gave us his Son, Who yielded his life an atonement for sin, and opened the LIFE GATE that all may go in.\\"  What a beautiful director and reminder this is!!<br /><br />The actual devotional pages include: the date, a directive title, a Scripture reference, words of wisdom/explanation/food for thought, and a closing prayer.  From cover to cover, Revealing Jesus is beautiful.  The colors are rich, the graphics are beautiful and what can beat the Word of God? Along with thoughtful and thought-provoking commentary.<br /><br />Revealing Jesus makes a great addition to your devotionals... it would also be a great any occasion gift (including that graduate you were wondering what in the world to buy them!).  .
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Piano fit nicely on my Galaxy Note2. Keys are easy to differentiate with my large fingers. My 4 year old daughter likes trying to play the songs on it that comes with it and so do I. It is a great app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|OMG!!  This is a great book.  I could not put it down.  It is a good read that I recommend to all.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Good read. Rediscovering science fiction from by youth.  Good job of creating a future world.  Found myself getting immersed in Silo culture.
B005FRF6PC|5.0|Great store about professional tennis & how they prepare for matches, train, & condition. I just loved the book & had a difficult time when I knew I was about to finish.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great book but super excited for the next one. The ending makes you think more. There really shouldn't be a word requirements to write this.
B009IEXKXI|2.0|The first pages of the book are the best part. Marooned on Mars, millions of miles from the next living person, with no method of communication or escape, and everyone thinks he's dead. From the concept, I expected a lonely descent into the inner workings of the narrator's mind: lost loves, memories from long ago, deep regrets, soliloquies of an easy suicide versus the primal instinct of living. All these thoughts set against the harsh, cold, desolate, blood red Martian desert.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that book I'll have to wait to read. This book is very different. Mark, our protagonist, is a lively humorous fellow, who is always quick with a joke. Even after he's abandoned on Mars, he only laments the lack of quality music to listen to. While his attempts to survive and communicate with Earth with MacGyvered tools are interesting, unfortunately after the first few times, it becomes quite boring and predictable. Mark's dry, sarcastic wit only serves to annoy us. A typical joke would go something like this &#34;Harvested 5 pounds of space potatoes today. Woo! Botany major FTW!&#34; So, yea, not so funny. Theres also a dearth of character development. We never get to know Mark. Who does he think about when he sleeps? What does he think about mortality now that his life is in jeopardy? We'll never know.<br /><br />All in all, a cool concept, some interesting macgyvering, but ruined by not taking itself seriously.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Anyone who's purchased a Voyager know's that the short charger cord and &#34;unique&#34; magnetic charger end can be very frustrating.  This case kind of solves that problem.  An ordinary USB charger end is used to charge up the internal case battery and I have gotten several headset charges from one carry case charge.  The headset is expensive, so having this carrying case is a great way to protect your investment.  Don't count on carrying this in the pocket of your jeans however, it's just a little thicker than the average smart phone, so a shirt pocket or purse would be a better place for it.  If you own a Voyager headset, this case is a must.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is great fun and moves very fast. Can lead to other games with holiday  themes.<br />Don't know what else to say that is why I don't do this very often.
B001JI72AI|5.0|great movie was interrupted with download a couple times during the viewing of movie. Movie and quality was good. i would rent again
B001AIY58O|2.0|I liked the architecture of L.A. in the future, and I liked the interplay between Bullock and Stallone.<br /><br />Much more could have been done with the portrayal of society in 2032, so as to appeal to those of us with 3-digit I.Q.s.<br /><br />Otherwise, if senseless violence and gratuitous property destruction is your thing, this is your film.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I can't say it beats season one and two, definitely more drama.  But I was hooked and had to buy it.  I'd borrow it from a friend for the cost.
B004IPPINW|3.0|This is a book recommended for book club.  Had trouble concentrating when reading.  Rather boring most of the time.  I would go see the movie instead which also got so so reviews.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I normally have little patience for corny comedy.  I wish I did; I just don't, in all honesty.  Still... This silly children's film is just too charming and funny to resist.<br /><br />This is the second time I've seen it---with a couple years in between.  I think I appreciate it even better now.  I think it REALLY BROUGHT OUT THE KID IN ME--and, at 61, that's not so easy to do (to my earnest chagrin).  I've just fallen in love with this disarmingly charming kid flick.  I like many kid flicks, I really do. (I enjoyed Nanny McPhee, and many other great kid classics), yet, there's just something so disarmingly delicious about this Danny DiVito gem that I'm simply amazed how many times I laughed---in spite of myself---and my normally much more serious albeit soft-hearted nature<br /><br />MUCH of the credit for the true success of this film must go to the gal who played the evil, kid hating \\"Trunchbull\\"-embodiment: Pam Ferris.  She, Danny, Rhea, Embeth Davidtz (as Miss Honey), and the delightful Mara Wilson as Matilda; each brought just enough credibility to this absurd yarn to engage even an old critic like me.<br /><br />OK, I'm not terribly hard to entertain, but I'm still really picky about what I call a treasure of a movie.  I simply have to admit that this is a keeper.  (Intend to buy some copies for grand-nieces and grand-nephews.)<br /><br />If you are a kid, you prob'ly already love it---and understand why there are so many five star reviews.  If you're an adult, just watch it with kids and you'll find it contagiously funny and sweetly teaching.  If you're an older person, or even a younger adult with no kids about---just let it take you back to childhood's vulnerability/accessibility/powerlessness; then watch how young you can become---in spite of your normal adult preferences!!<br /><br />Maybe it was just good timing for me; still, I hope it's similarly good timing for you; and, that you invite the kid to come up in you again.  ---Sweet nonsense, indeed!
B008YW5RH2|4.0|this is a really fun game, but ive rated it 4 stars because the Cpu controls some if the people, and those people can do things that u cant. so its really fun, but it gets extrememly challenging later on in the game. hope u enjoy!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I was very impressed with the complexity of the puzzles. Enough to challenge, but not so horrible that you pull your hair out trying to figure out what is next. Can't wait for the next installment, but would prefer if it was a little bit longer
B006LSZECO|4.0|Lost some gas to the close, but overall some great character studies in gender relations. A great summer book for the beach.
0525478817|4.0|I waited a long time to read this book because it's about kids with cancer, and because I spend a lot of hours in the hospital as part of my job, I typically turn to fiction for an escape. But this book got so many awards, so many stellar reviews, so many accolades, I finally broke down and bought it. And to sum up, I liked it, but didn't love it.<br /><br />The first third of the book was hard for me to get into. I found Augustus grating in a way I can't quite describe, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the ridiculously advanced, metaphorical way he speaks (the way all the kids in this book speak, really). I know John Green has said it's something like a grievous sin to talk down to kids in YA literature, and I completely agree with this, but I had to reread quite a few passages to get the gist of what these people were actually talking about. These were not realistic characters, and if Green was going for a lofty series of metaphors rather than real-life experience, than he succeeded. I just found myself constantly yearning for a normal teen. Smart, sure - I love smart, nerdy, overly linguistic teens - but I wish the dialogue and literary ruminations hadn't been so over-the-top.<br /><br />As the story went on, though, it got better. I very much enjoyed the ending, though of course it was sad (this is a cancer book - it's going to be sad). I liked the brutal honesty with which the author and his characters approached such a merciless disease. It made me think about my own mortality; it made me question my own place in this world.  I really felt for Hazel and Gus, but their families' stories were in some ways just as compelling.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for its emotional resonance, but perhaps not for the realistic depiction of teenagers. That said, the way with which John Green navigates humor and tragedy in the context of such heavy subject matter deeply impressed me.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|Everybody has said plenty about the songs. I just want to say that I really enjoy this album's different types of songs, ballads, pop songs and even disco. Her voice is excellent and I really like the way she chose her song writers as a duo instead of a bunch of different ones. If you're an Abba fan, I recommend this album. If you're not, I recommend this album. This is a good record and you can tell Agnetha put a lot into it. :)
B009X011UQ|5.0|Protects my kindle and makes a great stand for it. I would recommend it to anyone who are looking for these features.
B008EKON56|5.0|I use this for my car audio system. Easier than plugging in two cables, and I was able to repurpose one of my multiple extra android micro USB phone charger cables connected to a 5ma charger.  Supposedly this eliminates the issue of the hum you hear from the line out headphone jack, but I can't attest to that because I never had that problem.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. Every time I finish all the levels I reset the game. If you like games with thinking, get this game. This is totally great for kids and its season.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When this show was in production and airing for the first time I missed it, in fact, I didn't even know about it.  After it ran for its one and only season, years later as a sci-fi buff myself, I would hear some grumblings here and there about what a great show Firefly was and what a shame it was that it was only made for one season.  I was intrigued.<br /><br />Fortunately for me, the Science Channel started running the old episodes a while back and I caught a few of them, and instantly this bacame one of my favorites.  The show is absolutely brilliant, and unique.  The characters are very likeable (my favorites are Jayne, Book, and Kaylee), the acting is solid, and the plots are well thought-out.  They could have done so much more, but it wasn't to be.  So unfortunate because there was so much room for story and character development.  After only catching a few of the episodes on the Science Channel, I was excited to get this DVD set as a Christmas gift from my wife, so I could watch the episodes I had not yet seen, and also, watch all my favorite episodes over and over again.<br /><br />This set is a highly recommended buy whether you are a fan, or someone new to the series who likes sci-fi, or just anything unique and interesting.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved this game, it gives me a challenge, I get very bored with other stuff this is so much fun. I have the power to create, and it lets me think, and use my brain better. Please do me a favor, and make a new update I love this game, and I want to keep playing
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I loved it!  played great, my favorite set I own.  touches on a lot of different emotions.  I got a few more people hooked on the series after they saw it.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I play lots of fps games on my kindle like nova 3 and modern combat 4, but once I played this game I loved it! This game has four different classes to choose from and they all have different equipment. The online mode is the best thing about this game it has two different game modes. Lastly, this game takes up 1.30 gb of space. Thank You gameloft for finally making this game on kindle and I am hoping for more soon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a very good book. I was intrigued as soon as I first started reading. Not only does the story grasp the readers attention, but it tugs on the heartstrings. This book by far was on  of the best I have ever read. I would definitely recommend it.
B008B68IUY|5.0|I bought this for a birthday present and she loved it/ it is made out of plastic but seems pretty durable
B00080Z53O|5.0|Paralysed from the neck down for over 25 years, Ramon is trapped in a tragic prison - his own body. If he were able to move his arm, he could shoot himself and deliver himself from irrelievable, profound and intolerable existential suffering. As Ramon himself eloquently stated, \\"In my dreams, the one commonality is that I can walk.\\"<br /><br />But because of ass-backwards laws in Spain, all he can do is starve himself or find people to help him, illegally. An ignorant but well-intentioned woman visits Ramon near the film's outset. She is baffled at how a man who smiles so readily could want to die. He explains that his smiles are simply a curtain over his grief, pain and tears. He soon asks the arrogant and presumptuous woman to leave. This is nothing compared to the arrogance of a quadriplegic priest, who not only has his faith to sustain him, but billions in church resources to draw upon if he should ever need to. His non-sequitor argument, that \\"freedom without life isn't freedom\\", ignores millennia of bloodshed and sacrifice in the name of freedom and liberty for all. I found his behaviour repugnant, especially when he countered Ramon's appeal to public support by Godwinning himself and equating that support to that provided to the Nazis by the German people.<br /><br />While the majority of this powerful true story concerns Ramon's fight to legalise and obtain assistance to die, other characters are crucial and unforgettable, including his family and a woman who intends to end her life before her incurable, lifelong illness becomes unbearable to her. They round out the film and create a profound and realistic three-dimensional experience.<br /><br />Legislative change will come, and it will come soon, as baby boomers age. A placard raised at a protest in Ramon's honour read \\"Life is a right, not an obligation.\\" Nothing could be more true. A life that is compulsory, not to mention miserable, is torture. And paternalistic torture at the hands of the state is oneof the most profoundly abhorrent kinds of torture possible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is good for really any age. I love this game! This is a good way to past time! If I were you I would buy this game!!!!
B003MC5N28|5.0|My grandson read this book for school and could not put it down.  I also read it..fantastic book.  I give it five stars. He cannot wait to start reading the rest of the quartet.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|loved this book. such well described characters and surprising interconnections among them. Each section and time period was so vividly portrayed.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|pretty good and lots of laughts.could use more suv.s or even more karts.better cars how about a jetski version of this game?

B00BXKKNFS|1.0|It did not block ANY adds, even with the Angry Bird apps and that is what we specifically bought it for and that is also what was specifically mentioned in their advertisement.  I would NOT advise anyone to waste money on ABP!  In fact, on two of our apps, the ads seemed to get bigger (covering up the games) and more of them!
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I wish there were other prequals that is this good. Where and how some of the mutants came from. Quite intriguing for the mutant fan.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|After finishing BORN TO RUN I found this gem of a book. I highly recommend it for anyone delving deeper into the mind and heart of an ultra marathoner. Plus it has some great recipes!
B009PAETCG|3.0|Flick Football Soccer Sports HD is a good entertaiment game for my kids. It's a nice to spend time. It's okay.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My daughter is in middle school and they assigned this book as required summer reading for the whole school. I think it is a great idea, middle school was never my favorite so hopefully books like this can bring empathy to the table. I really enjoyed it.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I've learn a lot from this book. I am very anxious to read on!  Do you do motivational speaking in tx?
0553565915|5.0|I read it years ago and decided to share her experience with friends. It was very enlightening and gave a different perspective.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|This, item worked well and looked great. No rough edges, Ethernet cable plugged in easly with out any looseness. The USB fit into the notebook as it should.<br />Over all this device worked as it was suppose to without problems so far.
1439102813|5.0|Even though this book was fiction, it was very well written by a neurologist who has experience with dementia.  I could totally relate as a caregiver to the main character in the book, &#34;Alice&#34;.  All of the symptoms and problems that she experienced have been happening to my husband who has vascular dementia and alzheimers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this game yesterday and I haven't put it down since! I strong recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a pleasant challenge.
B00992CF6W|5.0|U should get this game but if u think it is too expensive then get survival craft ................. get this now works with Kindle Fire
0517591812|3.0|If Rutherfurd had simply just told the history of London (like Besant or Akroyd) I would love loved the book in 1/2 the time.  I'm not a fan of his story telling; it may be accurate (like Henry VIII coming on to his courtesans), but it feels largely speculative and simple.
B0073COMUW|5.0|I love having bright white bulbs. I hate the traditional yellowish color. The best part is that these are LED bulbs and are BRIGHT. Half the price of what you can get at Home Depot and better quality, in my opinion.
B00699SDR8|3.0|If you want the philosophy, read Glenn Sunshine (faith based) or Richard Tarnas (Intellectual History).<br /><br />The story itself is a little lame and more than slightly unbelievable - like Heidi meets climbs in a wardrobe.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|So glad this show is now available on DVD.  My only wish is that there were more special features on it, but perhaps maybe they will add more to the season 2 DVD.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|Amazon recommended Halestorm's Debut album to me around 2009 and I was blown away by it. They provide a great mixture of hard rocking sounds and great ballads. Lzzy has the iconic female rock voice that has been missing for a long time and easily helps them stand out in the crowd. Her brother Arejay is a very talented drummer and will blow you away at live shows with his skillset.<br /><br />I've had the pleasure of listening to \\"The Strange Case Of....\\" quite a few times now to really get a feel for the album(thanks to my long commute everyday haha!).<br /><br />Love Bites (So Do I) - I like this song. It starts off like a punch in the face with it's heavy guitar driven riff. The drums add a great rhythm that you can easily find you moving your foot, head, hands, whatever to. The lead is subtle in the background, but helps to accent the vocals(which go from heavy to melodic) when needed. Overall, I think it's a great way to open the CD.<br /><br />Mz. Hyde - This song has sort of a pop like feel in the beginning with a rock chorus. Another Catchy tune that can have you moving your head to the rhythm.<br /><br />I Miss The Misery - Has a nice steady build up leading into the chorus. I like this song and think it has a nice mixture between vocal and instrument build up.<br /><br />Freak Like Me - Punchy chorus that I'm sure will bring in a lot of crowd participation at shows. Verses are steady leading up to the chorus and the vocals are of course powerful.<br /><br />Beautiful With You - This is where everything starts to slow down. This has a nice slow feel, it sounds like a mix of female influences in this song. A good ballad type song for the album.<br /><br />In your Room - Keeping with the slowing down of the album comes this song. Very basic melody on this song, so you can see they wanted the words to be the showcase. Has a nice quiet chorus and a build up for a more rockin' chorus line. Overall I think this is a great song(and I'm not a huge fan of the slow stuff)<br /><br />Break In - Piano accompaniment on this track leads the way for a slow, melodic vocal line. Lzzy's voice has a very mellow, angelic tone in this track. It shows a lot of range and takes the album to a different point.<br /><br />Rock Show - Now we are starting to bring the tempo back up again. Still has a ballad type feel to it, but a little punch as the song goes on. Overall, it's a decent song and I find myself getting into it as it plays on.<br /><br />Daughters of Darkness - This starts with sort of a \\"clap your hands and chant\\" type of feel(I could see them doing that live). When the instruments kick in the rhythm stays a steady beat and goes heavier into the chorus line. Guitars follow the beat well on this song and it's pretty catchy.<br /><br />You Call Me A Bitch Like It's A Bad Thing - I like this song. It has a nice groove to it throughout the song. Vocal work is of course nice and strong from Lzzy. The lead fills on the guitar help add to the feel of the song and boost the overall fullness of the song.<br /><br />American Boys - This song starts has a hard rock/classic rock song feel to it. I think this one should make it as a sing. The chorus is very kick ass and it's really easy to get into the feel of this song. This would be what I would consider and \\"anthem\\" style song.<br /><br />Here's To Us - The chorus makes this song for me. I am a fan of the theme to this song and find myself singing a long to it in the car whenever this track plays. A good way to end the album in my opinion since it's not quite slow and not quite heavy, right in the middle.<br /><br />Overall, I love the new album and think it has that Halestorm sound that I have grown to love. Like I said, there are not many female rockers out there these days and Lzzy does a great job of being that next generation Lita Ford, Joan Jett, ETC.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I play this game more than my five year old daughter. She's not reading yet, so it is difficult for her to complete the quests. For older kids or adults, who are still into Nemo, this is a great game.
B005NFJAZS|4.0|I haven't had time to watch the DVD yet. I have seen it on VHS. When I received it I noticed that the label on the DVD was a bit fuzzy/out of focus. Then on the back of the box there was a rubber stamp message &#34;DVD made in Mexico&#34;. I don't yet know the quality of the DVD.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Beginning with a highly allegorical bad-ass tale of a child-stealing div, Hosseini weaves several tales of hurt, death, love, and reunion that spans more than 50 years.<br /><br />Centered around Pari a young Afghan woman, Hosseini employs a unique technique: by clustering biographical accounts of the people around our main character, we simultaneously are drawn into her tale, while being blessed with the story of many different individuals.<br /><br />Free of melodramatic coincidence, its hard not to be sucked right into this book as if one is reading real happenings, I'm a pretty skeptical reader, and I found myself wondering how much truth inspired these stories.<br /><br />Unfortunately while the first 3/4 of the book are brilliant and feel like they are leading towards a satisfying conclusion, the latter quarter begins to drag and required some determination to finish the piece. Ultimately worth it but with a slightly under-nourishing conclusion.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is fantastic. Great insight into the mission that killed Bin Laden. Highly recommend this book to anyone who has shown interest in what really happened that night.<br />Well written, easy to follow and best of all to the point.
0812983459|4.0|I purchased \\"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\\" after reading a good review in Oprah magazine. With so many books out there, sometimes its hard to choose and ultimately find a really good read.  This book did not disappoint.<br /><br />The book is beautifully-written, flows well, and opens the heart.  You feel compassion for Harold, for Maureen, for Queenie and most of the characters along the way in Harold's walking journey.  Certainly, we could all use a good walk every once in while to clear our minds of the clutter of thoughts and our hearts of regrets and guilt and open them for what beauty and happiness there is life, no matter how difficult.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was very well written and has potential to inspire and encourage people to follow their own passion and creativity,regardless of the world's reception of their ideas.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This young adult fiction was also fun for me to read as an adult.  It was recommended to me by a friend who read it after her children had finished it.  Told from two different points of view, the story moves at a good pace.  I gave it five stars simply because I picked it up and finished it in two days without the big sigh halfway through that says, &#34;Please get on with the story will you?&#34;  I also like that it wasn't gratuitous, nor was it heavy, in how it handled the concept of death. If I had any criticism at all, it would be twofold.  First, sometimes it was easy to lose sight of who the speaker was and I had to scroll back to the beginning of the chapter on my ebook to double-check.  Second, the twelve year old girl sometimes reacted to her 'love interest' in a way that seemed more appropriate for a fourteen or fifteen year old.  Then again, it's been a while since I've spent time with twelve year old girls so maybe I'm the one that's out of touch.  At any rate, neither of those two points spoiled my reading experience and I would recommend it to others who like young adult fiction and metaphysical themes.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Pretty fun game!  Keeps my daughter occupied so it does what it should.  She will get hours of enjoyment from it.

0740797719|5.0|I found this book to be easy to read and understand, and he makes a lot of good points about both color and light that should be useful for any artist (he even has tips directed towards those working in digital media, which is quite different from pigment based techniques).  Looking forward to having it in my studio.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|I chose this book based on a friend's recommendation about how it was such a great read, when I picked up this book I could not put it down.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|When I hear people complained about the Album I am left to wondered if these individuals have the slightest clue as to what drives inspiration or creativity.<br />From an artist point of view; creativity is instantaneous and a matter of immediacy, you don't think about it, it just happens and you can't control it.<br /><br />So Daft Punk should have solicited all of our opinion and cut tracks from all their old stuff and re-record, another \\"One More Time?\\"<br /><br />I understand fans can have expectations but that same expectation simply restrict growth, creativity and experimentation. But most of all expectations is an artist worst enemy.<br />Because I can never express myself, I most always do what is expected, so what if Daft Punk wanted to sing to nothing, will that be okay? As to what point can an artist express his/her inner feelings?<br /><br />Sometimes music is more then rhythmic vibrations and becomes a matter and domain for expression about the artist inner thoughts and demons, it is not necessarily about music. I love Daft Punk because they are a symbol of Abstraction, not deterministic. I listen to Instant Crush and it immediately affected my mood, I did not know if I should be happy or sad, dance or think, laugh or frown. This is the kind of impact great artist or music can have. You don't have to bang your head to extremely loud volumes to get the message.<br /><br />Again, look at Daft Punk as a complex abstract painting, with too many ways to interpret.<br /><br />Play the album, close your eye and what do you  see, what do you think of?<br /><br />Is a moment in your life affected?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have been waiting for this app. I had it on the iphone and ipad and its awesome! and I haven't even started it yet I saw it and started the download and now I'm weighting a review

B001HNE3NO|4.0|A sad story of life and loss and secrets. I really identified with Julia as she searches for answers about someone else, while simultaneously trying to find answers about herself. A glimpse at what it's like to carry secrets and the repercussions that come with their revelations.

0937381888|5.0|I bought this book to help learn the ins and outs of brewing and I was not disappointed! Palmer breaks apart every step of the process thoroughly, but still keeps the material easy to comprehend. This book definitively belongs in every home-brewers library.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Wow! I cannot describe how amazing this book was. Everything was just so shocking and full of detail...it was just magnificent! Cassandra Clare hasn't disappointed me at all with her books and i doubt that she will. If you're someone that read the first book, continue reading the series! You'll be very pleased. :)
B00C061I3K|5.0|In all honesty, I didn't expect Daft Punk to ever again record another album I'd love as much as I love 2007's Discovery, but here it is - 12 years later. \\"Random Access Memories\\" is as complex, ambitious and accomplished an album as any fan of this immensely talented French duo could possibly hope for. There's so much going on that it'll take repeated listens to dissect, absorb and fully appreciate the sheer brilliance of \\"R.A.M.\\" I like each and every track, and the song sequence is just perfect, each song flowing seamlessly into the next one. This is your chance to listen to two masters at work, and I'll go as far as to say that this is a work of art. To my ears, it's their second masterpiece.<br /><br />Volt-and-Volume.com

B00C7O8TSM|4.0|2012 was truly a special year for Beach Boys fans: first there was the unexpectedly strong reunion album \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\", arguably the band's best album in the last 35 years, and then there was of course the 50th anniversary reunion tour, with everybody in tow (Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks and Bruce Johnston). Then, inexplicably, the band's label issued a hastily compiled and rush-released DVD from that tour, containing a grand total of 21 (!) songs, when in fact the band played anywhere from 40 to 50 songs each evening, spread over 2 sets. Not surprisingly, the DVD was panned and dismissed by many BB fans as yet another quick money-grab by the band's label. Now 6 months after the DVD release comes this CD release from the same reunion tour.<br /><br />\\"Live: The 50th Anniversary Tour\\" (2 CDs; 41 tracks; 125 min.) is everything what the DVD should've been: a nice overview of last year's tour, with a generous amount of songs that somewhat resembles what happened night after night on the tour. The song selection focuses not just on the hits (all of which are on here) but digs much deeper, including golden nuggets like \\"All This Is That\\", \\"Marcella\\", \\"Disney Girls\\" and \\"Getcha Back\\", just to name those. The recording sounds remarkably clean and crisp for a live album, with the vocals upfront and sounding harmonious. Just a delight.<br /><br />I saw the band on last year's reunion tour when they played at Riverbend here in Cincinnati, and it was one of the most amazing shows of the year for me (they played 47 songs that night). Playing with confidence and even a swagger that belies these guys' ages, it truly was a concert for the ages. While I have seen Brian Wilson perform solo (with his band), I had never expected to see him playing again with the rest of the remaining Beach Boys. This 2CD collection is a pretty nice memento from that evening, much better so than that skimpy DVD from last year. If you saw the Beach Boys on last year's reunion tour (or even if you didn't), you cannot go wrong with this \\"Live: The 50th Anniversary Tour\\" CD collection.'s reunion tour (or even if you didn't), you cannot go wrong with this \\"Live: The 50th Anniversary Tour\\" CD collection.

B00005R24G|5.0|In 1972 SLEUTH treated its audience to a brilliant (and deadly) cat-and-mouse game between Sir Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. SLEUTH will keep you guessing so keep your eyes peeled (not that it'll do you any good). Anthony Shaffer adapts his original hit Broadway play into a screenplay that is so twisty even pretzels want no part of it. Here's an interesting tidbit: Albert Finney was originally tapped to play the Michael Caine role but he was either unable to commit or was later viewed as unsuitable for the part (whispers abound that he was too overweight). Obviously, the narrative would've rolled out an entirely different sub-text, absent Caine's marvelously distinctive Cockney stylings.<br /><br />The plot's basic bones: Snobbish mystery writer Andrew Wyke (Olivier) invites his wife's hairdresser and lover Milo Tindle (Caine) to his sprawling country estate and stages an elaborate ruse. Andrew Wyke, it's quickly revealed, revels in playing mean-spirited pranks and games. And there's something about being cuckolded that makes one step his game up to savage heights. Poor Milo Tindle, victim of a cruel joke. What's a street-savvy hairdresser to do?<br /><br />In a neat bit of sleight-of-hand, the film's opening credits, with its irrelevant roll call of actors, disguise the fact that this movie is essentially a two-man show, broken up only by the presence of veteran actor Alec Cawthorne who has a nice extended bit as \\"Inspector Doppler,\\" a pleasant old policeman. A wry smile may have crossed director Joseph Mankiewicz's face when actress Eve Channing's name surfaces on the credits. She plays the role of \\"Marguerite Wyke,\\" the mystery writer's unfaithful wife. Coincidentally, \\"Eve Channing\\" is an amalgamation of the names of two characters in one of his earlier films, ALL ABOUT EVE. SLEUTH is peppered with neat inside jokes like that.<br /><br />It's such a compelling character study. Both Olivier and Caine are superb in their tricky, very demanding roles, so good that they were both nominated for an Academy Award (only to lose out to Brando who failed to suck in THE GODFATHER). The film was also nominated for Best Director, Best Music, and Original Dramatic Score. How often is it that the entire cast gets nominated for an award? It's mesmerizing, watching Olivier and Caine engage in sadistic gamesmanship, and at first I wasn't sure who to root for. But you sense something in the wind when the crafty writer convinces the hairdresser to stage a robbery of the writer's family jewels. One could then collect on the insurance money; the other would have the massive funds required to provide for an expensive woman.<br /><br />I have to mention the stately Tudor country manor. It is the film's centerpiece as the story confines itself to within that space. Olivier's expansive parlor generates a creepy personality of its own. It is a dizzying sight, that room, opulent yet crammed with all sorts of weird toys and knick-knacks. The room goes a ways in establishing a disquieting atmosphere.<br /><br />But the central fascination lies with the sublime performances of the two leads. Olivier presents the demeanor of a British lord of the old guard, brimming with haughtiness and entitlement and exuding just a touch of menace and a slight dose of dementia. Michael Caine turns out to be Olivier's perfect foil, but we don't conclude that until very deep into the film. In 1972, Caine was very much the upstart newcomer. Rumor has it that he was very nervous at sharing the camera with the great Olivier, although Olivier, gentleman that he was, very quickly put him at his ease. Caine plays up to his strengths; he plays up his working man sensibilities, and while he initially seems to float in the Great Man's shadow, by the end of the film, he's very much Olivier's ferocious equal. I could watch and listen all day as Olivier playfully messed around with different accents and cadences. Caine's ability to elicit empathy is never more evinced that inthe sequence in which he's dressed in a clumsy clown outfit, dutifully carrying out the break-in and theft, even as Olivier scornfully egged him on. You feel quite sorry for Caine's character. SLEUTH grabs you with its its wicked sense of irony and its wonderful theatricality and flair for dialogue. When Olivier, voice dripping with contempt, taunts Caine, \\"You're just a jumped-up pantry boy who doesn't know his place,\\" well, I grinned with delight (even as I felt bad for Caine). I appreciate words, and a series of them strung together with such elegance and bite can't fail to make me smile. SLEUTH is full of such clever, telling words.the sequence in which he's dressed in a clumsy clown outfit, dutifully carrying out the break-in and theft, even as Olivier scornfully egged him on.

B003L1ZWG2|4.0|Let me qualify this review: I believe that it is necessary for the viewer to have actually been snow skiing or snowboarding in order to fully appreciate the events that unfold in this film. I say this because I recommended this film to a friend who had never skied found the film boring and too \\"talky\\".<br /><br />Yes, the pace of this movie is slow compared to the typical action thrillers that are cranked out with little thought to reality. But if you are looking for a fairly intelligent, well scripted, believable film that will have you second guessing the characters but wondering what you would do if you were in their shoes, then this is a helluva ride!<br /><br />Three college students hit the slopes finagling their way around the lift ticket process. A series of unbelievable but probable situations leads to them being stranded on the ski lift at closing on a Sunday night. No problem right? They'll be found soon enough or at least by the next morning when the resort opens back up....right? Ahhh, but we're informed the resort is only operating on Fridays through Sundays.<br /><br />What happens next is a slow process of agonizing drama and fear. I won't reveal much more, because it would really give the movie away.<br /><br />This is film not unlike Cube (which freaked me out) or Deep Water (which wasn't as freaky as Cube - but similar premise).<br /><br />In short, there are no good solutions for our characters - but the situations they face are ones we - in their shoes - must question and ask if we would be able to do any differently.<br /><br />The dialogue is well written and the acting is fine. The production itself is top notch and I have to say the ending is fittingly unnerving.<br /><br />This is not a film with a happy resolve.<br /><br />I liked it so much I bought it (though not through Amazon as in this instance they were a bit more expensive).<br /><br />I don't bother with DVD extras, so I won't review those.<br /><br />This is a fine film but may not be for everyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you use to like to play the Myst  computer games back in the day you'll love this one. The graphics are awesome and the game play was very smooth on my Kindle.  I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Not a fan of the band but really enjoyed the book for Manson' s brutal truthfulness and unwillingness to be something he is not and for standing up for what he believes in even if it goes against the \\"supposed\\" norms in today's society that is being force fed by the media and the government about how we \\"should\\" be and how we \\"should\\" act. Too many people these days are either more willing or are scared into thinking that they need to  conform and be like everyone else and because of this we are quickly loosing our INDIVIDUALITY.
B008N1V11U|4.0|I thought the boss should have been header .<br />But still it is awesome batman is one of the<br />best games I've played.<br />Buy the game it's worth it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm only on the third box of this game and it's awesome!  It must be for me to review it before finishing, but even if I get totally stuck at this point, it was worth what I paid for it.<br /><br />I'm not sure why it's called The Room, I think it should be called &#34;The Boxes&#34; or something like that.  You are in a room with a box, but not an ordinary box.  It's a wooden contraption with keyholes, drawers, secret places, puzzles...  You have to work your way through all that, figuring out how to open a drawer to get a key, then how to use it, to find the secret places...  It's just awesome.  When you're finished one box, you are sent to another box, more complicated, with more things to figure out.<br /><br />There is a storyline that I haven't been paying too much attention to.  It doesn't make much sense to me.  Some guy trying to find something to do with &#34;null&#34;.  No idea.  Hope I don't need to know later.  The game is fun without understanding it anyway.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game.  Awesome.

B0000A33QW|1.0|I was really disappointed because I was looking forward to watching this movie after a very hard day at work.  I put it in my player and it wouldn't even recognize that there was a movie there.<br />I will be returning this movie.  The first one that I have returned in all my purchases.
141690977X|5.0|I figured out the book's premise on my own the hard way. After having my heart broken time after time by guys just not that into me, I finally got pissed off and promised myself I would only date men who would be proud to introduce me to their families, make plans more than three days in advance and talk to me as many times a day as they could. I'm a big communicator. Why not find someone who ALSO liked to communicate instead of reverse engineering a recluse?<br /><br />The man I married in 2001 was not at all like the men I'd previously dated, and I'm not sure I would've sought him out had I not been so thoroughly disgusted with myself for putting up with bad treatment from other men. I don't know what was wrong with my self-esteem before, but I am so glad my dating habits set me up to demand better treatment and let me see how much a deal-breaker lack of respect is for me in a relationship. Knowing it was a deal-breaker for me made me a nicer person to him, and that's why we're still married, I'm sure. It's tough living with other people, and respect is so important.<br /><br />I totally agree with author Greg, though I understand and feel for author Liz, who's really not sure such wonderful men exist. They do. I found one ... but not until I got sick and tired of being jerked around by guys who couldn't be bothered to really engage in a way I found meaningful. Maybe not every rule in here is true -- these are opinions, after all -- but the overall message of not wasting time dating people who aren't really into you is valid. -- Rita Arens, author of contemporary young adult novel THE OBVIOUS GAME ([...])
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|The magnet connection works great with all of our other magnetic trains. Fits on all of our wooden tracks. Kids love it.
B00C7JFIRC|4.0|Loved the movie, one of those I would buy the Blue Ray as soon as it come out.  But I WILL NOT PAY $31 BUCKS FOR IT! It is WAY to expensive for a new release, totally ridiculous. 3D and 2D releases separate too, unlike the others releasing 2d 3d and digital download together at a less price then one version. Recommendation? Do not buy...force Disney and other money grabbers that we have a choice.  This reminds me of the early days, when they released movies, charged $79 for them , tried to make your rent them. Then they lost their shirts. So here we go again...<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Well now it's almost half of what it was when issued. As people know, the review should be the WHOLE product. Example? Review of movie of course. But not just that! How is the transfer? How is the sound? Amount of special features, packaging (of disc), on and on.<br /><br />When originally released, Disney was way out of line with its price and packaging. Now, the price is down to $19.99. Still, I prefer the \\"Blue Ray-DVD-Download\\" packages. I did see the movie, and liked it. (Mila Kunis on the screen is stunning).  I did like the story, and special affects, and such. The kids seem to like it as well, but not overly so. I did buy this (at the current price) and this is a good movie. Michelle Williams is excellent. Always did like Zack Braf (Scrubs) as well.<br /><br />So now I can safely say a good movie and worth seeing. A GREAT movie? No, but you will not be dissatisfied with it (my opinion). 3 1/2 star rounded up.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I bought this movie because a friend said it was good.  I'm not one that follows the bandwagon for the latest &#34;in&#34; thing, but I am so glad I did.  This movie introduced me to Skylar Astin and his amazing voice!  It also has Anna Kendrick in it, who I love as well.  It's just an all around great movie.  I definitely recommend it to everyone.
B00A7OJ0DC|3.0|my discs were scratched because of the stacked discs. it is disappointing that disney released it this way to save money, especially since they still are charging the premium price. as for the movie itself, 5 stars and it is one of my favorites among recent disney movies, along with tangled.
B005JR47R6|5.0|I only bought one episode of House because Skylar Astin guest starred in it.  I didn't understand a lot of what was going on, but nonetheless it was a good episode.
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|Just not what I was hoping the movie would be like.<br />much too much gore and language and some sex scenes.<br />I did hope for better movie than that.<br />I wish I could sell this copy I hate it.
0345525558|5.0|The language of flowers inspired me - as a foster and adoptive mom - I really related to the characters and all their challenges navigating through life. The language of flowers as a means of communication is a new idea and I want to speak it!  Wonderful story.
B005F96URI|2.0|Mildly amusing in a couple of spots, but predictable and boring in many others.  The narrator got to be really annoying.  No detectable sense of humor at all, and for a comic book movie, that's not a good sign.  Set designs were interesting, but effects were mostly unnecessary, or would be if it had halfway decent writing.  I suspect it was written by the effects team as a demo reel.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|The Expendables 2 was jammed packed with explosions, exciting stars and great action [from start to finish].  I would highly recommend it to any fan of action movies.
B00CS65JS2|2.0|Although highly anticipated, with the exception of a couple of tracks, this album is pretty forgettable. The highlight is obviously 'Get Lucky'. The majority of the remainder could be used as sleep therapy.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was epic.<br />Because it was Valentine's  day and he got candy. It was so so so epic and awesome
B006JPS1OM|3.0|It kicks me off when I try to start chapter 9! So disappointing! I hope this bug gets fixed so I can continue!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Love this game. Nice HO scenes and interesting puzzles. Excellent graphics. I enjoy adventure games like this.  I can't comment on music or sounds as I prefer to keep volume off.  Would recommend.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|It is fast and cool.<br />Read about how to install it.  Intel CPU's do not &#34;Plug In&#34; anymore.  They are placed very carefully on top of a hundred or so very small and delicate gold contacts that are easily bent and could ruin the CPU, Motherboard or both..
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is popular for a reason: it is fun no matter your skill-level, the amount of time you've played it or the type of mood you may be in when you start to play.  This game is amazing, as are every spin-off since.  If you somehow have managed to never play this title, download it (at least the FREE version) and see what the hype is all about... you will enjoy this game.

Theta Healing is a very powerful yet gentle form of healing. Thus it makes sense to start healing using this modality instead of as a last resort, which is exactly what a large majority of people have done that have come to me. I sense that I am plugging into a web of concsciouness with infinite possibilities.  Thank you Vianna for sharing your wisdom and compassion in this most wonderful way.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I started Got at HBO but the tv series was going a bit too slow for me, therefore I tried the books, this book has been great, lots of story plots, great surprises, battles and everything, don't want to get into details because a spoiler might end up here, anyway just try the books they are awesome!
B00B4804KS|5.0|I'm having a great time enjoying one of my favorite classics in a crisply remastered format.  The 3-D is surprisingly good, considering that the film wasn't originally shot in 3-D.  I'll treasure this for a long, long time!

Now. Don't delay. Get on it! Immediatly!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love a romance from a guy's POV.  This book is described as a non romance but I don't know why. Drew, once he brightens up, is a definite romantic. The story is witty, fun, highly entertaining and I just love Kate. Her relationship drama ended pretty quickly and anti dramatically but it wasn't very important so that's ok. Billy was a jerk anyway, and we don't know what happened because we don't ever get Kate's POV.  Definitely read this book.  Drew is the best :)
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|There's almost nothing to say because it works just like it should. You plug it into a working USB3.0 port and get a proper 1Gbe connection where the USB2.0 versions can't get you 1/2 the bandwidth under perfect circumstances. The price was about as good as I could hope for too.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|One of the best thermal compounds you can get. I used Arctic Silver because it was recommended by so many people who build computers for a living and they are right.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it because you can build whatever wherever however you want it so fun It is the best game ever
B0058YPILY|3.0|What is with the bleeched teeth. What is wrong with the natural color of teeth? All the actors have teeth so white they look cartoonish. When they show a drug addict, homeless person or prostitute they all have bleeched white teeth. As a matter of fact the show loses it's serious nature when every single actor looks like a clown every time you see their teeth. I am all for clean bright teeth but not when they look cartoonish and are the color of a bright toilet bowl. Also, they need to ease up a bit on the makeup. I own seasons 1 to 7. Many episodes are fantastic. Some episodes are unrealistic. I think i may throw in the towel and look elsewhere for future crime drama. I am almost finished with LAW AND ORDER SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT SEASON 3 That series is great.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Adam Levine and Maroon 5 never disappoint.  He could sing the phone book and I'd be a fan! :) Pleased with the CD.

B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Great game and campaign. This game is worth it is a must have but I know it does take a lot of memory. But it is like fat but better, you can now turn your enemy's into zombies and now all kinds of shops. So why are still reading this, buy it
B001O1O71C|2.0|Although the book was written for children, I feel it wasn't realistic.  There were many critical moments in the story where one was left to wonder what really happened.  As adults, we can imagine the unimaginable, but the children reading this book wouldn't.  This takes away from history and the reader remains naive just like the main characters.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I absolutely love this game...it is fun & very addicting with the various types of sharks that you get to use in this game.
B001DAJZI4|5.0|The story is campy but the composition of each song into an opera is exceptional. Pete Townshend may not be a brilliant lead guitarist but his writing and chord progressions are more intricate than we expect from a three chord pop musician. All songs meld together well even though the story may not. Tommy is a great study in album composition and production. A must have for someone who takes classic rock seriously.
B007ZTN07O|4.0|First, make sure your device is supported... if it is, go get it...<br />Unfortunately Google said my device wasn't compatible so I couldn't snag the two dollar sale there... but anyway, it runs good and the interface gives you a decent bit to work with.<br /><br />I don't even know if this thing is online... but I had to register, weird in my opinion.<br /><br />The arcade feel is there though, back bars on both sides that can't be adjusted, poor management of screen real estate seeing that the devices they support is mid high tier. Characters are pixelated when close and somewhat blurry. I wish there were some filtering to fix it, because I've seen what bilinear filtering can do on apps like mame.<br /><br />The gameplay is nice and the characters have their little meeting before battle, after you played it a while you might want to turn it off, YOU CAN! the system has a mitigate where you constantly have mini missions that help you fight.  While it is nice, it makes you think the game might be curved towards stopping some in the fray to stop drop and roll for some gauge boosts. Or bunny hopping for the former. At harder difficulties I'm sure it will seem annoying.<br /><br />Color selection is abysmal and the three or four extra costumes they have to buy with in game credits are expensive and don't seem worth it if you're going to try to collect all of the cards. They took colors Anne even cut or added a few pixels to make it different physically rather than just color on some. I wish they carried it further and added a color edit mode. Make me earn whatever credits.you see fit.<br /><br />Cards? Yes, there are full on cards that look cool and are fun to look at, you can buy them with the credits, these are also expensive, but somewhat more practical in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall it's a fun tribute to the game, there are certain cancel supers that aren't a mere touch away, but since there is a much needed easy button \ ex button, the game becomes more of a fan game responsible for giving you a little kof addiction in your pocket. Unfortunately the graphics don't deliver as well as it's fathered games, not even as sharp as it's ps2 predecessors such as Capcom vs snk 2, or even the PlayStation version of that game as well, which sort of brings a tear to my eye. Nonetheless it's a sound fighter for android and it beats most of the non emulator fighters they have, possibly all if the street fighter 4 android game is horrid.<br /><br />Short and sweet? good, but could easily be much better.n game responsible for giving you a little kof addiction in your pocket.

B007QNRMUU|5.0|Love this album! It is interesting to see how much Jason Mraz's musical style has evolved since his debut album, and yet it is still appealing for his fans. I can listen to this whole album over and over (and I do!) You can tell breaking off his engagement with Tristan Prettyman influences most of the tracks, but it is far from a downer. I think I like this album even more than We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was a good book but I didn't care for how scientifically it was written.  He is clearly a genius, but his writing style was very intellectual.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked the story line. Good graphics. Not too hard and not too easy. I like the darker games. I would probably recommend it.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|This movie is like the TV show &#34;Three's Company&#34; where there is just one misunderstanding after the other.  Love it, and even the wife loved it.  The main actress is not difficult to look at, either.
B00000JBCP|5.0|The cd is awesome I love it it came on time ! There are no scratch on it looked brand new
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Eye of the World was the first and  best book in a series that went on far too long, but ended in a mostly satisfying way.  I understand that Sanderson felt a need to tie up all the many loose ends created over 13 previous volume, but some were just too obscure to require being addressed, particularly in the superficial way they were (Paden Fain I am talking to you).  At least the book, which was mainly battle after battle, was a quick read and a satisfactory, if not entirely predictable end to the series.  If you have had the staying power to read the earlier books then this is a must read.  If not then it it will have you scratching your head.  Contrary to what the book says, there was a beginning (eye of the world) and now there is a definite ending to the Wheel to Time.
174179918X|4.0|We have actually bought this book three times; that's how much we wanted it! (We kept losing it...) This is a great book if you are going to travel around the entire peninsula. It gives a quick history of the country and good details on the places listed. I especially like the festival calendar. However, I wish there were more photographs of the destinations. Also, I feel like the North Korea section is wasted as I will never visit there.<br /><br />www.morethanapage.com

B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists and turns.  Definitely had me fooled which is not easy to do.  Once you start it, it will be hard to put down.  Love books like this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the Downton Abbey series.  It is so nice to see success in a show that does not rely on nudity or crass language as a form of entertainment.  Just good story writing.
B00CE6E6B2|3.0|This is a really good game, aside from the fact that if you want to keep playing and leveling up you have to spend real cash. Like in one of the quests you have to buy a house, but you have to spend cash instead of coins to purchase it.
B00CTT9646|5.0|when i first saw cumberbatch i thought he was going to be some alternate version of jean-luc picard from the future. his accent even sounded like picard but khan. ricardo montalban  must be spinning in his grave. i think bruce greenwood is cool as pike. glad he didn't suffer the same fat as pike in the original. jeff hunter was the original pike which i found boring, glad they went with shatner who is james t kirk. killing kirk in generations sucked. imho it was a slap in the face to the fans of the original star trek. i wish they would somehow give shatner a cameo in one of these movies. nimoy has appeared twice. glad to see he is in this movie as well.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My first Stephan King book, and I picked a humdinger!  I absolutely loved this book on multiple levels.  I've since read a few others of King's &#34;best&#34; work (e.g. The Stand) and this one stand heads and shoulders over them.  I've also recommended it to a wide spectrum of readers and every one of them has told me afterwards (unsolicited) how much they enjoyed it.  I do think part of my enjoyment is related to being part of the baby boomer generation.  His depiction of the late 50s and early 60s is vivid and brought back many childhood memories.  So that, the time traveler element, the JFK assassination element, plot itself, the characters, and his superb writing are all the reasons I loved this book.
B004XIZK5K|4.0|I resisted buying Enter the Kettlebell for a long time, until I decided to pursue an SFG.<br /><br />Why the resistance? Because for years, I had a my somewhat worn copy of the Russian Kettlebell Challenge and that, along with a pair of Kettlestacks, seemed to be sufficient. The Russian Kettlebell Challenge seemed like such a comprehensive work that I couldn't see the need for another text.<br /><br />But having embarked on the quest to make a serious study of Kettlebell training (and strength training more generally), I decided that it was time to make the investment in Enter the Kettlebell.<br /><br />Where the Russian Kettlebell Challenge covered a blistering array of exercises, Enter the Kettlebell covers just six: The Swing, The Get-up, The Clean, The Press, The Clean and Press, and The Snatch. By reducing the number of exercises, Pavel is able to give a lot more clear, concrete detail about how those exercises are meant to be performed, and provides good coaching cues for each one. The book also includes a brief history of the Kettlebell, and some program guidelines and plans to help the reader progress with the kettlebell.<br /><br />As far as an instructional book goes, this is a much better book than the Russian Kettlebell Challenge. I love my Russian Kettlebell Challenge, but Enter the Kettlebell is just much more comprehensive in it's explanation of each lift...when I started studying this stuff more deeply, I discovered that I had some pretty major technical errors in a lot of my lifts that I had learned by reading the Russian Kettlebell Challenge.<br /><br />The writing is...well, it's Pavel. Some of it feels like a bit of filler. Some of it wanders. He uses the word &#34;comrade&#34; a lot, and makes references to tough Russians. Either you like it, or you don't. But whether you like it or not, the info in here is solid. A lot of it mirrors things I learned at the HKC, and I suspect will learn when I get to the RKC as well.<br /><br />If you're interested in kettlebell lifting, this is a good place to start.ted in kettlebell lifting, this is a good place to start.
0385535147|5.0|OK, I admit that Grisham is my guilty pleasure.  Easy reading, pure enjoyment.  No current fiction writer tells a better story.  And I think this is his best story yet.  The twists and turns kept me guessing all the way.  I've read all his books, and I'd put this one at the top of my list.  If you have set him aside for a while, this is the book to jump back in with.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fantastic game. Truly unique and one of a kind. This game offers a twist to the average mystery puzzle game.  The challenges are fun to solve, they aren't too hard or too easy. Hints are offered if you get stuck. Love this game! Glad I purchased it. The five star rating was spot on and well deserved! Highly recommended to all that enjoy a mystery game, you won't be disappointed!

B00338CMTI|4.0|Similar to the first story, a nice and quick read with consistent action and interesting plot lines that drive the story forward. Unfortunately, the route the story takes in very predictable. From the start, it's pretty easy to figure out how most conflicts will be resolved and surprises are minimal. Definitely would suggest picking up and reading this book if you have read the first one in the series, just don't expect the novelty of the scenario to persist through this book as well.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This movie was entertaining but also had a great message.  Watched it with my 6 year old nephew and we both loved it.

Swedish furniture.  The consumption itself.  A dog named \\"Entourage,\\" as though being<br /><br />followed around would insure validation, reflection, \\"mirroring.\\"  Looking outward, everywhere, to see<br /><br />oneself, until the looking became fatiguing, and called attention to itself, irretrievably.<br /><br />¶ \\"We wanted to blast the world free of history.\\"  Another staccato, one-sentence paragraph of<br /><br />Palahniuk's, voicing the narrator as self-punching bag, slogging himself to keep himself awake.  Or<br /><br />maybe its Tyler Durden that's doing it.  Or maybe it's Tyler Durden that loves -- excuse me, \\"likes\\" --<br /><br />Marla, which is too much to bear.  Let him burn the world.  For her.  Attention can't be paid to all these<br /><br />things, at once: some other half will \\"bat cleanup\\" until the fissure modern-day America makes in<br /><br />people has been resolved.<br /><br />¶ Hence, Project Mayhem.  \\"'Getting fired,' Tyler says, 'is the best thing that could happen to any<br /><br />of us.  That way, we'd quit treading water and do something with our lives.'\\"  Easier said than done,<br /><br />particularly when you're working two shifts just to keep yourself afloat.  Make it another shift, then: not<br /><br />graveyard, but autopilot.  It's not me who's doing this.  It's not me who's lost in this daily grind of<br /><br />idolatry, the horizon slipped away and, itself, only a myth: thus, it's not me who needs to recover<br /><br />myself.  I think.<br /><br />¶ So, the narrator \\"thinks\\": \\"The problem is, I sort of like my boss.  If you're male, and you're<br /><br />Christian and living in America, your father is your model for God.  And sometimes you find your<br /><br />father in your career.  Except Tyler didn't like my boss.\\"  Thus, the boss ends up dead.  Wrong place,<br /><br />wrong time: modern era, United States of America.  Well, you've gotta show up somewhere.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />- 2 -<br /><br />¶ Meanwhile, nowhere's where it's at, with the flunkies galvanized by this Tyler Durden person<br /><br />learning to crave clawing their way back up: \\"The goal was to teach each man in the project that he had<br /><br />the power to control history.  We, each of us, can take control of the world.\\"  Hence, the adoration.<br /><br />With a clean and clear break from the monotony grind, there just isn't any competition in the \\"sincere<br /><br />esteem\\" department: if anything, those muscles are being awakened, for the first time in these (mostly<br /><br />young) men's lives, like the proverbial Sleeping Giant.<br /><br />¶ \\"Behind us, my job and my office are smaller, smaller, smaller, gone.\\"  These things happen.<br /><br />¶ \\"Like fight club does with clerks and box boys, Project Mayhem will break up civilization so<br /><br />we can make something better out of the world.\\"  Sometimes, these things are necessary.  Become<br /><br />necessary.  Whatever.<br /><br />¶ \\"Loud and fast, Tyler says how the kill whales, Tyler says, to make that perfume that costs more<br /><br />than gold per ounce.  Most people have never seen a whale.  Leslie has two kids in an apartment next to<br /><br />the freeway and Madam hostess has more bucks than we'll make in a year in bottles on her bathroom<br /><br />counter.\\"  This is the problem: not just the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few, but the<br /><br />concentration of everything worth considering beyond the point of experience or one-on-one contact<br /><br />for everyday Americans for the vague, garnish-like, kept-at-a-remove luxury of those very few who<br /><br />need more and more and baroque methods for validating their supremacy.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />C+<br /><br />Christopher: another backslide.

B001XV09UG|4.0|A very thought provoking and extremely different type of movie that not only entertains but shows an unusual side of a married couple.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a twisted tale of extremism in a marriage. It takes all the real flaws and complexities of a relationship and exploits them. Brilliant writing.
B008Q00BOQ|5.0|Great entertainment...what you go to the movies for!  Doesn't have a dull moment and is very fast paced all the way.
B0044DEAUA|3.0|Maybe my car is loud (Nissan XTerra), but I could definitely use more volume.  The microphone seems to be pretty good as I rarely get complaints outside of standard mobile issues.<br /><br />In hindsight, I would've paid more and bought a car BT of a bit higher quality and the ability to stream from my phone.<br /><br />DK
B008Y768XO|4.0|An entertaining and well made movie about the relationship between a dog and his master.  Very nice story that touches the heart
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Fun but hard to navigate through the game would be better if there was a better way to move throughout the game
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|Jonas kaufman is the ideal werther because of his beautiful voice , his interpretation of the role and his romantic looks and  performance. I have never heard such a pertect accent and persona.in any role.<br />Sophie KOch is an excellent Charlottet<br /> I play this record over and over, and never get tired of it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome because of it making you want to keep playing over and over<br />Now there's no other game on my kindle I would rather play!!!! And it makes you smile x
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|My DVD library at Toobworld Central wouldn't be complete without this series.  I'm glad both network versions have been combined.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I am 19 years old and I was unable to watch the original Star Trek series in the 80s. This is AWESOME. I am so happy my generation can actually see these great directed moves instead of the crappy movies from now a days. I went to see Star Trek Into Darkness and it was Awesome too. I will definitely go again this weekend.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Find your way out, if you can!<br />Excellent game for exercising your brain and your way of looking at problems. Must-have for the steampunk in you!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The actions are limited to one room, but the challenges and visuals are stunning and provide you to rotate the image in many directions, which comes in handy. I will definitely look for the next Room! Just finished the Epilogue and it is still great!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Works fine, if you have one of those boxes that plug into an outlet to use. Otherwise, when you get your 2nd generation Kindle fire, you aren't able to charge it, because kindles won't charge straight off the computer USB ports.
098555780X|5.0|The pictures are crystal clear with step by step directions. There are tooooons of options to choose from. Even the most complicated knots are easy for beginners because of the instructions. I will be looking at other volumes by this author for sure.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Although I liked the book, pretty slow at times. The ending came on too fast - not quite believable and reader left wondering what will happen to brother and sister's future. I appreciated the author's depth in understanding about the deep pain of child abuse and the lifetime affects it has. Was hoping for a &#34;hero&#34; for the children at the orphanage to find solice in somewhere in the story - especially for those who were not adopted out. Might be a good book for classroom study in high schools - a lot of topics exposed to discuss morality issues in today's climate of &#34;looking the other way&#34;.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun game but run out of diamonds quickly banishing ghosts from rooms. without using the diamonds,  you can't explore the rooms anymore.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is really fun to play!  It is a challenge.  If you think that you are very good at temple run 2,try this.It is FREE!  No money to lose if you don`t like it.  Get this game.  What are you waiting for!?!
0679805273|4.0|The year this book was written, I gave it to my son for his 19th birthday while he was in college.  Since then this book has become very popular as a graduation gift for seniors.  I gave it to a relative for his upcoming graduation from high school.  He got a kick out of it.  And I still love the message.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|It is a good game. Time management, but I pass every level the first time I played it. It was over too quick.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its fun trying to win the levels. I like that you can buy all sorts of differant tack and horses. I think it is a really great game for being free.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Love it ! But got  little slow thru the middle .I can't wait to out what happens next with everybody
0812416503|1.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books, and is on my &#34;Re-read&#34; list.  I ordered it and it came on time, in good condition, packaged well.  I returned it and got immediate credit from AMazon.<br /><br />The reason for the return is that the book itself is very small, and the print is so small I would require a magnifier to read it.  I am sure I can find a book with regular size print.
B0000070QS|3.0|Huge fan of a-ha.....felt let down on this one.....Hopefully he will get the band back together..<br />although Letters from Egypt and Out of my Hands were pretty good.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this app it helps me wind down after a long day .I have no problems with this app it works perfectly I highly recommend this.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is really descriptive and has a very good plot. Tick Riordan is a great author, I really haven't read a better book
B009NY43NY|1.0|What could have been a great book wound up a disappointment.  Many inconsistencies starting with Sookie not being able to read Sam's thoughts when she could always do so in all the previous books.  Book ended abruptly, and it left me wanting more.  Read all the reviews before reading this myself, so I only read this out of an obligation to finish the series I started.
1878424319|5.0|I bought this book to give as a gift after loving the one I've read for years....<br />Not everyone responds to this way of thinking so you have to know the person you are gifting.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I normally don't watch alot of TV but Sons of Anarchy is one show I can't miss. You have to start from the first season to understand what it is going on. Season Four is as good as the other seasons and each character has decisions they have to make. I like the storyline and the actors play superb roles.
0307352153|4.0|I keep it bedside to read on and off.  I found it informative and well researched... a book to continually pick up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this because its simple to use like a regular calculater. I would recomment it for others to use.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Well thought out tale of the Beginning of the saga of Bilbo Baggins.  This film is a classic before it's own time.  I understand this tale will be a three parter and I can't wait for the next installment to be released.  It is good to see Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, and all the big names from the LOTR again.  Excellent Actors and Actresses always bring believability and draw you into the film and leave you wanting more.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Daft Punk set out to make an homage to the dance music they grew up with, a sound that seems to come from somewhere near Los Angeles in the late 70s or early 80s if a couple of androids had roamed the scene way back when. If you want to know all you need to know about this album, then know that there's a big controversy in music circles because people are saying this is music \\"for their dads\\" and that they'd be embarrased to listen to anything this old-sounding (read: oldschool).<br /><br />...which hilariously ignores the fact that virtually all modern dance music is based very directly on work straight out of a continuum of dance music from the 60s to the 80s, with whole genres built around samples like remixed drumbeats from talents that backed up James Brown or synthesizers that originally accompanied Donna Summer. I hate to be that old man shaking his fist at the kids on his lawn, but this is the time for it.<br /><br />Daft Punk have made a glorious album that brings back every last bit of soul and funk and \\"GIT DOWN\\" from a bygone era. This music makes me want to rent an eye-damaging color of convertible and drive it down to the beach for a twilight dance party. This music makes me want to move, to groove, and above all to smile. Daft Punk had made a name for themselves for making low-production wonders (Homework, Human After All) and they take that to the extreme on this album, using a heavy dose of live performance from real musicians with a decidedly minimal use of electronics. It's an odd situation when having the guitarist from Chic lighting up your tracks is \\"low production\\"- and the results are all the better for it.<br /><br />There is one honest fault with the album, in that it's missing any strong female presence. Considering the massive influence women had over this era, this seems like a glaring omission. A modern music critic should also note that a lot of current dance hall tracks seriously overuse female vocals, such that when you browse most popular lists of dance tracks you're guaranteed to find syrupy-sweet female lyrics just about everywhere, and the lyrics serve absolutely no point in the actual music (when the original women of dance music were often making major social and political points, particularly in the areas of female and community empowerment). Maybe Daft Punk were making their own statement regarding this problem with modern music in their anti-use of female vocals, as they're clearly making similar points with the rest of this album regarding other excesses in current music. But the album still feels incomplete, point or not.<br /><br />This album is easily a \\"top album of the decade\\". Although what decade that is, might be up for debate. If it had included a proper female presence, Random Access Memories would be a contender for \\"THE top album of the decade\\". Really enjoyable, this is going to be a staple of my listening for a long time to come.opular lists of dance tracks you're guaranteed to find syrupy-sweet female lyrics just about everywhere, and the lyrics serve absolutely no point in the actual music (when the original women of dance music were often making major social and political points, particularly in the areas of female and community empowerment).

B00CTT9646|5.0|This movie is an excellent movie.  I have read alot of reviews, alot of complaints, but when I left the theatre I knew I had been entertained from beginning to end by Star Trek.  This new re-booted franchise has been Star Trek in an 'alternate time' since the beginning and Into Darkness works as it continues that concept.  It is funny, filled with action, and offers old Trekkies something that is 'known' but in a fresh, new and alternative way. The villian of this movie is an amazing and powerful actor.  The Enterprise Crew does a better acting job than in the first movie.  I cannot imagine another James T. Kirk than Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto is excellent as Spock.  This movie is neither unimaginative nor predictable.  It takes skill to re-tell a tale in a new and exciting way and Into Darkness does just that.<br /><br />I went with my husband and my 26 year old daughter, who usually cannot stay awake in a movie and had never cared much for the old Star Trek Series.  She is going to see it again and taking her friends with her.  I plan to do the same.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this is a fun way to waste time. not the best game but fun anyway<br />the little goals they give make it interesting. they don't give enough time for healing the sick bone's though.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|Dirty Harry is the best.  Always good movies to watch when t.v. is so boring, which is most of the time.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Christopher Hitchens died of cancer just 4 days after my father, too, died from cancer.<br /><br />For me, this book put into better perspective the notion of &#34;battling cancer&#34;, that the cancer needs the body to live, hence it only dies when the body dies. And the phrase &#34;What doesn't kill you makes you stronger&#34; is now heard with sadness rather than as a source of encouragement.<br /><br />This is a great read.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|When I have time, I sit and watch episode after episode. Columbo was always a favorite of mine. I used to watch them with my Mom.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I have been to &#34;Love&#34; and it was such an amazing experience. Having this movie to share with family has been so much fun and we can re-live that experience.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|The more I play it, the more I love it!! I highly recommend it to all ages, but just make sure you have some time before you start<br />because it's addictive lol
B00006AW2J|5.0|I have listened to this album for at least 49 years!  What else needs to be said! Just a masterpiece.

B007VDN1PA|2.0|I received the scanner pretty quickly from the manufacturer with no issues regarding packaging or shipping.  Once in use the plastic film holder easily becomes scratched degrading the quality of the photographs.  Regardless of the &#34;Scanner&#34; description used in the name it appears to be a camera photographing the image.  It leaves quite a bit to be desired and I would not recommend for purchase.  While others have stated you can order the film holders, I found issues with dust particles inside the machine that also detract from the final product.
0446580848|3.0|This is a book I couldn't wait to get my hands on. I am a huge Nelson DeMille fan in general and John Corey in particular. Corey is my favorite character in modern fiction. Having said that, I found Panther to be only average. I thought the beginning and endings to be what you would expect from DeMille, but the middle very average. The main complaint is the book spent so much time educating me about Yemen, with not enough action. I found my self doing something I never do with one of his books: skimming. It is still a must read for all fans of the series, but one which will leave you looking forward to the next one.
B0095P33IW|3.0|Was expecting more.  Main bad guy was a good choice but could've done more with his character.  Evans did a good job.  Not a bad movie but a one and done with me.

B000V4UFZK|5.0|One of the classic horror movies that I never tire of watching. The special effects seem to stand the test of time, while other details in the movie, like, well, snow on the television when the broadcast ends, show the time period. Who remembers the playing of the Star Spangled Banner when the broadcast ended on television? I do!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very cool.  You could pick different characters.  But I would like it to have more girl characters to chose from.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|I love this disc.  I do not understand a word of it but I love it. I got this for my wife but I think I like it more than she does.  A jazzy old time warmth about her singing is so endearing.

140884009X|4.0|Austenland is a delightful novel with a unique twist on the continuing homage to classics author, Jane Austen. Though it was released several years ago it has been republished by Bloomsbury ahead of its debut as a motion picture starring Keri Russell, due for release in September 2013.<br /><br />In Austenland, New Yorker Jane Hayes is thirty two, single and nurses a secret obsession with Pride and Prejudice, particularly the BBC film adaption, and her romantic ideal Mr Darcy/Colin Firth. When Jane's aunt dies and bequeaths her an all expenses vacation to Pembroke Park, a UK resort that immerses their guests in a Regency England 'experience', Jane hopes that living the fantasy will finally allow her to put her obsession behind her, before she winds up a spinster.<br /><br />Though I do appreciate Jane Austen's contribution to the literary world I wouldn't say I am a huge fan and of her works, Emma is my favourite rather than the more popular Pride and Prejudice. As such, I wasn't at all sure what to expect from Austenland but given it's brevity (at just under 200 pages) I was willing to give it a chance and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was quickly caught up in this delightful romantic comedy.<br /><br />I have no doubt Pembroke Park, should it ever actually exist, would have a steady stream of clientele enamoured by the romance of the Regency period (while still enjoying some of today's mod cons). In Austenland, the resort is populated by paying guests and actors required to conduct themselves in a manner befitting Jane Austen's time. I thought Hale created a unique and fun setting, and though it takes a while for Jane Hayes to succumb to the experience, which requires her give up her mobile phone and wear a bonnet whenever she steps outside, eventually she submits to its charms, encouraged by the attention of the Park's gardener and the gruff Mr Nobley.<br /><br />This lighthearted novel is a quick, entertaining read sure to delight Jane Austen and romance fans alike. I'm looking forward to reading the next Austenland book, Midnight in Austenland, from Hale soon.ance fans alike.

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I am almost embarrassed to admit I have yet to read Khaled Hosseini's first acclaimed works, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns so I couldn't pass up on the chance to read And the Mountains Echoed, the author's third novel.<br /><br />This novel begins in 1952 as a father recites a bed time story to his young son and daughter during an overnight trek across the Afghanistan desert on their way to Kabul. The tale, we soon learn, tells the truth of the father's journey for desperate to provide for his new wife and growing family, the father has agreed to sell his daughter to a wealthy couple unable to bear their own in a deal brokered by their valet, his brother. The separation of the brother and sister, Abdullah and Pari, provides the catalyst for Hosseini to share several stories, within a larger arc, that explore the bonds of family and love, and the devastation of separation and loss.<br /><br />Abdullah returns to their village with his father but feels the loss of his sister keenly;<br />\\"She was like the dust that clung to his shirt. She was in the silences that had become so frequent in the house, silence that welled up between their words, sometimes cold and hollow, sometimes pregnant with things that went unsaid, like a cloud filled with rain that never fell.\\"<br /><br />but never relinquishes the dream of being reunited with Pari.<br /><br />At just four, Pari quickly settles into her new life but it is the story of her adoptive parents - the wild, provocative Nila and her introverted and much older husband Mr. Suleiman Wahdati, that unravels next as witnessed by Pari's uncle, Nabi. A marriage of convenience it soon disintegrates when Wahditi suffers a stroke and Nila flees to France, her mother's birthplace, with Pari. Nabi is left to nurse his invalid employer, remaining with him even as the war begins to rage around them.<br /><br />Moving then to Paris, America while never straying far from war torn Afghanistan, the fates of Abdullah, Pari, and those connected to them are slowly revealed. It is an emotional, poignant journey that weaves its way in and out of character, time and place.<br /><br />I do have to admit And The Mountains Echoed was not without its flaws for me. At times I felt the narrative was disjointed and while eventually Hosseini merges the threads of the splintered journey it is not always an easy path to follow. Characters come and go, and their importance, or their relationship to Abdullah and Pari, are not always clear.<br /><br />Still, I was captivated by the powerful prose and the heartfelt emotion infused in this tale. And The Mountains Echoed is an epic tale of heartbreak and hope that exposes humanity at its worst and best. A fine novel that I am pleased to recommend.those connected to them are slowly revealed.

193700788X|4.0|In spite of all the vitriol being spewed about how people don't like what Charlaine Harris has done with her own characters, I found this an extremely interesting and fun book to read.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil any of you, but I saw the final choice coming a mile away. If you're unhappy about what an author chooses to do with their own characters, then I suspect you should write your own books where you can pair up whatever characters you want.<br /><br />The ending felt rushed, but I can say that about 90% of the books I've read recently. For some reason the majority of the series that I've been reading look like someone took the final 1/4th of the book and squished it down to half the original size. I suspect this is editorial in nature rather than authorial but we will have to see how things progress in the future.<br /><br />I was happy with this as an ending to the series and it tied up a huge number of loose threads in a very satisfying manner.
B000P12LWY|4.0|The acting and detailed period settings highlight this series.  Though Henry VIII was older than portrayed in this series, we should forgive artistic licenae when reality was not nearly as interesting.  Certainly, Henry VIII was a virile and active man, not the fat monarch as he is often portrayed.  So if you don't treat this program as a history lesson, it serves well as good entertainment.  Hirst, the creator and head writer, also is responsible for the History channel's excellent recent series, The Vikings.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Every once and a while, a truly special film comes along that defies expectations about what a film can be, and also makes you wonder why no one ever thought of doing something like it before.<br /><br />A worthy effort from first time director Peter Ramsey, \\"Rise of the Guardians\\" is at once epic, touching, exciting, heartwarming, at times quite scary; in short, everything that makes a good movie. Truly, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, animated or otherwise.<br /><br />Being someone who, at 19, still believes wholeheartedly and without shame in the \\"Big Three\\" (Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny), I quickly became a fan of William Joyce's excellent series-in-the-making \\"The Guardians of Childhood\\", which attempts to give a history to some of the most beloved legendary figures, including the lesser-known Sandman, Jack Frost, and of course, the Bogeyman himself, named, what else, Pitch Black. The film occurs some 300 or so years after the books, and deals with the Guardian's need for a new member to help them in their fight against Pitch as he attempts to corrupt the children of the world's dreams by turning them into nightmares and in the process squelching their belief in the Guardians at all, in an effort to take over.<br /><br />While on the surface an adventure film, at its heart, it is a tale about discovering who you are, what gift we as individuals can contribute to the world, the awesome power of belief, and the importance of keeping our childlike sense of wonder alive. No, this isn't like your typical DreamWorks picture, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The storyline is superbly well crafted and never once loses its focus, and the avoidance of humor that relies on crude and suggestive humor and already-dated pop culture refererences gives it an irresistibly timeless feel. While there are many serious moments (I was brought to tears many times), the film is also just plain fun, a delightful joyride that deserves the designation of a family film more than most others produced nowadays.<br /><br />All of the characters are wonderfully unique, with their own distinct personalities, further enhanced by the fabulous acting jobs of all-star actors including Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, and Hugh Jackman. While they might be tweaked a bit from the original stories, they retain the overall essence of each Guardian (For example, the Easter Bunny, instead of the stuffy, egg-obsessed Pooka he is in the book, is now a tough, no-nonsense Aussie).<br /><br />It's a real shame that this gem of a movie was considered a box-office failure upon its release and was subsequently made a scapegoat for DreamWork's current financial difficulties, because it is so well done and has so much to offer. With a great story, a beautiful message, gorgeous animation, and a great voice cast, I can't think of a way to possibly make it any better than it is.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love it, love it, love it! It is a great series! I hope this goes on for many years to come.
B0037NVM2C|3.0|We know it, T2 is a cult. One night we really wanted to watch it and we decided to stream it on Amazon. Terrible choice.<br />The streaming page should be cleaner and there should be a subtitles option...not a good experience.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|In Star Trek Into Darkness, his follow-up to 2009's blockbuster reimaginging of the Star Trek franchise, JJ Abrams delivers a visually spectacular and action-packed installment that's big on spectacle and a little forced on plot.<br /><br />The plot in its simplest form pits the crew of the Enterprise against a mysterious and vicious figure known as John Harrison, a former member of Starfleet who commits an act of terrorism against London and flees to a war-zone planet outside the neutral zone. Captain Kirk and his crew embark on a manhunt to capture Harrison with the hopes of exacting revenge and preventing further bloodshed.<br /><br />The film itself looks fantastic; Abrams is a true master of visuals and spectacle, both of which are on huge display here. The cityscapes, set pieces, and space effects, including travel and starships, are incredibly detailed and a wonder to behold.<br /><br />The cast, as in the previous film, are equally enjoyable to watch; Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have really nailed their respective characters in Kirk and Spock and have a lot more camaraderie this time around. The rest of the fantastic crew has returned for this installment as well, including Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, and Bruce Greenwood. As for the newcomers, Peter Weller is well cast in his role as Admiral Marcus, the man responsible for sending Kirk to catch Harrison. Alice Eve is also very good as Carol Marcus, reassigned science officer of the Enterprise and daughter of Admiral Marcus. The biggest newcomer to the film is that of the villain, played by the increasingly intriguing and engaging Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays his part extremely well and, for me, is one of the highlights of the film.<br /><br />Alas, if only the story could have been as strong as the visuals and cast. The plot, while entertaining as hell and lot of fun to watch, has quite a few holes that can simply be chalked up to sloppy writing. I'll keep this review spoiler-free but there were multiple instances I found myself scratching my head because of what was unfolding onscreen. While this didn't detract from the fun I had while watching the movie, I found myself thinking more and more about the problems with the script afterwards. Don't get me wrong; the film is an outstanding summer blockbuster that will hold its own in the Trek catalog, it just contains a few plot points that were either too convenient or too unexplained for my taste.<br /><br />Overall this is a really good follow-up in the rebooted Star Trek universe and has everything an summer popcorn-flick should. Though it does have some plot issues, I highly recommend this if you're a fan of action blockbusters, sci-fi, or the 2009 reboot.poiler-free but there were multiple instances I found myself scratching my head because of what was unfolding onscreen.

B00CS65JS2|5.0|I love Daft Punk. And I love French House. And I love 80s Pop and 70s Disco and R&B even more. So when I first listened to Random Access Memories, my first thought was this: Finally, they made the album that really took us back into time, the time of when music was different. When records couldn't be leaked, or streamed, and they weren't just a few singles amidst a bunch of filler tracks. They were albums, totally made as one complete package, to be listened to from beginning to end.<br /><br />For fans of Daft Punk who love dance music, house, and techno, this is NOT an EDM album. It's not the house music that we know Daft Punk to have made, with filtered sampled loops, drum machine-programmed beats, and electronic harsh noise. It's not any of that that. You can't fist-pump to this music, you can't go nuts to it. So when you listen to Random Access Memories for the first time, go into it with a different state of mind than \\"House Music.\\" I invite you instead to hop into your DeLorean, and take a plunge back to the year of 1979, when dance music was quite different...<br /><br />Random Access Memories is Discovery if Daft Punk had produced it 30 years ago. This is a tribute to those who grew up in the 70s and late-80s. To those who grew up listening to Roger Troutman's vocoder in the band \\"Zapp\\" on classic songs like Computer Love, it's on this album. To those who danced to Nile Rodgers' impeccable guitar licks on classic Chic songs like Good Times and I Want Your Love, they're here too. And to those who enjoyed the mellowed-out soulful keyboard playing of Michael McDonald and the Jazz Crusaders, it's all here too. From the beginning track, \\"Give Life Back To Music\\", to \\"Get Lucky\\" to \\"Beyond\\" and everything in-between, you can hear the distinctive influence of the 70s.<br /><br />Random Access Memories is also for those Who grew up watching movies like Tron, Blade Runner, and The Muppet Movie, and television shows like Miami Vice. You hear it in every one of the songs, that at-night, convertible top-down, cruise style of the album. The immense amount of vocoder, the guitar licks, strings, and synthesizers. The happy children playing. While Random Access Memories may not be as mind-blowing as Discovery was, this is a fantastically-produced album. This album is like watching a movie. It's a soundtrack to a life, really, a life of two robots trying to be human. It's slower-paced, somber, and meaningful. And it's really good. 5 stars.ngs, that at-night, convertible top-down, cruise style of the album. The immense amount of vocoder, the guitar licks, strings, and synthesizers.

B004TRKH9O|5.0|In 1974, the release of Tangerine Dream's [[ASIN:B0000074C9 Phaedra]] captivated Canadian youth and was to hold them in thrall for three further albums. I was one of them. Thus, a heretofore unknown German band had toppled Pink Floyd's reign, that they had held since [[ASIN:B004ZN9NCY Ummagumma]] and would never regain. Krautrock had come to Canada and changed popular music forever.<br /><br />On the merit of Phaedra, I quickly discovered the first four albums on Ohr (mach das Ohr auf) Records, which were deeper and more rewarding than the rather commercial Phaedra. Of these, Zeit, the album that sums up Tangerine Dream the best, sounds as visionary and mysterious today as it did then. If you are looking for the one TD album to fill that gap in your collection, this is the one to buy. It has both LPs on one disk and, as a bonus, is accompanied by a fine 78-minute live performance from the same year on a second disk. Weit drau&szlig;en, Mann!

B006OE7XM4|5.0|I listen to a lot of music, incluidng a lot of jazz.  I listen to probably 150 new albums each year and have done that for many, many years.  \\"Be Good\\" is by far the best album I've heard in 2013 and better than anything I heard in 2012 too (maybe even 2011 too if I can remember than far back!).  It is just a terrific, well crafted album with a voice that yes, is Ellingesque but all its own.  I've got Porter's first album on order now and am looking forward to what will hopefully be many more to come.  I doubt that anybody who really digs music would have any difficulty really loving this album.  Give it a try and you'll at a minimum, not be disappointed or, like me, be unable to take it out of your cd player or playlist for a long, long time!
B003L77GG0|5.0|The last episodes on \\"Smallville.\\"  Since I collect superman, this is a great addition to my collection.  they should have used Tom Welling in the new Superman movie that is coming out - although I haven't seen it yet.
B005LAII08|5.0|Disney/Pixar really hit the mark on this one. The main character shares a lot more true-to-life qualities with growing up that many past princess characters; she's rebellious to the point of not only going against her mother's wishes, but trying to subvert them completely. But she loves her family dearly all the same, and the bond runs deep through all that happens. Seeing a child's deep love and caring towards a parent whose rules they also so desperately wish to escape from is a very different motif for a Disney princess story. I found it heartwarming on so many different levels. The fear, the bravery, the sacrifices, and the strengthening of their loving bond through their tribulations are all wonderful and relatable parts of the story for any parent and their growing (or grown!) child. The lesson of mutual respect between a parent and child is a wonderful reminder of this constant challenge to both real-life counterparts as they watch this movie, as well.<br /><br />As others have stated, this movie does have some fairly scary scenes involving animals. Many people use the term \\"intense,\\" which they are, but to be perfectly blunt - they're scary. As a small child, I would have had bad dreams involving them, but I also clung to imagery in movies very tightly and had an overactive imagination. If in doubt, watch the movie by yourself first, or search online for a synopsis or video of just the scary scenes if you don't want to spoil getting to watch the whole movie together for the first time with your child. It's not \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" or anything - it's just good to be aware of the scenes if you have a child you know gets frightened easily.<br /><br />As for the physical disc itself, the presentation is very nice. I like the lenticular slip cover that goes over the disc case, though it is prone to the corners getting a little bent after removing and reinserting the blu-ray case a few times, as it's a pretty tight fit. I do appreciate that unlike a lot of multi-disc sets, the discs aren't stacked on top of each other in this package. Each one is one its own little spindle so you can get to whichever disc you want without having to remove a bunch of others first. The bonus features are also really enjoyable, and this movie looks great in 3D! A wonderful package to buy if you'd like to get the complete set of viewing options (we used the 3D blu-ray as a special \\"movie night\\" treat, the standard blu-ray for normal \\"let's pop in a movie\\" type viewing, and the DVD for playing in the car during road trips).lti-disc sets, the discs aren't stacked on top of each other in this package.

1439130833|2.0|I thought this was going to be a book that could be used multiple times. It's a tear-off format like a daily desk calendar.  Feel good encouragement, but after the year, it's gone.  Since it isn't a calendar, it would have been better for those purchasing to have a reusable book.  Also, don't put much stock in the lessons unless you're prepared to work a lot harder than intend or wish something. That's exactly the mistake the poor masses make every day.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse has been a joy to use.  It arrived in an attractive package and the installation was quick and painless.  This is my first mouse with programmable buttons and I only really have one complaint, the buttons on the side of the mouse (particularly the one farthest from your palm) can be a stretch to reach. Other than that I have been very happy with the mouse.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this as a first \\"gaming\\" mouse, and I have been very impressed with the company behind it.  Anker has emailed me twice regarding the order to make sure I was happy with my purchase.  Now if only they made a mechanical keyboard with a couple programmable keys they would have another sale. :)
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|this film pretends to be way more meaningful than it really is.  there is absolutely no character development and many of the characters added nothing to do the story.  the original idea behind the film was great but it got lost somewhere in between.  the trailer is definitely misleading.  you will more than likely be disappointed.  i wanted to love this film...then i just wanted to like it.  to say i am disappointed would be an understatement.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|it can teach poeple to take care of pets such as horses<br />and it can teach how fun it is to take care of pets such as horses
B00005JLEU|5.0|This was a gift for a friend as she really wanted this movie. She liked it very much so I guess it's good.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Well, maybe.  All I know is that this record, along with Shafiq Husayn's _Shafiq En' A-Free-Ka_ and Esperanza Spalding's _Radio Music Society_ and _Chamber Music Society_, sure are pointing in a rich and exciting direction.<br /><br />Glasper's record smoothly blends jazz, funk, hip-hop and R&B elements into something that sounds like all of them and yet not identifiably like any of them.  It's missing the edgy clash of genres that Spalding's and Husayn's records have; hers are \\"jazzier\\" and Husayn's \\"hip-hopper,\\" if I had to characterize the differences.  But Glasper's record wouldn't be mistaken for smooth jazz.  Its overall sound becomes its title--Black Radio--but, rather than sounding exclusionary or proprietary, it feels to your reviewer--a middle-aged white guy--like there's room for everyone with ears to hear.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awsome not better than minecraft but otherwise than that,awsome i would pay 100$ for this game gamewouldnt you!?!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy and fast paced games.  Highly recommend if you're not looking for something terribly difficult. It's free too even better.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved this book and I highly recommend this to anyone who loves adventure I was literally up almost all night reading and I couldn't put it down I freaking can't wait to get the next one which is probably right now!! Peace out!!!!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is just like saints row 2 and its pretty cool but it would be more epic. If we're was multiplayer but other than that this game is awesome
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Wow that's all I could say was wow best book ever need to next one now and must Read lol hope you loved it as much as I did because I NEVER put it down!!!!
B0027MJU00|3.0|Dark Places begins with a full head of steam but bogs down in the middle and never quite manages to fulfill its original promise. Good writing, vivid imagery, weak ending.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I have been a fan since 1996. This album is different. It is not the old daft punk we got used to and have been waiting for. But still this album is great. I particularly like \\"Give life back to music\\", \\"Giorgio by Morodr\\", \\"Lose yourself to dance\\", \\"Get lucky\\" and finally \\"Fragments of time.\\" I think daft punk tried to explore new areas. It feels like they replaced synthesizers with \\"people\\", I mean with real instruments and players. I kinda like this \\"exploration\\", have been a fan and will stay a fan.
1611761751|5.0|The maestro has still got it, with an amazing range of characters and a devilish plot.<br /><br />Arguably his best in years.<br /><br />I just wished it would never end.<br /><br />But that's another story . . .
B008220D7S|3.0|This is a black comedy at best. I watched the theatrical release with my wife and adult daughter and her spouse. I expected to see a mirror image of typical middle aged life and its challenges. Okay, they got a few of those right. Some of them made me laugh, others were just juvenile potty humor. Actually, I thought the teenaged daughter was the most realistic of the bunch. As for the completely disfunctional peripheral family, I found them to be pathetic and a drag on the film. The editor could have lightened the theme and saved about 30 minutes of depressing moments by trimming as an editor should.<br />Not my favorite movie, but not the complete stinker that the 'one star' raters rank it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game.  Whenever I play it I am always entranced in it.  My mom can never get me away from it.
0061438294|5.0|Great information - easy read.  Will read it a couple more times to get it all to stick - fun to practice.  Who knew there was so much information in the feet.  Use this information a lot in sales and my massage practice.
0525425772|5.0|At first, I expect Theo who keeps fighting against an just evil or a criminal ...as always.<br />But it is not like that simple, this time.<br />I feel that Theo has been grown up and who can battle against the environmental unfair issue \\"outside\\" the court with FB and so on!<br />Of cource, I love the 4th, definitely.
B003UESJHY|5.0|I think one of the kids used my account for this - can't comment one way or the other.  Given it has Christian Bale how bad can it be?  Hopefully someone else has a better review.
B005RZ8W94|5.0|This dvd is awesome- I LOVE Volbeat, but the likelihood of my ever making it to one of their performances is pretty slim. I'm too old to tolerate the crowds, so this is a great way to have the next best thing.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|As I wrote about the first season, terrific cast, great plots, fantastic acting and a wonderful story line. We really loved it.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Sorry, Keira Knightly... you're lovely, but your version of the movie is just not good.  I've seen this move so many times, read the book so many times... and I can tell you - they did a great job with this movie version.  And hey... Colin Firth... need I say more?  Oh... you want more?  How about Colin Firth jumping into a pond, and walking across the field all wet?  Yeah... I liked that too.  I finally updated my old DVD version to the BluRay version... didn't HAVE to, but wanted the quality.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a nice game to pass the time.  It can be as simple or as difficult as you choose.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was NOT a quick read, yet I could hardly put it down.  I finished this just a few weeks before going to see the World War II museum in New Orleans... and it was very historically accurate.  Actually, I read this at the same time as &#34;The Greatest Generation&#34; by Tom Brokaw, and found I was blurring reality with fiction between the two books!  This is an absolute page turner!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This was a nice game.  I finished all the levels, and then got bored.  I need new input constantly.  I will play it again.  Eventually.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This was how it all started. Read all the Lord of the Rings books. Enjoyed this very much. Thank You.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I play this game all the time.  I keep trying to beat my highest level.  Very addicting little time waster.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|good game.  I had waiting for stuff to ready. need to the game easier for those who do not want to pay the stupid rate for more stars. also why do I have to type twenty words in this review for you guys
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game presents a good combination of base building and actual fighting where the user has some control over the outcome.  It is a little slow in terms of building resources at first, but develops nicely after 5 or 10 hours of play.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is great,especially for a person who loves dragons and mystical creatures.I recommend this game for little kids or even adults!Great game but it does have some problems,you have to wait about 6,7,8,AND sometimes even 9 hours for a dragon or habitat to finish!
B009AMAGQM|1.0|Going in I knew this was going to be bad.  But I wondered how bad.  Well . . . [SPOILERS!] . . . the main female character Lena, who is a caster (i.e, witch) faces three challenges, none of which seems terribly urgent:<br /><br />1. When a female caster turns 16 she is \\"claimed\\": that is, she will involuntarily and irreversibly use her magic for either good or evil.  (Male casters are exempt from this for some reason.)  That's the theory.  But when Lena's cousin Ridley, who was already claimed for evil, shows up, the strict good/evil dichotomy doesn't hold up: Ridley has more or less behaved like a slut since she turned 16.  (There was an instance when she hypnotized a boy to walk in front of a speeding train, but that's in a flashback.)  If that's the extent of the evil Lena might endure, then why is everyone getting so bent out of shape?<br /><br />2. The claiming is the result of a curse involving Lena and her boyfriend Ethan.  Apparently his male ancestor, also named Ethan, and her female ancestor, Genevieve, were in love.  As a soldier in the Civil War, Ethan was shot.  Just as he was about to die, Genevieve cast a spell to bring him back to life.  As it happens, this is a spell they're never supposed to cast.  (So why the hell invent it?)  Just as Ethan came back to life, Genevieve turned evil and, well, killed him again.  (What a waste.)  Since then Genevieve's female descendants have had to face the claiming.  It's implied throughout the film that Lena can be prevented from becoming evil if she stays away from Ethan, but it's never quite clear what difference that would actually make.<br /><br />3. Lena's mother, Serafine, who was claimed for evil, has her sights set on Lena being claimed for evil as well.  She's presented as a threat but all she does, when not posing as a fundamentalist church lady, is laugh a lot and tell Lena what a great time she'd have if she were evil.  Pretty non-threatening.<br /><br />All these things, in addition to the painfully stereotyped southern town of Gatlin, are meant to create tension for Lena and Ethan.  In the end the supernatural obstacles, unable to make sense in themselves, fail to add up where the romance is concerned.<br /><br />On the plus side, Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson manage to ham it up with quite uncharacteristic southern accents, which is the reason I bothered to watch the movie in the first place.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|I was very satisfied.  Product came on time, and was exactly what I expected.  Great movie.  The ending will blow you away.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I think through my long, sometimes geekish, love affair with all things Star Trek and wonder how it can continue... will I ever grow out of it?  Then JJ Abrams makes another fantastic Star Trek movie and I know the love affair will continue.  The entire cast is just perfect... if I were re-booting the franchise myself I don't think I could have come up with a better set of actors to represent who I imagine these characters to be.  I thought that after the first reboot movie and they continue to prove themselves to be the right cast - including of all people Bruce Greenwood as Pike. Love him in the role. Same goes for all of them. I found it comically ironic that Peter Weller was the bad guy - can he play anything else?  Of course I continue to be amazed at how pleased I am at the role of Zachary Quinto as Spock.  The movie visuals were amazing. Special effects awesome as expected... music-great... Story-great - Ah Kahn! You genetically engineered devil!  Of the originals, The Wrath of Kahn was the best movie by far...(Ricardo Maltaban as Khan was great but Benedict Cumberbatch really did a fine job!)... but this re-imagined prequel is pretty great as well.  Nicely done Abrams.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is so fun I can`t stop playing it. If you want a really good game check out this one.
B004SIP71M|3.0|I heard a lot of good stuff about this movie so maybe I expected too much.  I found it a bit dated, limited in scope, and on occasion confusing.  Meryl Streep is, as usual, excellent, but overall I found the movie somewhat self-conscious and even a bit maudlin.  There are better, more subtly done movies about these issues.  Perhaps that's it--too many issues in one short film.<br /><br />Best part for me was the photography--some scenes stand out as very evocative despite the limited scope of the sets.<br /><br />Worth watching once.
B008JFUO72|5.0|I loved this film I have most mavel films and love how they are directed this was another success x
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This application is always failing and there is no compensation from the company when it does.  I was charged 4 times for the same purchase and still have not been refunded or compensated for this.  I love the game. I am just disappointed in the company in general.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This might not have been how some people wanted this series to end but I thought it was good. It was fitting for Sookie. Loved all the books.
1475143389|5.0|Lots of good info. No fluff. Straight to the point. Started implementing the info yesterday. I will update this review on my progress.  Reading this finally gave me the motivation I needed.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I've been obsessed with Daft Punk since 1997. Since I was a teenager, pretty much all of my highs and all of my lows have somehow been accompanied by these guys. \\"Indo Silver Club\\" & \\"Burnin'\\" & \\"High Fidelity\\" & \\"High Life\\" taught me how to groove. \\"Rollin' & Scratchin'\\" & \\"Rock'n Roll\\" & \\"Alive\\" & \\"The Brainwasher\\" taught me how to rage. \\"Fresh\\" & \\"Aerodynamic\\" & \\"Da Funk\\" taught me how to dream. \\"Emotion\\" & \\"Digital Love\\" & \\"Something About Us\\" taught me how to cry. Etc., etc., etc. Over and over, again and again. Their songs have remained ubiquitous and omnipresent in my daily goings-on. And I am very, very proud to say that Random Access Memories fits very nicely into Daft Punk's luminous lexicon, and it's held a constant place in my life for the past a week. Unable to wait until the official release date, I was fortunate enough to snatch up a copy of it from the advanced full-preview, and of course it very quickly made it's way on my iphone, laptop, and even my computer at work.<br /><br />The most flawless songs are \\"Doin' it Right\\" & \\"Lose Yourself to Dance\\" & \\"Instant Crush.\\" The most memorable songs are \\"Get Lucky\\" & \\"Give Life Back to Music\\" & \\"Fragments of Time.\\" The most provocative songs are \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\" & \\"Touch.\\" The most beautiful songs are \\"Within\\" & \\"The Game of Love...\\" But there are three tracks which, of course, are very high quality, but I find them completely perplexing: \\"Beyond\\" & \\"Motherboard\\" & Contact -- they each have their own identity, for sure, but I'm not sure what purpose they serve, exactly, except to give us more material on an already extremely generous album. For me, these three tracks are just filler.<br /><br />This album isn't hard to digest for those who've invested their time in Electroma & Tron & Irreversible -- but that's not everybody, though I do not think that this album can't be for everybody, because in a way it tries to have something for everybody, and as a whole, it is an extremely rich and rewarding and well-rounded experience.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I really liked some of the old mystery series movies, so yes, I LOVED the COLUMBO series.  I would rate it excellent.
B009EAO38C|5.0|This is a great album that combines contemporary and classical pieces, or reinterprets other popular songs. The quality of the music is great. I would recommend this to anyone who loves either classical or new age music.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It's worth the memory and time!!! I've had a few issues driving motor cycles or bikes I have had to mess with the calibration a lot to get it work drive and not do a stoppie. Other than that perfect game.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Saw the movie and decided to read the book which was better.  A bit hard to read to start with, but got much better as you got into the story.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.
0307743659|5.0|But I am going to try...This book, whoa, what can I say.  Absolutely incredible writing here.  It is a monument of a book that fly's by you so quickly despite its length.  If you have seen the movie, go read the book.  There are a number of things that are different, and in my opinion, better, in the book.  The characters are so rich and developed that you are rooting for everyone, including Jack.  King's prose is so rich and fluid that you almost don't want to read another book after this one.  It isn't so much as a horror novel as it is a suspenseful, well written and supernatural. Go read this book, you will NOT regret it!!
B00BQHA06A|5.0|I was not initially going to write a review, but now felt the need to do so. I personally believe this to be HIM's most mature album. The lyrics are intense, and honest. There is no frill to the words, no hidden meanings, but they are still so powerful in what they convey. It seems to be as though the words are an almost form of acceptance of life, of love, of loss. An understanding that nothing is perfect, but everything is just as it should be. Pain, hope, passion, love, sadness... All serve a purpose, and help to shape us as humans. Help us to grow, learn, and survive whatever may cross into our path.<br /><br />Musically, this album is gorgeous. Such different styles, woven together to create a beautiful partnership with the lyrics. I am constantly in awe of the ability of the musicians in this band. This album showcases each of them in a fantastic way. You can clearly hear the talent each of these men possess.<br /><br />The only negative about this album, and I must state I have only heard the mp3 version, is that sometimes Ville's voice is almost completely lost. I don't know if they intentionally set the levels this way, but I wish his voice was a bit more prominent in the songs. I don't know if the cd version of the album is the same, but I am hoping the vocals are a tad more clear.<br /><br />All in all, I really adore this album. It was emotional, beautifully arranged, and well written. I wish all music could be this well done.<br /><br />Carrie D.<br /><br />Edit... After listening to the actual CD of this album, I can say the vocals are much clearer than the mp3 version.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Really love this show. Love the characters and the banter. It's always a good time. I can't wait to finally meet the mother!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|It was good, but not great, I'd much rather see the stage version.<br /><br />I don't think the voices were that great.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Didn't even see the whole movie. It was so boring and uninteresting that I fell asleep while we were watching it.
0375842209|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Interesting way to handle a very upsetting subject matter. I definitely recommend this book to anyone!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Not a big fan. Very slow, boring movie. I definitely expected more when I purchased it. Not a happy camper.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|If you know anyone or suspect someone of having asperger's then this book is an insight into how they may see the world and themselves. There were times that I was laughing out loud at the main character's naivety and literal interpretation of events. You really wanted it to work out for him and would cringe at some of his actions. Easy to read and enjoyable while being insightful. Good read.
1416972242|4.0|I would like to thank you for giving me a good deal on this book I have been wanting to read it to find what happens next
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A beautifully written book. The Author has a  way of describing  characters, places and even sounds t which makes one feel  like a  silent  spectator  in the novel. The plot is unique and very intriguing.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|This game has the potential to be a great game, unfortunately it seems as if the devs have forgotten about World At Arms. It's very glitchy, and these are major glitches that everyone complains about on the Gameloft forum, and yet these glitches don't get fixed. Also it seems as if this game is designed to have you accidentally click things that cost in game currency. I accidentally clicked something worthless that basically wiped out my star currency, and when I tried to contact the devs about it, they basically told me tough luck, watch where you click. But of course I could get all of that currency back if I use my credit card. It's too bad because this could've been a great game.
B003NX75B8|5.0|This book is excellent. Funny, insightful and slightly mischievous. A must read for audiences 13 or older. John Green Never disappoints!
B00AO686MY|5.0|This is one of my favorite films, so I bought it once again (VHS, Lazer Disc, DVD) on Blu-Ray, because I felt the previous versions had a bit of video noise (grainy). It's interesting that the cartoon at the beginning still has the noise. I guess they want it that way for effect, but the rest of the video is pristine.
B002ZG975Q|3.0|Eh... this movie is DECENT to me, but I won't say much more than that. I don't know, I was expecting it to be better; especially since the previews made it look like it was going to be just &#34;oh so good...&#34;<br /><br />It is cute though. I'm 20, I feel like a younger crowd would like it more than I did.
B00BRYDKM8|3.0|Akash's book is a good mesh-up of guidelines, tips and tricks and examples on public speaking in general, not just for a TED Talk. Actually, I was expecting a sharper focus on the TED format subtleties (i.e. the TED commandments, how to handle the space on a stage of the kind you see in most TED conferences, how to prepare the speech for a present and a virtual audience simultaneously, etc.): these aspects are rather lacking. Nevertheless, although I was familiar with most of the core principles having read Heath brothers' \\"Made to Stick\\" - from which Akash admittedly draws a lot -  I learned some useful new concepts I will try out in my next presentations.<br />All in all it makes a quick and easy rough guide to venture in public speaking, condensing the essential from different sources and from the author's own experience. I especially liked the very clear structure of each chapter (intro-body-summary) that allows a speedy retrieval of the relevant bits when needed, which makes it a good companion to bring with you while you move your first steps in the public speaking arena.
B002ZG9968|4.0|Definitely a cute movie. Somewhat predictable but that is fine. Alex O'Loughlin is a major hottie so it doesn't hurt to watch it just for him!
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I would give more stars if I could...I believe this is their best CD yet. Every time I listen to it I have a new favorite song. I really like all the tracks, but my favorites (this week!) are: Lola Montez, Pearl Hart, Doc Holliday, The Cape of Our Hero, and The Sinner is You.  I would say again this is their best effort yet.
B000089RVX|5.0|Hey, thank you!!! The disk looks wonderful and of course plays fabulously. I couldn't have asked for better, thanks again.
B008NA3I30|5.0|Any of us who have been in long term relationships or marriages have thought about what it would be like to be with someone else, or what to do with the attraction felt toward another person.  This movie explores that feeling in such an in-depth manner that by the end, I felt that I had had an affair and had my answer to how that would feel.  It was incredibly thought provoking and the realism of it was like a slap in the face.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Getting info on the tornado destruction in Oklahoma almost as fast as it happened<br />is great.  No waiting until later for this news.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|This movie just makes me laugh. Not a huge John Malkovich fan but this movie was made for his style. The Whole cast is perfect. Can't wait for #2.
0679890475|3.0|This book is really cute. I didn't realize when I bought it that is was the small version. I was looking for the original, but this will be good for taking along in the diaper bag.
B003HARV4S|5.0|Blu Ray may be a bit much for this movie due to the fact that the film is designed to look &#34;aged&#34; as if it were done in the 20's or 30's (It is a period film). Having the DTS audio is worth the price of admmision.
0375851569|4.0|Love these books. My son really enjoys Green Eggs and Ham. We read 2 - 3 of these books every night before bed. I think every kid should have Dr. Suess books. A great buy!
B009NY43NY|5.0|This has been my favorite series ever. It is sad to see it come to an end. I was please with the ending. I think Sookie will be the happiest with Sam, but I know she will always have a good friend in Bill.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|Great app for the musician or the &#34;wanna-be's&#34; like me. Very entertaining. With a headphone I can play without disturbing (ha ha) anyone.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|There is only one Barbra, and everything she does, is her best at the time!<br />No matter how many times you see her, it's never enough!
B001P5HI4A|4.0|Ms Streisand would NEVER approve the poor quality of this DVD. Her Performances are always perfection. This needs to be remastered.
0525478817|4.0|The principal characters of ` The Fault in our Stars`  are cancer stricken teenagers whose lives revolve around chemo sessions and ICU-stays, rather than shopping malls and dance-clubs.  In spite of the grim prognosis for the teenagers the book is a pleasant read.<br /><br />The story of youthful love, and the accompanying teenage angst told in the intimate tone of a personal diary makes for a cheerful book. And, just as well, because the book celebrates the life of Esther Grace who in real-life lived her days to the fullest even as the blighted clock ticked down cruelly.<br /><br />As a story that celebrates the victims' determination to fight and, in the limited time, leave behind a legacy that inspires others, the novel does indeed hit the mark.
0446541478|3.0|The book is an unabashed celebration of Israel`'s technical prowess, which the authors ascribe, to the hostile environment unique to the country.<br /><br />Quite early in the book the authors credit the Israel Defense Forces - IDF, and the unconventional war they are engaged in, for fostering this culture of innovation. The central premise of the book, worked over and over again, is that the IDF is forced to innovate to overcome the political and geographical constraints, and in doing so fosters creativity which, coupled with the extensive networking opportunities during the service, makes Israel a hot-house of creative talent.<br /><br />Having laid out the premise of IDF as an incubator of original ideas, the authors serve up numerous examples to support the proposition. Some of which are flawed!<br /><br />There is no doubt that the IDF has a far greater influence on the society compared to other armed forces, yet it is hard to imagine that any institution can single-handedly foster entrepreneurial talent a country of. Surely there are cultural and societal factors; for example a society tolerant of failures, that nurtures creativity. If one considers that serving in the army is a rite of passage for all male Israelis, the link between the IDF and their achievements latter in life, would appear marginal!<br /><br />On the whole the book is idolatry to the point that sections breach the line of objectivity and move into marketing territory. The description of how Paypal acquired fraud-detection software for example is different to how it is described in `Juice`. The description of replaceable-battery powered electric cars conceived by Better Place is another example.<br /><br />The book provides interesting insights into the culture of innovation in Israel, but neglects objectivity, and with it, loses some of its credibility. It is a bit like reading a biography that turns out be hagiography.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved the character development.  Environment and background were so influencial to both Will and Clark.  The changing mental state of both characters allowed the reader a depth of emotion rarely felt in novels.
B00493E1GI|5.0|How can anything with Julia Roberts be bad? It was a light movie that was adorable and would recommend it.
0375851569|5.0|they came very fast and in perfect condition. I am having a baby soon and these were all my favorite books as a kid can't wait to share them with my little one.
B004X2M9VY|3.0|good show but would like a better story line.  Would like to see if I like it after I watch again.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|This is my first Kindle book.  After seeing the movie Les Miserables (which was awful), all I wanted to know was why Fantine was shunned by her co-workers.  So, when I saw it was FREE, I thought, &#34;great&#34;!  Not so much.  I had trouble  getting to the beginning of the book.  If I don't swipe across pages correctly many pages or chapters go by and I can't find where I left off.  There are typographical errors - at least I think they're typos.  Not Kindle's fault, by I'm apparently not a fan of Victor Hugo's writing style, either.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed reading from each character's perspective. I would recommend this book to all my friends. It's unassuming and graphic detail kept me intrigued.
B000W9DTG6|2.0|First off, I have no problem with the movies or anything. They're great.<br /><br />The reason for the bad review is that they didn't send the box set that is pictured. I received all three movies in individual cases, that all fit into a cheap cardboard sleeve. It's ok, but not at all what I wanted/ordered.<br /><br />Also, the first disc is pretty scratched. I don't know if it'll play.<br /><br />Quite a poor job.
0345803485|5.0|I loved the book, I couldn't stop reading it once I started. It was really cheap and I loved how it was in or almost perfect condition. pages were fold a bit but besides that it looked practically new.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|cd is great quality and teen girl approved ..who ever else would dad need approval from...even dads should love it
B008GXHOFW|1.0|when i first saw this game i was like man this game is expensive so i waited. and when i saw that it was $0.99 i look how much space it need it and i saw it was 6.86 i think so i decide to buy it, and when i bought it it told me to download it and when i said ok i saw that it need it a lot of space like 648.22 mb i was surprise because on the appstore it said that it need it 6.86 mb. and when i download it all i started to play it and like 2 or 3 days later it wouldn't work and it was telling me that the game is not working, and i just waisted $0.99 on this stupid game that had bad graphic and alot of memory. so please don't wasted your money on a game that will not work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is on the edge of your seat. Couldn't put the book down even for a second just had to finish the chapter to see what happened next.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is awesome thanks gameloft what your selling I'm buying just like gta 5 stars all the way great game even worth 7$
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is the story of a girl, her beau and his buddy getting mixed up in stuff that only destroys.
B00C061I3K|4.0|What most reviews have already said already is certainly true... this is a departure for Daft Punk, something very different.  If you go in expecting a boom-chick-boom-chick album, then yeah you're definitely going to be disappointed.  Good news though, there are a billion other artists occupying that space right now so there is no shortage of twists on that formula to sample.<br /><br />That said, and I say this as someone who enjoys electronic music, I'm sort of glad they didn't go that route.  You have to be willing to give it a real chance, but this is a very interesting album to listen to.  To summarize it as a 70's tribute is, in my opinion, not giving the album enough credit... there is more to it than appears at first.  Listening to the samples isn't going to help with this one, unfortunately.  Its just not that kind of album.<br /><br />At first listen, its going to sound like some kind of... I don't know... adult contemporary music.  It can be off-putting, and trust me I'm not a fan of the type of music I thought this might be at first.  If you happen to be the type that enjoys, or even has an appreciation for, jazz / funk / and I guess disco (though I'd not describe myself as a disco fan, personally, nor do I go out of my way to listen to either jazz or funk), I encourage you to use your best quality music-listening setup, start the album at the beginning and just let it play.  The modern-ness of the album will become more obvious with a more critical listen, but you've got to put the cynicism aside and give it an honest shot.  If you listen to the whole thing going \\"OMG DISCO WTF\\", it'll be like yelling at a movie over the dialogue.  This is the first album I've listened to in a long time that seems to lend itself to being listened to as a whole, as opposed to a collection of songs.  At times I felt like I was almost watching a movie... it just kind of hooked me into listening.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I'm not familiar with hardly any of the supportingcast, but I will say that there is definitely some serious musicianship on display here.  Recording quality is excellent.  The guitars and percussion sound stand-out great.  The way the traditional instruments are integrated with synths and especially the synth-vocals is really something else, and is a great example of some talented people taking ideas from the past, integrating modern elements, and creating something unique that stands on its own.  I wouldn't say its a new genre of music, but then again I don't know that I've ever heard anything that sounds like it, either (If the EDM crowd really went for this album, they'd already have come up with a subgenre name for it.... funk-step maybe).<br /><br />Just let the album be what they intended it to be, and it might surprise you... I know I was.
B00C7O8MJ8|2.0|While the CD music is about what I expected (i.e., similar to first album), I was disappointed that there was no track info or album art included on this CD disk. It comes up on my player as Unknown Album, Unknown Artist, and No Track Titles. Amazon should have mentioned that this was obviously a \\"quick and dirty\\" compilation of MP3s, rather than a professionally produced CD. If all I wanted was MP3s, I would've bought MP3s rather than pay extra for a CD.
B0058SNIC6|5.0|This is a really nice, comfortable shoe.  I'm a women's shoe size 9.5.  I ordered a size 9, which juuuust fits.  In retrospect, I should have ordered a 10.  These aren't like the big, flat Crocs clogs.  These have a slimmer fit, though they will conform to your foot after some wearing.  I have bunions--not terrible ones, but I'd have done better with a 10.  I've been wearing my size 9s around the house with thick socks to stretch them out.  These are lightweight, very cushioned shoes.  If you need hardcore arch support, these may not be for you.  That said, I'm a teacher and I'm on my feet at least 6 solid hours a day.  These work great for me.  Some have commented that their feet sweat--I haven't had that problem, and it's sometimes upwards of 85 degrees in my classroom (no climate control in August and June!).  I think the nubs on the inside of the shoe help sweat evaporate, and the vents and slingback work for this as well.  But I don't have super-sweaty feet, either.  If you purchase black and you intend to wear them a lot, you should go to the Crocs website and order their polish, which is called &#34;Crocsbutter.&#34;  Unfortunately they don't sell it on Amazon right now. It literally makes the shoe look brand new--even after you wear them through the sand at the beach.  I've read that you can also use mineral oil for this purpose (don't put it on the bottoms, though!).  This is a sleek, very presentable shoe that doesn't require me to worry about a pedicure.  It's super-comfortable.  I'll probably end up buying another pair in size 10 when we can afford it.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|This is a great surprise! We are back to classic Le Carre. Great suspence and very brittish. I can really recommend this novel.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|loved watching the movie. Great for the whole family!! when in doubt rent this movie you wont be sorry that you did.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is a very good book and so much love and hatred.the mockjay is a very unique girl and Peta is loving
0316223239|5.0|WOW.  I read this (purely by random accident) right as that girl in Cleveland was found with her daughter... just gave me another reason to feel for her.  So well researched.  Amazing to think what this real person had to go through also with a child.  So sad.  But don't make this stop you from reading it.  I loved her for doing what she did for her son.  Only people with amazing imaginations and amazing writing skills can make you feel this way.  And that is the kind of book I love, one that puts me in the characters shoes wondering what would I have done if in the same horrific situation... I love a book you think about for days after you read it.  Thank you!
B000FA675C|5.0|This novel grabs your attention at the beginning and keeps it through the entire book. It made me refer to an encyclopedia constantly to look up interesting historical data, and I feel that I came away from it with more than I expected. Block off the time to read it in one sitting (if you can) because it'll get stuck in your head until you finish it! Full of art references, historical references, and travel scenery, it is one of the best books I have ever read.
B00C7D5XLE|5.0|At a time when popular rock music was dominated by Seattle grunge, Blind Melon expanded the envelope with a record that kept all of the same raw emotion, but blended in a package that was richly layered and relentlessly up-tempo.  The first single from the album, No Rain, was a catchy tune, but it didn't do justice to the complexity and brilliant playing to be heard on the rest of the tracks.  I listened to this record in heavy rotation for most of the decade, and it continued to give me new things to hear.<br /><br />Shannon Hoon's star was extinguished too early, but it shone so brightly that the loss eclipses those of even Cobain, Staley, & Wood.<br /><br />&#34;I only wanted to be sixteen...  and free...&#34;
B000TDGGRY|4.0|Loved the book. It encompassed so many interesting avenues. Held me from start to finish. Adventure, history, biology, ancient ruins, angles and pirates it is so much more then good verses evil.
B009X01C64|5.0|I have been using this case for my Kindle Fire for weeks now and have been very satisfied . It has proven to be exactly as advertised and has met all my expectations. It was very easy to install and the feature to prop it up either vertically or horizontally works great. I highly recommend this for Kindle owners.
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|Can't handle how good this is.  Every song is amaze!  I was raving so much about it at work all the girls bought it!  There is a little something on here for everyone!
B0098VXN2Y|4.0|My husband actually picked this one out for our movie night and he laughed even more than I did.  I really liked how they showed so many different angles on pregnancy and becoming a mother... a miscarriage, an adoption, a &#34;perfect pregnancy & delivery&#34;, a horrid pregnancy, and a c-section.  Great job showing that all pregnancies are not the same and there isn't one &#34;RIGHT&#34; way to get a baby.
B000N2HCKQ|4.0|I think this book is well written and reinforces the key points through concrete examples which is useful. I recommend it to anyone who is writing articles or even reports.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I love almost every song on this album and I think it was a great price. I still listen to my Lady GaGa songs to this day.
B008KYWN2Q|5.0|Have had great luck with Croc flats and wear them a lot.  Comfortable, cool and look better than tennis shoes for casual dinner/lunch out.  Will continue to order and would recommend as long as someone knows their size.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is Dawson got to the next generation of a hamburger the got a you love it was a hamburger the chipmunks to go to the next few days ago found&middot;
B007THA4FI|2.0|Dark and depressing. If you're looking for the characters and magic of the Harry Potter books, you will not find it here.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read this book it changed my life and i guarrente it will do the same to yours peace out yeah
B0058D77S2|1.0|I purchased the Hd version and the entire move was grainy and kept pausing to buffer every ten minutes or so. had so many issues that i didn't even finish the movie.
B00002DE4E|5.0|If you're just getting into joy division don't start with closer start with unkown pleasures but if u loved unknown pleasures like I do closer is a great next step that takes you a little deeper into the mind of Ian Curtis
1451627297|4.0|First of all, I have read most of King's books, and enjoyed each one for various reasons. This one is no exception, though I didn't care for it as much as I have others he's written. The romance concept left me cold, I'm afraid, but that's just me. There are several flaws, beginning with the idea that this modern 35 year old seems to have an unlikely knowledge of fifties and sixties rock and roll (he recognizes Doug Sahm and Sir Douglas Quintet by sound alone). During the wedding party he attends for a couple of friends, the bride brags that she hired a great new band who can play Louie, Louie (Sir Douglas Quintet)! What? In 1961? The song didn't become a hit until the year Kennedy was assassinated....1963. Having said all that, I did like the book...and if I ever had any idea of changing history through time travel, this book would cast some serious doubts in my mind.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|GREAT show and GREAT conventions. All of the actors in the show are outstanding, friendly and funny.  After going to a couple of their conventions I have re-watched all the seasons and like them even better than the first time around.  If you have a chance to go to one of their conventions you really should check it out. Even if you've never seen an episode it's a great time. Season 8 is a really good season. They just keep getting better.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is awesome. It has adventure and thrills. You can become iron man and collect stark credits. You should buy this game.
B0099LDUFI|4.0|I've enjoyed pink's music over the years. This carries a bit of her old style along with a deviation on some of her songs to something more progressive. I love the collaboration with Nate Ruess, they have a good sound together for that song.
B009ZFPQOQ|1.0|First and most critical this is a social network and GPS combination, So basically its like playing with Facebook while you're driving---very dangerous. And your info is only as good as the next person on the highway.<br /> Second, this app is a battery hog. My Defy XT normally gets charged once a day and can run 36 hours. This app empyied it in less than 90 minutes on the road, so have your car chargers ready, you'll need them.<br /> That being said I kind of like this app and if you have another person with you and you have it plugged into a car charger I would probably use it, but it's not worth keeping on my phone just for those times. I'm uninstalling it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I 've been looking forward to getting this Led Zep DVD for sometime, exteremely pleased! Very nice service, my delivery came well within set time frame, contents were protected and well packaged. A really great value: as described both DVD's were in excellent shape, and in the original packaging, along with all misc. material inserts.<br />I am very pleased, thank you!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I would say that this is the best app/game I have on my Kindle so far! I have at least 20 apps and this is by far THE BEST! This game is VERY SIMPLE TO WORK which is good. Also, it is VERY ADDICTIVE. It is also a VERY FUN game and is great for when you need something to do. You will easily get addicted and will want to beat each level, just like me. The only minor problem is the level difficulty. The first and second levels are very easy, but with each level, it gets pretty difficult. Unless you are a pro, you will probably spend at least 2 minutes on each level. But I enjoy the challenge. And if you also enjoy challenges, you will like this game. Plus, it is free! What else could you ask for in a game? I guarantee you will like this just like everyone else did! :)
0375714839|5.0|Persepolis takes you into the life of a young Iranian woman growing up in both Iran and Europe in the 1980's and tales of her struggle for independence and just trying to find her place in the world
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I will admit that I am a newbie to the Game of Thrones series and I watched the first season and was disappointed and thrilled at the same time. When I found out that it was a book series I wanted to read it and be a part of the in club. I had too read this twice to see if it moved me enough to spend the money for the other books in this series, gladly it did and if you enjoy political intrigue, fantasy, and great character development. Then this is a book for you, even if you have to read it twice.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|If you mixed the best aspects of &#34;Twilight&#34; with &#34;Pride and Prejudice.&#34; It was a great book with lots of depth. Full of adventure with a dark and mysterious man to boot.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I think even though it's about kinky sex it feels kind of monotonous. Would be more interesting to explore Grey's psyche.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|To tell ya the truth it would have taken quite a bit to turn me off of this series. Oh it can be done (I am looking at you star wars episode one). There is a lot to like. You are dropped right back into an amazing world. Beuatiful landscapes, fun characters, and amazing special effects make you want to stay. Of course gollum was great.<br />There are many things that could be critiqued. I won't get tedious. If I were to pick one things about this film that didn't quite jive I would say it was that the film didn't quite know what it was. It is a children's book set in the same world we all know from the Lord of the Rings. So there are moments where we get the silly humor, but it is hard to forget how serious Jackson is trying to make it as well. Not a big deal but somewhere down the road the decision on how we are going to see this story is going to have to be made.
1400067820|5.0|1. every page was interesting. 2. I wasn't in a hurry to finish. 3. I'll remember things I've read in Antifragile for the rest of my life. 4. I now want to read The Black Swan. 5. I will certainly buy any future book Nasim Taleb writes
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Sure you could probably like the dad if you don't mind that he is a mindless buffoon. And some might find the sons funny, however, I just saw them as a waste of space and I think they actually confused my daughter. There is almost something redeeming about the mother/daughter relationship off and on. It gets pretty muddy and the resolution is a none event.
B0000027F3|5.0|Theres enough reviews on this album, that expresses many opinions on it. If you do not own it, most certainly buy it now! As it is *my personal favorite album ever*, one of the best metal albums ever made. You take away metal meltdown, and this album is absolutely perfect. It is more technical, more emotional, and more mechanical than any Metallica, Iron Maiden, or any metal album out there. It'll take a few listens to really get why is it all those things. Easily a replayable album.<br /><br />Now, theres a major problem, especially in the U.S. In 2001, Jon Astley remastered all the older Priest albums. Problem is, the majority of them didn't need remastering to begin with. But the so called 'remastered' cd is awful! It is so clipped and compressed. None of the highs are natural. The lows now show more bass guitar and overpower the drums, instead of the perfection of the original albums mix. It sounds awful! Now the 2010 Japanese Remaster is pretty good. Some improvements of the original, but even it has a few issues.<br /><br />Even the 2010 vinyl release has the 2001 'remaster', and sounds HORRIBLE! Going back and finding a seller that actually has the original cd release, and listening to it was an absolute joy. Extremely tight bass. Natural and pleasent highs, mostly from the drums CRASH! The 'living bad dreams' extra track is a pretty good song from the 'remaster' cd, so I'd reccomend buying it seperately. Doesn't quite fit the album, sounds more like a ram it down song, but its good.<br /><br />One of the best albums ever made, just make sure you buy the best version. This is not an opinion, its just simple fact. And the original cd release is the one to get!!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I really liked this movie and so did my daughter but both for different reasons. That is what amazes me about this movie. They didn't have to use sexual humor that will supposedly go over the head of younger kids to suck in the adults. No they owned you emotionally. And if you aren't moved by the opening montage then you just might be dead inside. But seriously, using emotion tied to a time in life to hit different audiences was brilliant.
B00C1C09MO|5.0|Just as funny as the first one. I feel this is a good 'family' movie, something for everyone to enjoy!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I might even read the books if I can find them on sale. This is not the next great alien movie. Nor is it real memorable, but it is fun. I don't regret spending the money or the time to watch this.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|LOVE this show.. a little slow to get going but give it 2 episodes and you're gonna be hooked. Claire Danes is great as Carrie
B001LM1456|4.0|It wasn't disappointing to me. I don't expect dramatic depth from a movie about a giant green rage monster. A little suspense and lots of smashing. It was great at what it does. Now this isn't a creation story and I think that can be disappointing since a great hulk creation story has yet to be made. With as many really bad super hero movies as there are out there I am happy to say this isn't one of them.
B008M0TMXQ|4.0|Read the reviews that said it runs large, but it seemed true to size to me as I normally wear an 8 1/2.
B00622B3MY|3.0|I was disappointed. I am sure there are a lot of both positive and negative feelings towards this movie. For me the negative is really in the let down that this movie is following up the original Cars. Pixar had done an amazing thing with the first Cars movie. They had created a world and a story line that was almost universally age appropriate. Now I know that is debatable and that is why I say almost. No super evil villain, no real violence, romantic relationships handled tastefully, but that was the the first movie. Not all of that can be said of Cars 2. Cars 2 wasn't all bad it just wasn't Cars.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I do not find it original, some songs not good enough, orchestration &#34;Kitsch&#34;<br />only 2 songs I did like! Very disappointing and worst CD so far by Buble.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Terrific Movie, first few minutes it is a bit slow but it does setup what is about to start, hang-on as this is a fast pace movie, with great actors.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|if you're patriotic then chances are you're going to like this movie... it's so good and i've watched 5 times already
B008220C38|5.0|I am a Keira Knightley fan and especially enjoy seeing her in period pieces.  I think this movie is a work of art!  It a completely unique format that I have personally never seen, the cross between play and movie might jump out at you at first, but it's visually so appealing that it adds to the picture, and you actually don't notice it as much once your 5 minutes into the movie!  It's a really beautiful and tragic love story, but I think even though the actors are not given the time to develop the characters that Tolstoy had with the book, each of them really got to the soul of the character very quickly so that I did not feel like any of the characters were 2 dimentional.  Although my choices may not have been the same, I still find all of the characters sympathetic and wished for a happy ending even though we know that's not what we get.  Beautiful, beautiful movie!
B004WGIXX4|3.0|personally I thought the movie was ok. I just like the movie with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis better (friends with benefits)
B007CKNX28|5.0|I love everything Jack White does.  This was given to me as a gift by my husband and it was a great one.  I enjoy every song and really appreciate the length's that Jack White goes to in order to give us something authentic and original!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would recommend this book for anyone 21 & older!! I loved this book I wish there were more book!! It was such a great book words can't describe it you are just gonna have to read it!!! Take my word for it and read it!! I think I am going to re-read the whole series again!! :) I'm soooooooo glad I read this whole series such a great series!!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This was a good story, and kept my attention. I could not put my kindle down! I can't wait to start another story.
B009JZTP4Y|3.0|Now seems slow, but good special features considering when it was made.  Made more enjoyable when watched in context of new star treck movies.
B009G78EE2|5.0|this is a real great album that touches on a lot of subjects,  it will be hard for him to repeat this great work i love every song on the album
B00915G6WQ|5.0|We watch Dexter again and again. It doesn't matter which season you get, you will enjoy the great characters, actors, and very creative writing. The next season will be it's last and we will be sad to see Dexter end.
B008602KQI|4.0|Action packed and gruesome, similar to the novel.  Such a tragic tale. Missing some of the desperation felt while reading the book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is very user friendly and helpful. I tried install the other remote pc app such as i***** but none has worked. This app works like charm and requires no effort to set it up.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great app. I have used it frequently with most of the different options (local, cloud, network) and it has worked flawlessly with file management.  I have not used it for ftp.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars is tied for my favourite film saga of all time, along side Lord of the Rings. As every set of movies, it does have a few rough moments but overall it is absolutely spectacular. I may be in the minority here, but other than Solo shooting at the same time as Greedo, I actually enjoy all the changes/edits they've made. The audio and video are spectacular and Episode 4-6 have never looked better.
B005H29GSI|4.0|My kids are 2 and 4 and they just love playing with the blocks and birds. The launcher and cards they could care less about.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Loved it from start to finish. I am aquainted with the old series and my wife is not yet we both really enjoyed this one.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|It's so rare to find a show that strikes the balance between horrifying and thoroughly intriguing so very well. The special effects are realistic in the extreme but the entire show is written so well that the horror aspect is only one small component of the entire picture.<br /><br />Dr. Lector's fascination with Will from the get-go is creepy and oddly loving all at the same time. So well acted and subtle by Mads Mikkelsen you can actually almost feel Dr. Lector's genuine respect/caring (?) for Will as time goes on.<br /><br />Will's slow build up of trust in Dr. Lector is also superbly acted. The inevitable build up and subsequent breaking down of Will is so very carefully and methodically portrayed by Hugh Dancy, you can truly believe in his neurosis.<br /><br />The script writing is tight, elegant, and infinitely interesting and the acting of the entire cast is engaging and has you interested even in the smallest characters.<br /><br />If you loved the books, you'll love this show!
B008B3MZMY|5.0|I've always enjoyed this album and being able to see a concert from this perspective is really nice.  Excellent sound and video.
B009LXECF6|5.0|What can I say, it's Bruno Mars. He is such a great singer, songwriter and entertainer. I would definitely buy his future CDs.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Pretty cool game.<br />Been on some kindle games that suck. This one is easy to follow. And fun to keep going with.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Engrossing and enjoyable. Loved every minute of it. I wasn't bored for a moment and can't wait for the next chapter.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Perfect ending to a perfect series.  I will miss you Sookie! Thanks to Charlaine for the friend and many hours of delightful reading!!!
B00B2166BS|5.0|I have found this cable easy to use and performs the charging job admirably. With the case on the tablet it is somewhat difficult to attach.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Movie was good. I wouldn't say it is great but It has a good story line. Recommend for weekend afternoon.
B00BFV1K0M|5.0|I've read Hunger Games and enjoyed it so much I started reading Catching Fire straight away.  Well written and totally absorbing.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun and somewhat educational.  I quite enjoy creating my own little world.  I highly recommend this app to any one. Get it
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I never loved Star Trek but I loved this movie. This a must see for new and old fans alike!
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|I really like the mobile app, on my MID tablet.<br /><br />It works faster on slow internet connection that I have on the train.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Absolutely loved it.  Much more than expected, beautifully written, adventurous, you are there.  Forget expectations!  Just take the journey, enjoy!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Was kind of like 50 shades but Cross was less of an jerk I think.. I can't wait for then next book!
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|The key to all of Apotow's hit movies is ability to find the perfect cast  members to make a good work into a piece of art.<br />&#34;This is 40&#34; proves his genius in this regard as the young kids,the moms,Melissa McCarthy,the therapist etc etc ect  are all brilliant performers in their own right.<br />You will wait many moons to see a more entertaining movie than this one<br />Cannot wait for the sequel
B00BETX5PS|3.0|It just wasn't as good as I heard or thought it would be. It just seemed predictable. I am a fan of the Bond movies and this was was a let down.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|My kids could hardly wait until it came out on DVD. We don't live anywhere near a movie theater and wasn't planning on making a special trip to town (200 miles one way) to see it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|On a trip to Europe a couple years ago I found this game (or a very similar version) on the seat-back TV in front of me. As I had watched all the movies that interested me and since I cannot sleep on an airplane, I needed a diversion. This game kept me going for hours and it continues to be interesting and challenging. Love it!
B00023B1LC|5.0|An outstanding video. As a matter of fact I hav purchased the entire series and found them to be 5 stars in every instance.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Recently we were traveling from Council Bluffs back to Dayton. The tornado had hit Moore, Oklahoma, just a couple hours before we arrived at our stop-over motel in Peoria, Illinois, and the skies overhead were about to let loose. The TV was shouting that there was a tornado watch and they were showing the counties affected. Now let me ask, who knows what county your are in when you are traveling? I popped out the Kindle Fire and accessed the Weather Channel app and typed in &#34;Peoria, Ill&#34; and up came the forecast, the map, the warnings, everything. Just then the skies opened up with a tremendous thunder and lightning display and ominous dark clouds. We kept our clothes on just in case we had to make a run for it but all turned out okay. Thank you &#34;Weather Channel&#34; app.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Different and fun game.  Challenging at times but keeps you coming back,  must.....free dungeon dude.  I would recommend to anyone.
B000UZQIDS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book...I've always found Austen a bit too dry and was reluctant to try fan fiction (in general) but reading this has made Austen's feel less dry although I reread this much more regularly! I feel that she gave Mr. Knightley's voice very true, or at least close enough that it didn't bother me.  She took some liberties with other characters but as I prefer happy endings I have no complaints and felt those story lines were rather seamlessly woven in as well.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great fun, I enjoy that I can rearrange where I've placed my plants, plus earning the points and pearls to acquire more.  I would recommend this to any age, both young and older alike.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Barely lasted the first hour.since it was nominated for awards I didn't read any reviews. We should have found something else to do with that hour. Slow and boring at best.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I felt like I was in a rat maze working  for cheese. Learn clues and developing the skills needed to get my reward. I'll buy again for sure!
B000I3UMKM|5.0|Excellent classic movie. Great story, great roles, really an enjoyable way to spend an evening. Love Audrey Hepburn in this.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|He HOT HOT and seams to be a real person unlike some other singers happy for he and his wife expecting there 1st child and love his music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Pretty fun and interesting game for a regular dungeon crawler. And don't need any permission at all. Good for kids and adults. Try it and you like it.
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|I loved this movie but sometimes the picture quality would get pixelated which would make the screen fuzzy and then it would go back to normal.
1936608898|5.0|I never thought I'd ever be reading a book like this....didn't think it would hold my interest for more than 30 seconds....BUT it is quite an enjoyable read...easy and to the point...fun and quirky....it all makes complete sense and presented in a way that it will hold your interest and make you want to keep reading to change your life. BUY IT!!!
B004Q0SQ24|3.0|This product is okay, but is mostly plastic and not wooden.  I was disappointed because we have many Thomas wooden trains that are all wooden and I thought these would be the same.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|No one else but Peter Falk could have played the crafty detectives.<br />Creative plots with loads of stars.<br />Be ready to enjoy several bowls of popcorn with the MANY hours of viewing material.
B004Q0R7FG|3.0|This product is okay, but is mostly plastic and not wooden.  I was disappointed because we have many Thomas wooden trains that are all wooden and I thought these would be the same.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This movie is very well done. Although it is not a Hayao Miyazaki movie, it is made by his son. You can feel how it is similar to Miyazaki's films. It just doesn't have the fantasy elements that most Miyazaki films have. Instead its more of a slice of life, laid back movie like Whisper of the Heart. Which I really enjoyed. So even though its not like watching something like Spirited away or Howl's moving castle, it is sweet and very well done. if you are a fan of Studio Ghibli's work, this is a great movie to watch.  I highly suggest you check it out! It will surprise you in a good way!
B004HHKFIY|3.0|This product is okay, but is mostly plastic and not wooden.  I was disappointed because we have many Thomas wooden trains that are all wooden and I thought these would be the same.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game rocks the story is okay but multiplayer is the bomb love it gameloft keep up the good work
1607066017|5.0|The title says it all - this is a great graphic novel.  Reminiscent of early Neil Gaiman, it offers an interesting story and a unique setting.  It is strange, compelling, and weirdly uplifting.  I'm eager to read more.<br /><br />Note: The content warning is no joke.  This graphic novel gets rather... graphic.  Pun intended.
B006YC74E8|5.0|WOW! This is an awesome app...granted I don't know alot about photo editing but really for being a free app it's great even If this app costed money I would have still bought it!
1401940676|5.0|it's everything that we know about spirit and the after life, i enjoy her experience from her angle of her life
B0086700CM|5.0|A bit sensitive but who cares its great!!I mean who wouldn't want it?When ever I am angry I just play this game and it cools me off.
B008Y768XO|5.0|very lovely history of fidelity. Good for any age. Dog history.<br />family, dog movie, tale about a dog, lovely dog
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.I own three horses.You should honestly get this game is you want a horse but cant have one
B003ELKNH2|5.0|this movie brings back alot of memories. i saw this when i was young and you know how sometimes you watch a movie again later in years and there just isn't the same vibe. not true for this movie, it was great when i was younger and just as great twenty some years later..highly recomend this video....
B004GYY714|5.0|Travel across the globe with TuneIn. Awesome produce and the content from the 70,000 stations all over the world is just incredible. Trending function allows you to put your finger on the pulse of what the world is listening to in real time.
1616551151|5.0|If you want I learn more about the world of dragon age than this is the book for u. It has just about everything. Great art. Even has a awesome timeline the runs the length of the book to help ya out.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Been using the paper kind for many years and I did not know it was on the Kindle App store and nice that it is free.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Its a great action-adventure game for the kindle fire and its even better if your a fan of Iron Man. My only problem is the glitches that occur occasionally, making it very hard to steer and operate the game.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|I haven't watched the one I purchased but did go to see this at the movies.  I'm a superhero fan!  I have to have them all.  This was pretty good - well done and presented.  However, I hope that Mr. Reynolds will continue in this role.  I know he's gotten pretty big but hopefully not so much that he abondons us in this role.  Story line was done well - the 'relationship on hold until I get a handle on this thing I'm destined to do' was well handled.  Made we want more and gave me hope there would be.  Overall for a minor superhero I can see a lot of possibilities.  Having not followed the comics as I might have when I was young, I'm excited to see how they take this forward.  Good job!
B005UDD1R6|2.0|For something as simple as a music player, and storage, this app has allot of systematic and structural flaws. I would not download until these are fixed, due to the effect it has on the kindle fuego's operating speed. Yes I meant to say fuego...odelay!
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Ok - I didn't think he had it in him but WOW! If you've seen one, you've pretty much seen them all but I'm still trying to figure out how they keep it going and so interesting and action filled - WOW!  When Wills says - I ran out of bullets (I think that's right - but if not, very close to it) I almost died!  The people behind the scene did not disappoint and neither (as if he ever good) did Mr. Willis.  And he's gone on to do another one after this!  WOW!  When will it end?  We know it must because of aging but I'll be watching until the last one.
B003N7ORNI|4.0|i loved everything about this book exept his ending.<br />they leave everything open-ended (i won't say more, i dont want to give any spoilers).
B003L20IJM|4.0|very well done!  I liked the 1st one so I decided to purchase this since I had not seen it on TV.  I viewed it and it was not as good but what can you do with the subject matter.  Acting was well done in my opinion.  I was glad they didn't tell the same old story the same old way.  They changed it around.  Then at the end reviling who the old lady was is a good touch.  It tied everything together nicely.  Made me wonder if it was not planned before the 1st book was completed that the 2nd would work out this way.  Not a big deal but something to consider.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Truly engrossing.  My only qualm is that there is not a ready source for all the intricate history that is given. I do so love this series and can't wait for more.
B0000549B0|5.0|This movie I've seen many many times throughout the years and I had to have it for my collection.  Finally got down to a price I could justify/aford.  So glad I keep up with it on my 'save for later' list.  5 stars is not good enough for this classic.  It rates right up there with 'Arsenic and Old Lace'.  As always those final scenes where James Stewart speaks to Harvey and we actualy see a shadow of a large rabbit really was a good twist.  Never read the book but can't see how that would have been protrayed in the book so I'm thinking it was a directorial decision.  Great!  I also was glad for the actual name and definition that they gave.  It added body to an otherwise only described howbeit 'imiginary' character who was very much the co-star in this movie.  And yes, his sister is great - she also is in Arsenic... - another great proformance for her.<br />Really good classic feel good movie.
B00CFOXBX2|5.0|I personally enjoyed this film and was drawn to it due the cast. It has enough twins and turns to keep you interested, but not enough to be really confusing. Excellent movie.
B008745B32|3.0|This is a book that I've heard so much about - so many good things.  No doubt it was a book for lots of thought and introspection but as far as the actual writing and subject matter, I was not impressed.  Maybe it's just not my style of writing.  But I stuck with it and read it word for word through to the end.  Taking lots of time to think about the issues but still can't give it 5 stars.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book taught a lot of lessons that some people need to learn in their heart. All kids should read this book<br />- Luke age 8
B005HJWWW8|4.0|It's actually pretty good for the price.  A word of advice though, if you try anything higher, like the E17, you'll never want to go back to this again.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|One of the best TV series ever produced, and getting to watch the episodes whenever you want, well that's awesome.  Still manages to be timely even a couple of presidential terms after it was originally made.
0553386794|5.0|Bought this for my grandson who has read every one<br />in the series.  He could hardly put it down and said it<br />might be the best one yet.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|There are more messages in Groundhog Day than the immediate or cursory glance affords. There are philosophical, religious and the obvious comical message present if one chooses to look. What would you do if you had the gift of immortality coupled with the conundrum of having to discover the reason you were selected for this dubious honor? That is what our hero has to cope with. In addition he can't refuse the gift and doesn't, at first, understand who, what, why or how this is even possible. He has to livd the same day, go through the same situations and see the same people until he answers those questions. I love this type of puzzle!
0743243153|5.0|I purchased this copy for my twenty something nephew who is an artist and quite a thinker.  I became aware of it when it was referred to me years ago when it wasupon its first publication.  I was immediately hooked on anything M. Scott Peck wrote and went on to even attend two of his Community Buidling  Workshops as put forth in his book, A DRIFFERENT DRUM.  (Oh, dear, I think it was A DIFFERENT DRUM.)  Anyway, his writings and the workshops helped make me who I am today.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I like QT movies.  New take on westerns.  I liked the soundtrack.<br />The only thing I didn't like was that the wife didn't get to say much.<br />Didn't get her side of the story--just Jamie Foxx.<br />Get the popcorn & watch.  Entertaining.
B000QK7YQ2|1.0|This Is an old 70's film. Enough said. Why does Amazon want you to write a novel just to rate a stupid film?
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|One mark of a great film is that it keeps the minds of the audience engaged beyond the length of the film. Silver Linings Playbook has not let go of me, even days or weeks after first seeing it. Would highly recommend.
B006OITIQE|4.0|Keep a winning formula going back to back. They don't do much but pace on stage like rejects from an Abbiecrombie & Fitch runway show.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app, I get to talk to my best friend, who lives in Sweden, on here. Add me if you want to talk! Just plz no creepers, weirdos or dinosaurs...Pandabell 171
B00A03WBVI|4.0|Being a huge Take That fan, I approach the turnstile arrival of British boy bands with suspect. Just like Take That, One Direction are a creation of someone sensing an opportunity in the marketplace. One Direction don't dance. Save for the Kennedy-esque Harry Styles, none of the members turn my head. But their harmonies are undeniable. Take That has an ingrown songwriter in Gary Barlow. Don't know if anyone of Directioners have that talent waiting to blossom. The songs are fun and age appropriate. The fact that they have broken through in the states while Take That came close is another plus for the guys. From Il Divo to One Direction, Simon Cowell builds on his brand. Never forget his brilliant pairing of Diana Ross with Westlife. Is this real? What is real? Take it home and decide for yourself.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Absolutely love it! A fantastic journey... an exploration of the human experience across time, space, and dimensions! The actors did an amazing job playing multiple roles. I highly recommend it!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I would recommend this book as an ideal holiday read. It's not too demanding and, once you get engrossed in it, you will stay with it to the end. Unfortunately I really didn't like the main two characters. They are both thoroughly unpleasant. You can get this book covered in suncream and sand and once you have finished it you definitely won't bother bringing it home. But you will finish it, just to find out what happens and how the author will resolve the convoluted plot.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This accounting, written by a physician neurosurgeon, who thought he knew the brain fully, will challenge conventional thinking. Depending upon your bent, you will either say, \\"See, I told you so,\\" or \\"Hmmmm, I wonder...\\" A spellbinding interweaving of medical and mystical, very well-written. I could not put it down.
0143119680|5.0|This is a great and engaging story for reading enjoyment!  Well crafted characters and excellent historical interweaving. I found this book great fun!
B00821OX98|5.0|Could not stop watching. Used prime and watched several episodes at a time. Would recommend to any one who likes sci-fi or apocalyptic shows.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I am not a Tom Cruise fan at all so I was hesitant to buy this movie. I was, however,  pleasantly surprised with this movie. It was a smart, reasonably fast-paced thriller that I've actually already watched twice.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|As usual, Michael Pollan is lucid, diligent and entertaining.  Tons of information and a joy to read.  I highly recommend it.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Easy setup, has never failed me yet. Price is low for all the extras.  Love all the options. Definitely recommend!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|i like to keep things simple.. and it doesn't get any simpler..  get this app!... this is an excellent calculator and its free!!
1591840562|5.0|having read a summary of ART OF THE START prior to my purchase...IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. Very practical, easy to read and entertaining, Kawasaki: BRAVO!<br /><br />Yaffa Licari
B008QLXSG8|2.0|I have been working through some of the classics and this was on the list.  At first the writing style is very staccato and short and hard to work through, but it finally loosens up as the book continues.  The story is somewhat interesting but the character is so aloof and experiential that he is hard to relate to.  He doesn't seem to care about anything, and he focuses on momentary discomforts like being to hot over a serious situation that may be occurring like a funeral or his own murder trail.  What is created is an antihero that is hard to relate to and really doesn't make any sense, and the story makes little sense either.  Also, it is never brought up in the trial that the man he shot had a weapon.  This fact would at least make a case for self defense.  In the end the character does stick to his persona of one who lives in the moment, but readers are left with hopeless and pointless themes.
B0013V33DG|1.0|Florez's singing and the orchestra are the only redeeming features of this monumentally wretched production. Dessay is at her very, very worst - moronic tic-ridden acting, and the voice is sadly in complete congruence with it. The gaping photo of her on the cover says it all. I have rarely hated a production or singer's work so much, and I am extremely fond of the opera.  This does Donizetti's deceptively light score (which is actually brilliantly crafted, with perhaps his best overture) a criminal disservice.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is a very good game. I wish it was a little longer cause I wanted to play it more, but at least a second part is going to be coming out apparently. I'll probably buy it if it's longer or cheaper.
1601251556|4.0|This is great for drawing quick maps and setting up positions for your games. It wipes off very easily and folds up conveniently. The only issue is the creases between the folds make it so this won't always lay flat. I use paper minis, so they can start sliding around. For the money it's a pretty good buy, though.
0767903862|5.0|If you are travelling 'Down Under' this book is a must.  Bryson tells an informative story with a great sense of humor.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|Dont buy it i love it its horrible but get it its worth it im serious stay away from this app but its amazing
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I love Tolkien's work and I always love Peter Jackson's adaptations of his stories.  I enjoy how he is using license to fill in the gaps left in the Dol Goldur story.  I do wish Radaghast was more than a comic relief but I suppose he needs to keep the non Tolkien fans involved in the movie also.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great way to pass time and exercise my brain.  Fun and challenging. My kiddos love it as well. No downside unless you count  habit forming.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Glad to see Arnold return in his first starring role after his break.  Arnold is always awesome and I liked the way the director does old school action including Matchbox demolition derby style car scenes.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Its a good game but may get repetitive and boring for some after a time still its fun for a while
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ok, I'm not a young adult, but you don't have to be to read this series. A strong female role thrust into life saving and changing choices, made with bravery and tenderness. The fantastical world of Panem just kept me wanting more. I started readingat 12, the Hobbit, I couldn't put it down, like an addict ive serched for that first thrill, this is it, so many years later.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Not exactly the perfect role for Natalie Portman.  But, overall the movie was ok.  A little drawn out where it didn't need to be.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome<br />It is really fun. I like how easy the controls and gameplay is. The graphics are fun and create. All around well done.
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|I decided to watch when I heard about the Broadway play.. Really cute movie.  Enjoyed the character development and the shoes!  hahah
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Most beautiful game I've played so far.  It's not like one of those mental hospitals that's depressing, it's not overly demonic in undertone.  It's just fun and so pretty!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Can't wait for the next episode to start. It will be a long summer. Castle always keeps you guessing to the end of the show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awesome I love this game you can do so much stuff on here after you get this go creative first male your own seed find out the secrets of the map and then own it in survival mode. I've found out things like the map SkythekidRS has NO water.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|this is a good movie if your a fan of tim burton dark and moody like a old horror movie with batman throwin into the mix great just my opinion.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All the story mix that includes so many people is always interesting.  Whomever wrote this wasn't afraid of reaching out with different lifestyles.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This movie had my attention since I originally saw the trailers and it did not disapoint. It was full of great shots and the feeling of dread, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good scare!
B00AEFXL5W|5.0|Always a favorite movie, and so nice to have in Blu Ray. Enjoyed the extras as well. The only thing I don't like about this movie is Mickey Rooney playing an Asian character (seriously, use a real Asian person!), but the director explains that at least a bit in the extras. This movie never goes out of date!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Was surprised how good this story was with unexpected twists and turns.  Bring it to the beach and enjoy, you won't be sorry
B0063IH60K|4.0|It keeps me interested when I don't have anything to do, and if I'm tired of reading for that day.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|By itself, this movie is great.. Awesome visuals, good acting, great mix of drama and action.<br /><br />As a &#34;Trekie&#34;, what made this movie even better was they way the reboot was done. The writers decide to do a reboot of the serious while not disregarding any of the original movies! Masterfull
193700788X|4.0|I want to begin by saying that everyone has been a bit hard on Harris and her final installment of the Sookie series. I absolutely expected from page 1 who she would end up with (I'm going to keep this as spoiler free as possible) because there was no other logical choice. And besides, Harris has built a character who is fiercely strong willed and independent, which means that to tie her to any man at the novel's end would have been a cop-out. The ending is still left open for Sookie and the point is that she IS going to be ok--no matter what.<br /><br />Also, true to her character, Sookie would never be 'turned' into a vampire. If Harris did that, it would have been a gross and disappointing deviation from the character she worked so hard to build. So, guess what? She and Eric can't be together forever--you should see this coming a mile away if you are at all invested in these characters. Same with Eric--if you KNOW ERIC AT ALL, you would not be surprised to be reminded that at his core, he is cold and calculating--and acts accordingly. He loves Sookie, but he has a far greater existence than just her. I disagree with the reviewer who said that Harris 'assasinates' his character.<br /><br />As far as the actual events of the book, I was a tiny bit bored and couldn't really invest. The book is clearly more about the wrap up of the characters and their relationships with Sookie. As I sit here to write this, I can't remember what actually happened (indicating that I didn't really care much), but was entertained nonetheless, as I always am by Harris.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I enjoy hidden object games and this one is okay to pass the time. The hidden objects become very predictable and it's a cinch to remember where they're located. It's frustrating to have to wait for the energy bar to recharge. Some of the time my bar does not recharge at all, even if hours have past.  To enter some of the rooms you have to have a certain number of a particular item to explore. If you do not buy diamonds it takes a long time to acquire these objects. Therefore if you are unwilling to pay out-of-pocket to play this free game, then it will take quite a bit of time.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone in the world should watch this video.  I love it is NOT the phrase I would use to describe this dvd.  That was Amazon attaching the phrase to 5 stars.  Very important dvd.  I'm a vegetarian, if I weren't, after watching this dvd--I would be a vegetarian.  The content needs to be raised to society's consciousness.  The power of money illustrated in FOOD, INC. distorts our values, our health, and puts money above compassion, empathy, and reduces the value of life to meaningless.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Thanks first of all for the speedy delivery. The processor was very easy to install and after installation my computer ran beautifly well. Great processor and great product.....................
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Have you ever read &#34;Pride & Prejudice&#34;, and you just want more?  Well, this is it.  The author tried to keep true to the original style of writing.  It's done very well.  Gives us just a little more of a glimpse into the life of The Darcy's that we all want!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is by far one of the best car games on the market. I enjoy playing it any chance I get. It is an excellent time killer.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|We LOVE this movie!  Lovely settings.  Grace Kelley is funny, playful, and of course, beautiful.  Cary Grant is his charming self.  They act well together.  Very enjoyable movie.
B0098G7AWS|4.0|I know I am 15 years late on this, but finally watched this romance classic! Great film, even better performances by 2 amazing actors. Would recommend. Quality was good on instant viewing as well, thanks Amazon. keep it up.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Enjoyed this movie very much.  Very engaging.  Kept our interest the entire time.  Good acting, and visually, very realistic.  Good story line.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|The one I received do's not cover the all of the kindle fire HD  that I purchased. It doe's not revolve.
B007N31YH0|5.0|We love this movie!  Very entertaining all the way through.  Robert Redford, in his youth, is always something to see!
B009VB9VKY|4.0|My girlfriend and I rented this awhile back and I didn't think I'd enjoy watching it at all. It turned out to be a pretty decent movie and it provided a few laughs.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|i love this movie, it's a real classic, funny and engaging.  it's the type of film that most people would enjoy.
B008Y6Q38A|5.0|Jesse Eisenberg is amazing in this movie. The story of Facebook is a fascinating one and this movie does a great job at both being entertaining and faithful to the story of Facebook's origin (of course there's embellishment, but the bulk of the story is accurate).
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This came as a present from me to my fiance and came on time and in perfect condition. I know he really liked this movie. Thank you!
1853104825|2.0|Though entertaining at times, I found this book to be full of conjecture, snobbery, and arrogance on the part of the author. His opinions on certain subject matter in the realm of human factors were a little much at times. The copy right of 1995, (18 years old) also didn’t help the readability because much of the industry has changed. The last chapter in the book is basically a political rant with little in the way of closing, or common theme . If you want to read a real book on human factors without all the bad attitude, pick up one of Tony Kern’s books.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game rocks best game I have played on my kindle.I suggest this game to any slashing dungeon hunter' hack on
B009IH0ICG|5.0|It lights charcoal using only two sheets of newspaper and no need of lighter fluid.  What more needs to be said?
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Good graphics.  Enjoyable to play.  I really liked the puzzles.  Ability to zoom helps with darker more obscure object finding.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|This film is closest in tone to J.M. Barrie's classic....and the actor playing Peter does such a fantastic job - charismatic, cocky & charming - it makes you wonder why they ever had a woman play this role.  It's a magical movie, but definitely not for the littlest ones...above six years old would probably be best.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|&#34;I have one more question...&#34;  Still enjoyable after all these years.  I love detective shows and this is the best of them all.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Have heard the basics of this incident before but never imagined all the background and details!  Recommend this book to anyone.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|I thought it was cool at first but then it started saying comers not available so I hate it now.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie is cerebral.  So if you come into it wanting mindless entertainment forget it.  Profound, strong, thought provoking. Thank you for making a movie like this.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Got this for my grandchildren to play and they have fun and it keeps them busy for awhile. Great game.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|8 bit kindle fire game. Don't lag. Simple puzzle hidden in a rpg....or a dog hidden in a puzzle game. It's free so no worries about Amazon coins or credit
B004SBS8LA|5.0|We play this and make it a challenge to see who can get better score. Enjoy playing this game with my grandchildren.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game and the different selections I have to change it up. Have enjoyed this game for years. Bought a new Kindle Fire and the game did not update so I had to repurchase the game.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Wonderfully well rounded movie with everything you want- action, love, and comedy!!  All the differing personalities are perfectly cohesive to deliver an entertaining plot. ENJOY!
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Although I enjoy Jeffrey Archer's books I found this book tedious and a bit boring.  Nothing really happened to write home about and i felt cheated  that the book ended so abruptly.  I am glad I did not pay for a hardcopy!
B004SDEP38|1.0|This app and a lot of the reviews lead me to believe that not only would it allow me to edit my files but it would allow me to create new ones as well.  Well it will allow me to edit but not create unless I buy the full version.  If I could I would give the free version zero stars because I was so mislead on what the free version would let me do!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|With every electronic we get, the kids want this game on them.  This game is what I would call an electronic staple.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|cool game to ply going up the hill can get fun playing hope you like this game I did stay cool
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A page turner. When a section ends its hard to put it down and go on with life, you just think one more section i have to know what happens!
B002NNA9N0|4.0|The cast is excellent! Well done, superb acting, true to life back in the time the movie is dated for
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|i'm not one for writing reviews, but i want to take the opportunity to praise an excellent album. &#34;V Dubs&#34; has crafted a terrific soundscape with MVOTC.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great.  Involves strategy by negotiating, trading, and cutting off opponents.  What makes this game great is you always have a chance to come back and you can' get out.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I love it. It does every thing I need. I use it on a weekly basis and it has never let me down. The ease of use speeds my work. How did I ever work without it?
B002APU580|5.0|Absolutely wonderful movie. Both Keira and Matthew did a super job. Donald Sutherland was very entertaining True to Jane Austin's classic novel.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Love love love this movie! James Spader was soo good in this great movie and the disc was clean and delivery was on time.  On complaint is that the box was broken :( fortunately the disc was not.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|Great comedy and very close to real life. I guess it is director's autobiography. Good actor cast, fell good movie
1577314808|3.0|I didn't download the first Pretty woman so cannot rate it. It  is being returned.<br />The power of Now was not as good as I expected but it was okay.<br />The second Pretty Woman will be arriving until later so no rating yet.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Say what you will about Tom Cruise and his wacky scientology but you can't take away the fact that this guy can really make a great action film!  I love this movie.  VERY entertaining and very good supporting cast.  His fight scenes are hilarious!  Definitely get this movie!
030795062X|5.0|I watched the film several times and kept scratching my head to understand what the director and cast were attempting to convey ... the book cleared the fog and I could understand the characters and the story line better.
B003AWRM9W|5.0|These two make a surprisingly good pair. I love all Clint Eastwood movies, this one has a bit of a different pace to it but fun to watch none the less.
1594630844|5.0|It will remain on my book shelf forever.  The life lessons are so true.  I will refer back to it over and over again.
B00466HNHM|5.0|If you know this movie, you know it's noting spectacular, but Kevin Costner pulls the movie together and makes it enjoyable.
044661758X|4.0|Author, Michael Connelly, has done such a great job of creating a lead character that I love.  Det. Harry Bosch is a flawed hero who is identifiable and likeable without being over the top alpha.  Here, Bosch is on trial for his previous actions that Connelly has touched on in the past.  He has set this world up perfectly.  The mystery here is very good as I thought I figured it out as soon as the police did and I was wrong.  I look forward to reading more by Connelly.  Really good stuff.  My only complaint is that its too short.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This concept makes so much sense. I wish someone would have taught this to me when I was in my twenties. A must read for all relationships. I found out it was ok to be me. Learn your partners love language and get ready for the fun to begin.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a very good book. It kept my attention and interest. Having a child with personality issues and trouble in school whose name is also \\"Jacob\\" made this book easy to read too!
B0000524CY|5.0|DVD in pristine condition and the price can not be beat. Will surf in the future for other movies from my younger days. Thank you.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this game!!!  Need more installments!!  Perfect game. I ran my kindle out playing it now I'm addicted and I can't find anything as good :(
B001VLC3T8|5.0|The chicken is very cute and has great colors! It is alittle smaller than I thought it would be but great for my daughters little hands to hold. She loves chickens and would like to play with my chicken salt shaker. So I found this one and she loves it! They also sell these at Walmart if you want to see there whole selection. It's great for a toy or decoration!
B000IZXR7U|5.0|Great start to a great series..  George Miller had imagination and great directing skills, and he achieved more and more with each of the Mad Max films.. great stuff..
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Not to be confused with a classic but really well written. Pure Sci Fi and a fun read from start to finish. He has you hooked in the first page.
0790729342|5.0|Bravo.  Bravo..  Truly awesome film by George Miller.  Ranks right up there with \\"Vanishing Point\\" as one of the best existential action movies ever made...
B008M87GJK|5.0|It is great to have a different source for world and other news with it's high quality and variety portable
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Good to Great. Was everything I had heard about it. The concepts were well explained and thought out. The process of going from Good to Great, should be an enjoyable process.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I watched this in one weekend-could not stop. I especially loved the two part Halloween episode. Very well done. Although not a continuation of this season (which was well wrapped), I will definitely watch season 2.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|My son LOVES Iron Man so I downloaded this game for him.  He gets frustrated though because the games freezes while he's in the middle of playing it.
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|I have long wanted to attend one of these spectacular events. What an opportunity, there is much to enjoy, it is magical, breathtaking and at the same time you will be amazed at what these highly skilled performers can do! The body, when desciplined is so much more capable than most of us know.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It is very easy to understand the meaning of word,and it makes it easy to learn new word, and grammar.
B000002GK1|5.0|This album IS the quintessential Soundgarden in all its glory. Cornell is belting it out like, well, like he is a young, powerful rock legend and why not?  He was and is! You can hear his throat bleeding. The songwriting is awesome -- music and lyrics.  It is heavy, driving, sublime, nasty and simply awesome. It is a blast to listen to this and picture the beautiful twenty-something Cornell stalking around the stage in his shorts as the band simply blows the the place up. I just saw SG in DC last month and, suprisingly, they played about 7 songs off of this album. They also continue to use the cover of badmotorfinger as the backdrop on the stage.  Seems the fellas agree that this music defines what this amazing band is all about. buy it now and HAVE FUN!!!
B000021XS0|5.0|Ever since I was introduced to Dream Theater I have loved their music.  This album just pulls at me and is so haunting.  Anyone who like progressive rock should try this CD first and you will be hooked.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was a bit reluctant to purchase a book from a relatively un-heard of new author as sometimes these newer stories are full of grammar and spelling errors and I just can't get into them! I am so glad I took the risk as Hugh is now a new favorite author. His editing, plot and pacing are wonderful. I found it difficult to put this book down! I just finished it and have already purchased Shift and I am looking forward to more of his excellent storytelling. Keep 'em coming, Hugh!
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|However, the story did keep us involved and on the edge of our seats. Well acted performances by all. NOT for kids or the faint of heart or queasy of stomach.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have enjoyed most of David Baldacci books.  This is the first time I read his book with Will Robie.<br />I could hardly put the book down.  Looking forward to reading more of Baldacci books with Will Robie
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Is not too hard and not to easy. Just enough too challenge you but not a mindless game like most games. Hope there are other games like this.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I rented this movie so I could watch it with my amazing boyfriend! It's an excellent movie, with a wonderful bit of comedy. We loved it! :D
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Compelling.<br />Riveting.<br />Shocking.<br />Unpredictable.<br />Lucy Liu! She keeps up with him---they are equally yoked!<br />Great writing!!! Which allows Miller to shine!<br />Love this show!<br />This is no wanna be &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; --- this one stands tall and proud on its own quite well and easily. There is no comparison. Sir Doyle would enjoy it, I'm sure.
0385349831|5.0|In typical Coelho style, Manuscript Found in Accra is full of insights and memorable quotes. The book begins on the eve of an impending war. The war will divide people from three religions, and many will die in the battle. Prior to the fighting, the townspeople gather and ask a guru questions about life, living, and death. This is a remarkable book and a quick read. If I could give it more stars, I would!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book gives great details to the battle between two of the greatest geniuses of all time.  The one that prevails dies alone and penniless, while the loser goes on to undeserving fame. It leaves me wondering what if Tesla were to receive the accolades for his inventions like Edison did. Great inspiration for those of us that have felt failure.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Everyone should read and follow the suggested program and advice! It is clear and well written with easy to follow diet plan.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|All three stories were gripping. I was left with a deep regret that Lisbeth never reconciled with mikael, but it was in keeping with Larson's concept. Ultimately, this was a romantic tragedy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just wonderful! By far my favorite season! If you weren't completely hooked by the first season you will be with this one.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Just had to play around with it for awhile to see if I could set it and get an alarm. First time I used it could figure out what the sound was until it got some what louder. it sure is neat though.
1451613512|4.0|The true history of U S imperialism around the world.  Shows how multi corporations control this country and ruin our image around the world.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time, enjoyed it thoroughly, . Still crying now. Made me feel like I was a part of the family with Enzo . Forgetting that Enzo is even a dog.
B000002J1O|5.0|From the day I bought this album over 30 years ago it has remained a Genesis favorite. Some of their most melodious music, less raucous than their earlier efforts and not as poppy as those subsequent the band hit the sweet spot with this and 'Lamb Lies Down'. Highly recommended.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I really loved this book.  Ran through a whole range of emotions for me while keeping me hooked from the very first page.  The perspective from Drew's point of view was so much fun to read.
B0000YB7Z8|4.0|Very well produced for a live album and captures the classic Tull era. Although Anderson continued to make good music beyond this period, for sheer musical excitement this lineup has to be one of his best. His one liners between the tracks only add to the ambience. Wonderful listening.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I've come to grow and love the way that Dan Brown writes his novels. This one did not disappoint and I cannot wait to read Inferno!!!
B001R4MEUM|5.0|Appreciate this album so much more now than when I first heard it in the late 80's. Musically mature and wonderfully produced it has stood the test of time. Along with 'Selling England' has to be their finest work as a group. Only emphasizes the loss of Gabriel as subsequent albums although more popular cannot match the creativity and variety evident on this album. Highly recommended.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show!  The first season was great, 2nd was great too, and the 3rd starts soon!  I enjoyed every episode!
B00BZF7REQ|5.0|Absolutely loved this!!! I think it is a beautiful work, i just got this last night and everything ive seen till now is just awesome.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I absolutely adore this moving. It is fun, funny and sweet. I didn't want it to end the first time I watched it and now I just want to watch it time and time again. I absolutely adore Brittany Snow and I love seeing her in such a big role. I can't wait for #2.
0425263908|5.0|If you love 50 Shades of Gray you will love these books!! I hope Sylvia Day keeps this series going. I loved it!!!!
0679805273|5.0|My favorite of the Seuss books. Very good for someone whom is preparing for a major change in life. I recommend this book to everyone.
B005UG542S|5.0|Love the Potter series.  Good quality.  This movie played just as well as the theater when I first saw Part 2.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Excellent movie, following the actions for hunting down and killing Bin Laden. It was worth the money. I really enjoied it.
B00AEBB8BU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies--one I've watched many times over the years.  It arrived quickly and in good shape.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I like Adobe Reader in my PC, but couldn't download in my Kindle. I call support and sent me an email appologizing for the inconvenience and let me know they continue working on solving this problem, but since I haven't hear from them and this appa is not in my Kindle Fire.
B004FKGX8Y|5.0|It has its downs like all movies, but I love watching it because it can send my mind wandering in all directions! Makes you really think about if you can have multiple dreams within dreams.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Disclaimer: I know very little of the original star-treks :)<br />Nice movie, good special effects, acting was ok and scenario not too dumb, what more to expect.
0375815996|5.0|My 6 month old baby loves it! She likes to read it and she likes to eat too.you can do both with this book.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|The courage and selflessness in this film seem to be increasingly meaningful as the years go by; we could all learn from Gandhi's example. Ben Kingsley was superlative.
6302787068|5.0|This movie was in Good condition, delivered on time and obviously a fantastic movie. The fact I can get VHS so cheap is great. :)
B0019I6WDG|4.0|The plot is nice and speaks to the young generation and whats going on in our society this days. Struggles of youthful generation...
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|At first the book was kinda boring then it blew my mind.  It wasn't as spectacular the Da Vinci Code but it still had me reading  nonstop.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Wonderful script with a touching story, excellent cast - all principal actors including two children turned in an excellent, very credible performance. It is so easy to get involved with the movie  - there is suspense,  and even a good chance for moist to tear-filled moments. Without giving the plot away, it is a movie that makes you feel good. We loved it so much that we watched it twice in a 24 hour time span. It has a potential for being one of the top movies of 2013.
0439023521|4.0|I found the hunger games interesting but not interesting enough to keep readin the series. Don't get me wrong it was a good book but i don't think it appeals to everyone.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|This is a great show.  Sometimes it can be a little out there, but if you take yourself so seriously . . . watch the news.  I love this show.  It is my main guilty pleasure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the most fun game  in the world I am making a serpentine statue it it is AWESOME.Buy this  game!!!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Tintin is a fun and pretty straightforward movie. It's short and moves quickly, but if you're a Tintin fan, I'd suggest the old HBO cartoon series.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|GOOD BOOK. The ending of each chapter keeps you turning the page to know what will happen next. Let's in the book do seem to get a little repetitive like every time Katniss is interviewed in front of the Capitol. Definitely interested in the sequel because the book leaves you wondering what will happen next.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I have to log in to face book from my kindle and it wont take my information not user friendly sad as I heard from anther friend who plays on their phone it is fun
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Plays smoothly on my kindle fire. Levels filled with plenty of things to kill in a wide array of ways. Your objective...... Exterminate every thing you see , any way you can.

B005IQ39AY|5.0|fun just good fun I spend a lot of time enjoying this game. I highly recommend it for a good time
0375869026|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I just sent copies to 6 grandchildren. One, 10 yr old, has already told me he &#34;really liked it&#34; and &#34;the way it was written from different points of view.&#34;  We decided we were both better people after reading this book.<br /><br />I learned that some 5th grade teachers in our local school district are choosing it for a re-aloud and discussion for the next school year.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|not a good game very uninteresting I do not recommend it there are many more games that are fun use one of them
193700788X|5.0|I loved all her books not just Sookie Stackhouse. Love her southern stories. Charlaine will keep you interested in her fiction stories
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is very addicting and its fun to play. the only down fall is that it takes a while to make a lot of money to buy the items needed to level up.
0375851569|5.0|This set covered the basics a child needs of Dr. Seuss. Nice container. Regular sized books and first rate quality.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The plot's basic theme of cyber warfare is current news, the action is fast-paced, and many of the characters are ones I like and are familiar with from previous Clancy novels. Once started, the book is hard to put down.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who likes international suspense novels and authors (besides Clancy) such as Robert Ludlum, Jack Higgins, Dan Brown, Daniel Silva, David Baldacci, Nelson DeMille, Brad Thor and Vince Flynn.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|The script seems written by a romantic teenager -- I found this a hodge-podge of wishful thinking. manufactured drama, and unrelated side stories. And although Bradley Cooper is beyond gorgeous, he seemed wooden in this role. I just didn't get it.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Saw it originally at home on DVD. LOVED IT! Ordered it on Blue Ray..I think its at the PO Office today hopefully. Great fun and I play it every July 4th. Besided all the effects the acting was worth buying the movie and afterall who does'nt want the political power &#34;House&#34; blown up once in awhile?!!<br />MovieMan
B008RV5K5E|4.0|Pretty good first part. I enjoyed the second part more but this is good. Best if you watch them both together.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|It is just as good as I remembered reading it as a kid.  I will recommend it to all my young readers.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|How can you not love this movie? Who would have ever thought they could pull this off. Good stuff. word
B000F3A7LO|3.0|I love every King Crimson album ever made, but this Robert Fripp solo album didn't measure up in my opinion.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A very good read,and ends very suspense filled,hence a open wound! So now the long wait begins for book 6.
B000FC2ROU|5.0|Murakami delivers one of his most poetic, enigmatic novels yet. A 15 year old boy, alienated from a distant but brilliant father; an idiot savant victim of WWII gassing on a mission to complete a dangerous spiritual mission; a mysterious library locked in time & home to a beautiful heartbroken woman - all are interwoven in a tale that is at once lyrical & mysterious. Be prepared for talking cats, a wicked Johnny Walker Red character & the benevolent appearance of Colonel Sanders as a pimp to round out your journey. Oh, and a visit to limbo, too. How all of this ties together is the beauty of Murakami. This book is beautiful, haunting & quite lovely.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Remember when Arnie said \\" I'll be back\\", well he's back and loaded for bear. This time as a small town sheriff with a big time past as a LA cop. His staff is strictly small time with no real experience and the bad guy who is a Mexican Drug Kingpin who is he coming with a car that goes 200MPH and an army of gunman with guns up the ying yang. Its obvious that Arnie was tired of getting his butt kicked as a politician so he's back kicking ass and \\"Terminating\\" the bad guys again. Great movie and welcome back Arnie, its great to see you again.
B008220C38|1.0|I have to go along with the majority of the reviews that have already been posted.  It is hard to believe what was done to a great story.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I am not much of a gamer lamer but I have played this one for a while. It is a pretty nice little distraction from time to time and I suppose that one of these days I will actually finish it.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Can't access events on this mobile version.  Can't share posts with a specific person.  There are just some features missing, but overall it is good.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|It is a stunning tale, realistic and not inflated, of the life of one boy who made it. And continues to make it. A riveting tale that would pass as fiction if one did not know of the horrors of North Korea.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I like the entire album.  I find that the energy she puts into the music by combining a dubstep backdrop with her skill on the violin creates a fresh new view of the genres.<br /><br />My only criticism is that some of the pieces sound rather similar to one another.  &#34;Spontaneous Me&#34; and &#34;Electric Daisy Violin&#34;, for instance, are difficult to distinguish.<br /><br />&#34;Elements&#34; is perfectly put together and gives clear musical forms for Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Ilike the cordless swivel sweeper. I use it also on my carpet and my floors.. It beats using a broom and dust5 pan. The little pan doesn't hold much. In other words I like it. O&#62;W&#62; of Boone NC.
B009AMANH4|4.0|There's no denying the following: Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the best living actors. That's just fact. He disappears into every role he's ever done. He's a true chameleon and he deserves every accolade that could ever be heaped on him. His work in this film, Steven Spielberg's LINCOLN, absolutely 1000% deserved the Golden Globe and the Oscar as well as any number of other awards he won. And this is a film about who is largely considered the greatest president in American history, written by one of America's premier playwrights and directed by one of the greatest directors to have ever lived.<br /><br />So, why did this film leave me wanting?<br /><br />LINCOLN is not an epic portrayal of Abraham Lincoln's life, from humble beginnings to great heights and tragic assassination; as written by Tony Kushner, it is laser-focused on Lincoln, his wife Mary (the incomparable Sally Field), his chief of staff William Seward (the always great David Strathairn) and his motley crew of assistants (played by the marvelous trio of James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson), and radical Republican abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens (the eternally gruff Tommy Lee Jones) and the months leading to the vote in the House of Representatives for the Thirteenth Amendment, essentially abolishing slavery for all time in the United States. This amendment, for Lincoln, serves two purposes: The end of slavery and the end of the long and bloody Civil War. But complications arise when The Confederacy sends envoys to Washington for peace talks. Lincoln wants the war to end, but he can't, in good conscience, allow the war to end and for slavery to continue. He also can't, in good conscience, allow the war to go on, with hundreds of thousands of Americans dying. Through what some might consider \\"impeachable\\" offenses, Lincoln secures the necessary votes to have the amendment pass, but his victory is short-lived for the man himself, since not much longer after the amendment's passage, he would meet his end by a coward's bullet.<br /><br />The first sequence of the film shows a brutal battle sequence followed by Lincoln visiting a Union Army camp and being confronted by a black soldier who understands that while he has been proclaimed to be equal by the leader of this country, he is not even equal while he and his brothers fight and die for this cause. It frames the film succinctly and beautifully in such a short period of time, and I wished that there were more moments like that throughout the film. The film is peppered with Lincoln telling anecdotes to just about anyone who will listen (there's a great moment where a Union Army general actually leaves the room, refusing to listen to any more of Lincoln's stories), and they're indicitive of the gentle, wise, and soft-spoken man who did everything he could to bring equality to all men. Every scene with Lewis is magnetic. You can't take your eyes off him, and what's more indicitive of how brilliant of a performance it is, you never get the sense that this is Daniel Day-Lewis \\"pretending\\" to be Lincoln; he simply IS Lincoln. Spielberg speaks again to his perfect casting instincts with Field as the barely-restrained Mary Todd Lincoln and Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, who has deeply personal feelings about and furious contempt for slavery, and as a man who's mind will not be changed, Jones is the perfect actor to play that. And the film is almost over-populated with great actors, like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Lee Pace, Hal Holbrook, Bruce McGill, Walton Goggins, Jared Harris, and Joseph Cross, but many of these other actors seem to be making not much more than cameos.<br /><br />The only problem with the film, really, is with how much it feels like a stage play. Kushner is a brilliant writer, and if this were just about any other quality director, this would feel a bit more complete as a film because of its theatrical monologues and intimate scenes. It feels very much like Spielberg's AMISTAD, which, while powerful, also lacks the epic scope of the films the name Spielberg evokes. Ironically, Spielberg's last film, the excellent WAR HORSE, was actually based on a stage play, but had a more sweeping and epic quality to it, making it a more \\"Spielbergian\\" Spielberg film, and therefore, a more fulfilling cinematic experience. Aside from a few sequences in this film, such as the opening sequence, there's very little to make this feel like it's not much more than a stage play.<br /><br />The film is absolutely worth watching for a number of different reasons, mainly for the performance/disappearance of Lewis, but LINCOLN ends on such a note that it felt like it wasn't necessary to take it that far, and while you have time to reflect and recognize the greatness not only of the man the film is about, but also of the craftsmanship of the people involved, you also will find yourself glad you saw it, but not much else.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars.cks the epic scope of the films the name Spielberg evokes.

B00AKFG15S|4.0|I have been reading Clifton chronicles since a month and I am astonished to realize that I finished all three parts in a just a month's time. 1200 pages in a month....Really impressive. Well it's not me. Credit goes to the marvelous author Jeffery for his amazing style of telling the stories to the world. This one part again stands out in the series of Clifton chronicle as much as the previous two parts for the way story evolves with the next generation of the family, exciting events and ofcourse the end. I suggest this series ( by the way for me it was first series I completed or finished so far...because story is still seem to go on) to all the book lovers. If you like Jeffery, you gonna love it.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|So, the David O. Russell who directed SPANKING THE MONKEY and THREE KINGS is now making Oscar bait films. It's rare for a heralded director of indie (SPANKING THE MONKEY) or fringe Hollywood (THREE KINGS) filmmaking to maintain the things that made him so unique a voice and still make the short list for the Awards season. Well, as with he did with 2010's THE FIGHTER, Russell gives us an gritty and emotional but an ultimately heart-warming, crowd-pleasing, life-affirming film about overcoming the odds and getting your heart's desire that is also packed with an extraordinary ensemble and a supreme standout performance. This is what Russell has become over time, and while this is a good quality film, it's not what I used to go to David O. Russell films to see.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Matthew Quick, you have Pat (Bradley Cooper, in what apparently amounts to a nomination-worthy performance), who is leaving a state hospital in Baltimore with his mother (Jacki Weaver) back to their home in Philadelphia. Pat suffers from a bipolar disorder, finally diagnosed after a severe altercation with the man sleeping with his wife (he beat the crap out of him), and as part of a plea agreement, he decided to be admitted. He arrives back home to his father Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro, for once, NOT phoning it in as he's done for the last several years, since probably RONIN), a severely superstitious (or is it OCD) man about his beloved Philidelphia Eagles and after losing his job and pension, he has become a bookmaker. Pat, upon returning home, has a singular goal: To get back his wife Nikki, and he'll do whatever he feels necessary to do so, seeing his \\"silver linings\\" in the opportunities he looks to create. Still severely unhinged, he goes to a dinner thrown by his best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) and his extremely domineering wife Veronica (a severely underused Julia Stiles) and meets Veronica's younger, similarly unhinged sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who recently lost her cop husband in a car accident and they form a strangely provocative bond. It is through this chance meeting (or is it chance?) that both Pat and Tiffany seek normalcy and solace in each other as they seem to try to out-crazy each other, each looking at their own goals: Pat wants Nikki back, and Tiffany wants to compete in a freestyle dance competition. Oh, and there's also Chris Tucker here as a somwehat innocuous fellow inmate of the hospital who keeps escaping.<br /><br />Russell is an adept director as always, and he keeps things moving very fluidly, but the film leaves you asking a lot of questions. Is it supposed to be a comedy? A drama? A film about dealing with mental illness? What purpose does Chris Tucker serve (not only in this film, but in the universe)? Why doesn't the film ever deal with Pat Sr. as far as his possible mental illness? Why does the film almost completely ignore Jacki Weaver? Why does Tiffany seem like the only character that's well-rounded?<br /><br />Well, I do have an answer to that one. As he did with THE FIGHTER, Russell seems to LOVE to showcase one singularly talented person in an extremely showy role. In THE FIGHTER, it was Christian Bale, and he won (deservedly so) the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for that film. In this film, that showcase is given to Jennifer Lawrence, who (not quite so deservedly so) won Best Actress for this film. Make no mistake; it's a great performance. Is it Oscar-worthy? Of nomination? Yes. Of winning? No, or at least not against Jessica Chastain and her totally immersive and subtle performance in ZERO DARK THIRTY. But there's the rub; The Weinstein Company who produced this film, and the Weinstein's former studio Miramax, blitz the living hell out of the Oscar voters in massive campaigns that are reminiscent of presidential campaigns. This is how in 1999, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE beat SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and more recently, how, in 2010, THE KING'S SPEECH defeated THE SOCIAL NETWORK. Just on a bit of a tangent here, let's face it; Oscar voters LOVE the opportunity to celebrate performances that show great impersonations of real-life figures (Edith Piaf, Idi Amin, Truman Capote, Abraham Lincoln, etc.), people mimicking disabilites or mental issues (RAIN MAN, MY LEFT FOOT, FORREST GUMP, SHINE, etc.), and big, showy, bombastic performances like Bale's in THE FIGHTER or Lawrence's in this film. And then, every once in a while, they'll find the year to give it to the right person.<br /><br />In the final analysis, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a very good, very solid film with some excellent performances, and it really does a little more than the bare minimum to be complete. But is this a film for the ages, like THREE KINGS or is this a performance that will be remembered, other than it being Lawrence's first win (which she deserved more for her first nomination, the brilliant WINTER'S BONE)? Like Pat and Tiffany's dance competition, it doesn't stand a chance.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars.ngent here, let's face it; Oscar voters LOVE the opportunity to celebrate performances that show great impersonations of real-life figures (Edith Piaf, Idi Amin, Truman Capote, Abraham Lincoln, etc.), people mimicking disabilites or mental issues (RAIN MAN, MY LEFT FOOT, FORREST GUMP, SHINE, etc.), and big, showy, bombastic performances like Bale's in THE FIGHTER or Lawrence's in this film.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun game but don't give into buying items...wish it was a bit less pushy $$ wise...should have challenges to go further...not a wallet.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought I would not like this book because as a mother, having a child who is ill must be terrible. It was so beautifully written. I could not put it down.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|It is a security app. What can you say about a security app. If it is working, like it appears this one is then you have nothing to say!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|A lot of things to do. Challenges could be a little harder. Overall a really good game to sit down and relax with. Nice story line also.<br />I will buy the full version.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|Great blues trio: Muddy, Buddy Guy and Willie Dixon. What else can you expect than greatness coming from this gathering. Superb sound as well, very atmospheric sounding.
B005LAII80|1.0|We were extremely disappointed.  Had a great potential story line, but the gore for shock value was EXTREMELY disappointing. The main goal seemed to be the presentation of cinematic special effects for 3-D and included very little character development. Main Character never removed his helmet. Karl Urban's talent was wasted in this adaptation.
B008NMT684|5.0|I LOVE this app because my son just turned 3, and this app helped him learn how to put puzzles together. But not only that, now he knows what pieces go where just by the shape. I was soo proud of him for catching on so fast!! Which made me very happy I got this app for him. And he loves playing it too, which is a bonus!
B002RI99XW|5.0|Infidel was the most enthralling book, I would recommend everyone to read it.<br />It is a true story and one can only admire Ayaan Hirsi Ali for having the amazing<br />courage to write this account of her life.<br />I could not put it down.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|entertaining, suspenseful, feel good movie, all  characters worked well together, Julianne Hough's movie husband did well as the villian, perfect character acting for him

B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was hilarious, sexy, lots of fun! Told from a male POV, it's unusual, refreshing, and made me laugh so many times--and that was just reading the first chapter! After that, I was hooked to the point of not being able to put the book down until the story was finished. Emma Chase has a new fan, and I'm looking forward to anything else written by this author.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is a really great app an I recommend it to anyone who likes zombies and other things to complete my review
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|This movie marks the point where I personally finally lost interest in a series that was surprisingly decent for how bad it could have been. Well, it's finally got around to being as bad as I had always feared. Save your money & watch the first 3 instead.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot.  The author lays out his experience in both a scientifically and spiritually and merges them both very well.
B00BLGZDVS|4.0|Both Phoenix & especially Hoffman deliver as a lush loser and a thinly veiled L Ron of scientology fame. This is not a film about scientology, rather a character study of a man whose life becomes intertwined briefly with the little-explained Master (Hoffman). Good, but not great.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|mom and daughter enjoy playing together. good graphics. a little tricky for my five yr old but good with help.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Renner is a good replacement for Damon as the lead in this series reboot. The action is fast & explosive across a few different locations without feeling forced. Fun action flick for everyone.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|I've been watching this show since the first episode. When we dropped cable we decided to buy the show each week that it came out. Be warned that with the &#34;season pass&#34; (that saves 5%) you have to buy the entire season, so if you start midway through, the savings may not be there for you. It's great not having commercials, you expect them but the show jumps right back into it.<br /><br />The storyline is good, although at times can be a little slow, but it does spring to life with zombie attacks. It's turn into more a story of human interaction and survival, and not just zombie attacks. The attacks are just bonus. Some of the special effects do seem not as well done as expected, given movies nowadays.<br /><br />For the fourth season I'm planning on buying a season pass for it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Such a unique way to tell the story. What are you waiting for get this book right now- you will love it!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read definitely worth the money you should read this book it is 17 A.R. points
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Impossible to let down. Well written. Gripping. AND the story stays tight until the end (which is oh so rare in this genre, with this much of adrenaline going on throughout the story)<br /><br />If you miss the feeling picking a book and spending the night reading it because you can't stop until you're done, Gone Girl is waiting for you. Read it last week and have recommended it to over 10 people since. It's a no-brainer.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is put together very well. The storyline is exciting, intriguing, and unpredictable. I would encourage anyone who enjoyed 80s trivia or video games to definitely give this book a try
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|My family has enjoyed the previous Lego movie releases for Star Wars, but considering the superhero obsession in our household I had to pick this film up.  The movie itself runs 71 minutes, almost a feature length which is quite a bit more than we've gotten with the previous Star Wars specials.  The movie begins with Batman and Superman taking on Lex Luthor and flashes back to the \\"Man of the Year\\" award ceremony which quickly gets out of control when the Joker leads a group of villains (including the Penquin, Harley Quinn, Riddler, Two-Face and Catwoman) to crash the party.  And what better way to stop a villain team up then by getting together a few \\"super\\" friends like Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Cyborg and The Flash.  There are plenty of other characters that show up along the way as well.<br /><br />While this film utilizes the spirit of the cut-scenes from [[ASIN:B006ZPAYGE LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]], it is not a straight repackage of them.  Many scenes have been added and the others reanimated and re-cut and improved upon for the release, all for the better.  If you've played the game, you get the gist, but this is a much higher quality of animation and gives you the story in a much more cinematic way.<br /><br />The film itself is fun for all ages, with enough Lego humor for the kids and plenty of jokes that will probably be over their heads including references to the Batman films going all the way back to the 1960s.  Kudos to the design team for their parody of the original 1989 Batman film opening, as well as the use of that iconic Danny Elfman music and the John Williams Superman score. The voice work is solid and though I prefer the voice cast of Arkham Asylum, this group of actors does a wonderful job portraying these characters in a more kid friendly way.<br /><br />The bonus features are great as well and include a short feature called \\"Building Batman\\" behinds the scenes in the Lego animation studio with a few kids getting to work with the resident animator, 2 episodes of The Brave and the Bold and one from Teen Titans, a Lego Batman stop-motion short, and 5 winning shorts from the Lego DC Universe Super Heroes Video Contest.  There are various languages options but unfortunately no commentary which I would have loved to hear from the director or lead animator about the production.  The pack-in of Clark Kent with the \\"S\\" exposed is a nice add on for Lego collectors as well.<br /><br />Ultimately this is a great release.  It's a fun film for all ages and a worth a look.
B00COGY2P2|2.0|Typical action film but its a hard pill to swallow watching 50 year old , 5'7 ,Tom Cruise, play a character who is 6'3  and is a genuine bad-ass in the books. Character development was non existent which means you rely on the action of this film which was poor, slow and uncreative. This was a poor excuse for the Jack Reacher series, wont be another  movie I hope.
1400069807|5.0|A wonderful read about how our food supply and what's put in it has evolved. Some of it does not make one happy with the food industry!!! What was especially interesting was all the new products that were created in the changing landscape over time, and what families needed for meals and quicker ways to put food on the table.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada is an example of a novel ready for the big screen.  Damian has assembled all the essential characters from WWII and put them into action.  We are comforted by the scenes we remember of France, the Resistance the Vichy, the Germans, Nazis and Allies.  We have seen so many movies of this conflict that it's easy to visualize the scenes in our head.  Add a James Bond lead character and you have the perfect script for the theater.  That's the best part of the book.  Damian puts you in the action with vivid descriptions and details that bring the scenes to life.  His background in screenwriting is certainly evident.  If you like James Bond and stories where the Nazis get their butts kicked, you'll like this novel.  Now he should write one about Bond and the Vietnam War; maybe we can win that one this time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am having fun finding things of interest to me.  I have already gotten a lot of ideas.  Thank you.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This story is told completely from a male's (Drew) point of view.  It was refreshingly funny and I was hooked before the first chapter even ended!  Drew is the ultimate bachelor - smart, good looking, driven, passionate, wealthy, cocky, witty and absolutely loveable.<br /><br />Drew tells his story and makes no apologies for the kind of man he was or has become.  His story starts while he's sick with the flu, \\"At least I'm pretty sure that's what I have.  That's why I've been holed up in my apartment the last seven days.  That's why I turned my phone off, why I've gotten off the couch only to use the bathroom or to bring in the food I order from the delivery guy.\\"  It's not until his sister Alexandra \\"The Bitch\\" shows up and forces him to open his door does he finally admit the truth, \\"It finally happened....What you've been wishing on me all these years, I whisper.  I fell in love.\\"<br /><br />Thus begin's Drew's story, the story of how he feel in love with Katherine Brooks and of how very thin the line between love and hate really is.  Will Drew be able to grow up and become the man Kate deserves?  Will he choose to fight for something that doesn't come easily?<br /><br />\\"Women fall in love quicker than men.  Easier and more often.  But when guys fall?  We go down harder.  And when things go bad?  When it's not us who ends it?  We don't get to walk away.  We crawl.\\"<br /><br />Tangled is a must-read.  It's funny, it's hot and so addicitve you'll be hooked quicker than you think.  I started and couldn't put it down until Drew finished telling his story!
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|This game is too easy.  It gives too many assists, so there is not enough challenge for me.  Thank you.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I saw the Game of thrones series before reading this book. I was pleasantly surprised that this second book in the series is quite different than the tv series season two. There is so much depth in this book. I simply loved devouring every word.<br /><br />Loved it! A must read for all the fantasy book lovers.
0316228532|5.0|The book was great quality, it was sent within the alloted time, and it was a good read. I liked it.

B005XN31LY|4.0|Two strong female characters who are bad ass and smart. Good story around them. Clever integration of old fairy tales.
0525952926|5.0|These books are entertaining and wonderful reviews of history.......... Winter of the World is as  good as Follett's prior works. I will look forward to reading his next book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I put off reading this book -I heard it was poorly written pornography!  I was hooked on the first page.  Yes there is a lot of kinky sex but I think it overshadows a story of love and redemption.  It seems the most successful Romances have a damaged but wonderful guy who just needs to find the right love to make it better and Fifty Shades is that story.
B008133MDK|4.0|I went through the entire series in a few nights, just a mood I guess and it was cold outside.  I like watching a whole series quickly, I can keep up and remember the &#34;flow&#34; of the show.<br /><br />The characters were fun and the dialogue quick.  Easy to watch and a little comedy thrown in too.
B000669GAI|5.0|All of Pearl Jam&#34;s great hits and then some. I am a recent fan of the group and am enjoying getting to know their work.

B004LOJPLQ|5.0|This movie did a great job of showing the reality of drug addiction and it's affects, not only on the person doing the drugs, but also on the lives of those who care for them. I loved that it was a true story, and that it also had hope. If you are determined you can turn almost anything around.
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this book, and the next one as well. I've preordered the third. I was slightly disappointed with the female lead character, but the main male character is great. Overall it's worth putting with stupidity of her character, because the rest of the book more than makes up for it.

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WAR GAMES THAT I HAVE FOUND. This is a simple interface, and is really impressive. It has many options and is easy to learn. Great graphics, lots of different equipment and buildings. Good social app interface. Even the story line is interesting. Combat against real people makes for a real challenge. Combat resolution is simplified , but offers enough variation to be interesting, I and is clear enough foo newbies. I have paid for war games that I flushed after less than an hour's play this one has a permanent  place on my pad !
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Never before have I grown so addicted to a show in so few episodes. I live for thursdays now. This show is really good okay trust me on this.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I loved this story line and the idea of a world where love is a disease. This dystopian world creates chaos but love still finds a way in no matter what. I would compare this to Divergent and The Hunger Games just because of the chaotic world and the futuristic aspect. A great read for young adults and teens. I would recommend it to a friend.

B00AU15HPC|3.0|I've been enjoying all the reviews of this album, the criticisms as well as the raves. Because it's Justin (Be Still My Heart) Hayward, I have to say it's good. But not really good enough, unfortunately. I'm not much of a country fan, and not much of this album excites me. I'll take songs like \\"Tuesday Afternoon,\\" \\"The Actor\\" and \\"Forever Autumn\\" any time (in fact, I play them daily). But it's Justin (Be Still My Heart) Hayward, so I'm glad it's here. Here's what I find really interesting about all the commentary: Most reviewers don't like the remixes of \\"Out There Somewhere.\\" I love them. Though the Paul Rincon mix is a bit too long for my taste. I'm hoping someone gives me this album because I don't want to buy the entire thing. The one song I am buying is the shorter remixed \\"Out There Somewhere.\\" I plan to choreograph it for my Zumba classes.
1857885082|5.0|Ah, the Brits. You gotta love `em.<br /><br />At least I hope you will, because I'm one. I came here more than a quarter of a century ago with an aim to wipe out foreign accents and bad spelling. I struggled in vain. Nowadays I don't hear American accents anymore and have to watch my emails to Britain to make sure that I say things in words they understand.<br /><br />And so, that brings us to Kate Fox and her book \\"Watching the English.\\" When I first started reading it I was a little dismayed at seeing her speak in a Brit-Sociologist manner, but I got into it very quickly. That's probably due to Kate's sense of humor, and giving the scope of her investigations, you can see why.<br /><br />Where she succeeds is buying not just describing the odd ways we have, but also tying it together in a way a sociologist could. It takes a lot to stand back and see how you're behaving. Many English traits appear to have no rhyme or reason - it seems they are just there to confuse foreigners. What I think that some visitors to the UK think that we go through these routines fully conscious of what we're doing.<br /><br />I can say for certain that it's just not true. One of the male rites of passage is ordering drinks in a pub. I had to learn the way to attract the attention of the barman, by holding up an English pound note. Then, when the barman decided to serve me, I had to remember everything and describe it in a way he could understand. I had no idea why you had to order drinks this way, but I did what I was told.<br /><br />In a way, describing the odd behavior of your fellow citizens is a bit like telling fish about water. It appears there is nothing to say - they swim in it all the time, so why can't they be aware of how things behave? Similarly, it should be easy for people to pick up on their own behavior, but it just ends up with a confused \\"That's how I've always done it.\\"<br /><br />Now, I see one of the reviewers here was accused of sexism. He went to the website of Kate's employer where she's using a picture from at least ten years ago. Why look for pictures? Because this book is clearly about the author, not just the subjects she's studying. I think that everybody builds a mental picture of what she's like. I thought a woman of about 40-50, with unremarkable features so she could blend in during social encounters.<br /><br />In fact, today she's in her late 30s, a tall (but biggish) blonde, and bills herself as a poet, comedienne, and writer. She was described (by a woman) as \\"friendly, enthusiastic and very pretty. Her chumminess and lack of academic snootiness (her specialisms include \\"body image\\" and the meaning of French fries) could suggest banality, but her sharp intelligence and the quality of her research save her.\\"<br /><br />And if you go to her web site (Google \\"Kate Fox\\") , you'll find her reading poetry, and trying to get in shape for a run in her hometown near Newcastle in Northeast England. Her poetry is self-deprecating but I'm sure she'd catch anyone trying sexism on her. Look at the first and last videos on the page called \\"Fox News\\" and you'll be amazed at the quality of her poems (especially \\"Small Girlfriends,\\" that ends every verse with \\"But I'm Five feet Seven, with size 8 feet.\\")<br /><br />So don't over-examine her - just take in the breadth of her observations. I thought that Bill Bryson had us Brits down with his book [[ASIN:0380727501 Notes from a Small Island]], when he talks about being in a pub, listening to advice on how to get to the Southwest, especially from someone called \\"Colin, with a nubby green sweater.\\" I howled at that observation, but I howled even more and for longer reading Kate Fox's book. Get it now - you won't be disappointed.ate's employer where she's using a picture from at least ten years ago. Why look for pictures?

She was described (by a woman) as \\"friendly, enthusiastic and very pretty. Her chumminess and lack of academic snootiness (her specialisms include \\"body image\\" and the meaning of French fries) could suggest banality, but her sharp intelligence and the quality of her research save her.\\"<br /><br />And if you go to her web site (Google \\"Kate Fox\\") , you'll find her reading poetry, and trying to get in shape for a run in her hometown near Newcastle in Northeast England. Her poetry is self-deprecating but I'm sure she'd catch anyone trying sexism on her. Look at the first and last videos on the page called \\"Fox News\\" and you'll be amazed at the quality of her poems (especially \\"Small Girlfriends,\\" that ends every verse with \\"But I'm Five feet Seven, with size 8 feet.\\")<br /><br />So don't over-examine her - just take in the breadth of her observations. I thought that Bill Bryson had us Brits down with his book [[ASIN:0380727501 Notes from a Small Island]], when he talks about being in a pub, listening to advice on how to get to the Southwest, especially from someone called \\"Colin, with a nubby green sweater.\\" I howled at that observation, but I howled even more and for longer reading Kate Fox's book. Get it now - you won't be disappointed.
B006M4F67A|3.0|This is just a Mahjong game, nothing more, nothing less. Nice tiles, easy to read. I would have liked more layouts.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was not  a book I would ever read again or recommend. I found it  painful to switch back and forth from person to person and it. Was childishly predictable
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a great app for the Kindle tablet. It gets you right to your Yahoo mail. Haven't had any issues with using it.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Great for calculating cuts when working in my garage workshop. Quick, no nonsense, and simple to use. I like the layout of the buttons. Very unique in design.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|THIS game will make your ribs sore!Each level is more challenging than the last. Then there are all the accessories to spend your winnings on, which is an education in itself.<br /><br />The sound effects of your neck breaking is too cool ;)<br /><br />-Philly
031603438X|5.0|A great read for music lovers. Very surprised at Keith's reading list. I see home in a different light now.

B0061PEAUY|2.0|too many facts and on and on trivia  Very hard to get into the story and stay with it  Not a favorite
0811879542|5.0|I received this book in record time! The book was &#34;used in new condition&#34; and the seller was true to his printed word. The book looks and feels brandnew. I would definitely order from this person again. The book is too cute. i bought it for a 2 year old and I'm sure she'll love it.
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|I was quite disappointed at the official, untimely, and ugly demise of the not subtle, but high-quality 'Deep Purple like', Black Country Communion band. But guess what? I'm already over it. The original classic band is back. This Deep Purple album has all the elements of classic rock at its finest. This iteration of the line-up carrousel seems to have really settled into a tight quality band. Kudos must be given to the fine production, but Ian Gillian sounds on, Steve Morse and Don Airey now show just the right amount of chops to be impressive without overpowering the song, and Ian Paice and Roger Glover sound bright and tight.<br /><br />This album is more than just a great Deep Purple album, its a great classic rock album.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|i have followed this series from the beginning. the one episode i saw of season 7 was good. i didn't understand the scene where the credit cards were invalid. but ut looks like the series will be entertaining.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this app aint very awsome. usually everything is awsome just not this.you should try survivalcraft  if you love the mojang company. you can even ride horses and camels on survivalcraft

B00AN0KGWE|5.0|The acting, directing, writing & cinematography are amazing.  I really get excited about TV series but this one is so compelling it's unbelievable.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a huge Vince Flynn fan...read every book when it comes out.  Once again he writes a book that is current and keeps me wondering how the plot is going to play out!  Great job!
B002AWX6UM|5.0|An incredible, saddening, and moving firsthand account of a life and struggle we are all too fortunate to ever really comprehend.
B003UAKE9Y|4.0|Very well put together, alittle slow in the beginning, but picks up mid stream.. did keep us watching and kids enjoyed it
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I've attended his concerts and he's amazing.<br />A must see - check him out the next time he's in your area
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|What can 1 say, Grand Slam on this.. Tastefully done, All-Star-Cast and Funny Funny Funny for sure, Made me look at Honey Bees in a whole different way..lol
B00196YNWU|5.0|I watched it with my Grand Daughters over the week-end.  They loved it.<br />They like to sing and know a lot of the songs.<br />Great entertainment!
1452111014|5.0|I love the movie, I've seen it at least six times already and I probably would have seen it more if I didn't stop myself. I wanted to get a good look at the thought process and design behind everything and this book delivered more than I imagined. They go through a bunch of the development of the characters and the different worlds and even share some of the scrapped characters and scenes. There was so much detail and care put into this movie, I did not even realize until I read this book.<br /><br />I hate writing bad reviews and I am glad that I don't have to. I am completely satisfied with this purchase.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have been listening to Metallica since I first heard One back in 1988, so when I heard this new cd I was so freaking psyched, about getting it and it is a welcome addition to my collection, just 3 more cd's and I am done. Cd came quickly and in very good condition, so very happy with my buy can't wait to get the rest of Metallica that I am missing.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved the characters and was really routing for them.  Funny in the right places and serious where it needed to be.  Modern love story and classic romance at the same time.  Will definitely read this author again.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This is a real HOG, just like the other Big Fish games I have on my pc. It has a story, many locations, much backtracking to keep you thinking, and nice, atmospheric graphics. It's not too tough for someone like myself, who just wants to be entertained, yet I think it is absorbing and challenging enough for the slightly more serious gamer. I highly recommend it!
B009T8XBBO|1.0|Screens are too small for smart phone, I couldn't tell what I was doing should come with warning for iPads or larger.
0425263916|5.0|I read the first book and was looking forward to this one. This book didn't let me down! The story line flowed and kept me wanting to read. Great read and I highly recommend it!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The sex scenes were good, but everything else was boring and very redundant. Would I recommend? Maybe; if you like erotica....Maybe.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Good, Real action by Cruise. Not as sneaky as the first two MI's, but still good. I hope they go back to more undercover type stuff in the next one.
B00CI5ET7K|2.0|Let me start by saying Joe has earned the right to do whatever he wants. He has filled my life with amazing music over the last 20 some years and i cant thank him enough. I do think this cd has some great music but in my opinion Mike(the keyboardist) is taking the music in a direction that is unpleasent to say the least. I would loved to have heard how this cd would have been without him.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|i cant wait for there to b a movie on this toooo ! its a good love story with a nice ending
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|I am a big fan of movie music, and anyone who feels the same knows that this is one of the greats.  I would assume anyone reading this review is aware of the music already so I will mention only one thing:  the sound quality is greatly improved, just the intro gong at the prelude is noticeably more lifelike, full, detailed, clearer.  There is a bit more hiss also, but there are details you never heard before.  I really also like the demos.  The opening track actually has some really powerful timpani, actually moreso than the final one, but the brass is much more powerful in the final take.  Its really amazing to see the very first run of these done so well.
141593309X|4.0|The more Gillian Flynn I read, the more I realize that all of her books thus far have focused on hardcore unhealthy relationships. That is the main theme I have found with all of her books. She is a truly remarkable psychological thriller author. She has the ability to really take a reader's mind beyond the ideal mindset, and bring you into the sick and twisted world of the mystery and thriller genre. I think that Flynn is one in her own and has made a place for herself as an incredible writer.<br /><br />Many people didn't feel as great about Sharp Objects as they have other Flynn novels, but I myself think I enjoyed it a little bit more, at least more than Dark Places. Even though the story content is sick and twisted (which doesn't really bother me!), I seemed to find it the easiest to follow and keep up with.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of this book and I thoroughly enjoy being able to sit down and listen to a Gillian Flynn novel, and Sharp Objects was no different. I didn't have a problem keeping my attention with the story and following exactly what was happening at the precise moment it was happening (without having to rewind it a hundred times to get it!) The story flowed smoothly and quickly, but not too fast...just the perfect pace!<br /><br />I felt that Flynn built a great set of characters within Sharp Objects, most that you couldn't stand, but a few that you wanted to see have a decent outcome for their lives. I found that I disliked all of the characters so much in Dark Places, that it made me not care so much for the book, and it was the exact opposite with Sharp Objects. I can't say that I felt emotionally attached to any of the characters, but I felt obliged to find out their ending!<br /><br />Overall, I felt this was one of Flynn's better novels, especially for her debut novel and think that Flynn really has a wonderful gift in writing in the mystery genre!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, challenging puzzles, but not so difficult to make it frustrating.  Can't wait for the next one to be released.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I use this app constantly on my computer it is so much nicer than having to spend the computer memory space on iTunes!
B00008O31H|4.0|Love this one - every track - just crunchy raw bluesy rock. I think this is my overall favorite of the boys
0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist is the first novel by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho and this edition is translated by Alan. R. Clarke. It is the story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearning to travel motivates him to take a chance and search for his destiny. Along the way he encounters a Gypsy, a King, a thief, a merchant, an Englishman, a camel driver, the love of his life, a Tribal Chief and of course, the Alchemist. He leaves Spain, travels to Africa, to the Pyramids, earns money and loses it, and learns about much along the way, including the Soul of the World, The Philosopher's Stone and the Elixir of Life. There is lots of profound wisdom contained in this little story: \\"It's not what enters men's mouths that's evil,\\" said the Alchemist. \\"It's what comes out of their mouths that is.\\" \\"You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it's better to listen to what it has to say.\\" \\"....the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself.\\" Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.\\" \\"There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.\\" \\"...when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.\\" A charming read.
B000MZHW40|5.0|the movie is no play thing or easy to watch sleeper,this puppy keeps your blood pumping from the get go and is quite a testament to a rotten situation occurring in many undeveloped regions. The use of the kids to promote the idiots dumb ideas and too steal them from their parents to work in these cesspools if awful and should be banned in any country that indulges in this corruption. Gives you a really good insight into one of the many worlds we live in...
B000HL09MG|3.0|From a male POV, it's great to see so many beautiful women with amazing bodies. That being said, this is a pretty disturbing film. Costumes as a pretense to having anonymous sex and the images were boring as well as disturbing.  I think that it tries to be more than it is (which is Mediocre.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|Still trying to get my head around this album. I prefer her with a trio doing jazz standards, which this CD isn't. so if you are looking for that incredible Krall sound and get combination of voice and music- keep looking. Maybe this CD will mellow over time or repeated playing....I sure hope so.
B0091REZMW|4.0|good game very nice graphics. good hints. moves. along quickly.  price is right. fun for puzzle people. keeps the mind working while still having. fun
B00005JKBC|5.0|this little film will catch your attention and keep it thru out. Very spell binding and great action. must have in your collection.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This app worked great for a few days, but now when I try to save my coins for more expensive upgrades, it resets them! Very frustrating, would not recommend until they fix the issue. :(
B000FA675C|5.0|This is the first Dan Brown nove that I have read and I couldn't put it down! He kept my interest through the twisting plot all the way to the fantastic ending!
193700788X|2.0|I am so disappointed I don't know if I can put this into words.  I agree with several others here that feel this was written by someone else.  It was so strained and missing all the magic that you have come to expect from Sookie.<br /><br />Other readers, I have to ask.  Was it just me, or was the whole Sam/Sookie sex \\"scene\\" enough to engage your gag reflex??  I literally stopped reading for a moment and laughed out loud.  It was awful.<br /><br />I think the ending was totally ridiculous too.  Eric would have never walked off without a fight.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|An original retelling of Cinderella! I listened to this so I don't remember all the details but I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Prince Kai comes to Cinder to fix his android because he's heard she's the best mechanic around. He's surprised that she's so young and female, but trusts her to fix it since she came so highly recommended. They form a friendship which Cinder is never quite sure about.<br /><br />Cinder is sweet and kind and easy to relate to. She's just a hard working girl who has to give all her profits to her stepmother but she's easygoing and, even though she doesn't like it, she is still kind to her and her stepsisters. She has a plan to leave so she can start living life the way she wants but there are a few kinks in her plan. This book ended in a place where I'm excited to read book 2 but I didn't feel like I had to start it right away.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|Black Dog Barking is the best Airbourne ablum yet.  There isn't one bad song on it.  In my opinion, every song on it is good enough to be a single.  If you like Airbourne's other two albums, there is no reason you won't love this one.  GET IT!!!
0151003084|5.0|I love Edward Gorey. I already own a few of his books and wanted to add to my collection. It's cheap and it's one of my favorites by him. I would not recommend it for kids, as the entire book is about death.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Great show, pretty graphic so not for the feint or weak stomached. But overall well worth it and loved every episode, support it
B004HHKFIY|5.0|this are really well done and durable. My grandkids have several chagginton's train and they were so happy to add brewster.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|My son had a need for an advanced calculator and the recommended one was $80. I happened to catch this on the FAOTD, so I gave it a try. It had all the features he needed for class, so, I got it for his phone.  He's been happy all year.
B00003W8NM|4.0|The movie works great. The odd thing was that the movie was wrapped in shrinkwrap and when I opened it, there was a pocket for some papers but the papers were gone. Other than that everything was perfect.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I really enjoy playing this game and all the dash games. This one would get more stars if it wasn't for 1 thing! Every once in a while it on its own erases all my previous game data on its own!!! Please fix!!
