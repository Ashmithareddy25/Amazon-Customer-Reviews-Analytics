B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is very fun for my daughter and I to play together. We enjoy the challenges and cute imagery. Five stars!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Trying not to give away any of this book, this was an exciting read with unexpected twists and amazing detail. It was a little scary to see some of yourself in these characters. I couldn't put this one down and tried to read as fast as I could to get to the end. I wanted justice! However, this one did not end as expected. For a moment I was trying to decide if I hated the book because it didn't have the ending \\"I wanted\\", but then reflecting on this whole ride, the ending was rather fitting for the characters.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|One of my very favourites, especially at Christmas.  Wonderful cast.  Fantastic music. Heart warming and uplifting at any time of year.
B0031R5K7M|5.0|its amazing i am looking forward to the next book. I will tell others of this book and the previous ones i have read.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I am learning so<br /><br /> many new words about everything about the United states' language. It is actually so fun to learn!
B008XG1X18|5.0|So addicted to this app! Although I get this strange &#34;you have met your limit&#34; message, that I find very odd. Still love the app though and use it on a regular basis.
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|She still hasn't fully learned the train table we got her for christmas but she loves Chuggington and loves the great little wooden characters. She has all 3 of the main characters.
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|I had to use my computer to watch the movie and the computer only offered SD.  There was HD available only for Roku, XBox 360, etc.  So the quality was lacking a bit, due to the SD.<br /><br />Other than that, the movie was pretty good.  A lot of action in it!  Not a bad story line either!  I would watch it again - using my Roku...lol
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love the awsome words that help me and you. The other words  are the best best  Oxford amarican words.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|I gave it five stars for casting, acting, setting, and of course the story. It was not just a typical murder mystery but developed the lives of the characters as well.  I found it interesting and provocative.  Plus there was a little naughtiness but all in good taste.
B004Q0SQ24|5.0|She still hasn't fully learned the train table we got her for christmas but she loves Chuggington and loves the great little wooden characters. She has all 3 of the main characters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the variety of games available. Very flexible skill levels, so that I can compete with my grandchildren. And sometimes I actually win!
B00499K9E0|5.0|Riveting, masterminded, and exceptional. The best, best, version of Sherlock Holmes, by Sir Conan Doyle that you will ever find. This is a must-see, even if you are not a Sherlock fan and just want some thrilling, clever, and cinematic  thing to watch. This is probably going to be even more than you anticipated. Happy viewing for those that have not yet seen it (I will give nothing away). And for those who have seen it, I'm sure you all can agree.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a well put together book. I laughed quite a bit during and was intrigued throughout. I would love to see this turn into a movie.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Great music! The packaging is great! I would recomened this item to any one who likes good music and sound!
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|Indepth view of Harrison's life.  Long, but well worth the time for any fan. Photos, interviews and imagery well done.
B008133DO8|5.0|Season 2 is just as thrilling, clever, and riveting as Season 1. Again, this production by BBC of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the best, best, best version you will find outside of the text. I completely recommend Season 2 (as I completely recommended Season 1) for anyone that is a fan of Sherlock and for those that are not. This is a must-see. It is witty, thrilling, action-filled, and dramatic. I will not give anything away of the stories, but it is surely appealing for viewers of all genres.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Ridiculous.  So bad I didn't even finish it and I usually like Mark Wahlberg.<br />Don' waste your time and money!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks has always managed to make his readers feel as though you are a part of the story & this book was no exception!! This book contains the element of romance and suspense that make it impossible to stop reading. I was so sad when the book was over. I can't wait to see the movie in February! Highly recommend this book to all readers.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Daniel Craig continues his brutish portrayal of James Bond (definitely Connery-esque.) The movie sets a quick pace from the opening scene on through out the movie. Craig is my favorite second only to Connery (although a very close second.) This is a 007 must see.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|i check The Weather Channel app on my Kindle Fire in hopes that it will provide a different but better forecast than I'd heard from other sources....I have found that it was easy to use and always provided accurate information whether it's what I wanted to hear or not!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing and so emotional. It really hits you...nothing is ever stated right out...it makes you really think!
B008M721MS|4.0|excelente uno de los mejores juegos que e jugado entretiene y divierte excelente para los niños y adolescentes  incluso adultos que lo deseen jugar
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The movie was ok. It had good action sequences, and they did a decentg job of transitioning from Jason Bourne to Aaron Cross. definitely worth renting for the plane ride home or a lazy Winter's day.
B00005JLEU|5.0|While this artist's work was made popular in the States by Pixar mastermind John Lassiter, there is a genuine quirkyness and so much creative courage in Miyazaki's work that you would be hard pressed to find in any Pixar or Disney movie. These films, while often sweet and melancholy, are not afraid to explore the dark side of childhood, fears and obsessions that children have to come to terms with. In this case, it's the first hint of discovering your own identity, independent from your parents, that you have to form and embrace. Spirited Away is empowering to kids and miraculous for all ages.
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|WOW.. What a GREAT MOVIE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS &#34;AS A MUST SEE MOVIE&#34;!!! BREATHE TAKING AND SHOCKING AT THE SAME TIME!
0374533571|5.0|I haven't read fiction in ages and Silver Linings Playbook turned out to be a true page-turner, can't-put-it-down, can't-wait-to-get-back-to-the book sort of read. It is simply a great story that has the bonus of being well written and does, as other reviewers point out, offer hope - not Rebecca of SunnyBrooke Farm optimisim but an authentic sense of life's positive possibilities.  Add a dash of humor and the flutters of an original and believable romance, and you have a gem that is as better/different as the wonderful movie it inspired.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This wasn't a bad movie for a plane ride, but it had its flaws. The pacing was choppy, and it was difficult to feel for the characters. The action sequences weren't bad; they just weren'y particularly good either. A good selection if there is nothing else to select.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|The idea of a raunchy teddy bear was very creative and provided some good laughs. At the same time it portrayed the struggle to grow up and take responsibility for your life.
B001G0MFOM|2.0|WELL I loved the show.. but the Final Season .. STUNK! It was like a bunch of Girls . .whom didnt know anything.... the Writter should of ended with something more creative!
B000YHG72E|4.0|Great Christmas movie to watch with the kids.  Wouldn't recommend it for adults only.  It's Will Ferrell all the way.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I personally think this is one of the best books I have read in a long time!  It keeps you guessing and you don't<br />know what's going to happen next. I loved the characters. I just do not understand the necessity for<br />ALL that cussing. The story was abosolutly wonderful. I understand that it says harsh language, but why is it needed? I almost stoped reading it because of that. I know my opinion doesn't really matter, I just wish authors would take that into consideration. I would have rated it a 5 if not for that :(
B0063IH60K|4.0|it's a fun game and easy to download and easy to play.  I do wish I could download &#34;Sweet Tooth&#34; to play.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|I have watched this movie numerous times.  I am pleased with my purchase.  I am amazed how they could have made this movie.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|Not sure why it's called a hospital when it clearly is a pawspital, but that's besides the point. This is a good educational game for youngsters and those of us who remain young at heart. Dr Panda has to take care of the sicky animals that come to the pawspital for help. Very cute. Not sure how long it'll hold anyone's interest, but it's well done.
B0058YPL66|2.0|Bought it for girlfriend for Christmas... now I'm hooked.  I thought it was gonna be some cheesy show..  I was wrong!!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It is most enjoyable to browse ebay on my Kindle.  I find it easy to navigate around the site.  I would recommend it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|lots of fun. looking for part 2. would recommend to anyone that is looking for something fun. the game actually scared me on some parts.
B0085YNML2|4.0|This game is similar to Froad but I like this one better -- it moves around the screen more and the graphics are better. Froad got boring real fast. But this one held my interest longer and is funner to play. Fun grab all the critters with that rubbery tongue. Kinda cute and quirky too. I like it well enough. Graphics and physics are great. Top shelf programming, just not sure how often I'll play.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Loved the interview format, many stories give a general idea of what is happening, some are amazing. Im glad this will turn out to be a film but as far as that go I would rather watch &#34;The Remaining&#34; from D.J. Molles: less hollywood bang, much more story and reality.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|my family loved it and i did too ! ! !! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B00064VR0W|5.0|If you're a Rod fan, this is a great show.  Nice mix of songs and some great guest performances (especially Amy Belle).  Rod seems like he is enjoying himself and that always makes for a better performance to watch.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|I know this is just a Christmas edition, but I didn't see anything here that'll make me play this over Smule Magic Piano. I even downloaded the regular (free) version of Piano Master, and I wasn't all that impressed; you get a few songs to start, but after that, everything costs money. At least Smule had a way to collect points for free songs. And their selection of MJ tunes seemed better. Unlike Smule, this one does mimic a real piano, if that's important to you. But if I wanted to play a real piano, then I wouldn't be wasting my time with an app. It's well done, I just prefer Smule.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|Best atr album ever. Much better than their new stuff and their old stuff. Dont hesitate to buy it, you wont regret it.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I do not misplace a red cover! Not only does it function well but one would-be thief thought I had a Bible with me.
B005XN31LY|5.0|Great product at a great price. Fast shipment. Love the show and happy to have it and watch it again. Thank you, A+++++
B007N5YIUS|5.0|For a franchise that is in danger of becoming a victim of its own success, Angry Birds sure is doing a great job of remaking itself and staying fresh and fun. It's no wonder this is considered the gold standard for all apps to live up to. Angry Birds Space really is innovative and fun. They've reimagined their own format to come up with something entirely new, yet familiar enough to keep avid fans happy. The gravity is outstanding and clearly this must have inspired the move to make the Star Wars edition. It's one of the few (non-word) apps that I installed on my tablet first, yet still finds a way to keep my interest. Though, I still have yet to get a paid version. It's fun, but I guess not enough to make me splurge a couple bucks on every new iteration. Worthwhile download though and fun distraction.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|It was just what I had been looking for.  The music is incredible.  One I'll be playing over and over again.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I love THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE COMPLETE TALES OF TERROR. Sher[ock Holmes and Moby Dick were my favorite books 60 years ago. Now I have a woman's voice reading when my eyes get tired. Wonderful.
B004499LX0|5.0|I love any movie with Julia Roberts but this one was awesome. It's intense. Definitely worth purchasing. I watch it all the time
B00A4TKDKY|3.0|I'm a fan of Buddy and have started my collection. I always enjoy Live Blues as they lend themselves to extended guitar licks. The music is typical Buddy - good stuff. But could we keep it a bit cleaner? The opening track is an introduction to Buddy Guy &#34;one of the best f#@%ing guitar players...&#34; So now I my kids can't listen in on dad's blues. Sorry - could have done without the profanity.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Oddly addicting game.  Very fun and easy to play.  Give me more coins so i can play longer and longer!!
B0096C7QF0|5.0|I purchased the blu-ray of this, it was my first exposure to Joe. I have not been this excited about someone in a long time. He incorperates all the great sounds for those of us that are 60's & 70's aged or branded remembering our first Led Zeppelin album and others. All I can say is I could not imagine anyone being dissapointed with this calibar of music from Joe. He is really on to something here. I  am now gathering and listenening to his earlier work and looking at what he may be doing in the future. When I think about the loss of Stevie Ray and others, its so special we are graced with someone from this age group with such talent. The cast of players he has around him is just as exciting, what a package. I will end this by saying enjoy as I listen to ZZ top, oh yeah you will hear that in Joes work...Joes parents really have sent Joe on an exciting path and are no doubt so proud of him. Will be listening and waiting for what comes next, his guest on stage are just as exciting cant wait! Check out Black Country Communion just in case you find yourself looking for more....
B009KHBDUU|5.0|Tim Burton did it again, another classic with an excellent cast.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, good story line, superbly cast and constantly moving.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So good!!<br />Couldn't stop reading it. Couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the next one! Have fun!
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I was upgrading my DVD collection to BD and got a great deal on this from Amazon.  I was a bit torn on buying it since it includes the trilogy (RotLA, ToD, and LC) and that other movie (we won't name it.)  In my mind I like to pretend there was never a fourth Indy film, but this set reminds me that isn't true.  I wish Spielberg had taken his own advice and left Indy in a museum and not revived him for a 4th film.  Having said all that, the set is very nice, has lots of extras, and is presented very well.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|it works really good and is also easy to configure. i only got it because it was on sale . you know with google drive and dropbox sync. it is a lot easier  to get to my files and music. anyway like i said if you're planning on getting a remote desktop app, then this one is the one to get.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|The director Nicholas Evans,  sought a venue for his latest cyber-nanotechnological theory.  Sadly unlike the Coen brothers, it wasn't rooted in solid physical concrete production design nor did it consider the viewers, innocent babes, seeing it for the first time.  I'm a screenplay writer, with one optioned project,  have watched movies non stop since age 9 with family and friends, lived and worked in NYC as a professional writer, but don't know how this got produced, unless Knob Leonardo deCaprio fronted most of the geld. Oh, whoops!  Look at those credits!  Here, let's throw in some car chase sequences, stern visaged close ups, home theme,,,,aw[...] vacuous dialogue.....zippo emotional content because it is, Leonardo....sans the heart of a real lion.  Save your money and go to the zoo.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Chevy Chase is very funny.  This is a good Christmas movie for adults.  I always enjoy this movie every Christmas
B005KR6NJU|4.0|The first two seasons of the Clone Wars are my favorite so far.  The price and packaging for season 1 are great.  The episodes look great on BD and the menus are easily navigable.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Thor is an excellent film you and your whole family will enjoy! I enjoy collection all kinds of films like action, adventure, romance, mysteries, superheroes, fantasy, ect. Thor is about a selfish god who had bad behavior and he is banded from his home and is banished to Earth where he meets a mortal and falls for her then his brother trys to reason with their father that he has changed but their father won't listen so his brother send things down to earth to try to get rid of his brother to become king and at the end Thor returns home and destroys the bridge so no one can cross again. Your family would enjoy it watch it is worth buying it or even renting it!
1451695195|4.0|Dr. Alexander is a church (episcopal church) goer, but he was not religious. As a neurosurgeon he is more scientific in his approach to life than religious. So when he hears of NDE's from his patients, he would listen but don't really take them seriously.<br /><br />Dr. Eben Alexander is a respected and distinguished neurosurgeon who suddenly got ill with a rare and severe case of  E. coli meningitis.  He went on a deep coma for almost a week and survived.  While his body was in coma he went on his near death experience (NDE), where he saw the core, the gateway, brightness, darkness, higher beings and others.<br /><br />Now he is a believer of the spiritual realm as he calls it.  That the very fabric that make up the spiritual realm is love, compassion and acceptance.<br /><br />If you are not extremely religious or extremely scientific in your approach to the \\"after death\\" topic.  This would be a book, you can enjoy.  It is easy read and you get to learn some things about meningitis, about what Dr. Alexander saw and feel while in heaven and about his life as well.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Poorly written at times but overall, compelling and original. The main character can seem unusually obtuse but I guess that is necessary to further the plot.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This is exactly what I needed for my tablet.  I was tired of having a handful of &#34;free&#34; apps to do a similar job.  This interface is very streamlined and intuitive and makes working with/creating Office docs very easy.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Bought it for my wife for Christmas. All the discs were intact and in working order. It came still in the wrapping. Excellent price as well.
B00328R21C|5.0|This is a great kit, the minifigures are great.  However, I have a store (won't tell you where but it is a Walmart) that I go to every post-Christmas.  This kit was going for $12, among 10-12 other sets from different lines at 33% to 60% off.  Gandolf arrives was $9, Mines of Moria $54, Jabba's Palace $79.  Look around, find a great store to go to for this time of year, and remember it.  This is the 4th year I have found awesome deals (last year, the entire Ninjago line was 50% off).  Forget the 3rd party gougers!
B004FPLJOW|1.0|I Bought This Movie Cuz I Was A Fan Of The First Three. And I Was So Disappointed. The Death Scenes Were So Unbelievably Un Realistic And The Cast Was Sucky. Take My Advice Do Not, I Repeat Do Not Buy This Movie! The Fact The Overall Rating Is Like 4 Stars Blows My Mind. The Final Destination 5 Is Better Though I Wil Say That. Save Your Money On This One Folks.
B0025KW29U|4.0|I love Nathan Fillion and am a huge Firefly fan (not to mention Slither.)  However, I just could not get into this.  My daughter (and most other people) love it, though, so she got it as a gift.  It's cute, just not my thing.
B000NDETLK|5.0|I'm a big fan of Felicity Jones. Due to certain circumstances, I have 2 different dvds of this same felicity Jones movie. The PBS Master Theater Classic and the Region 2 (UK import). First one is for the US market and the 2nd one is an import that plays only on region free DVD players. PBS really short changed us by cutting out 7 min. of scenes and provided no subtitles, whereas the UK import had no cuts and did have subtitles.<br />I did have a region free DVD player (Pioneer DV-610AV) that I ordered from Amazon.com.  Without the cuts and with subtitles made this import dvd much more enjoyable to watch. Excellent DVD.  What was not excellent were the reviews for this Region 2 (UK import) DVD. The reviews were out of place. They were supposed to be for a movie with Felicity Jones, but  instead, most of them were referenced towards the BBC movie with K. Schlesinger and P. Firth. Having not seen this BBC version, I am not able give a review. However, a big percentage of the reviewers gave negative responses. A big number  of the reviewers for the Felicity Jones  movie were mainly positive giving it  an average rating of 4 stars. All in all. the region 2 (UK import ) DVD of this Northanger abbey with Felicity Jones is very good.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Done in a couple days. I didn't want to put it down. I always wanted to know what was next
B00APUQH0W|3.0|its a good story line but you can read into the movie from the start but its clint eastwood,,,how can you resist not wanting to watch,
B009MCRHH6|3.0|My teenage daughter sat down and played the game for about an hour on my tablet and really enjoyed it.  She has similar taste in games as I do and can be pretty picky, especially when it comes to mobile apps, so that's a pretty good indication that it is a good game.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The book is great and ready to read the final book that apparently is not available for purchase until this summer....
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It's great to have a scientist finally support the existance of NDE, but on the flip side...due to the fact that the author is a neurosurgeon the writing is understandable, but somewhat straining on the 'average joe.'  I guess that's to be expected.  But thank you, DR Alexander, for standing up for NDE and not clamming up due to the pressure you must receive from others in the medical field.
B009B50QOU|5.0|The vinyl version is quite nice! I listen to it all the time! Much better than CD or digital MP3
B001EN71CW|4.0|If you don't own this or haven't seen Firefly just buy it and you'll be very pleased.  This is one of the most original series I've seen in years.  It looks great in HD and has a variety of extras that make it even better.
B006J420T0|4.0|I upgraded a low power AMD A4-3400 (Dual core) to the 3670K for the extra 2 cores and unlocked multiplier to allow for extra clock speed bumps while maintaining the efficient APU architecture. While it won't match Intel's i3 in computing power, the AMD APU line gets the benefits of on-die Radeon graphics. The unlocked multipler allowed me to easily bump the CPU clock to 3.1 Ghz on the stock cooler with no issues. The APU is the centerpiece for my HTPC which features the Ceton Infini TV digital tuner, blu ray drive, and media software for all my theater needs. The graphics are sufficient and the \\"cool n' quiet\\" technology throttles the CPU as necessary for power savings. H/W Monitor shows my power footprint at 22W at idle/low computing.<br /><br />System Specs:<br />Gigabyte A75M-D2H<br />AMD A6-3670K @ 3.1 Ghz<br />8 GB DDR3-1600<br />Ceton InfiniTv 4<br />Samsung Bluray Drive<br /><br />I would recommend this processor, but with the newer APU lineup featuring Radeon 7000 graphics and \\"Trinity\\" architecture, its hard to sell. The $80 is valuable since most HTPC needs don't require high computing needs or graphical requirements (unless gaming). The unlocked multiplier is a great feature allowing easy user overclocking via BIOS tweaks. This feature is also featured in the newer APU \\"Trinity\\" lineup.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Its getting Better and Better, now whith jason and percy acting together its all action<br />Great book<br />Recomend to every one
0756697875|5.0|Has sections on Lego Batman and the newer DC Super Heroes (featuring Batman)... mixed in between the pics and info on all the sets are two page comic-book style tales.  A neat character checklist at the back of the book was a nice touch.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|It's a platform type game that runs well enough, but isn't entertaining enough to really grab my attention.  I've yet to find an Android app in this genre that I really like.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Since this is a review of the DVD quality and not a movie review, I am giving this 5 stars. This was my first time to see the movie, and I had mixed feelings about the movie itself. I would rate the move about a 3.5 out of 5. DVD quality was just fine, though.
B00797MB0O|4.0|Quite a wonderful movie, but be prepared to have your emotions travel from one end of the stick to the other, watching Theron's character make her journey. It's not just the physical trip and its implications and misconceptions, but the excruciating journey of self-discovery while stuck in the haze (and maze) of an alcohol-induced fantasy world that will make you cringe and groan. The acting is truly great and the characters well defined--so much so that the movie \\"took me in\\", as though I was a part of it. This is not a comedy though--it should be in the drama section. I truly loved watching this film. Throughout the movie, more than anything else, I just wanted to rescue that dog!
0393088731|4.0|In my opinion, Irvine Welsh does not disappoint; this book is no exception.  Not quite as strong a book as Porno, but an excellent prequel to Trainspotting nevertheless.  Begbie's presence is not felt as much as in Trainspotting or Porno, which is a shame as he is one of my favorites of Welsh's characters.  Despite this, this book is everything wonderful that I have come to expect from Irvine Welsh.
B00138KKP8|4.0|Hard to describe Ray's style or genre - It's gritty but soulful. Frankly, it's worth buying just for 'Trouble' and 'Jolene' - especially at the present $5.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|First off, the movie was terrific.  Such raw emotion (especially IMHO Anne Hathaway)  Go see it! This music does not seem to translate well as a cd.  You need to be watching as well as listening. Also, it's missing the first rendition of &#34;Angry Men&#34; (I can't remember what the true title is. Sorry), which we liked very much.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers has it all; there is great actions, dialogue, scenery, and characters.  Lieutenant Speirs is probably my favorite--he's something of a legend.  I quickly felt attached to the characters and the bond between them seems real.  You can't go wrong with this box set.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great read by Clancy. Pace in the book is typically Clancy - a fast read with a lot of action.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|From what I have learned from a few Navy Seals and those that advanced beyound, the stories seemed accurate and consistent.  It was a good insight into the training and mentality whether or not the story Owen told of of Bin Laden's capture was accurate or not. These guys are true heros.  I just wish the military would take as much care to transition them back to civilian life when their service time is done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hadn't heard of the hunger games trilogy until the movie came out. Having no clue as to what the movie was about I watched it with a friend who also hadn't read the book but was interested with the previews. I fell in love with the movie and plot, so I decided reading the book was a must! I loved it! So well written, an amazing plot, such an interesting concept. I could hardly put the book down and the intensity had me so caught up in the plot I was even having dreams about this book! I would definitely recommend this book as another series too add to your list!
B007MDB548|5.0|This is the best in this series of Disney fairy stories.  Our entire family with 5 kids aged 3-11 plus the adults were entertained!  I highly recommend this one as appropriate for all ages.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of my favorite books can't wait to re-read! So glad a friend suggested it. Totally worth buying, you won't be able to put it down
B008OOYALE|4.0|I would give this game five stars but, sometimes the screen turns all blue and I cant see what I'm doing its really annoying.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ever since it was published in 2005, I have marveled over how well researched and even handed the treatment of Lincoln and his rivals William Seward, Salmon P. Chase and Edward Bates was. Doris Kearns Goodwin knows her subject and presents it in an objective, yet sympathetic fashion. A must read for Lincoln scholars and students of American history.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|I just love this movie.  It's gets better with each viewing.  Great message too.  Highky recommed this movie.  Get It!
B000FC10QG|5.0|Great story, reads like one as well. A must read for people who enjoy business books. Incredible amount of research went into this one to have the angles from so many different players.
B008GJV8BW|5.0|Excellent plot and dialogue, like an old Bogart film - requires some attention and provides more than chases and explosions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is good, but with the new updates it will be great!<br />New Update Features:<br />·Possible Infinite Terrain<br />·More blocks/materials<br />·Improoved interface<br />·Online Multiplayer (pay for online severs)<br />·Parent Contol (for all you parents)<br />·Longer view distance (Beta)<br />·Fancier Graphics (Beta)<br /><br />Mojang claims that this will be released near the end of May.<br /><br />This game is definitely worth it!<br />I paid 8.99 7 months ago but now it's 3.99<br /><br />-Great Game
B004I2K4DY|3.0|Out family has always enjoyed the music and story of this video.  This was a gift to an artist friend.

B000MRAAJW|1.0|HD DVD didn't work in my HD DVD player, or a regular player, or a blu-ray player. that's what I get I guess
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It is rare that I chose to read a suspense thriller type book, and I probably wouldn't have chosen to read this book had it not been one of the books selected by the book club I'm in. Can't say how glad I am that it made the list! I was instantly sucked into the book right from the start and could not put it down I finished it in one day.I would definitely recommend this book!
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I've watched Amazon Instant Video before without any problems, so I rented this movie. Then I found that, like Comcast, Amazon has apparently switched to a version of Adobe's player that's incompatible with the browser version I have to use with my considerably-less-than-new Mac. I couldn't download the version of the player Amazon required, so I thought I couldn't watch the movie on Amazon, and though I looked and looked, I could find nothing that would allow me to cancel the rental. So I paid Amazon for a rental, but watched the movie elsewhere. This was disappointing, because I love Amazon and was happy to discover Instant Video several months ago.<br /><br />I'm updating this to say that since I initially wrote my review, I found that I could download an older version of the player Amazon's using and still watch movies, here. It would have been nice if Amazon had let me know I could use an older version of the player, but I'm still happy.<br /><br />As far as the movie that I had to watch elsewhere goes, I thought Moonrise Kingdom was okay, but not great. I'd read some fabulous reviews and came away wondering why.
0439023521|3.0|This book doesn't seem to hold my interest like the movie might.  It may be more suited for someone younger than I.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I like the characters, the personalities of the characters and the way they like get in each h others minds.
B0000X2DMA|5.0|First saw the studio recording of this on YouTube, and was amazed. So I bought the album and its just fantastic. Epica incorporates the orchestra nicely in each song...<br /><br />Simone Simon has a beautiful voice, I'd say right up there with Tarja...with the rest of the band members and orchestra you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Enjoy the music .
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Loosely based on the real story of writer/director Nicole Conn (&#34;Claire of the Moon&#34; and &#34;Cynara&#34;), this is an incredibly sexy and romantic tale of a straight wife who realizes she's attracted to her new friend, a lesbian writer.  Her  unexpected crush on a woman is shocking enough but her pastor husband and his congregation are hardly the forgiving folks they portray themselves to be.  Necar Zadegan (&#34;24,&#34; &#34;Emily Owens, M. D.&#34;) as the wife and Traci Dinwiddie (&#34;Supernatural&#34;) as the writer are both jaw-droppingly gorgeous and give us the hottest love scenes I've ever experienced on film.  And who could resist watching these two lose themselves in the Longest Cinematic Kiss Ever Filmed?  I melt each time I see it, which is every two or three days if you must know (and every other day, if I tell the truth).  Yes, &#34;Elena Undone&#34; is THAT good.  And I haven't even mentioned the hip-rocking soundtrack supervised by Jennifer Corday.  That'll have to wait for another time--the movie's just starting...
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an awesome read that is non-stop, edge of your seat suspense! I couldn't put it down! Highly recommended!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|It is a great game! We enjoy playing it very much though it is tough to turn the game over after the half way.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I'll admit I was skeptical of this game at first but I found my self 3 hours later and my battery is dead I'm like wow this is a good game. The only con I have is that it drains battery like no tomorrow. 30 mins with it and it down to 70% from 100% truly a good game
B005HSG3TC|3.0|It seems not very sturdy it's hard to put in the case and stand it up which would be easier to play games on it instead of holding it in your hands. Might look for something else to replace it with
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book was heart wrenching yet insanely inspiring at the same time. This story shows the strength and endurance  behind pure survival, forcing yourself to send hope  and prayers to Jaycee Dugard....and all that she may face in the future, she truly deserves the world and enough love to help heal, and fill the void of her lost years.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Purchased this because I wanted it when it released..love the artist and her work and did not want the lines in the stores
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It was not a super great book and I want to borrow a super great book instead so I would have been a bit more better with a super great book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So beautiful and raw. I read it in one sitting and it brought tears to my eyes. Charlie is one of the most beautiful characters I've ever learned about.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Me and my Grand Daughter loved this. Wonderful story, fun and exciting. Want to watch again so plan on purchasing the DVD.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The only thing that I was mad about was that I could have gone to best buy the week it came out and gotten it for $10 instead of 30.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It was a useful tool for learning but it was not a super great book and I would like a super great book instead but it was very useful.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|what a good movie, great harmonica playing in this flick
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great book.  Looking forward to reading the third one.  E L James is a great writer.<br />You really can't put the book down.  A Great Read.
B009369Z8A|5.0|The only thing I was mad about was that I could have gone to best buy the week it came out and gotten it for $10 instead of almost $40. Everything works great! Got the download just fine and both disks worked.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Beautiful. Simply beautiful. A life-changing book. Which is an understatement and I feel the word \\"book\\" doesn't live up to this.
B001E75QH0|5.0|how could you go wrong with Indiana Jones
B009A87X80|5.0|Cassidy possessed a supremely expressive voice, and reinterpreted familiar songs in fresh, lyrical ways -- her version of \\"Fields of Gold\\" is a knockout, full of pain and beauty.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Lo único que me impide dejar las cinco estrellas es que algunas veces el sonido en español cambia de volumen, pero sigue siendo bueno.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Well this book transformed the way  I perceive people and things. It is amazing, beautiful and makes you see in a different light of things in life and just  in general. So if you're just bored and looking for a really good book to read this is one of them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Once I purchased this book I couldn't tear my eyes away. Hoover masterfully sucks you in and will leave you feeling emotionally changed for life. If I head to recommend one book for the rest of my life it would be this one. Well done!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I love this TV show! I didn't think I would but I started watching it right before the 2nd season came out and now I'm hooked. I was a little disappointed with the zombie head case the DVD came in. Someone said it was life size but it isn't and it also feels a little cheap.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I felt everything that each character felt.  It was strange to feel what they felt during the moment of their interludes!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it omg its so good I finish the book in a day and a half I couldn't stop . I think I'm going to sleep now :)
B007HACDLK|5.0|I would definately recommend this thriller to anyone.  It was well written as are all of Vince Flynn's novels.  I did not want to put it down.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|This was a good movie, I haven't read the books but I hear they're also good. Jennifer Lawrence was great and I look forward to the next movies.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I love the computer version, don't get me wrong, but this one is not very enjoyable. When you play creative mode, its nothing but you and your building. Definitely not worth $7. I wish I could get a refund.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game reminds me a lot of the farming type games on facebook. It is a nice to pass some time. I have had no problems with it though.<br /><br />No complaints it was free
B006H3MJ7G|5.0|The Cd was delivered earlier than the expected date.  And it was just like I bought it out of a store. Great quality, sounds great and I love Prince Royce so it was a great experience for me!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I didn't want to see this movie at first but my girlfriend did, so I decided to get it for her. It was much better than I thought it would be and Kristen Stewart actually does a good job. It's an interesting take on Snow White.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is my favorite book in the series! I had always wanted her to end up with peeta. Good quick read.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The acting was pretty much flawless in this picture, although it was one of the few times when I felt that Meryl Streep was not 100% convincing in a role.  She was only about 98% convincing.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is truly a wonderful book!!! I loved it I am sad it's over! Truly the be st book ever!!!!
B004LWZW7O|4.0|It's not a great movie in my opinion. It was entertaining overall but the message seemed a little extreme. My girlfriend liked it so I got it for her.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I like it because I can learn  languages and other languages too and you can to if you like to read.
0446580848|5.0|Nelson DeMille isa good friend of mine and has my name in &#34;Nightfall&#34;.  His best books by far are, &#34;Word Of Honor&#34; and &#34;Spencerville.&#34;
0307739961|5.0|I chose this rating because i couldn't put the book down and read it in about two days.  It is exciting and thrilling and keeps you glued to your seat.  It is the kind of book you want to read on a loong cross Atlantic airplane ride when you can't sleep for 15 hours.  I read the trilogy all at once so the same goes for all of them.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is a great movie in my opinion. All the actors do a great job and it's just a really entertaining movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have read this entire seiries and every time I read them they get better. I really love this book and recommend this book to everybody you will not regret spending the money.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|These are some of my favorite games.  Flower is my favorite.  These games are so unique.  Definitely worth buying you won't be disappointed.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Enjoyed this book.  Well written.  Thought provoking.  Will capture your attention.<br /><br />Quick read that you will enjoy.  I recommend this book without hesitation.
1401207529|5.0|I bought this because of its critical acclaim and I gave it to my girlfriend for Christmas. She's a Batman fan so I'm sure she'll love it when she gets around to reading it.<br /><br />The book arrived in awful condition (it was in a padded envelope, not a box, so it had a fold when it arrived. This isn't a detraction from the RATING, but it was really disappointing to have to press the book back into shape before I could wrap it.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has made this story very engrossing. In such a short format he manages character development and plot development very well.  As a huge fan of his, I am probably a little biased, but I think anyone would enjoy this short story with it's intriguing plot and concept.
1419705849|5.0|My son began reading this as soon as he opened it Christmas morning.  Seems to be just as popular with him as the previous books in the series.
0307450570|5.0|This is a very comprehensive craft manual. If you can make it at home it's in here! I loved it.
B0083SBM7Q|2.0|I loved this movie, but the Blu Ray in the two-disc set has an unacceptable dialogue level on my television.  I do not have this issue with any other Blu Ray or DVD in my collection.  We had to crank the volume up to 75 just to hear the dialogue and my kids were still asking me to repeat many of the characters' lines (we typically have the volume set between 12 and 20).  We constantly turned down the volume during high-action scenes to keep it close to a consistent level.  We also have a home theater set up with a newer receiver, and I had to turn the center channel balance all the way up.<br /><br />I don't see this mentioned in other reviews but I don't think I have a defective disc because all other aspects are perfect.  We were all anxiously awaiting this movie but were distracted and disappointed with the sound levels.
1904994679|4.0|This is a fun book for when you are sitting around with not much to do.  Lots of neat and really weird facts.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great time killer and my daughter loves it too so does my two year old niece. she played if all day while we were on a trip
B0079R8IYW|1.0|It should not have broken already.  would not recommend it to anyone or buy another We bought 3 this was the pink one.  Should have known the price was too good to be true
B0027ZCQ4E|5.0|All good a great movie suspense and mystery.  A good movie.  Too many words to complete this review.  All good
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Enjoyed the story line, but as the season progressed it seemed like the use of the f word was heard more and more.
B005HSL626|5.0|The game is a lot of fun.  It is easy and fun to play.  Fun fun fun fun fun fun
B003O86FMW|5.0|Defiantly worth buying. It will not disappoint you! Just as good as the first book. I would recommend it to anyone!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Fun book that is pretty typical romance with a little twist to it. It was a fun quick read that was good entertainment.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Very funny from start to finish but really raunchy. If you like Seth McFarlane's style of humor and think Family Guy is too tame, this is the movie for you. It helps that &#34;Ted's&#34; voice is similar to Brian from Family Guy.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Stephen Amell knows how to act.  That is always a plus.  While it is lovely to watch him training against the bad guys, also being able to appreciate the nuances to his situation is an added bonus.  Some of the relationships need to develope more.  Like his interactions with his sister.  She's lovely and talented, but their dialoge is always the same.  Same with Lauren and her work assistant.  Let's expand their interactions to go beyond judements and complaining!
B009E3EY38|3.0|Played disc #1 OK. Sound quality OK but sound mixing of recording not very good.<br />Removed disc #2 from box and it was broken so was not able to play it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so fun you might not believe this I just down loaded it for free.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|I've been getting Kindle Neck from holding the bit heavier Kindle Fire while I watch movies and tv.  The viewing angle always has me bending my neck and it gets stiff wihotut me realizing it.  So, I've been looking for a cover that might help alleviate the strain.  This cover is okay.  I don't have Kindle Neck as bad, but I don't like the way there is a seam in the cover so it can be bent and inserted behind a flap.  That seam, when not being used to prop the cover open, is annoying.  There's nothing to lock it in place so it doesn't flap loosely.  And the way it just hooks behind a flap you bend out isn't all that secure.  I give it a &#34;Meh&#34;.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's ok, but my iphone gives the option to share posts, but the app for my kindle does not.  They need to update it so you can use all the functions Facebook has available.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I have really enjoyed all of Mitch Albom's books and this one was no exception.  I hope this one becomes a movie like some of the others have.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|This was a interesting book due to the twists and turns...as I read it, I thought I understood what was going on and then there was a nice twist that made it worth the read.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|Too much detail toward the end. Overall very good and informative. His basic dietary advice is quite similar to Atkins 35 years ago but Ferris never acknowledges this. Waiting for the next 4-hour book. I have read them all.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game will keep you playing it for hours! Its really fun and it never gets old. AND it only gets better when its free. So don't just sit there and stare at my review- go install this app!
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is an ok game.  I used to play it on fb awhile ago.  I just thought I would try it again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Not expecting that all the twist and turns are very unexpected . I can't wait to read the next book
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I wasn't sure how could sounds help someone sleep but this app help me discover that. I come from the Caribbean where it rained almost every day and this help me bring back the natural melodies I missed so much! I suffer from insomnia and this helps me fall asleep quickly and sleep soundly through the night. Extremely glad undiscovered this app. Highly recommend it to anyone who want to sleep or relax without having to take me medication.
B0000549B0|4.0|Directly after its five-year Broadway run, Universal filmed Mary Chase's play with considerable success.  James Stewart is delightful in the title role as Elwood P. Dowd, the drunk with a six-foot high rabbit Harvey as his friend; although clumsy in movement, he remains perpetually optimistic even in the face of adversity.  If having a friend like Harvey keeps you happy, then why not keep him?  Josephine Hull is all bird-like as she twitters through the film; although placed under considerable stress, it's clear she's in love with her brother Elwood.  There are two wonderful cameos from Cecil Kellaway as a sanatorium doctor who sees Harvey himself, and changes character as a result; and British-born Wallace Ford as a cab driver who reveals what happens to patients who end up at the sanatorium.  The film has some important points to make about the presumed value of psychiatry and institutionalization, but makes them deftly, without minimizing the comic elements. A true classic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Easy and engaging read!  Read it over just a few days. On to book three. Most definitely recommend this book.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I am not one to buy songs, yet alone albums. I heard that the this album was selling like good pizza in NYC does, so I decided hey let this be the first album I buy. I actually bought it on a lightening deal so it was pretty good priced! I also don't listen to country per say but she is the only country singer I listen to, since her songs are a little more pop like.<br /><br />On to the album. There are a mix of paces in her songs. The most up beat and load is probably We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together. Stay Stay Stay is another quicker paced song but she is softer with her voice here. Regardless there is a main theme behind all of the songs in this album. She is able to convey a story across to her listeners without actually being &#34;strictly/hardcore country&#34;. She seems to cross a line and mesh together a country themed song, with pop elements, and stories. These things all end up forming songs that despite the varying paces, seems to all fit together into your playlist and just make sense to you as you listen to them.<br /><br />Honestly, I can say that I was not disappointed by this album. This is my recommendation to Country listeners and any other types wanting to just give it a try, give a listen to a couple of her songs on YouTube and see if they suit you. They definately worked for me! Totally worth the buy
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a long time since I've written a review here, so any book urging me to write one (in a foreign language, mind you) must either be insanely good or utterly bad. Wool is fantatisc!<br /><br />It's a great concept, but most of all it is very well written. I also has great pace (a little slower in the 5th instance, but still good!). It's filled with live, believable, easy to care for characters. To top it all: it's an entirely captivating adventure. Did I mention it is also modern yet still reads like something out of the golden age of sci-fi?<br /><br />I don't want to enter into the contents of Wool, its subject matter, I left it to the reader because it is an ejoyment, almost an achievement, discovering things at the pace they were meant to be discovered. I will try, instead, to pass down what it feels like to read Wool, to read Hugh Howey.<br /><br />In all of sci-fi I believe that the greatest \\"inventor\\" of worlds - really strange, exotic, impossible but true worlds - is Stephen Baxter. I don't think he aligns there at the top with the best writers like Zelazny and Heinlein or Vance, but his worlds are impossible yet believable, stretching the imagination to where, really, no one went before. Just read Raft or Flux (or the entire Xeelee sequence). Simply AMAZING stuff. Well, there's something of that flavor permeating Wool from start to finish.<br /><br />But there's a catch: Howe writes better than Baxter! There are cliffhangers at the end of the volumes, but they are cliffhangers only because they are unexpected, and while they left you begging for more, they are thoroughly satisfying. The books are also filled up with great passages, phrases sculpted to perfection, a really great source for Unix login quotes! All of these makes reading Wool a lot like reading, for example, A Game of Thrones: everything seems satisfying, in place, expected in its unexpectedness,and, above all real even in its fantastic setting.<br /><br />So Howe imagines like Baxter and writes like Martin, how could this go wrong?d writes like Martin, how could this go wrong?
B004QK5N5W|5.0|The Apple Digital AV Adapter worked out great i don't know why i didn't buy it before i love it.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) has dream to start his own small business.  He wants to build custom designed furniture but it takes money to begin a startup company.  His day job is a construction worker who makes enough money to live on but not enough to save to start a business.  His night job is being a male stripper in a club located in Tampa Florida. Working there is part of accomplishing his dream.<br /><br />While on his day job he befriends a young man, Adam (Alex Pettyfer), and almost by accident gets him into the stripping business. That is how he meets Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn) and shares his future dreams with her.....<br /><br />This was a good movie with some comedy, seriousness and an insight into the world of professional strippers.  The storyline is weak and cheesy as the object used to sell the movie is naked men and the good looking women who want to be with them. The music, dancing and overall action is pretty good and that is what carries the movie.  It is worth watching but I guarantee my wife enjoyed it more than I did.  It is entertaining and a fun movie to watch. I rate it 4 stars as an amusing movie but not a stellar film.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|overall great  game . I am happy to see that I could get it for my kindle hd .  it is very addicting . it helps me stay quick on my toes while I have a winter break from school.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the rest of the  story ! Having to wait is gonna be torture. Gideon is a God!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|The series, which is less about solving crime than it is about love, built up a great deal of tension between the two main characters.  The inevitable conclusion of that situation was well worth the wait.  The character interactions have been a pleasure to watch, though it would be nice if the writers developed the characters Javier and Kevin.  Both characters are flat and caricature like.  The show is fluff, but enjoyable fluff with just enough humor, banality and sadness to keep things interesting.  Susan Sullivan and Molly Quinn steal just about every scene they are in.  It is easy to see how Ms. Sullivan snagged those Tony nominations and awards.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I now use this for my go-to news first.  It has in-depth articles and a broad selection.  Easy to manuever within different topics.  Has &#34;real&#34; news as well as current world events.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Just started to play and enjoying quite a bit. Haven't gone very far yet to see exactly what it can do however having fun so far
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Keeps me busy while baby naps or hubby and teen occupy the tv. Very exciting and fast paced. Much fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A very intriguing story line, one that took some time to absorb.  WAS at times offended by the graphic details, but kept reading.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Fun match 3 game. I like how they added the map and story to make it more entertaining. Decent graphics and fun little surprises .
B009MO5960|2.0|I always find it interesting when an action film feels weighted down in tedium. No matter how many things explode onscreen or how much people jump around shooting with semi-automatic rifles, it just can't rile up any sense of excitement. These were my thoughts when reflecting on \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" after weathering through an hour and a half of tired action movie clich&eacute;s, slow motion cinematography, and 3D gimmicks.<br /><br />Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in an underwater Umbrella facility where she must travel through different T-virus testing simulations to escape. Along the way, she meets up with an associate of Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) named Ada (Li Bingbing). She informs her that Wesker is trying to help her escape to join his fight against the Umbrella Corporation and the undead. Wesker also put together a team made up of Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb), Barry Burton (Kevin Durand), and Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) to retrieve the two girls.<br /><br />Alice and her rescuers come up against different varieties of the undead as well as a group of familiar faces the Red Queen (Ave Merson-O'Brian) is using to intimidate and fight against them. The team is led by a brainwashed Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and made up of clones of Alice's dead associates including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Carlos (Oded Fehr) and James \\"One\\" Shade (Colin Salmon). Can Alice get to safety and discover why her old opponent Wesker needs her help so bad?<br /><br />I know the movie is based on a video game, but does \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" have to feel like I'm just watching someone else play it? A script is almost non-existent as the film takes viewers through different simulated \\"testing\\" grounds for at least an hour of the 95-minute running time. Just like in a video game, you go into a room with a character, defeat whatever monsters are in it, and then move on to the next one and do it all again. If I wanted to play the game, I would have just rented the latest version and skipped this mess.<br /><br />Director / writer Paul W.S. Anderson found a way to shove as many of the old characters from the other movies into this one through his use of clones as assassins and gunners for the Umbrella Corporation. Besides Michelle Rodriguez's Rain, the other returning actors have little to do except shoot guns while running and jumping around on wires.<br /><br />The CGI and visual effects aren't too bad. However, the final sequence of the movie looks like it was pulled straight off of Capcom's game. It looks ridiculously animated and really closes the film on a negative note. There also seems to be some kind of synthetic sheen over any scenes featuring Jovovich that give them an artificial air.<br /><br />You can't fault the video or audio quality of \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" for an unpleasant viewing experience. The picture is clear, vibrant, and is at least easy on the eyes. The 5.1 surround sound will please audiences as explosions, gunfire, screams, and other grotesque noises are spread throughout the speakers in their home theater.<br /><br />One thing I can say positive about the \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" Blu-ray is it's packed with special features. They include two different commentaries with filmmakers and cast, outtakes, deleted and extended scenes, several \\"Behind-the-Scenes\\" featurettes, and an interactive database. One featurette that many will find interesting is \\"'Resident Evil: Retribution' - Face of the Fan\\" in which series devotee Dylan Syrett shares her experience visiting the set of the movie.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" is a disappointing entry in the franchise. I watched \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" after watching this and it just furthermore pounded home how laborious \\"Retribution\\" is. Many enthusiasts of these movies may find themselves feeling like they're sitting on a couch with their hands tied behind their backs while being forced to watch a friend play \\"Resident Evil 6\\" for an hour and a half. It's just not a very pleasant predicament to find yourself in.a half. It's just not a very pleasant predicament to find yourself in.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was so difficult to put this book down.  It was an excellent read and a magnificent story that is highly relevant to an adolescent's life.  I would recommend this book to anyone and I'm interested in seeing how well the movie depicts the story.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Director Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar for his screenplay on The Usual Suspects, and he also wrote the screenplay for Jack Reacher. If you have seen the trailer, you might think that the movie is a pure adrenalin rush in the same vein as Taken, but that's not exactly correct. There is plenty of action, but McQuarrie also gives his characters time to breathe, and we learn a little about the backgrounds of most of the major players.<br /><br />The movie begins with someone shooting five apparently random strangers from long range with a rifle. This is shown in close-up. In fact, this movie has more close-ups than any I have ever seen. It includes facial shots, point-of-view shots, and objects. The camera angles are also interesting. Perhaps the intention was to place us right among the action?<br /><br />A man is arrested for the shooting and asks for Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). Unfortunately, Reacher is something of a mystery and nobody knows how to contact him. When he does eventually appear, it's on his terms. We learn that he was an investigator of sorts while in the army, and he's enlisted by Helen (Rosamund Pike), who is the lawyer representing the accused man. Reacher isn't sure he's even guilty.<br /><br />I don't think that I should give away many more plot points, so I'll talk more generally about what you can expect. But I will say that the story is fairly predictable.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I think this is one of his best performances and I would put it up there with Collateral. At 50 years of age, he's still a convincing action star, and I believed that he had the skills to do what he does in the movie. McQuarrie also keeps some of the action scenes realistic and things don't always work out perfectly for the hero.<br /><br />You'll see Reacher investigating the crime, and we are shown how some of his realizations come to pass. There's an enjoyable cameo from Robert Duvall, and nobody gives a truly bad performance in the entire movie.<br /><br />Action fans will enjoy a few fight scenes, a car chase, and a big shootout, but there's a story present at all times. This isn't a movie without substance. Reacher is the only character who is given much to do. At times it seems as though everyone else is standing around waiting to see what happens.<br /><br />Jack Reacher won't blow you away, but it's better than the standard genre offerings. I could easily see it spawning a sequel, and I would probably go and see it.e movie.<br /><br />Action fans will enjoy a few fight scenes, a car chase, and a big shootout, but there's a story present at all times.

B005LAII8K|5.0|It's rare these days to find a truly exciting and thought-provoking science fiction film. When one does come along, it should be cherished and talked about among genre fans so the joy of viewing it is spread throughout the community. \\"Looper\\" is one of those prized treasures that deserve to be talked about and doted on.<br /><br />Time travel is invented and declared illegal in the near future. The mob uses it in a very inventive way. Disposing of a body after eliminating a target has become very difficult thanks to science and forensic advances. They use it to transport a target into the past where a hired assassin called a \\"looper\\" kills them and then burns the bodies. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of these highly-paid gunmen who are living the high life. That is until he's contracted to kill his future self (Bruce Willis) and things get complicated.<br /><br />Writer / director Rian Johnson (\\"Breaking Bad,\\" \\"The Brothers Bloom\\") has created an intelligent and complex story that keeps viewers glued to the screen. It's been a long time since I've seen a film that so wonderfully blends together science fiction, action, and such a high level of emotional depth.<br /><br />I couldn't stop thinking about the premise of the movie throughout its two hour running time. There's never been a better visual illustration of the tragic aphorism, \\"Eat, drink, and be merry; for tomorrow we die.\\" \\"Looper\\" also drums up some paranoia and makes you re-examine the statements \\"Every action has a reaction\\" and \\"Everything we do matters.\\"<br /><br />The audio and video quality for \\"Looper\\" is beautiful and sounds great in a home theater setting. The picture is striking thanks to a great high-definition transfer. Colors all blend well together and are vibrant in their own distinct ways. The 5.1 surround brings to life every startling gunshot and sound effect used from the time-traveling pod noise to the rustling of crops on a farm.<br /><br />There's a good amount of special features included in the Blu-ray version of \\"Looper.\\" Director / writer Rian Johnson and actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt provide audio commentary. Over 20 deleted scenes are found with optional commentary by Johnson and actor Noah Segan. It also contains three featurettes entitled \\"The Future from the Beginning,\\" \\"The Science of Time Travel,\\" and \\"Scoring 'Looper.'\\" An animated trailer for the movie is included as well.<br /><br />\\"Looper\\" is everything a science fiction movie should be. It uses entertaining storytelling to deliver a message or social commentary in a non-threatening and exciting way. I would use \\"12 Monkeys\\" and \\"Source Code\\" as comparisons to \\"Looper\\" if someone wanted an idea of what to expect from the movie. Great performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, and Jeff Daniels only add to the quality of this soon-to-be classic film.included in the Blu-ray version of \\"Looper.\\" Director / writer Rian Johnson and actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt provide audio commentary.

B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was a great book! It captured my attention from the beginning. I look forward to reading more from this author.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|It's been almost 24 hours since I saw Quentin Tarantino's latest effort, and I still have mixed feelings. The first thing that you should know is that he is probably my favorite director. While his movies don't quite reach the heights of David Lynch's Mulholland Dr., he is responsible for more movies in my Top 20 than any other director. His movies have a unique feel and I love spending time in his worlds.<br /><br />If you have somehow never seen a Tarantino movie, I should mention that they are not for everyone. All feature a significant amount of violence, although the majority of the situations are so ludicrous that you aren't meant to take things seriously. I would say that every Tarantino movie is, at heart, a comedy, but his brand of comedy is darker than most. It doesn't matter whether you usually don't like war, Westerns, crime, or kung fu movies, because Tarantino creates a genre of his own. Like Monty Python, the humor is extremely silly, but works because of its underlying intelligence.<br /><br />It's necessary for you to understand the love and respect I have for Tarantino's work in order to appreciate the significance of my eventual rating.<br /><br />Let's get to Django Unchained.<br /><br />Settings include Texas, Mississippi, and Tennessee, and the opening scene takes place in 1858 (two years before the Civil War). It's clear from the start that this isn't going to be a conventional story. Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter posing as a dentist. We see him free Django (Jamie Foxx) from slavers, while giving the remaining captives their freedom and the ability to decide their own fate. Schultz enters into an agreement with Django, and the two spend the remainder of the year together as bounty hunters. Schultz ultimately discovers that Django is seeking his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), and decides to help him. That involves searching every plantation until they find her.<br /><br />The plot is of little consequence in Django Unchained. Like every other Tarantino movie, this is more about style. If you are looking for plot holes or deep meaning, you have chosen the wrong director. I know that many people will be offended by the subject matter, the violence, and the foul language, but I'm almost certain that Tarantino merely intends to entertain and provide as much fun as possible along the way. I obviously detest the thought of slavery, and people being whipped or murdered, but it wasn't really on my mind as I watched the movie. The tongue-in-cheek tone allowed me to separate the hideous events from any semblance of reality.<br /><br />The main reason I like Tarantino's work so much is because it is creative, and contains some of the best dialogue you'll ever hear. Those elements are present in Django Unchained, and some scenes and conversations work wonderfully. The bulk of the good scenes involve Christoph Waltz, who is essentially playing Hans Landa. Expect flowery dialogue delivered in a very deliberate way. He can talk his way out of almost any situation and he's full of surprises. If you can't imagine a scene involving the Ku Klux Klan being funny, Tarantino somehow pulls it off.<br /><br />Foxx does a reasonable job as Django, but I can't help thinking what Will Smith might have done with the role. DiCaprio plays Calvin Candie, who owns a plantation and seemingly has no scruples whatsoever. He's probably the best character in the movie with the exception of Schultz. It's always good to see Samuel L. Jackson working with Tarantino, and his performance as Stephen was strong. He plays a complicated character who is difficult to like.<br /><br />Despite all the familiar elements, Django Unchained often struggles to reach the level of Tarantino's best movies. Tarantino is a master at selecting the right music for a particular scene, but he misses the mark this time. There's nothing to match Bang Bang (Kill Bill), Across 110th Street (Jackie Brown), Cat People (Inglourious Basterds), Stuck in the Middle (Reservoir Dogs), or Dick Dale's Misirlou (Pulp Fiction). I can't think of any meaningful music from Django Unchained, despite the inevitable inclusion of something from Ennio Morricone.<br /><br />I don't have a thorough understanding of the role of an editor, but I have to wonder how much the absence of Sally Menke hurt the movie. It's the first time Tarantino has made a movie without her, and at 165 minutes, Django Unchained is his longest to date. Would Menke have turned it into a more cohesive story?<br /><br />I cared about Butch Coolidge, Jackie Brown, The Bride, and Shosanna Dreyfus, but I was never really invested in Django's quest to find his wife. Perhaps it would have worked better if I had been shown something of their history together?<br /><br />Do you remember the opening scene from Inglourious Basterds in which Hans Landa talks to a French farmer? That's one of the best scenes that Tarantino has ever written and it works because he builds tension throughout. In Django Unchained, the tension is less intense and some of the scenes feel rushed and end prematurely. This is especially true in a scene with DiCaprio, Foxx and Waltz near the end of the movie. In fact, the ending as a whole seems entirely too predictable for something penned by Tarantino.<br /><br />Tarantino is still playful, clever, creative, funny, and unpredictable, for the most part, but something is slightly off this time. I would say that Django Unchained is his second-weakest film behind Death Proof, but it still might end up as my favorite from 2012 when I have seen it a few times. If you are a Tarantino fan, it's a must-see and an eventual must-own, but it's a bit of a mess if I am honest.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5tuck in the Middle (Reservoir Dogs), or Dick Dale's Misirlou (Pulp Fiction).

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I personally love this book!! It is a teen boy named Charlie, writing to some stranger about his entire freshman year of high school and all the trouble he gets into, what friends he makes along the way, and how he \\"survives\\" being a wallflower.<br />Overall it is a really good book for teen readers!! :)
B0099G3I96|3.0|I am not sure about all the songs on this album. Sometimes it feels like they are trying too hard. I really loved Tragic Kingdom as a teen and hoped for an album more like Rock Steady but there just isn't enough horns/skaw/ dance for me in this. I bought this for a great price so I am still pleased. I &#60;3 Gwen.
0062197258|4.0|I thought this book was well written and does a good job of keeping the reader interested through-out the book. Towards the ending, i had every light on in the house! What a great thriller.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I thought those game has cute graphics and fun quest but do not spend a dollar it helps if you do not
B009NCM248|4.0|I am pretty late to get this album but it is a good one. This one is not as sappy as the last and really rocks. Highly Recommend.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This movie was a great beginning to more Halo movies to come. I feel the movies can only get better from here, especially since it should be mostly action from here on out!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I forgot about it for a while and cheked wat games I had and updated its way better now u can play online and more soo ya blaksjjsjjsjdjjsj
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I have never fallen in love with a band so fast. I am obsessed with Maria Brink. Blood makes me want to fall in love and kill at the same time. Maria's voices has never been more clear and meaningful. This album has a great beat that makes me want to dance/rock out. I only learned of ITM when I  seen them open up for Halestorm 11/2012 and they blew me away. I have never been into screamo music but ITM only adds the scream to add passion to the song when needed. Since then I have bought all the albums and I am weeding through the 3 other albums to find my favorites. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. Tiffany
193609648X|5.0|I already have projects planned. The pictures in this book are beautiful, really good photography. pics really show the designs.
B009NCM248|5.0|This is another great CD from Stone Sour, it is hard and gritty and gets in your face. If you like the first Stone Sour CD then you will love this one as well.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Great movie and price. It arrived quickly and the wife loved as I know she would. Great story line. Buy it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|the only thing I could complain about is that pictures are too big on my news feed. that aside, the app is just just as good as a web browser window.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love this app it is so fun everyone should buy it if they like PAC man! Buy it please please buy it!!!!!!!:):)
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I just expected more...  All around blah, nothing great or exciting going on to really impress a person. Skip it if you think you'll be dazzled, you won't.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|It's adictive. Tile swap for the money to create an aquarium. - And buy the stuff to comfort your fish and beautify your tank. Good choice of fish<br />I like it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Even though we were snowed in I still couldn't put this book down. Can't wait to start the next book.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I started to watch s 1 when it first came out but didnt give the series enough attention. Now I can hardly wait for each episode, the series is completely twisted and I love it
B008L1DNGI|4.0|Fun game. gets progressively harder with each level.<br />The challenge level is fun too, but you gotta love time limits.
B0043URV5U|5.0|These CDs played very well and distinctively.  Very good quality and the sound was incredible.  Made you seem<br />like you were there on stage watching him play.  All the hits there all in one place.  Recommend this copy for<br />those Bob Seger fans.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wasn't going to read this book. Even though I had heard good things it sounded too much like a watered down ripoff of \\"Battle Royale\\" (Great movie btw). It smecked of tweeny twilight dogshit. But it was available free with my introductory Amazon prime membership so I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Turns out, its very good. So much so that before I realized it, I had read the entire book in one sitting. Quite the page-turner, this one...
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is the same, with some changes in methodology.<br />Crafting is easier, cuz you don't have to know how to craft it as long as you have your materials.<br />Tablet play is very different than pc, but easy to adapt to.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Even though this case was someone cheap, it is absolutely great!  Its better than buying one that is twice as much.  Save some money and get this one!
B008WCP2PG|1.0|I thought this movie would be somewhat entertaining but no plot whatsoever and no ending. Just a thrown together movie with some stripping. And in my opinion none of the men were attractive the only good thing about the movie was Channing tatum dance moves. Just bad!!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Fun -ish.<br />the game doesn't credit slashes in the right place sometimes.  but you can just leave you r finger on the screen and use the scribble teq to win every time
B00979CS50|3.0|When I opened the sealed package, I found that there were two copies of Disc 2 and no copy of Disc 1.  I love the disc I received, but would like Disc 1 as well.  How can this be remedied?
B005FISBTO|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite seasons besides season 4 with trinity killer. Colin hanks does a wonder performance and leaves you on the edge of your seat at the end of each episode. Nothing but good things to say about this season but don't want to spoil it :)
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This Trilogy is by far the best trilogy that i have, I love the batman movies!! I watch them as often as I can, even wathc them on the laptop while the wife is watching something she likes!!(chickflicks!!) lol Bale, Ledger, Bane,  Dent, Catwoman, League of shadows, The fight scenes awesome! I love these movies! a must watch!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My family is a big fan of all the Tinkerbell movies.  This one is one of the best - it is funny, sweet, and refreshingly clean.  I highly recommend it.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This gift was on our daughter's Christmas list and she was so delighted to get it and couldn't wait to play it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I first saw this game and thought it was way too easy and boring, than I realized I was wrong.  it is fun and does get a little more challenging but it is VERY addictive.
0446619078|5.0|Harry Bosch goes after the killer of his mother and digs up his own past. On top of that, he has to sneak into his house because it has been condemned after an earthquake, he's on suspension for slamming his boss through a window... just another day at the office for our hero.<br /><br />Since I'm not reading these books in any particular sequence, I'm filling in gaps in the chronology of Harry, learning pieces of his history and getting questions answered that were left lingering from future and past books. All of it is interesting, layered on top of the ongoing standard detective case weaved into this book.<br /><br />As usual, there are plenty of plot twists and turns and it kept me engaged and guessing right to the end. I could've figured who the real killer was at the beginning, but chose to let him surprise me. I can say I wasn't that surprised, but I wasn't disappointed either. Plenty of bad guys got it in the end and Harry, while not coming out smelling like a rose, didn't walk away a complete disaster.<br /><br />The narrative and exposition didn't bog things down though there were a few very long paragraphs here and there, but at least the chapters were relatively short and I didn't find myself lost in the middle of pages when I had to stop reading for one thing or another. He kept it solid third person and didn't head-hop.<br /><br />Overall, a very satisfying read. I'm well hooked on the series and can't wait to indulge in the next random offering, out of sequence, of course. Highly recommended.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|This gift was on our daughter's Christmas list and she was so delighted to get it and couldn't wait to play it.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie because it is a great family movie with a great plot.<br />I have always enjoyed seeing Christopher Plumer and Julie Andrews preform.
B00551912M|5.0|After listening to B&W 685's ($649), Dynaudio DM 2/6 ($800), Wharfedale Diamond 10.1 ($349) I thought that these speakers were the best value for the money at $489. I like that they are front ported so that you can actually put them on a bookshelf and not have muffled sound. The Dynausio's were the best sounding speaker, but are rear ported and when I put them on the bookshelf the case was muddy. Freestanding they were outstanding!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the most amazing book I've ever read. It's filled with heartbreaking truth and breathtaking love. I would read it over and over just to relive it again
B0098460O4|5.0|Words cannot describe how good this album is--every track is amazing.  I was so moved by the music I was brought to tears.  My recommendation is to sit back with a good glass of wine and let yourself sink into the music.<br /><br />Enjoy.  If you just purchased this album, you're in for a great treat!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was riveting from the start.  One I didn't think I was going to like.  I started reading it with one eye closed.  In an embarrassing sort of way.  By the end I was hooked.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|You can really feel the emotion pouring through their voices.  True, there are some aspects that you will find here but not in the Broadway version (crying, sobbing, other nuances), but it is still terrific music.  For $5, you cannot go wrong.  Buy this album, you will not regret it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|As the cast come more and more to grips with their reality, the whole show becomes more disturbing and unpredictable. You're never sure what will happen next.
1933952806|3.0|This book was written by a professional, well informed person. It got the highest rating for the D7000. I bought it and found it to be mostly a handheld tour of the menues. If that is what you want then, by all means it would be great. I bought this book to help demistify the amazing controls offered by the D7000 and found that I set it down after I'd already sety the date and time with no need of help and then found some of the more intricate features too advanced to follow. Maybe I'm too new to the DSLR game, but I think this is a high-end consumer DSLR camera so I thought I'd get a high end book to help navigate through all the controls and menues a bit more thoroughly. I returned this book and bought the David Busch's Nikon D7000 which has really helped be gain a good grasp of the camera. I find it much more informative and useful for my needs.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters in Downton Abbey are so well crafted that you can't help but become in grossed in their lives.  Can't wait for season 3.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|Very funny, makes me laugh every time. Definitely worth buying instead of renting. Just a great movie. Probably not appropriate for kids though...
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|Nothing on this cd is as good as his older tunes.  Big disappointment for me.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
034580404X|5.0|Got this trilogy as a gift to my better half. Needless to say it was the perfect gift for her she really loves them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book ever used buying the 3rd book! Can't wait the last part left me hanging so of to Amazon.com
B005I6EVUG|3.0|Pros: Cute cover, easy to insert Kindle Fire and it fits snuggly under the straps which have rubber backing for better stability.<br /><br />Cons: Magnetic snap does not work when Kindle is in the case. If anything is in the pocket (all I have is the little wipe cloth that goes with the screen protectors), it looks warped.<br /><br />Could have used an elastic strap in the back to keep it closed.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I am currently obsessed with this movie.  Everything is just..wow..amazing! I love the music and the choreography.  I was so impressed by how original it is.  Also, everything seems so new for some reason.  I just love love LOVE the mixes and can't get over how great it all is.  Definitely watch it!!
0140120416|5.0|Love the approach - as a professional language learner, this lets me learn on my own terms & at my own speed. I would like to see more on how to write cursive; each letter is taught, but I need to know how to connect each letter to the various others that may follow (as in English cursive /r/ in /br/ is very different from /cr/, for example). If there was a companion workbook, I'd snatch it up for sure!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is ridiculously addicting. There are 300 levels of puzzles with increasing levels of difficulty -- it's hard to stop playing! This game is challenging, but it doesn't ever reach the frustrating, I-want-to-punch-Om-Nom level. It stays fun. I love playing this game in bed or when I'm waiting for something. It helps the time pass quickly and it's a blast figuring out how to get every star.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|The rest is just noise.just noise, just noise just noise, just noise, just noise, just noise, just noise, just noise
B005TZFZJC|3.0|I asked for this CD as a gift because there is at least 6 songs I really love, including Birthday Cake...I was really disappointed when it was over in under 2 minutes. What I don't get is there's no single available but the radio plays the full version all the time, so what the heck? Still love the CD but I really love that song! Such a shame.
B005LAIHZY|2.0|The DVD is US region, this was not put in the description. As it was a gift, I threw out the envelope it came in before offering or trying it. I cannot return or play it - very disappointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was one of the best ones I have read. I can't say how many times I laughed and cried but still refused to put the book down. This may have been a story, but this is true life for some people. I'm commending you for this book Colleen, your best one yet. Please keep them coming.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|i enjoyed it until the game pretty much forces you to connect to other players. I'd like the option to play alone/continue the game without having to connect that way.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This app is fun.  It takes awhile to make money to put in buildings but still fun to move the trucks around.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars because the characters are great and the writing is excellent.  This book is not as good as the first three, but better then the 4th book, especially the second half when the time lines come back together.  My big complaint is that all of the characters who you read about in the beginning seem to just disappear when the timelines come back together.  Bran and Davos do not get any chapters the second half of the book.  I think spliting the 4th and 5th book the way it was done was a mistake, but at the same time I'm excited to see them correct that problem for HBO.
B005HSL626|5.0|almost as fun as the real physical game that i also got with my kinect for christmas as well. love
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds Free is a great game! I am totally hooked!  A lot of fun, challenging  & it's free...what a great deal!

B009RH973I|5.0|but they only had black. love my pink case and that the kindle snaps in, instead of being secured only by straps.
1455527475|3.0|I'll start with I love an accent and had zero trouble listening to this book. I'm always happier when a writer can narrate their own book, because it brings authenticity. I also appreciate when a writer is in over their head and calls in a pro. Not the case, Greg Smith can read his own book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book initially. South African boy does good, wins scholarship to Stanford, procures Wall Street Internship and amazing career ensues. Greg gave enough insight and definition to his (complicated) work, so a novice could follow along and not get bored or overwhelmed with jargon. I felt like I learned things and even found myself making the hand gestures to buy and sell, like I was standing on 'the floor' (people driving by just thought I was nuts).<br /><br />My problem is Greg comes across as a lily-white, do-gooder surrounded by blood-sucking heathens. It just doesn't feel genuine when you elevate yourself at the expense of others. He was the only good guy in a sea of scum... right (said sarcastically). He writes openly about his peer's weaknesses, his superior's faults and personality quirks even about hanging out with strippers in a hot tub in Vegas with his GS bretheren (whatever happened to what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas?). He burnt people to write this book all the while he is portraying himself as saint. He totally covered his own a## and made a premeditated exit from GS, while simultaneously ripping the rug out from the company that took VERY good care of him for 10 years. It feels kind of gross and disingenuous. I ended up not liking this guy.

B009X01FJS|3.0|I bought this Marware cover for the versatility and leather. It is a very nice design for the  most part but unfortunately the lining is synthetic and has a very strong chemical odor. This odor is on the hand strap also and my hand took on the odor. I left it out over night hoping it would air out but it did not get any better. To bad because it is otherwise well designed.
B0063IH60K|3.0|There is no quit function, you have to either redeal your cards or just use the backup arrow. Cards do not shuffle enough, too many times cards are back to back. It only pulls one card from the deck instead of the normal 3 when you play with regular cards.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The replacement was needed because the original cord for my KINDLE 2 disintegrated. Customer service was quite helpful AFTER I experienced a high degree of frustration trying to find a replacement myself online.  I want to note that since they were so quick to replace it for free, it appears to me that this is a known problem with these cords.  Be warned though if you experience the same issue.  KEEP your &#34;wall plug&#34; because the replacement doesn't come with it... they charge an additional $9.95 for something that came with the original!  Overall, I am also irritated that Amazon has so quickly forgotten KINDLE 2 owners.  Sorry guys, we paid close to $400 for this item, and all you want to do now is have us toss it out and replace it, at personal cost.  No covers available, or accessories, etc.  VERY disappointed in that.
B0094K1K42|5.0|It's a black comedy. C.T. did a great job portraying her sad character. Just understand what kind of movie this is before you watch it and you will love it too
B008JGSM6G|5.0|if you're a problem solver, you'll enjoy tackling some of the pipes in this game. The higher levels offer more of a challenge, but it's a good way to work on problem solving and strategic moves.
B007THA4FI|3.0|First of all, if you are thinking of reading this book because you loved Harry Potter and are hoping to reconnect with that character through the another one of Rowling’s books, you will be very disappointed. Now that we got that out of the way, The Casual Vacancy, Rowling’s first venture into the world of adult literary fiction, showcases the writer’s talent in a very different way. As always, whether you like the book or not will depend on your literary tastes.<br /><br />The story begins with the death of a prominent member of a small English town,; but this event is merely the catalyst that enables Rowling to introduce the reader to the various miserable characters of Pagford Parish. The news of Barry Fairbrother’s demise spreads in the usual way of tiny towns with nothing better to do: gossip. The reader travels along the gossip chain, meeting new and interesting characters along the way. This part of the story was pretty amusing for me because I felt like I had known a few of these characters.<br /><br />However, while I found some parts of the novel interesting and entertaining, I didn’t exactly like the book as a whole. I felt as if it was Rowling’s experiment in character development, a practice of sorts. The pacing was painfully slow and I could never really put my finger on the actual plot of the story, only that it was about how one death (or life) affects an entire community in the smallest of ways. While that is a beautiful sentiment, I believe that it would’ve been better kept to a short story or novelette, rather than a 500 page novel.<br /><br />This book is not for everyone. If you like a book that has a fast pace, a clear plot, and an exciting climax, move on. For those of you who are voyeuristic or like a good soap opera, you may find this enjoyable. One thing is certain, though, J.K. Rowling is a first class writer, a master of her craft.
B007712XAU|5.0|Just starting watching this past season so this purchase has cleared up the questions i had & familiarized me with the story line & characters. Love it!
B004P1JDJO|5.0|I have always been a type I, but never knew how to explain to others that I was never really driven by money. I was driven by success, doing a better job, proving to someone else that I could do it. Proving to myself that I could do it.<br />Drive has never been about education, or status. As an Entrepreneur, this book confirms my thoughts about motivation, money and work ethic.<br />Daniel Pink gives real world examples that everyone can relate too as well as the theory that backs up his submissions.<br />This book is a must read for managers at all levels as well as entrepreneurs, and individuals entering the work force. Understand what motivates you and your employees.<br />BJ
B0084TWN9K|3.0|So, occasionally I like to dig into some literary fiction. Short stories, in particularly, are great since it can get a little tedious and boring to read. Anyway, I have only tried one other time to read a book of short stories by a single author, (Junot Diaz’s Drown...great for some, but I wouldn’t recommend it). I felt a little more confident reading Munro’s work because I know I already like her writing. She doesn’t disappoint with Dear Life, a collection of short stories about the lives of women. More specifically, these stories are about the miserable lives of women.<br /><br />  It is clear that Munro writes from a different generational perspective (she’s 81 years old), because the women in her stories are usually straining against the confines of their gender and they are punished when they make an unconventional choice (such as to have an affair, elope, work outside of the home, or challenge male authority). While it is not cheerful reading, I do think it’s important to look to the past to appreciate where we are now. (Not saying that these things don’t happen these days, but I definitely think the gender gap is closing).<br /><br />  While the stories are occasionally disjointed and you don’t get a very good sense of the characters, you don’t really need to; they are every woman. Despite the progress we’ve made, there is not a person alive, man or woman, who hasn’t felt trapped by obligations and expectations. It is the human experience which ties us all together, and Munro chronicles this experience beautifully.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This is a cute, but somewhat predictable, story of a several British seniors who,for various reasons, decide to move to India. These seniors all respond to an add to live at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The hotel does not quite live up to the advertisements. Each senior, or senior couple, discovers something about themselves and about dealing with aging. Juxtapose against the stories of the older folks is the the story of the young Indian man who is running the hotel.  Excellent cast, and screenplay is good. Although not a &#34;deep&#34; movie, it is light and fun,
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This movie was everything I expected it to be and more. Bane was quite different from his comic book character but that's to be expected with this trilogy.  I won't spoil it for anyone and I won't go into a super long narrative but I'll say this; it had enough twists and turns to keep me on the edge of my seat, literally, throughout the film and although it's quite long, I was never bored.
B002SRQ214|5.0|My friend got me into AMD (me being an Intel fan) LOVED this processor, 3.4GHz, quad core, combined with 8GB of Kingston Hyper X RAM, is snappy as can be.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have been using the Kindle app on my cell phone for a year or so now. Now that I have a tablet it was one of the first apps I put on it and love reading books on it. I still love to hold a real book in my hands but I also love being able to look up and download a new book on the spur of the moment...I am never without something to read now.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Interesting hard to handle at first but it comes around all in all a pretty good book looking forward to sequels
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I am still in college (longer than I should have been)  and this book gives me hope that it has been worth it. It doesn't matter if it takes awhile to find the right job/profession/invention or idea because  you only need to be right once.

B004KBSQOW|5.0|Purchased to get me out of the 'Snow Slump&#34; , but will be playing it throughout the year.  I love IZ's voice, every song is really pretty.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing from beginning  to end. I had a lump in my throat the entire way through and admit that I had to plug my kindle in and sit on the floor because I HAD TO finish it. Some things were predictable, but that does not make this book not worth reading.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|DeMille isn't Grisham but rates maybe 2nd place. Considering ordering the next in the John Corey series as soon as I finish some other books awaiting me on the kindle bookshelf. Hopefully by then the price will have gone down. I for one am most disappointed in the jump that the kindle books took in 2012 but that's another story. (You should pardon the pun!)<br />Grisham's stories are smarter and do not include all the stupid swearing. We get it, DeMille! We don't have to read it or hear it!! Any idiot can swear.<br />But considering the low price paid for the kindle version, it was a fairly good read.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|All of the crews problems did not link to their mission, they were all self-induced problems. Most of it's caused by them just being stupid. Horrible movie and Horrible plot. There was nothing actually relevant to the planet Prometheus except for the disease and until the end.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is a great website, but on the kindle searcher it's really difficult to navigate through Facebook, with this app it's a lot easier. A few days ago my mom got a kindle for herself, she is a Facebook lover and instantly was on Facebook through her kindle. She was very frustrated and when she asked me for help, I told her the best way to be on Facebook is through the app. Once she got the app she was relieved that the app made it easy to navigate through Facebook. Now she's on it everyday. I don't know why this app has such a bad reviews.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The game is addicting, but it is supposed to be free. The game doesn't restart when you run out of coins. You have to buy more or wait. That isn't fun.

034580404X|5.0|I had already read these, but bought them for my daughter, at her request, for Christmas. I don't know what all the hoop-la is about the books. The 2nd and  especially the 3rd, in my opinion, were not as stimulating at the 1st!

B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an amazing book! I loved it so much and cannot wait to read the last and final book in this<br /> series! If you have not read this series you need too, it has quickly became my favorite series I have ever read!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I like it, just wish the camera could take pictures from the opposite side.  I do think this should have been included with the kindle for free.
B008PC1GF8|5.0|Need a no-brainer? Here you go.<br /><br />I've always greatly admired Karajan's 1989 Bruckner 8 with the incomparable Vienna Philharmonic - the 8th being one of their 'signature' pieces. But I wasn't that happy with the up-front, slightly harsh sound. That issue has now been addressed to a satisfactory level, with DG's \\"Original Image Bit-Processing\\" method doing the job. I don't know just what that means, nor do I care. All I know is that it now sounds better to me, with more space and 'air' around the instruments themselves (particularly when only a few instruments are playing, or at softer dynamic levels). The VPO's slightly unusual sounding timpani now sound more realistic and 'pleasing' as well. But because of my dissatisfaction with the sound quality (as well as being broken across two discs), I dumped my original issue quite a while ago for the highly touted Boulez/V.P.O. issue. Now I would be very hard pressed to say which one I like better. Karajan vs. Boulez:<br /><br />I do prefer Boulez's quicker timing for Bruckner's somewhat 'rambling' finale, but Karajan delivers a tremendously powerful coda (ending). I also like Karajan's exquisitely gorgeous Adagio, as well as his lumbering, more 'Austrian' sounding gait for the scherzo. Both Karjan and Boulez give us plenty of power in the first movement, but I think I might prefer Boulez's slightly greater sense of urgency here. Karjan is more mysterious. Both are great, in my book.<br /><br />Just as final thought - if you picked up the Barenboim/Chicago box set of Bruckner symphonies (also DG) but are not entirely happy with Barenboim's 8th, you may want to add this bargain priced one as a supplement.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This was a great book so heart breaking and relatable makes u think and challenge what you would do in these situations i loved it

B00479SVBU|5.0|Son says it works great. No static . Good and clear. Does not lose signal like the thing he had before that just connected to the iPod and sent a signal to radio ( worked off iPod battery I presume). It was just what he needed and saved me from having to change out stereo in his car.

B0079R8IYW|5.0|I loved the cover, it was so much better than I expected,..,.The fit was perfect I the quality was excellent
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|Others have pointed out the simeralities between Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, but I have to say that I didn't particuarly notice them when I read the Lightning Thief. I found the book's first couple of chapters a bit same-old same-old, but the rest I thought was interesting and fun. The Percy Jackson series made me learn a lot about ancient greek, and later on roman, mythology.<br /><br />I suppose it is a bit like HP, what with living with Gabe, and having Annabeth and Grover as friends. Also having Annabeth being the second joining Percy's 'group', just like Hermione joining Harry's. I can clearly make the connections between HP and PJ's characters and plot, but even so I think that the situations Rick Riordan placed his characters in, the monsters, the bad demigods ect, were pretty different to HP. And I cannot find a same-same character in HP for Luke.<br /><br />The whole Percy Jackson series are terrific. They are easy to read, they teach you things and they're funny. Once you get past the first chapter or so, you can't put it down. (And if you put super glue on the book you literally can't!)
B008M721MS|5.0|The &quot;Kindle Fire HD&quot; is the first kindle I have ever had and the Skype feature works perfectly fine without any problems.  I called my friend  yesterday an  everything worked fine.  I use  the  pre-installed version  that should come already on your Kindle Fire HD.  If it did not come on your kindle (which I find kind of strange), you should definitely download the app.  Now, one of the normal problems is that it  appears to be on your Kindle but when you try to go on it it does not work.  If this happens, you might want to try to uninstall it by holding it down and deleting it.  Then try to reinstall it yourself from the app store where you probably saw this review.  As I said earlier, you should definitely get this app to connect with your family an  friends.  Hope you like ho  Skype works.

B009329Y30|4.0|I've never watched even one of the high school musicals, and so I never thought I would care for Zac Efron as an actor. I will have to say that he has a lot of range and I enjoy his movies. This movie was more sad to me than some of his others, but it was still a good rainy day watch.

B008F5YDRI|3.0|I didn't really appreciate how Ewan McGregor went about ending his marriage. True, his wife was a bit of a cold fish, no pun intended, but when she realized they were in trouble she still wanted to at least try. He just wanted what he wanted. I realize it's a movie, but I feel it encouraged the attitude of &#34;it isn't working, just get a divorce&#34;. If he hadn't been married, this movie would have been not just a great story, but a great love story. I realize my views sound outdated, but I don't think there is anything outdated about trying to fix and find a solution to a &#34;broken&#34; marriage.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|this hand shell for kindle is awesome. only thing that is not yet as good as it should is the flap used to keep it upright. It does not have anything to hold it in place, so sometimes, it will drop down.
B005KMX866|5.0|I saw Chris Issak in concert at Gruene Hall a month before the cd came out.  He did a lot of music from this cd so i was looking forward to it. I can't think of another artist I would rather have do the Sun records stuff.  His performance is so authentic it's hard to believe he is not from the time period.  His voice is just beautiful.

B007A2O3FO|1.0|Expected to like this movie with such a stellar cast and interesting story.  Didn't even finish it - the film looked very dated and unrealistic - (make up, set) - story didn't really draw me in - watch at your own peril.

0345803485|1.0|December 29, 2012, Maryland.<br />In regards to Fifty Shares of Grey, I have not read the book and I do not plan to read it. I have read some of the reviews, and those were enough for me.  Thanks to all of you who braved the erotica waters of \\"Fifty Shares of Grey,\\" and came back to report your findings (i.e., reviews).<br /><br />As I am writing this review, Channel 4 news is reporting that this book has now become the basis for a \\"legitimate\\" course in academia.  Oh my!<br /><br />I would like to submit to those reviewers, who wonder how this book became a \\"best seller,\\" the following: Think about it. \\"Best seller\\" is not synonymous with \\"quality.\\"  It does not always have to do with the \\"quality\\" of writing, but rather with \\"quantity\\" of books sold. Those who were curious about the book, and purchased it, helped to make it a \\"best seller.\\"<br /><br />Trashy and juvenile as it may seem (based on the reviewer comments that I read), it seems to have become a best seller by default! The deed it done, let's get over it and move on.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This diary style novel is structured as a series of letters written from high school freshman Charlie to an anonymous older character. Charlie relays a coming of age tale that examines sex, relationships, and family dynamics through the awkward lens of an ostracized teen. I read the book in one evening and it can relate to mine, if not everyone's, life during those awkward teenage years. I am equally excited to watch the movie that has been made as well. However, I do have some reservations with some of the concepts and themes. At times it was incredibly hard to relate to Charlie. He is a dynamic character but sometimes his eccentricities got in the way of the plot of the book. But, Chbosky wants this novel to be a character study more than anything, so it is understandable. All in all it is a great book for a rainy day stuck at home.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is amazing. It's definitely a life changing book. It makes you think about not only the main character's problems, but you're own as well.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Overall, Hopeless is a well-rounded book. The author does a great job with character development, as well as writing an interesting and suspenseful plot.<br /><br />However, I felt like this book was an emotional mess at times (as in, Sky seemed like a 12 year old, not a 17 year old), and there was too much reiteration. I also think there should be more development into the future of the characters, instead of so much in their past. Granted, the past of the characters was the foundation this book was standing on, but there were a lot of loose ends at the end of the book.<br /><br />Anyways, it's an ok book. I was bored with a lot of it. But, Hoover's a young author. I believe her future works will continue to get better.
0525953728|5.0|If you want to know most of the details of the op on #1 then read this book, If your active or retired it is defiantly worth the read.

B00797MB0O|1.0|Practically 2 hours of my life is gone. I understood the plot but it wasn't funny like it claims. At least it was free. If you like watching a grown woman ruin her life with alcohol and a relationship that's never going to happen, this is the movie for you. Take this as you will.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|love this game. Play on my kindle fire<br />but. cant seem to access new Colors.  don't know what to do<br /><br />I have virtual coins but want Colorado. help!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Love this story! Found it very elegant written and relatable for everyone! Interested in seeing the film to see his this story translates to the screen
B004AQR29C|4.0|It's a good storyline. Some of the acting is bad. Great action and fight scenes. Overall good movie to rent.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is really, really good. Ever since I first read the first  \\"Diary Of A Wimpy Kid\\", I have been hooked!  I've been waiting and waiting for this book to come out! It is SO funny!I recommend it for kids 6 (maybe 5) up to any age! I rate it five stars! If your  looking  for a new series to read, get this! I highly recommend it!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I was surprised to see some good actors in this movie. The plot is very good and a prohibition period movie is always good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very clever characters. I would recommend this book to every one of my friends and I am glad that this book was recommended to me.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I could not put any of these books down. I read them twice! The trilogy Fifty Shades,  Ffty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed was a beautiful, erotic love story of two people finding themselves and coming to terms with their love and moving  it to solid ground.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|great action flim with a good story line and excellent action. i would recommend this movie for anyone that likes action flims.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I honestly think that this is the best of the Wimpy Kid Series. An unexpected twist at the end when Abigail ends up going out with Rowley instead of Greg
0738212415|5.0|Very clear lessons and uncomplicated instructions make this a very useful learning source for the absolute beginner. I would recommend this book for anyone who is learning to drawing realistically.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I loved this book  Lee child's did a great job creating a  story that keeps you wanting to read as  much as you can without having to put  the book down  one of his best.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I was looking for the bubble game yahoo games, or something like it. This is nothing like it. It is boring.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This has to be one of the best games I played for the kindle beautiful graphics and a lot of things to do and it only a dollar
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I love these. I now own the original and the epic, along with two knockoff versions. The perplexus brand are the absolute best and worth every penny. I can't wait for them to make more!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This pinball works great on my new tablet. It is easy to install and use.  My grandkids like it a bunch
B00631VJIC|5.0|I an a huge SOA fan and this CD rocked all the songs I enjoyed threw the first four seasons. I play it all the time wish there were more CD to get for this sound track.
B008OOYALE|1.0|It stinks it is terrible  but it only gets good if your like level ditty and<br />It is not as good as it looks on the cover well on the kindle fire
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Excellent film. Great message. Good acting..  One of the best classics ever made.  My wife even loved the movie.  Rock star.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the book can't wait for the movie!! I couldn't stop reading and now I'm onto the third book. Excited!!
B000VHMF0A|4.0|I missed the Marley era - my head so squarely in jazz, so this is a perfect collection of his work to introduce myself to his Reggae genius.  LEGEND has expanded my musical world.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is amazing! I just have one thing that kind if put my satisfaction a little down. You should add zombie pigmen, endermen, and the option to build armor but overall, it's an amazing game
B001TAJGO6|1.0|It was supposed to be a feel-good romantic comedy chick flick. Seriously????  That was a movie? People got paid to do that??
B003O86FMW|5.0|After watching the first book on DVD I started reading the second book. I couldn't put it down, page turner. I lived in the hunger games world for two days. Great trilogy. Great job Suzanne Collins.
B00633W614|5.0|Wonderfully fleshed out characters. The interwoven plot keeps you guessing. I can't wait for the next one in the series.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I absolutely love Tina Fey, and you can really hear her voice as your reading it. I could read this over and over and it still cracks me up. I love her writing style. Easy to read, and lots of fun!
0061743526|5.0|Just the way the book is printed and bound makes it feel like a special book. The story is well known, but this copy is a unique gift for a fan of literature.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I breezed through the book as it pushed me quickly along the story.  I just watched the video last week and this filled in the blanks.
1423165691|5.0|Book just feels and looks amazing. Great paper and printing. Nicely done. Informative. Any Disney fan needs at least one copy of this in their library.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Pretty good game.  It is keeping my interest.  I have had a little lag here and there, but nothing to bad.  Fun enough that I am sticking with it.
0786860707|5.0|An amazing book. It is as if Ollie Johnston was teaching a class on animation or talking to me about animation. Great book. I love the book and the amazing printing
B005NQ5LQ4|5.0|If your a IP MAN fan, I highly suggest this movie..  Very good.  Highly recommend it.  A must have movie.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This one went so many places for me. Deep into science and history. With a much needed look into the characters lives. Very well done.
B009MB682W|5.0|Unlike the many other James Bond theme song collection you can find, the songs in this album are by the original artists.  Thus, I can't complain.  I did have to buy the Skyfall theme song separately to add to this collection but that's a small thing.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Love it, have watched it twice so far, replacing all VCR tapes with new DVD's.  Should bring years of enjoyment to our home.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This game was easy to learn and a lot of fun. The graphics are great, though there is sometimes a little delay getting from screen to screen. Most of the puzzles aren't too hard, but the game is long enough that it takes a little while to get through anyway. For the price, it is an incredible value.
B008KE3960|1.0|Not good quality, do not buy !!!! spend your money on something else.  Spend your money on other products, please
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Cannot help but love John Corey and his relentless humor in the face of grim circumstances - DeMille is my favorite author and wait for his books to come out - he never disappoints.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|awesome, fun, hilarious, great freaking movie! makes you want to get up and dance and sing along! So worth seeing!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|A Very good, entertaining movie we thoroughly enjoyed it - interesting parallel to previous Bourne  series. Looking forward to sequels.
B004LP601S|5.0|LOVE IT. Panic sounds awesome, and I am especially loving their song Ballad of Mona Lisa. It is amazin!! The video is cool, too.Buy it if you are a fan of Panic, you will love it , and will not be dissapointed!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|A terrific sequel that grabs you in the first minute and does not let go - the added humor was a plus for me.  Highly recommend.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The product fits great.<br />I have purchased  Kindle Fire cases from other sources that did not fit very good.<br />This item feels soft.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Like Transformers: Dark of the Moon, there is enough vehicle action going on in and around the city that's treated like a racecourse where the traffic lights, buildings, parked cars are just obstacle-course challenges to see the anti-destructive behavior of The Batcopter and the Batcycle. I think it's better to leave your brains at home and not figure out too hard all the odd moments of the film such as Catwoman's 'kiss of life' to Batman before he takes off in the Bat in the distant sea and disappears in a mushroom cloud, without any trace of a tsunami wall-like wave effect that would seem to threaten the bridge-stranded bus along with the children's lives on the bridge. Wearing my wireless headphones for more than 2 hours can be relaxing as the movie soundtrack's drum, horn and violin music breaks the silence during conversation scenes and city action scenes. Bain's villain voice sounds like Darth Vader and his poem-like words in his speeches can be funny and annoying at the same time ::
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I order this cable because I recently purchased a Kindle fire. I have order cables from other sources and they not worked very long. I would recommend this this to friends.
B00785P2QC|4.0|very fun game I have no problems with it at all. I play the free version and it has no limit. def worth playing if ur into strategy
B0043ZDU1E|4.0|My wife is a big fan of Loreena McKennitt. Have all of her CD's except her live one. I personally have not listen to it yet. That is the only reason I'm giving the 4 stars. Love her Celtic sound and voice.
B009GESJH2|2.0|Kid Rock is my favorite artist of all time but what music direction is he going towards? His best albums have been &#34;Devil Without A Cause&#34;, &#34;Kid Rock&#34; and &#34;Rock n Roll Jesus&#34;. Rock has proven to be a great songwriter and has proven to rock all genres. Lately, it seems that he is stuck on this fun country bluesy garbage when he has such a broad range of music ability. My words of wisdom to Bobby is...go back to what you are good at..good songwriting and good music...not this crap that my 1 year old can write.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Many AMC shows rise in popularity after a few seasons (see: The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad), and Mad Men was no exception. Aforementioned in the title, this series does not disappoint and at these Amazon prices, why not have a hard copy of one of the best shoes on air? The box set is beautiful, following suit of Season One's. I would highly recommend this purchase!
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|This game needs better directions, but even once I figured it out I found it very boring very quickly. I think I might have played it three times total and removed the app. Great concept, but it needs a ton of work.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a great game for the kindle fire.  Well worth the price for the full version.  Amazing graphics and good puzzles.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|This is not a game that tries to &#34;bring things to a whole new level.&#34; Instead it seems to only care about one thing... having fun! It is totally dorky, goofy, and 80's feeling. This all adds to why I have kept playing it. It would be better if the difficulty would increase a little slower. I have yet to even try anything except the beginner level and I seem to suck that even that. However, it is still fun to play. If you like the racing games from the 80's and 90's game stations, buy this one.
B00846REIS|5.0|A fantastic and easy read that makes you cherish the relationship you may be in! Really made me cling to my boyfriend and how uncomplicated it truly is! Puts I'm sure he'll agree with the mood some of these chapters put me in! :)
B009MCRHH6|1.0|Ok, let's get the good stuff out of the way right off the bat. This game has some of the most entertaining graphics of any game out there. From what I was able to see of the characters, they are highly entertaining. The sounds on this game are pretty dang funny too. There is a small problem though. The developers worked so hard making it look cool, they forgot to make it intuitive. I was never able to figure out how to actually play the game! I tried every button I could find and it never started the actual game. I found buttons to do all kinds of things other than play the game, but that was about it. Maybe better directions next time?
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|total recall. totally different than the first version and not as good.Ok rental but not for your library. thats all
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator for basic home use. This does the job great. I like the list feature. Can't beat the free price.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I knew she really enjoyed the movie and would like to see it again
B005HSG3VK|3.0|This cover does the job as a cover and allows was when holding during use.  Although this cover is fairly sturdy,  It does not protect the kindle. It also does not hold itself up for no hands viewing. Bottom line, if you simply need a covering, this is your product.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I gave these to my son and son-in-law for Christmas as they had them on their Christmas list to watch
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this is one of the best games I ever played it has a awesome new tower that's not on computers.<br />I recommend this game for all monkey and tower defence lovers . &amp;)
B007HACDLK|5.0|I will preface this review with the fact that I have read every single Vince Flynn book so I'm definitely a fan. This book is a good one, and although it is not my all time favorite it is definitely a solid one of his and better than most books out there.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Ok so I just finished watching the entire Firefly season and topped it off with Serenity. I can honestly say that no sci-fi series and movie has touched me the way this one has. The characters were so very real and genuine with flaws that weren't contrived or overdone. The film continued to emphasize this and one really cool thing was the belief, faith and love that really came to be a foundation of the story and the lives of these people. I just don't know that there has ever been or will be a show and movie like this again. I lament its conclusion and wish there was a way we could see what happened to the crew of Serenity. If you love science fiction and you haven't seen this masterpiece then you need to carve out some time to check this out!
0375869026|5.0|Wonderful book, especially the part about kindness.  I highly recommend it for all ages -- young or old.  If more people followed the theme of the book, the world would be a better place.
037571457X|5.0|One will learn about the Iranian revolution through the Iranian perspective. Heart-felt, Actually Funny, and Sad. Great mini facts and well written for entertainment. Never a dull moment !
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I'm at a loss for words.... I am unable to figure out who the target audience is here. Can't believe I spent money for this.
B0086700CM|5.0|Who doesn't like to run from angry jungle apes? No internet needed, helps time on the train pass by. Fun and challenging ... it only looks easy, but looks are deceiving.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|A book that offers intrigue and intimacy woven into an amazingly British story of a girl's quest for authenticity and respect as well as love.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Easy to play for kids (mine are five and eight) and fun for adults. A lot of variety and quick games for those times when you are on the go.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|(some spoilers)This review is for the game Journey only. I give it a 4 1/2 stars out of 5*. Amazing game, and not everyone will get it unless they understand it. The game is short, but it was created to be played over and over again. You meet different players who can't chat with you, but the cool part is that the game tells you who they are at the end (their psn username).<br /><br />visuals: The game is visually stunning. the most beautiful graphics/design I have ever seen.<br /><br />game-play: The game-play is VERY simple, but for some reason I feel like I am doing a lot more in this game than any other game.<br /><br />music: The music is amazing, it definitely gives this game excitement and emotion, and tells the story even though there is no dialogue.<br /><br />conclusion: Amazing game. You need to understand this game in order to enjoy it to the fullest. It is designed to be played over and over again. Love it! the only reason I slashed a half star off is because there could had been more environments to find secretes in. Is the story game-play good as is? definitely, but I feel like they could had added worlds that aren't part of the main story, and you just explore them and find extra clues and secretes in them.<br /><br />UPDATE: Journey has been a lot of fun, but after a few weeks I started to lose interest in the game since there was nothing else to do. I do not regret buying it at all only because of that. The game is amazing, but like all games, there comes a time when you just lose interest in the game. I still highly recommend this game.
0671449028|5.0|I read this book over and over to my older grandchildren when they were small.  Now a new little one will get to listen and enjoy it too.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Compared to Justin Cronin's series about vampires, the Zombie Wars book suffers badly, mostly in the incredibility of its basic premise (what are zombies and where do they come from?). Cronin's explanation for the origins, nature and physiology of vampires is believable and quite compelling; Brooks' explanation for zombies (a virus that &#34;reanimates&#34; the brains of the dead, enabling the body to live, sort of, as long as the brain isn't destroyed) has no possible basis in science; and his zombies are therefore incredibly uninteresting. The only problem humanity has to solve with the zombies is how to kill them efficiently and in large numbers by destroying their brains. It's a pity that Brooks never addresses this fundamental problem since he writes well, and his war &#34;documentary&#34; includes a number of &#34;interviews&#34; that are quite clever.
B0000AK7AA|4.0|Just purchased this as a gift,  if you like these movies its a good little movie and for the price it was worth it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great book.  Great action.  Easy reading.  great for an afternoon curled in front of a fire on a rainy day.
B000V39KDO|3.0|This is a good guy movie, I enjoyed it I like history and I think its worth watching. Good purchase
B004N44SOI|5.0|[[ASIN:B004N44SOI This Is Gonna Hurt]]<br /><br />I bought this CD to go with the book as both this and The Heroine Diaries are basically Rock Opera's for your Brain.<br /><br />I was not one bit disappointed as the songs on this CD are powerful and moving. The songs help us to understand that we are beautiful no matter what our \\"dust cover\\" may look like. You cannot help but Smile when you listen to these songs. Some are filled with pain, but it is a beautiful pain as you come to the realization that you ARE Beautiful. There are people who cannot see that in themselves and this CD helps them to do it.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this CD to a friend or a passerby. Great Work SIXX: AM
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I have purchased all these so of course I had to have the last one.  Good CD. Some repeats from other CDs but good.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I bought this adapter so my wife could charge her Iphone in an Otterbox case.  I took a generic apple capable alarm clock and super glued a brace on it for the phone to lean on.  With this apapter she can set her phone on the alarm clock to charge with the otter box case still on it.
B00866JL96|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, Not like the book of course but good.  Good girl movie night cause Zac Efron is cute!!!
1608862771|5.0|I'm biased, I love everything Mattias Adolfsson does. It's intricate and whimsical and purely creative. I'm glad to have this as part of my Adolfsson collection. Check out his personal Etsy shop for goods not available on Amazon
B004YM6JLO|5.0|We love this series!! Its just a very good TV series.  I think they are kinda expensive on dvd but well worth the purchase if you like the show
B00AAX68HG|5.0|So much fun to play.  Getting better the more I play.  Was looking for something that wouldn't get boring so fast.  Think this will keep me interested for a long time!!
B0058YPL66|5.0|If you liked Fairy Tales this is a great show . I like how they bring all kinds of different characters from different fairy tales
B007N5YIUS|4.0|ANGRY BIRDS SPACE is great fun. This game is addicting. I love the challange. It is much more difficult than all the others.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Got this for my husband who LOVES it.  We are older and learning to do new things is sometimes difficult but he really got right into it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game, great for price. My only complaint is that the map shows action available sometimes when you have already cleared an area. The manager s office in the beginning of the game kept showing an available action in the safe though there wasn't one. Puzzles were hard enough to keep me interested without being frustrating. Good for a few hours of gameplay.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is very entertaining!<br />I highly recommend it to fill in any down time you may have!!<br /><br />All must try!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I downloaded a book to my computer as your supposed to but it went to the kindle for pc instead of my tablet I wish there was a way to transfer it without having to call customer service
B000W9DSVW|5.0|Love my OCEANS trilogy. I love these movies and picked up two for family gifts. These are great stories and were on sale at a wonderful price. I love 11 and 13 the best, and can skip 12 any time... Much like Inidana Jones.... : )
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm a seventeen yr old girl, so you guys will know who's perspective you're getting... it was a really nice read, finished it in about two days because I couldn't put it down. Had nice turn off events, a healthy dose of romance, passion, pain, and an ending that's believable but leaves you in a good head space.. 5 out of 5
B009JBZH54|5.0|The best B MAN package available. I have watched it with my son more than once and he has watched the new one many times... Packaging is GREAT and arrived right on time.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I can see that others might find this story line stretching credibility too far, but the 'big' plot worked for me and I didn't see the ending coming. Isn't that what mysteries are all about?
B00821OW8K|1.0|Falling Skies, for me, was a disappointment.  The premise for the series, aliens invade, has been done to death.  For some reason, every show on the tube has to have some kind of family drama to go along with the lizards, zombies, or whatever is threatening the American ma/pa cohort.  Not to say this does not work for me because I like the Walking Dead.  However, this show spends too much time with trite dad, kid, friend characters that we have seen before and not enough time establishing any interesting alien science.  Walking Dead is grittier with characters that have a complexity far beyond those in this series.  Walking Dead presents a society that is truly dystopian showing us how these characters must change to deal with the new and very horrible world.  The science in that series is also sparse but it fits and enhances character and plot.  This is not happening in Falling Skies.  Nor did it happen in Terra Nova with its obnoxious nuclear family.  Same for Revolution.  I have no reason to watch this stale show so I am going to rerun my Babylon Five DVDs to clear out my mind.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The game itself is okay, but it has 'ads' attached to it. I know, it was free, but I'd rather pay for my apps in the future to get rid of the ads.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughters love this game. They play this game every day now.  Thank you for creating the beautiful game for little girls.
B000HF702E|5.0|DVD arrived on time for the holidays and was packed very well. Fun, light, holiday entertainment for the family with unexpected plot line twists.
1451695195|1.0|I'm glad he survived his brain disease but, sad to say, his NDE experience was demonic for at least three reasons:  1. Jesus is never mentioned except in passing. Satan's plan is to get people to think they can get to heaven without Jesus. 2. The author refers to God with a \\"personal pronoun\\" of Om which is a part of Hinduism/Buddhism. This is a subtle attempt by Satan to lead people to other avenues to God outside of Jesus, which is impossible. 3. He describes heaven as a \\"vast, inky-black core,\\" where an orb talks to him and says there are many universes. John says, in 1 John 1:5 \\"...God is light; in him there is no darkness at all.\\"
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing book! I read it in 2 days. From start to finish I couldn't put it down<br /> A must read, loved it.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Me and my daughter play this we love it just wish there was a easier way to get bling and hearts
B003JTHXOK|5.0|good book, kept my attention well. predictable but still good. I'll be eager to see the movie. I loved the ending, not predictable at all. made it a feel good ending.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but I was drawn in and it was such a good movie. All the characters/actors were wonderful and you really cared what happened to them. The movie has some great insights into getting older and how different people deal with aging. Stunning scenery and a range of great emotions from humor to sadness. I have now watched it 3 times now and each time is just as wonderful as the first time. I cry and laugh along with the characters each time. Highly recommended for all.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not as bad as I thought and good ending, definitely some raunchy sex scenes that brought out another side to me!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It is nice to have an alarm clock on kindle fire hd  I use it instead of a regular clock. And it was free
B000MV8XPG|5.0|My grandson loves this, its a great toy!  A little expensive. Price went up right before Xmas.  My grandson is 2.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|love these types of adventure games.  dislike the ones that allow you to play a few levels only to require you to purchase the full version to continue
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We loved the price.  We watched it after we purchased it and we are very glad that we did buy it.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|This movie was pretty good I like Jeremy Renner but the previous Bourne movies were alot better. Could of been better.
B002YDTPHA|5.0|I thought The Final Destination was quite enjoyable.  It's fun and exciting, and the ending is very intense.  Highliy recommended.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|this is the best movie i got it very quickly and it was packed well and came in a nicely packed which is nice so the dvd would not get broken in shipment
B009CPES4I|5.0|This movie has a stellar cast (Maggie Smith, Judi Dench) and a delightful premise.  My husband and I enjoyed it, as well as my 17 year-old daughter.  She is very taken with India and wishes to travel there after college.  I don't want to risk any spoilers, but I highly recommend this movie!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Can't wait to see the movie now, hoping they keep it the same though!  definitely suspenseful and a good, easy read (completed in one day!!)
B00APUQRPC|3.0|This is a good movie, it's Clint Eastwood so you wouldn't expect anything but good. It was a little slow at parts but still a great movie to watch.
0525478817|4.0|Great book for both parents and teens.  I like how it didn't take the subject of cancer and just make it this dark book you had to endure.  There were moments of sweetness, humor, and horror.  But they were all mixed together. . .like real life.  Just have the tissues ready!
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a great addition. I can't seem to find the option to buy the Dr Doof levels that are supposed to be available.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|A good movie overall, doesn't take itself too seriously. Thought it would be funnier than it was. I wouldn't let a thirteen year-old see this, probably 17 or older, due to the casual sexual themes.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's ok.....but they should let u continue without paying! I hate games like this! It's fun but they shouldn't call it free cuz It's not.
B003L77FYS|1.0|the dvd will not play on my new or old dvd player I bought this for my husband he loves Castle
B0091LS07E|3.0|Good cd, but not as good as her previous ones.  I love Alicia Keys so anything she sings is good.
B001XRLWPQ|1.0|the dvd will not play, bought a new dvd player b/c it would play on my old one, still won't play
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|Survivalcraft is fun it just that it's really bugging me when your in the middle of building, it says trial time is up .their just doing that to make you buy it!
B0053O89KG|1.0|none of the DVD disks will play on the old DVD or the new one I bought for him as his Christmas presents
B00992CF6W|5.0|For those people who thinks minecraft is boring, you thought wrong<br />!minecraft is amazing and its like doing something you've never done before, people put 1star because there is no updates on the kindle edition ,their actually is!
B003F3NDWG|1.0|I bought this for my husband, I also bought a new DVD player, it does not play on it or my old DVD playee
B005K17RU0|4.0|This works. I have had no problems with it and it comes up quickly for any of several locations I use.
B002RPR6DU|4.0|One of Bruce Dern's best and one of the first solid 'man/environment v corporate exploitation' adventure films. Perhaps the seeds of Avatar were planted here.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Great book by the founders of the raspberry pi product; I highly recommend this book to any and all users as it is a great starting point for the product and describes in detail what the purpose is for. Great product!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I have seached everywhere for a solution for this....<br />The text is way to small and pictures are to big.... fix please
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Very personal and revealing tribute to inner strength and shear willpower. Although sometimes a little too much biblical reference it demonstrates the power of true faith to overcome huge obstacles. Well worth the time. Would be a great movie !
B0086700CM|3.0|I think there should be more obstacles. And there should be more coins. Plus, there aren't many things that you can buy in the store besides boosts,people, and backgrounds.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is clearly his best effort in years with all the right detail , clarity , intrigue and suspense you expect from Mr. Clancy. Well done. My faith restored in the master story teller . You won't want to put it down.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|kids Christmas gift.  we enjoyed it when we watched it before.  my youngest has not watched it yet, but she will like it
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Time killer when I need to kill time.  Addicting at times when reading is not enough. I am having fun.
0345529057|4.0|Really enjoyed having the series at my fingertips and not having to wait to read the next book. Great imagery and writing in this series.. I'm quite a bit older and don't feel like I'm reading children's books, highly recommended.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|just started watching this year ,so i ordered one and two and preordered 3, not for childen i wish i watched it sooner
B004SEUJ82|5.0|I bought this for a frien who wanted to give this as xmas present to a couple of her friends.  It is a sad but good movie the price was good and when the woman wanted a couple more it was an even better price!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|While this show certainly isn't for everyone, I think its some of the best TV on right now.  While the second season is actually on right now (and a completely different story arc), this was/is a great show.  Watching the pilot, one sometimes wonder if this was too much even for cable.  That's one of the reasons this was so good.  It really seemed to be pushing the limits of TV.  If you're a fan of dark humor, dark stories and discovering something new; watch this.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|Okay - why is Adelle not on this CD?  The song is sold separately - very disappointing!  Well as a James Bond-er, I enjoyed the soundtrack... works well for background music while reading the kindle!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy. It kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. Very well written.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It kept you at the end of your seat.  Had a hard time putting it down. Very well written and a different twist of a story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Would definitely recommend. Great fun. Just enough action. Superb imagery. I have read it twice. I will definitely read it again.
B00846TRHY|4.0|Interesting movie and makes you rethink what you are doing to help the world be a better, more loving place.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Brings back memories of better days. A little difficult to move joy stick but fun trying. Will definitely recommend to friends.
0545265355|5.0|LOVE this series!  These are a quick, fun read.  I'm not usually into the tween stuff, but these are great.
B009VB998I|5.0|An absolutely wonderful movie. It is so very visually stunning! Also, Amazon has made it very easy to rent and watch in just seconds. I am a satisfied customer. :)
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Right size, and backpack itself is light enough to carry around but spacious to place as many gears that I want to carry with me.<br />Very good design,<br />Go for it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not one to read often however I finished this book in about four days. This book always has the readers attention and some times is very relatable.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I LOVE SPIDER SOLITAIRE BUT THE ANNOYING ADS BETWEEN THE  Games makes me not play as much as I would if they were not part of the download.
6305692572|5.0|The movie really hits home concerning dealing with depression and how it affects the person and family.  Meg Ryan's character plays an alcoholic, but the alcoholism is only her way of coping with her depression.  The movie really shows a great example of how a mental illness and/or addiction can affect the whole family.
B00866JLEG|5.0|I was very interested in seeing Zac Eaton and has first romantic roll. I was not disappointed. I thought she was very good..
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Love many of the songs.  I can listen to it all the way through many times and not skip a song.
B009MO5G90|5.0|I think this is my second favorite Resident Evil movie of the franchise. People are always going to complain about the character of Alice because she is not to be found in any of the games and was an original character created by the director of the Resident Evil franchise film series. But as much as people complain about this, these movies are still doing okay box office wise. So even though people don't like to freely admit it, they seem to actually like the character of Alice.<br /><br />With that being said, this would be my favorite of the series as far as a completely original story goes. Its actually highly entertaining, it has amazing visuals and great sound. It brings in a few more new characters from the Resident Evil games that they have not put in any of the other movies before which was cool, and they brought back Wesker which is probably my favorite character from the actual games.<br /><br />I would say that Resident Evil: Apocalypse is still my favorite Resident Evil movie so far because it is the one that resembles an actual Resident Evil game the most (Resident Evil 3: Nemesis). But, I wouldn't put Resident Evil Retribution very far behind it at all because it is so highly entertaining. It might possibly be even better because of the 3D.<br /><br />As far as the 3D goes this has got to be one of the BEST 3D movies I've ever seen. A lot of people seem to say that the 3D in Resident Evil Afterlife was better but I have to disagree. I think this movie had more pop-out shots as well as CONSTANT DEPTH. It looked so freaking amazing. It would have to be one of my top 5 3D movies to date. Had this movie not had the amazing 3D I probably would only give this movie 3 or 4 stars but I really wasn't expecting the 3D to be this good. This movie is worth the purchase just for the 3D alone.
1416594795|3.0|Actually as a biologist and soil scientist I was somewhat disappointed given all the flap about the book.  Nothing new really but I could have wasted my time on something far less educational so everything was not lost.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to read this book before seeing the movie since it was becoming so popular. I felt it was a fun read and had a lot of suspense throughout the story. I couldn't put it down and it only took a couple days to get through. I'm excited to venture to the other books in the series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was witty and smart and had me laughing as tears rolled down my face. My family is experiencing something very similar to this story and I found this book to be healing. There is no way to know how to deal with these situations, but these kids and their take on life helped somehow. Maybe this book is for me what An Imperial Affliction was for them. Thank you for writing this...I needed it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids love it and I play it as well, I love it when I am needing to pass time =)
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This is a really cool game. The photos look pretty darn awesome and I wouldn't ever know how realistic they are.I can't wait to beat it
B008L1DNGI|4.0|DISCLOSURE: I enjoyed ChuChu Rocket when it was first out on the Dreamcast.<br />This puzzle game is both adorable and addictive. The goal, for those uncertain, is to get the mice to their rockets without falling into harms way. Harm comes in the form of holes or cats. The method of success comes from placing a limited number of directional tiles on the board that can be directed with to get to their ships.<br />I won't go into any more details such as &#34;rules&#34;, but the game is immensely fun. Whether you want to play for long stints or simply a few puzzles at a time, ChuChu Rocket is a &#34;blast&#34;! The puzzles do start out simple and easy, and before you know it you're blasting through the first 10 and realizing they've gotten harder without you even knowing it.<br />The game isn't &#34;easy&#34; but it does ease you into the concepts. This game is fantastic for beginners and experts alike. The music, characters, and style are all quirky and enjoyable. If you're a newcomer to the experience, give it a chanc
B0086700CM|5.0|My cousin showed me this game on her kindle I loved it the first time I played it. Now that I have my own kindle I find it  way more fun. I showed my hole family this game they loved it to. The best part is its free and no ads. I think it's great for anyone who loves games and for any age
B007AL48UK|4.0|lots of fun when traveling . Amazon has some good games. I downloaded a couple of the mahjong games to past the time traveling from pa to GA.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great combination of hidden object and puzzles! I was able to play it for almost a week before I finished it! I thought it was the perfect length of game play! Interesting story line, cool and creepy scenes, lots of fun!!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I just couldn't get into this. There were some clever lines but overall I felt like I needed to morph back to a high schooler to really embrace it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoy the structure of the book.  I like that it is written In letters and I'm ready to watch the movie now
B000001E3L|5.0|This album is pure Van Morrison energy. Right from the start you can tell Van and this all star band are there to kick butt, and they do.  Grab it and turn it up.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I fell in love with this book. It's so different but good at the same time. John green is a really good writer.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I had a hard time stomaching the movie after the VT shooting joke. Alas, i thought the movie was only slightly funny at intervals.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It really is a great book. Even rereading it, it hasn't lost that intensity that first drew me to it!
B0055V0GQC|5.0|This is a piece of pure hard rock'n'roll, that should be reheared and reaheared,<br />should be lived throught,<br />and should be honored as an ultimate classics.<br /><br />Simple.<br />Hard.<br />Honest.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A great, honest book, realistic, funny, sad, and quirky. Good for teens and adults, a story about high school, friendship, and finding one's self. Loved it
0736092269|5.0|Great volume to refresh your memory of which exercise effect which muscle group and also help you setup an exercise schedule. It's worth the $10+. The drawings are very accuracy and detail.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|It made me really feel for the poor little orphans.  Snicket has quite an imagination.  Now I am curious as to their future and have to read the next story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I don't normally play games liked this one but a friend of mine has it on their kindle and she liked it
B008GXHOFW|5.0|The game is great I played it on my kindle fire hd the only problem is the game is to short and on free roam all I do is defuse bombs other than that the game is five stars
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Reading this book made my heart melt. Love can concern anything if you but your mind and soul to it.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I have always been scared to spend money on my kindle fire but this was worth it. The controls were easy and music was great. It brings back lots of good memories. It took up a little more than 200 megabytes on my kindle. I am always worried about memory usage.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|Excel continues to shut down after a few minutes EVERY time. Didn't even bother to try Word. Don't waste your $0.99 on this one!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The device works perfectly to download from the computer to the Kindle. Isn't that what it is designed to do?
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game has the graphics the nice quality Sound, it really just gives &quot;me&quot; something to do.At school, home,anywhere basically.I have no regrets.I'm 12 and this is a good game.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 6 year old and her friends love this game. They could spend hours playing it. She especially loves that you can save the final hair style photo on the kindle fire. Even my toddler loves watching his sister style people's hair.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is one good book in which I rate a 5/5. I like it because it was very funny. I would highly recommend to read for all book lovers.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 6 year old loves this game and I love it too. It's easy enough for her to pass the levels, but because I actually try to cut all the ropes to get all the stars, the game is more complex for me. It's a game that everyone in my family enjoys
B0027MJU00|5.0|I know it's going to be a good read when I download a sample and just have to purchase the book to keep the momentum going. I was hesitant. Libby, the main character and narrator in parts, is not very likable. But as her story develops you come to understand how she got that way, through a combination of nature and environmental influences. Gillian Flynn, the author, goes a great job of developing the story, through present time and flashbacks that weave the plot to its ending with a twist that doesn't reveal itself too early on. Flynn is more well known for her second book, Gone Girl, which is on the Best Seller list. I tried a sample of that and wasn't as captivated as I was with Dark Places. I may go back now and try it again.
B005R473G8|5.0|I am French, live in the US, majored in comp. lit. had not read this particular work of Maupassant. It was a great pleasure to be able to read it in French on my Kindle.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|Yet another movie in which aliens attack planet Earth (looking for some sort of resource, as usual) and after giving humans a run for our money, the world -- led by the USA, of course -- ends up prevailing.  The aliens always have some sort of weakness that can be exploited, fortunately -- something that I suspect will not be the case should anything like this (unlikely though it might be) actually happen.  But it's the weakness of the individual aliens that perplexes me somewhat.  Initially, they seem virtually indestructible; then it's determined that they do have weak spot; after which they are picked off relatively easily even though most of the nearly-continuous shooting on the part of the Marines does not appear all that precise; then toward the end one of the character feels the need to remind some of the others where weak spot is.  This apparent inconsistency is a bit irksome.  Added to that is some of the standard sentimental, patriotic elements that clearly have a \\"propaganda\\" purpose.  Aside from that, the action is pretty good and the special effects are decent.
B0045HCJ6M|5.0|Great basic story..great  &#34;classic&#34; actors ..memorable lines throughout the movie  even for our time.. It's fun<br />  I really love it.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|I am a Clair Danes fan going all the way back to the 90s, but don't have Showtime, so I bought the DVD set of the First Season of Homeland. (I would have bought it even if it was not so critically lauded and Emmy-awarded.) The show makes for very compelling viewing. There are several plotline variables that you are not sure about, which keeps it suspenseful. The cast is pretty good. Claire is excellent. Damian Lewis does a fine job, but I would not have nominated him for an Emmy neccessarily. The writing, cinematography and often jazz-based (think Miles Davis) musical score all seem pretty well executed. The storyline is current and it is worthwhile viewing. Still, I would not go so far as to call Homeland truly masterful or \\"the best show on TV,\\" etc.<br /><br />There appear to be a few extras, at least on the fourth disc of the DVD set. I have not checked them out yet. As far as content, there is some nudity in the pilot episode, but not after that if I recall correctly. Also, there are fairly heavy doses of profanity throughout, FYI.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This was a great date movie! It wasn't a \\"dumb\\" comidy. It was a very funny take on growing up in the 80's & 90's and the growing up we often still do as adults. Oh and news flash, just because there's a talking bear, you still shouldn't let your kids see it before the age of 15.
B008NW67E0|5.0|but not as good as sigh no more.  sophmore albums rarely live up to the freshman effort.  still 5 stars
B004H1V5RU|5.0|AWESOME!  is exactly what my 9 year old said when he received this for Christmas.  He continues to play with it, and spend hours with it absorbed in the game.  I highly recommend it.  His two older brothers, 14 and 11 are constantly asking to play with it as well.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE COULD RELATE TO MOST OF THEIR EXPERIENCES.  THIS MOVIE WAS VERY REALISTIC, AND HOPEFULLY COULD BE USED TO INFORM TEENAGERS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CHOOSE THE WRONG PATH.
0060763280|5.0|Eker helps you get over problems other than just your financial problems, he tells you how to be a generally good person all around in your subconscious thoughts, conscious thoughts and actions. I would recommend this to anybody, if you're having financial problems or not.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|The movie is a good family feature.  I love the imagination behind the story and the movie, itself.  Lovely feature.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|I have no problems with the plot, it was good.  The most exciting part two thirds through could have received more pages than some other stuff.<br /><br />I think the first person perspective bothered me.  I did this then did that....with no ability to really learn much about the characters.  And the 80's references...&#34;there was a poster of xyz band on the wall, I was wearing my name brand 80's shoes.  I liked to listen to this 80's band.&#34;  just kind of superficial.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|This game's dialect was extremely boring and repetitive.  Too much of the same puzzle types left me wanting a greater challenge and not as much conversation.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I bought this product as a gift. The recipient of this gift was thrilled. I am thrilled that my gift was a success.
B005KELW26|5.0|Use it all the time.  Love the Color and easy to find and good protection.here's five more words for you.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game keep me interested for hours, it is fun and I love it! Would recommend you try it you will not want to put it down.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Fun game. I don't like having to have all the ads everytime it deals. Once v per session would be good
B006CUDDUG|5.0|I found myself rereading pages just amazed at his spare and direct prose.<br />The story is frustrating and sad. It shows how the use of double agents compromises everyone. It reveals the spy trade deployed to protect us as devious and amoral capable of destroying honest, passionate and well meaning citizens in its effort to protect its  agents.<br />The cold war is long over and the Berlin wall is gone. For those of us who came of age in those years, especially those with relatives behind the Iron Curtain the book feels like an icy hand around your heart.<br />A brilliant and chilling book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is clever, sad, loving, heart-felt, and just plain out good. I recommend this to anyone looking to take a nice adventure with Charlie in his high school and personal life. I absolutely loved it. I was able to sympathize with almost all the characters. It makes you actually want to meet these people. It's great.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|This was a nice surprise.  It is extremely violent, but a great watch. This is movie reminds me of the movie Blow, but the the 2012 version.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always, Vince Flynn gives us another classic. Mitch Rapp is my favorite character of all time. Non-stop action from front to back. Masterful.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game its so much fun.. it has entertained myself n my kids for hours. I love all the different animal's.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I am a huge BONES fan, so I may not be the right person to review this. But if you LOVE a good drama laced with comedy, love affairs, and mushy, squishy or eerie murder mysteries is just the thing for you, then ALL SEASONS OF BONES is the perfect series for you!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game! So much fun to play! Glad this version is free. Angry birds is fun but it can get a bit boring after some time. But bad piggies almost never gets boring!! I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to build. Five stars for Bad Piggies!!!!
0547848412|5.0|I must be a theist because I understood the story to be that God uses many languages to communicate with us; Hindi, Christianity, and Islam to name a few.  We choose the story (religion) that is most lovely to us.  That is why I choose my own faith over other ones.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can not even begin to express what i feel about this book into words!! In fact, this the first review that I have ever written, and let me tell you, I have read so many books!  Ms. Hoover has written an amazing book filled with so many emotions! I cried, laughed, smiled, gasped, swooned and even blushed so many times throughout this book!<br />Her characters are complex but not too complex you can not relate to them. They have flaws that truely make you fall in love with each and every one of them.<br />Beautifully written! I can honestly say that this beautiful book will always be etched into my heart.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Anyone who loves a surprising, but happy ending will love this book! I could not put it down and lost a lot of sleep because of it bring so good!
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|My daughter loves her pouch and uses it often. it really does keep he new kindle fire very protected. :)
B001UW58YK|5.0|Do not hesitate to pick up the blu-ray of this concert if you are even considering it. The quality is excellent and the performance is show-stopping. This will make you a bigger fan of the Buble.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We thought \\"Homeland\\" was great! I am still longing for \\"24\\", but this series was also fast-paced, exciting, and kept you guessing. We are waiting to see the next season.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|What a transfer! I am completely shocked at the quality based on the age of the Montreal show. Sound is utter perfection and the concert will blow you away. MUST BUY!
B007O4XX9K|5.0|My husband swiped mine.  We both love this CD and Joe Walsh.  Analog Man is a great song.  The entire album is excellent.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a fantastic movie for kids and adults. Seeing it in blu ray really makes it even more enjoyable to watch with vivid colors and better sound.
B002L6I9Z4|3.0|The product description states that you can take 80 pictures, but in actuality it is full after 35 pictures. This is really annoying because you have to download pictures at least once a day!<br />Otherwise, the camera is colorful, fun and easy to use.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I love it<br />It is a club opinion<br />The wart is delicious considering the situation that guy is in .
B005FISBTO|5.0|Glad to catch up on Dexter.  The series just keeps going and keeping you guessing.  But a long wait before Season 7.

B0015XWUC2|5.0|Great CD  all the songs are soft soothing theme.  No scretching sounds.  A great  album to listen to with the one you love!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book throws in some shockers and overall makes you see things in a different perspective . Loved it .
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you've been looking for a solitaire app, you honestly need to look no further. It never ever crashes. The only ad is at the beginning of game play and there's none whatsoever afterwards. I can't fathom why anyone would hate this app (unless you're extremely bitter and can only find joy from giving great apps bad ratings) so download it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is such a fun app. Great app game to use when you are waiting at the dmv, during long commercials or when you are bored. Would definitely recommend!
B000002BPS|5.0|My husband asked for it for xmas and loved it! Now he is jamming out to tunes that take him back to the &#34;<br />good ol' day&#34;!
B0081SPK0I|2.0|I was looking forward to playing this game. But after installation, all i got was the sound . The screen was blank.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Art<br />This is the first black and white graphic novel that I've followed through and bought. It also has some of the most memorable panels I've ever seen even without the color. The Atlanta skyline and Rick on horseback for one.<br /><br />Story<br />Excellent pacing and unpredictable turn-of-events throughout.Kirkman makes it clear that this series is about Rick coping and, boy, does he have a lot to cope with in this first volume.<br /><br />This was a truly engaging read. I highly recommend it.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|I saw THE BOURNE LEGACY at the movies. Couldn't wait for it to come on DVD. Love you MATT DAMON, but JEREMY RENNER beats you on that one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book had so many twists and turns that made this book worth reading I read it in three days that's how much I loved this book
B00AMBH70S|1.0|For those who loved the Borne trilogy, don't waste your TIME (2:15!!) This was the most pathetic attempt to recreate or to continue the Bourne Movies. It was terribly edited!! So friggin slow, I was waiting and waiting for something to happen and it never really did. They made money off of using Bourne in the title!! He almost gets beat by a female psychiatrist. He get's shot once and passes out!!!! Really?!!!!?

B001C1066E|5.0|This thing is perfect, and looks like it's straight out of the cartoon.  Construction seems sturdy enough for now, but I'm sure with continued heavy use, the gold snap bars will start to separate from the fabric.
B00009RDGA|5.0|She mentioned that she loved this movie when I rented it about a year ago and she was surprised when she got it for Xmas.
B0094LV1D6|1.0|I paid for the HD version of this movie, but Amazon Unbox only allowed me to download the SD version to my PC?  What gives?
B0089K7DGW|5.0|I was intrigued by the writing in this series that I decided to purchase this. Not only does it come with the Bluray, but it also comes with the DVDs of all the episodes! This is a great buy, plain and simple!
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Really a great record.Joe listend to me about recording an album with great sound!! laugh out loud!! Every song on it is wonderful.Worth listening to over and over.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|&#34;You get what you expect&#34; comments don't do this one justice. I purchased this set during Cyber Monday for $4!!! Yes, four dollars. I was happy to score a deal on a bluray movie but when I received it I noticed it was the Bluray/DVD/Digital Copy version of the movie. Even at the $10 it is now it is a steal. I highly recommend purchasing this film!
B001CQONKY|4.0|If you like the previous CSI seasons, you cannot go wrong here with more gripping investigations from the CSI team.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|This film is great. I picked it up during Cyber Monday for $8 for the 3 disc set! However, I regretted my decision thereafter upon receiving the order. The film skipped around throughout different chapters. I asked Amazon to send me a new one soon thereafter and finally got myself a perfect copy. The waiting time itself for a good copy you should expect from Amazon alone brings the rating down to four stars. Other than that, the movie is fine. But beware of bad copies like I received.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I don't usually spend extra on toys and gimmicks when it comes to blu-rays, but this realistic walker head is stunning to look at out of the box. The detail is incredible and the screwdriver in the eye to unlock it is a fabulous touch.<br />Season 2 is set mainly on a farm and adds some new characters. In my opinion, season 2 is even better than the excellent season 1 and this box set is definitely worth buying.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|my VHS tape broke and every once in a while ... I just have to be able to watch it.  its one of those &#34;feel good&#34; movies.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|This second season is another superbly acted, well written show I cannot get enough of. The acting is so good, it is sometimes hard to believe you are watching actors playing a part. This is one of the best shows I have seen.

Finally, she looks upand says gravely, \\"I would ask the hays to find it.\\" (Sloan, Robin (2012-10-02). Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore: A Novel (Kindle Locations 3436-3437).

B008WCP2PG|5.0|I got Magic Mike for my sister for Christmas, kind of as a joke. She decided to watch it with our 84 year old mother, her husband and two of our older brothers. They all loved it and were laughing all thru the movie. Great movie.

B005H5H3LW|5.0|The quest for Iscandar is a little different than expected. I didn't expect to see Saito. I watched it the night I got it. Action packed two hours.

B001QFZADA|5.0|I learned many great things from this book. You just have to get it and read it yourself to find out how life-changing this book is. Since I read the book my love has improved dramatically. My girlfriend is much more happier with me, and I feel more confident speaking love to her.<br /><br />The only critique I have is how come I did not find out about this book sooner?<br /><br />I recommend this book to you.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|Aside from all the incredibly hot men, this movie was horribly corny. Most of the acting was terrible and the plot was almost nonexistant.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a challenging and fun  game.  I do recommend this game for children and adults. Even with the advertisement it  still is a good game.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Easy to play and fun for all ages.  It has more difficult levels as you go along.  Can be addictive!

B0097NGUJG|5.0|Alt-J has an one-of-a-kind sound with a lot of space and air in their grooves and a front man with one of the most unique voices of the past decade.  The lyrics are a bit dark, and not recommended for younger audiences, but are overall poetic for the superficial messages they carry.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Like this feature. Easy to use. Easy to figure out. Use this a lot. Like to check my email and this makes it easy to do.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|perfect. fast and quick, was exactly what i ordered . Amazon Basics is a great brand i now own two cases and very happy
1594744769|4.0|It's more of a Michael Vey type story than a suspense / thriller, so don't get the wrong impression.  Crazy pictures, interesting story, not the best writing.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|exactly what i ordered, i like amazon basics they are notto bulky and i havent broke my screen yet... knock on wood
B008XG1X18|4.0|awesome resource. fun waste of time. the ways I use it grow and change with me. more categories please. or take existing categories and make sub-categories
B004IF8TLU|5.0|was awesome to watch with my kids now as an adult. my little ones loved it. rent it and enjoy!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|OK this is a free App why is it so hard to get?  It wouldn't download and kept telling me to go to the Amazon library for it  which I couldn't find.  I'm a bit of an Android Ice cream sandwich newbie but not an Amazon newbie and still couldn't find the library.  I gave up and got it on Google Play. It installed fine, works and is fun.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because of not being able to download it here.  I saw on another website that Amazon wants your credit card number even for free items. Is this true? If so Amazon should tell you that before you make yourself crazy thinking you are an idiot  or that your new Christmas gift tablet is broken : (
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Got this cover for my 7 yr girls fire... It's great!! Not big or heavy!! Stands up the kindle great by its self

1604590483|3.0|I have to say I was not impressed by this book at all. I expected more from the advertising. I wouldn't recommend it.
B007MDB548|3.0|I must note that the story has a more grown up feel compared to the previous  ones (especially the very first). A friend responded that it is appropriate, given the children who viewed the first tinker bell movie should now be in their &#34;tweens&#34; or even teens. Graphics are incredible and colors are vibrant as expected from the tinkerbell series. (No backstage featurettes though)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My granddaughter reccommended this, I got it, sat down to play a quick game just to try it out, then one hour later I finally stopped... very addicting!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I experienced this film having read the book and heard the music, but not having seen the stage show. That being said, I had no idea what to expect from Tom Hooper's adaptation of the sprawling French novel and beloved musical. The film is visually arresting and full of texture, from the muck that covers Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) as he emerges from the sewers to the individual pieces of smashed furniture that comprise the barricade. As for the singing, it is just as emotionally textured and realistically gritty. By utilizing both the medium of the close-up and live singing, Hooper allows his cast to imbue every song with an emotional realism that you will never see in a stage production; while this technique was not successful with every actors' performance, it found its high points in Anne Hathaway's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and Eddie Redmayne's anguished \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\".<br /><br />At around two and a half hours, the film is long but moves at a brisk pace, which was aided by several cuts made throughout. While most of these cuts were small and fairly insignificant, they tended to give the film a feeling of being slightly rushed, particularly in the second half. Without the back story included in the book, the romance between Marius (Redmayne) and Cosette (Amande Seyfried) seemed both sudden and paltry, while the segment cut from \\"Javert's Soliloquy\\" lessened the impact of one of the most dramatic scenes in the story.<br /><br />Casting is, for the most part, spot on, with Jackman providing a solid backbone for a story arc that encompasses three decades. Hathaway is generating a great deal of (much-deserved) Oscar buzz, Redmayne rises above expectations, and Russell Crowe is earnest and compelling despite his lack of vocal power. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, despite their talents, were appropriately nasty but not particularly funny; the only laugh I heard from the audience was at M. Thenardier's mistaking Cosette's name the first time. The second time around it wasn't nearly as funny.<br /><br />Though critics have generated a great deal of talk about the lack of subtlety, the relentless close-ups, the ugly settings, and the rushed pacing, Les Miserables rises above its flaws because of the impact that the story continues to have on audience members. In the theater I attended, people wept and I was approached afterward by a complete stranger who wanted to know if I liked it as much as she did. Les Miserables stands apart from musicals like \\"Cats\\", \\"Evita\\", and \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" because after the grand sweep of revolutionary anthems and spectacular company numbers is over, the story can be summarized as one man's search for redemption, which is something that humans apparently never tire of. We all know, deep inside of us, that we need redemption as much as Jean Valjean; in the intimacy of one man's struggle, we empathize because we see ourselves.irst time.

B009FB3XTA|5.0|I remember every scene when the song plays, how much better can that be when waiting for the movie to come out on DVD
B00005JPMZ|5.0|This movie was done well... it was more torward the comics than cartoonish... they didnt ruin it by making it too childish but its still good for kids to be able to watch
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Lot's of unexpected turns. A love thriller through and through. Couldn't put the book down until it was all finished.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I'm only writing this review because of the promise of no ads for five days. It's a good enough spider game but nothing special or exciting. Sort of Hohum.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|It is your typical Taylor Swift album. Nothing more, nothing less. And at $1.99 it was a great buy. I know some people complain about her music but it is definitely uniquely her.
159448385X|5.0|It was already said a lot good things about this book. Just want to add, this book is very moving, touching bottom of your soul and heart. I experienced all kind of emotions reading this book: sorrow, anger, happiness, helplessness, etc. On top of it, it gives good perspective what kind of things are going on in Afghanistan. Lastly, being a woman, at the end I felt so lucky living in USA and have my rights as a citizen, person, and as a woman. Makes you appreciate a lot of things that we take for granted, like books and education. Highly recommend for all people, this book won't leave you indifferent.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I bought this simply because I liked their single and Amazon offered it for $1.99. I can say it was definitely worth the $1.99 and I would not have been disappointed if I had paid full price.
B008458O3S|5.0|Tho game is really fun.  It gets pretty challenging as you move up.  My 5 year old could do it in the beginning. Tons of levels.
B001IFZL50|5.0|I absolutely loved every minute of this show. Great actors and great story. Does not disappoint. Shipped fast and was exactly what I expected.
B001QOGYFO|5.0|This movie was made to entertain. It had a logical, believable story and plot. It was enjoyable to watch. It had no blaring background music. It gave the viewer a special treat: Kate B. taking a shower.
B0037AGASG|5.0|My 13 year old daughter loved all of the Justin gifts including this one.  She has played it many times.
B000E5KUK6|4.0|This movie is good. The scene with Madison Square Garden is great though. Not one of the best, but worth seeing.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|My 13 year old daughter LOVED it and after playing it in my car for her so many times, I (Dad) realized I too enjoyed it even when she was not present.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read in my entire life. It's....fantabulisticly amazing. I know it's not a word but who cares?!?! Praise to Rick Riordan!!!!!!!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Great album. Includes her new hit Diamonds. Buy it and enjoy quality music from a lovely (read hot) woman. Enjoy.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This one was great to watch with the kid. The action is lively, the plot is fun, and the main characters are likable. But it's not the kind of film where you're going to expect anything all that original (other than the humor), or an ending you don't see coming a mile away.<br /><br />It's a really simple plot. During a routine Christmas run Santa forgets to deliver a bike. Cue the chaos as Santa's inept son steals an old sleigh to travel across the world to deliver it before the sun rises.<br /><br />It is what it is. I liked the corporate take on the whole Santa Clause mythology, and I liked how they put together the family dynamic. I was left wondering the hows and whys about the elves, but maybe some things are better left unexplained.<br /><br />Over all though, I felt like it was one of the best family oriented action flicks I've seen in a long time. Will watch it again with the kid next year.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app amazing ideas!!! my fav thing is hairstyles &amp; antique home ideas! great ideas for kids rooms and crafty ideas
1603427244|5.0|more cast on and bind off stitches to make a more interesting finish to my knitting projects. i recommend the book to serious knittes.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|It was a nice kid movie that adults can enjoy too. A little different to your typical princess tale. Especially good movie for young girls.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|One of my top favorite movies. It will keep you laughing.<br /><br />The package was all broken with I received it but I didn't try returining it because the disc was still intact.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read!!! I loved everything about it! I feel like this described a hopeful love that everyone discouraged.
075669812X|5.0|Great summary of all 2011 and 2012 sets for collectors or Lego Ninjago enthusiasts.  Fantastic pictures and descriptors.  The figure is also a nice collectors item.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing writing...I love a not so happy ending and am looking forward to reading the last boo in the trilogy.
1609611543|5.0|I was almost 300lbs and borderline diabetic, had high cholesterol, hypertension and had no energy.  I read this book, cut out the wheat and it has changed my life.  I used to come from work and TRY to play with my two and three year olds and just didn't have the energy.  I immediately noticed that my bloating in the face and abdomen went down, almost immediately , within a couple of days.  I started to have more energy and began to exercise regularly. It is 8 months later and I've dropped 54lbs, I'm 246lbs now!  I highly recommend this book and have bought it for many friends and family who are struggling with the same issues I was when I ate wheat!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|This is great pacifier for little ones who are still building their strength. The animal helps keep the pacifier in their mouth while giving them something to grab.
0307477479|4.0|This book is a really good read. Its a bit shorter so it is a good quicker read. Overall, it is highly deserving of the awards it has received.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I don't even know what to say except that this book has helped me through bad times, and helped me enjoy the good. This isn't something you read, it's something you live and hear and smell and taste and feel. It's timeless. It's infinite.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The Les Miserables soundtrack is excellent, but while the orchestra is incredible some of the stars falter where the original actors shined. To give direct comparison I feel that Russell Crowe was not as vocally skilled as the original inspector Javert, nor is Marius, but where those two faltered I felt that Sacha Baron Cohen, Anne Hathaway, and Amanda Seyfried were actually better. To me Hugh Jackman's Jean Valjean was comparable with the original actor. All in all great soundtrack. Check out \\"I dreamed a Dream\\" it is exceptional, on the same note listen to the original recording of \\"One Day More\\" and you will understand what I mean. Check it out.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I was hesitant at first to try this game because I didn't want it to be bad. When i tried I thought I was insane for no trying it the first time.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|This toy looks a lot like the real thing and Bruder makes it very durable.<br />I was not happy about the size of the box it was shipped in but other than that I have no issues, and I understand that Amazon was just protecting my purchase.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Really makes you think about who you are and why you are that person.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|the game is good but it is really slow. but for a free game I'd say it is prity good.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the way the story was told with alternating perspectives with unexpected twists and an uncertainty for the reader who to trust for about half of the book.  The ending was disappointing and left more to be had but the story was fantastic.  Interesting first hand narration of someone with anti social personality disorder
0425263908|4.0|I don't know why people feel the need to compare this book to 50 shades of Grey. They are two really good book in an almost close but different category. Christian is definitely no Gideon and Ana would flush at the things that came out of Eva's mouth. It's a good read if your looking for an out of sorts kinda romance with alot of not even that really hot but still mind blowing sex. Christian has positions for days while Gideon will make you come for days!<br /><br />I say, read it and make your own judgement :)
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Heath Ledger was awesome in this movie. He played The Joker like no one else could. This movie is Freakin Awesome.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was very detailed and is probably one of the greatest books I have read. It was so good I finished it under five days.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Let me make this straight right away: refined, complex literature this is not. Those without a nerd bone in their body will find reading long stretches of the work as interesting as watching paint dry. And members of Saint Anne Crocheting Society will hurl it across the room, horrified at its language.<br /><br />OK, that out of the way, let me say that enjoyed reading it very much. Were I not despising the phrase \\"I couldn't put it down\\" so much, I would have used it.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />The theme will bring inevitable associations to [[ASIN:B004UJ7VJU Robinson Crusoe]], but I find comparison to [[ASIN:B000JMLBHU The Mysterious Island]] more appropriate. This chronicle of unlikely survival celebrates human ingenuity, knowledge, perseverance and courage, but also loyalty, altruism and solidarity. The triumph is as much the result of hero's immense resourcefulness as of well executed efforts of many others, from the initial perfectly performed landing leaving plenty of fuel later turning out essential for survival to... Well, let's not spoil the story.<br /><br />Mr. Weir's characters are not particularly deep, but they are consistent and convincing. He will even shore up, perhaps unnecessarily, the believability of the hero's cheerfulness in the face of constant mortal danger and not much hope with an explanation from the mission shrink that this kind of reaction to stress was one of factors that helped securing him a place in the expedition crew. There is no much inter-character conflict (or, for that matter, any strong interaction), but where there is, it is executed well (reaction of rest of the crew to apparent death of a member and subsequent turns in events, strategy clashes within NASA).<br /><br />Weir knows his physics and chemistry, and gives his reader an opportunity to bask in his own knowledge: I was able to spot perhaps half of hero's mistakes the moment he made them, giving the perfect blend of \\"ha, I would do that better\\" moments and satisfying, unexpected plot twists. Where the author needed a deus ex machina (and works like this need plenty of those), he disguised it cleverly - the only big technical impossibility in the story I could find* will look perfectly plausible to those with less science background. Also, blind luck plays much lesser role than it often does in adventures of this kind (and dice roll both ways).<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />First and foremost, proofreading: the work could use two more passes of that. Confused homophones so prevalent in amateur efforts are, to Mr. Weir's credit, almost completely absent here, and spelling checker has done its duty, but missing words (dis)appear often enough to occasionally annoy.<br /><br />Eagle-eyed editor would perhaps spot that rover hull is in one spot made of metal, and others carbon composite, and would account more diligently for every expenditure of spare habitat canvas; she would perhaps even notice that water in improvised RTG heat exchanger would soon evaporate in setup as described. But these are very minor complaints.<br /><br />The main area where a good editor could contribute is evening out style and tone of the work. The whole first third or so of the work is hero's log. The style changes very abruptly when NASA is introduced. That could have been ameliorated by, say, moving the scene of mission abort from crew point of view a bit earlier and similar \\"mix and match\\" interventions - nothing would be lost in terms of dramaturgy. Also. one or two little pieces of background \\"tributaries\\" a'la Clancy that appear suddenly (e.g. on production of habitat canvas) feel out of place - not that they are not useful, but need to stick out less prominently.<br /><br />Finally, there is not a single really bad (selfish, stupid, anything) guy or gal anywhere to be seen. It is nice to have so rosy outlook on our species, I like to pretend to share it now and then, and the focus of the story is elsewhere, but come on!<br /><br />THE UGLY<br/><br />The sad, actually.<br /><br />NASA from this novel is the organization that put humans on Moon in less than a decade, where a binder cover and spacesuit sleeve made CO2 scrubber body, and where \\"the failure is not an option\\" ([[ASIN:0618619585 Apollo 13]]), the organization that does not exist any more. It was replaced by one that refused Columbia in-orbit photos by NRO satellites out of fear what they would see. The only little trace of the later in this novel is the administrator.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|Loved this quick, easy read held my interest, I couldn't put it down read in 2 days. Would recommend to anyone, looking forward to movie coming soon. Appreciated that silver lining ending happy happy.
B000FC10WU|4.0|I read a couple of other reviews that described this story as boring. I could not disagree more. Really enjoyed Agatha Christie's descriptions of the characters and how they interacted with each other. Very fun to read, especially the chapters that included Mrs. Bantry. The ending surprised me, but it was explained very well and wasn't just thrown in to wrap up the story. This is the first Miss Marple mystery I have read, and I will definitely read more of them.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The free version only takes you a short way into the adventure and then asks you to unlock the full game. It is easily worth the 2 or 3 dollars. Interesting story and fun game play. Good game.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Terrific animation, grafics, story, action. One of the best games I've ever played. Worth every penny! Now wonder it has such a top rating.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I loved this movie. I've watched it many times, and I'm rooting for it to win Oscars. The established stars are great, especially Bruce Willis and Edward Norton, but the movie belongs to the two young actors, Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward. I've written about it three times (so far) on my blog:[...]
B008K4JDLA|5.0|&#34;3D printers will be bigger invention than internet&#34;. This tweet from Chris Anderson tells exactly why you should read this book and understand what's happening and why it's important.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I am a big Van Morrison fan and have been a little disappointed with the last couple of albums of new music. I bought this with some trepidation and was very pleasantly surprised. The album starts off strong and finishes very strong. Terrific new original songs that really make you think. Just like a Van Morrison album should do.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|Fresh and up-to-date story straight from the man himself about a truly remarkable story: Poor kid from Austria starts lifting some weights, wins Mr Olympia 7 times, becomes very successful action movie star, marries a Kennedy, becomes Governor of California and saves the state from going bankrupt. But that's not all, of course. Drops school, but get a college degree in business. Buys some property and is now said to be worth hundreds of millions.<br /><br />Great read and sums up nicely all three sides of Arnold.
B007VTVGAQ|2.0|Huge fan of Fiona Apple but this album is not my favorite.  Gave it several listens and the lyrics are heartbreakingly good, she is still the best lyricist since Roger Waters but the delivery was more performance art and less musical than her previous albums.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Best show on network TV in 2012! Oliver Queen is a strong yet damaged protagonist whose personal transformation has propelled him into the role of crime fighting hero. The secondary characters are well developed and interesting in their own right from Oliver's teenage sister to his ex girlfriend's cop dad. I'm not sure how the creators have done it, but they've managed to mix the perfect blend of fantasy with gritty reality. Stephen Amell is perfectly cast as spoiled rich boy-turned guardian angel. I love dual identity stories--I love this show!
B007H9B8FS|4.0|Sounds and moves like a dream you want to keep having, really good music and vocals and the flow of the album makes sense song to song.  Repeat listen worthy (been in the car for several months) and does not get old.
B00821OUT6|5.0|I love this show! At first the intrigue is with the sci fi mystery, then you start to love the characters. Can't wait for season 3!
B0013LKFVO|2.0|I tried one of these Nite Ize LED upgrade bulbs to upgrade an old military issue Fulton angle head flashlight and was disappointed in the output. It was not even as bright as the Xenon bulb I had in the light to start with. Then I discovered another offering from Nite Ize and tried it:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0017UVDYO Nite Ize LRB-07-PR1W 1-Watt LED Bulb Upgrade/Replacement for Most C/D-Battery Flashlights]]<br /><br />The 1 watt Nite Ize LED bulb upgrade is EXCELLENT! Very bright, white light. I've become something of a collector of old Fulton flashlights and all of them now have the 1-watt LED offering from Nite Ize.<br /><br />Here's another cool product that I've been using in some of my flashlight \\"upgrades\\":<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006G70LRI Bluecell 5 Piece of  AA to D Clear Color Battery Holder Converter Adaptor Case]]<br /><br />With this you can use single AA batteries in place of the heavy D cells. (Of course, you are trading battery life for weight.)<br /><br />Hope this helps...
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci at his best. The plot always takes you places that you don't expect. A wonderful read but don't give away the end.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|I have never played the game (other than the demo of the very first PC version), and I wasn't really expecting much from this movie. But I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. The first two-thirds of the movie some may find boring (as did I). I felt they spent too much time trying to provide the back story for those not familiar with the game's back story (such that it is). It's like a game that forces you to go through a training section to learn how to move and use the weapons when all you want to do is get started blowing away bad guys. Actual combat doesn't start until more than two-thirds through the movie and then it gets a little confusing in the early minutes, but then that's typical of real combat much of the time.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I am a Trekie! I had these films on VHS tape and finely decided to clear out my few final VHS tapes. These movies needed to updated to DVD. The updated resolution and sound quality was just what i was looking for.vSo far I have watched five of the six movies and am totally satisified with my purchase.
1451695195|5.0|I just finished reading Proof of Heaven and am beyond excited about it's message! It only confirms everything that I have learned from the writings of Emmanual Swedenborg, 18th century scientist and theologian. Having experienced many losses in my life: friends, parents, a child and a sibling and usually with some sort of communication in some way from them as they transitioned from this life to their eternal home( particularly our son) this book helps to confirm what I have long believed in.<br /><br />There is a God.  There is a heaven, there is evil (hell). Our natural bodies hold our soul, and nothing can destroy that. Life is about Love, hence since love cannot be forced, God must leave us in freedom to love him in return. Our life here is but a speck of sand in the eternal picture - yet we are so caught in the realm of earthly time, that we sometimes fail to make the time to pray/meditate and make room for HIM.<br /><br />I am grateful to Eben Alexander for sharing his NDE with the world.  Just maybe it will help more people see the bigger picture of life, and down the road maybe fewer tragedies such as what happened in Newtown, Connecticut.<br /><br />Review by Janna Zuber. I can be reached at jannazuber@verizon.net
B006AZZPCM|5.0|The tubemate downloaded is a great app that is compatible with almost any device.I have the kindle fire and it works perfect!
B003IN7YPU|5.0|I was concerned because some reviewers mentioned the problem with the picture being cut off at the top and bottom to fit this format.  My husband had just about worn out our VHS copy of The World at War and is very familiar with the pictures in that older format.  However, we have both watched this restored Blu-Ray version and are very, very pleased.  It looks like an act of love to restore this with as much detail and fidelity as possible.  The improvement over the old VHS version is dramatic.  The problems of the format changed mentioned in some other reviews are really not distracting.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I purchased this anthology because I had never read the complete Sherlock Holmes, all in one volume, and I couldn't pass on the deal.  The series is very complete - it took me over a month to read all the stories, reading one per day.  I should note that most of the stories are in the form of \\"shorts,\\" but a few are novellas which stand on their own.  I knew most of the stories from the excellent BBC series with Jeremy Brett produced by Granada Television, but some of them were completely new to me.  To be completely frank, since these stories were written in the 19th century, and Conan Doyle was very much aware of current events and \\"recent history\\" from his point of view, some of the stories could not have been filmed without offending someone.  One of the stories has the \\"Mountain Meadow Massacre\\" as a part of the back-story, while another deals with a murderous sect of Freemasons.  Since the anthology is very complete, some of the tales are \\"derivative,\\" in the sense that a few short stories are obviously early drafts of more familiar works.  None of these issues takes anything away from the Sherlock Holmes \\"legend,\\" and it was a joy to read them in their original published form.  I only include this information in the interests of completeness.  As to the tales being complete, there is one story of a case which Holmes solved after his retirement, and another which has him coming out of retirement on the eve of World War I.  :)<br /><br />The volume also contains some stories Doyle wrote which fall under \\"suspense\\" and \\"terror.\\"  These are mostly tame by modern standards - sad to say - and some of them fall more into science fiction than suspense.  (There is one tale of creatures living in the upper atmosphere attacking unwary airmen!)  These show Conan Doyle was capable of writing more than \\"detective fiction,\\" and some of them are quite good on their own.<br /><br />All in all, well worth the purchase and the late nights reading for any fan of Sherlock Holmes.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I love this book, I'm a personal trainer and this guy ha a lot of great points and ideas. It's easy to follow and WILL get you strength through his progressions and variations.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome but it is irritating when you need to jump 2 seconds after turning but its awesome and fun but it should have a better name like temple dash also they should make a dragon ball z game version like this or even a skylanders game like this but over all its really really really really really really really cool really really cool it is beast and they should make a pokemon game like this yeah buddy I love pokemon especially mew and mewtwo
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Even more suspensful than the first~ I can't wait to get into book three! Thank you E L James! Great Read.
B0042816YK|5.0|EAT PRAY LOVE  is my favorite book.  I liked it so much, I bought copies for everyone I care about.  When the movie came out, I didn't go see it.  Movies are never as good as the book.<br /><br />Several weeks ago, a friend let me borrow her copy of the movie.  I liked it so much I had to buy my own.  True - it's a very abbreviated version of the book and some things have been changed but I still enjoy it.  The scenery alone is worth the price.<br /><br />It's a sweet representation of the book.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is AWESOME I tried text + it was ok but none of my friends had the app so I couldn't text anyone but with this app like all my friends have them it's great !!!!!!!! Thank you people who made this app happen and make it great!!!!!!!!!
B0090X4GLW|4.0|Ordered right after we saw movie! Wish it was Longer!! Wish they had bonus tracks and lengthened songs. This is awesome.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I got this as a Christmas present as my son loves super hero movies. He loved it, Than you very much!
B00AH8VU0Y|5.0|Absolutely love the Walking Dead series, watched season 1 and 2 on Netflix, bought the first 8 of season 3 for my Kindle, does anyone know when the rest of season three will be available to watch?  Can hardly wait.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christmas present - he Loved it! The smile on his face was priceless!!! Will order again. Than you very much for prompt service!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Scandal, intrigue, and romance- this show has it all.  I can't wait for the U.S. premiere of series 3.  Free Bates!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great book! I loved this book(: This book is very romantic and shows how people can love each other no matter how weird their meeting was!
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I've got to admit my husband and I just rented this bc there wasn't anything else on and we were bored.  We weren't expecting it to be funny but it was.  And surprisingly my husband enjoyed it more than I did, and he hates when they sing in movies.
0062082353|5.0|Great book, I would not hesitate recommending it to any true American. Once you start and really get into it you will not be<br />able to put it down.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|I liked the characters and the acting but the story felt very much like a season of &#34;24&#34;.<br /><br />Don't think I'll be tuning in for Season 2.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Cliffhanger!! I absolutely cannot wait for the last installment, I'll be getting it today and most likely finishing it tonight!
B0053O89WY|5.0|Hilarious!! This show never fails to deliver the laughs. I love that they've brought more ladies into the mix of geekdom. Nerds forever!!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|The game is really great over all but if you don't have enough jewles to speed up breeding processes its along wait. but the game is fun and exciting; your raising dragons for crying out loud!!!!
B005HSL626|1.0|I didn't figure this out so removed it from kindle, but might try it again if I can get some instructions from someone.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|This movie is pretty cool.. there are a lot of action scenes.  The plot is interesting.  This movie was enjoyable.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We absolutely love this game.  I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys games of strategy.  Easy to learn, difficult to master. My 9 year old daughter loves to play, as well as her grandpa.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|I know this sounds crazy, but after installing this game my wall chargers (5 different) stopped working. USB to PC and car charger still worked. Strange as I never have seen this before. I uninstalled the game and it cleared up this issue. I won't rate the game, but wanted other users to be aware of a possible problem. This is a known problem with some apps somehow changing usb voltage windows on smartphones.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts off easy but pay attention as you approach the 9x9  you will be challenged and the game will pull you in.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love the at a glance battery level. has been working fine on my Kindle Fire! would recommend this for your KF too!
B000FC130E|5.0|This was a book club read and so I was forced to read and I am not a fiction fan for reading. I am more the movie and CGI person. Don't get me wrong I love to read but I didn't think I would enjoy this book. So very wrong and glad to say it!  This was a story I got lost in very quickly as did our whole group.  We kept tabs on who was getting to which page first and we were on and chatting about our favorite spots in the book. The characters are very engaging and the marquee is one of the best artful scoundrels i have read about!  I hope that this gets to movie very soon and it has the right director to create the market  and hunter scenes! Thanks for a great tale. Please write a sequel!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What an easy read that makes the readers put their thinking caps on trying to figure out the whole Mr. Grey....inside and out.  What he was thinking and if he truly changed.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|Love this app for my 2 yr old and 7 yr old.  Lots of fun and it keeps them engaged. for hours.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read!!!! A must read!!!! Its a beautiful story...it captivated me all along...really one of my now favorite!!!
B00330UFQS|5.0|I love all the songs on this album, and have it on my computer, MP3 player, just loaded it to my Kindle Fire, and will I am sure also add it to my Ipad once I get that set up and running.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|At times I hardships book, I still have mixed feelings. But this was definitely the appropriate end to the series
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|unless you're desperate to see the stars in this movie in which case you should hit the mute button.  WOW, incredibly stupid movie.
B00555X8OA|3.0|This was a pretty good book with some interesting research - however, it was somewhat repetitive and often dry and clinical at times.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|its fun but i dont want to spend money every time i run out of energy. otherwise it would get a five star rating.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I purchased it as a gift for my Grandson to give to his Momma for Christmas.  She requested it, and she loves it!
B00004YRQA|5.0|Item arrived in brand new condition as described and works great. I've installed at least 3 games on the card with no troubles and use it fairly regularly. I find that it has plenty of memory for my limited play station use. Definitely recommended.
1419705849|5.0|Yes, we are Wimpy Kid collectors.  We have all of the books and two movies now.  He was tickled to get this for Christmas.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Couldn't stop watching this one of the best shows on TV. Seasons keep getting better and better. The writing is amazing.
B0086700CM|5.0|My sister told me about this app, so I had to try it out. I'm certainly glad I did! Hours of fun and entertainment. A great cure to boredom! :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow..... That's my impression of this book. Loved it. I laughed, I cried (a lot), I related, I sympathized, I hated, I loved. I went through a fabulous emotional roller coaster. I was shocked on more than one chapter. I can usually guess what's going to happen but not this time. If you are looking for your next book to read- you have just found it!
B000641D2Y|5.0|I chose this rating becuz the movie was entertaining, funny, and touching. One of my personal favs. Can't help falling in love with the endearing characters, and the touching storyline. Definitely entertaining for the whole family.  :)
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|There are a lot of options for the type of note,the format of the note, but what I really want is a simple list that I can quickly add items to and be able to mark them as complete. I find it cumbersome to always be working with a text box.I want a lined piece of paper that I can make an entry on each line - simple.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Any one of Connelly's books will make you a fan. If police procedural murder  mysteries are to your taste, this author consistently  delivers in condensed form with excellent dialogue. Sometimes, the plot turns seem to convenient for the hero but for a quick dose of mystery, a little suspense and world weary street humor  Mr.Connelly is hard to beat.  If you like Sandford or Rankin,you'll enjoy Connelly.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book is a an all time classic! I would recommend this book to every book lover. It is a must have in you book collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book on so many levels...for the heartbreak, the courage the happiness, and the live.  I've never read a book that has elicited so many emotions. I could not put this book down until I knew that each character would be okay. I felt like I was living the story right next to them.<br />I love every book I have read by Colleen Hoover but this one by far is my favorite!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|GREAT game!!!! One of the most addicting games out there! Graphics are GREAT, game play is GREAT , best game for free!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie before I read the book. So very glad I read the book anyways. Explains so much more when it's read in first-person. Can't wait to start the next.
B007N8RULO|4.0|great game helps me get through my journey to and from work. I'd definitely recommend it. thumbs up old school memories
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great fun. Awesome. Great for wasting time or if waiting in doctors office or on the mechanic. family friendly lots of fun
B0076DELIG|4.0|I like Harry Bosch so I really liked this book which was true to the character and kept the action moving without getting bogged down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is keeps your mind active. If I play it late I do miss obvious moves. I won't turn it off till I win.
0425263916|5.0|Once again you will be on the edge of your seat while tring to figure out what is going on with these two.<br /><br />I truely enjoyed this book and can't wait for the third installment.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|Love it! Have already listened to it multiple times since Christmas. GET IT for your Rihanna collection!  I DO hate the types of cases she uses for her CDs since &#34;Loud.&#34;  THAT annoys me, but the CD was/is great fun.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Slow at first but picks up towards the end. It was a good read and I would definitely suggest it. It is an adventure!
B002HNA95E|5.0|I am a HUGE Madonna fan--so I was/am thrilled to have the digitally remastered versions of these greatest hits.  Also like the new tracks.  Bought this now instead of MDNA.  THAT is how much I wanted the remastered singles.  Well worth the $! The sound quality does NOT disappoint.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I loved this movie and am very thankful that I saw it in the theater (not usual for me). This is a great prohibition era, family loyalty/brotherhood, love story. I can't wait to get this on DVD. It will be one of the few movies that I watch more than once. It may not be a movie for everyone. If you're more into the fufu movies or mind candy this is not the movie for you. It's a very intense, intellectual movie, that needs someone to understand subtlety and a bit of history.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This CD does NOT disappoint!  If you like Kelly's hits, you are in for a treat here.  They are ALL here.  This collection saved me a lot of money--buy this, and you've got Kelly covered--UNLESS you are the Kelly fan who wants it ALL.  I also like the way she handles avoiding grandiosity...&#34;Chapter 1.&#34;  No arrogance here.  Very pleased.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Merton is one of the best writers of this genre. And this book I consider one of her best. The way she is able to juggle so many characters and keep it coherent is amazing. The characters are clearly defined and the ending is a real winner.
B009P5S11G|3.0|If you are the type of Rihanna fan who wants EVERYTHING she's done, get it.  Otherwise, I'd take a pass.  I have ALL of R's CDs, and this one is the WORST.  &#34;Diamonds&#34; is the only real &#34;hit&#34; on this CD, and there are 3 versions of the same song on the &#34;Deluxe Edition.&#34;  If you want to get the CD, get the regular version.  If you want eye-candy, there is a lot of that in the album inserts.  Apart from that, if I had it to do over again, I would take a pass.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|It is fast paced,and cohesive, with great special effects. Acting believable and story line interesting and presently plausible given rapid developments in  biomedical and neuro-science.
B005I64U5C|5.0|WAY too much fun to pass up.  I would caution &#34;serious&#34; Green Lantern comic readers.  As is ALWAYS the case with screen adaptations, the writers, directors, producers, etc. took license with the story.  I have heard many folks bemoan that we don't see enough of &#34;The Wall&#34; played by Angela Bassett. She doesn't get the screen time she ought, but MAYBE another movie?  Ryan Reynolds does a really good job of being more than the &#34;funny man.&#34;  You get to see him be a BIT serious, and his acting moxy surprised me.  I will admit being an RR fan.  He just cracks me up!  Anyway, I love the escapism this movie offers, and the Blu Ray is FAR superior to the DVD platform.  GET the BluRay!  Will admit that I don't yet have a 3D TV, so I haven't yet seen that version of the movie.  SUMMARY: Fun time!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is an App that my step-son told me to put on my new Kindle fire.  Once I started using it, I fell in love with it!  It really helps many of us keep abreast of world events.  It covers everything from world news, to latest technology and entertainment news.<br />I would highly recommend it!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Christina did NOT disappoint with &#34;Lotus.&#34;  For the avid fan, which I confess I AM, this CD was a real treat!  I have missed her unique talent in the music scene.  I would point out, however, that although the deluxe edition includes Explicit BONUS tracks, the &#34;regular&#34; track set was EDITED.  I HATE censored music.  That was my only displeasure with this latest effort. Way to go C!
B008XDSUNU|5.0|Dreamy pop music at it's best, my whole family have been enjoying the Nocturne album, and I am about to buy Gemini.  I just found this group off of Pandora, and I haven't been the same since.  A must have if you love an album you can listen to in its entirety!  Keep up the good music guys!!!
B009DJB9HC|4.0|They truely did it this time. This is an attempt to get as close to the sun as possible.....If the sun was Led Zeppelin. Too much individuality in the band to rip off Zeppelin, but just in the feeling of the music, the accessibility, the possibility of every song being able to be played on any classic rock radio station or Beyond. A hit.....A hit? Well, yes...if the goal for a band is to get it's stuff out there and make it's listeners request it on the airwaves of radio or satelite, then yes, this record is a hit.<br />  I love the first two BCC records. Love them! But &#34;Afterglow&#34;....I need! Can't go wrong if you love the other two. I feel it is better song-smithing and arranging than the first two. Vocals are still soaring, Guitar still makes me look like I'm torturing my enemies and loving it, the drums are pounding and the keys.....as always....need to be louder...not over powering to become Journey-esque, but louder to become more John Lord-ish. Take Care, Everyone!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has a good story and good graphics, I can really enjoyed it! Wish there was s more free levels.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|.....it is still a phenomenal album! Not quite a Steely Dan album (anything with Donald Fagen's vocals is gonna bleed &#34;Dan&#34;) but I enjoyed this album more times than any of the last two SD studio albums. I am about to surpass the replay record of &#34;Kamakiriad&#34; and I've played that disc repeatedly since &#34;93. The production...mmmm....The sounds....whe[...] classic Donald Fagen imagery....man oh man. I hope he rapes the Grammy's with this record. It is definitely worthy of doing so.<br />  I always get a kick from the chosen musicians on Donald Fagen's records and Steely Dan's for that matter. On Sunken Condos, it's bulk is performed by Earl Cooke, Jr. on drums, Harlan Post on Bass and Jon Herington on gtr, although there are some other drivers strewn across the disc, including horns and some other great musicians sprinkled throughout.<br />  Wow! This is such a great disc. My favorite song(s) is/are changing all the time. An entire album of good stuff on par or above &#34;Kamakiriad&#34; and &#34;Morph&#34; for sure. Buy it, Enjoy it, Become it....Become it? Yes....Become it. Some of these songs have changed the noises in my head. I find myself humming songs from this record in my sleep. I walk down a hall with selections from this disc as my internal theme music.<br />  The only reason I do not give this 5 stars is.......it's not 5 years down the road yet. Maybe in half a decade or more, when I break it out again and give it a listen to, after taking a hiatus from it for some time...Then I might say...Wow! Still Awesome! Change that &#34;Slinky Thing&#34; to 5 stars!

B005HSL626|4.0|A nice non-violent game for practicing marksmanship type skills without simulating violence. You're slicing up fruit.. that's it. I think we need more games like this.
B00ARAO720|2.0|Levitt and Shannon should be embarrassed to be associated with this, and I figure in time they'll admit it.  It's like a Saved by The Bell movie with better production value.<br />The story doesn't develop enough to warrant an hour and a half and the soundtrack reinforces the feeling that there's nothing new being shown.  It's so corny at times you wonder if it's supposed to be an ironic spoof with Levitt doing a cheap Franco impersonation from 127 hours and Shannon coming across like a much less interesting Ray Liotta dirty cop, any one of the many he's played.  And I'm a fan of the acting work of both Levitt and Shannon, most notably Shannon in Take Shelter, an all time great performance in a role tailor made for him.<br />If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have rented, and I refuse to justify money and time spent by pretending this is anything more than garbage.  What a waste.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Nice to have facebook on my tablet but it's not the greatest app. You can only see a few stories and pictures in your news feed so if you've been off all day you won't get caught up with all of your friends.
0316069434|5.0|Still going strong, Michael picks up where he left off in The Drop.  He kind of summarizes what went before without repeating himself and basically going over the Drop.  Starting with the Echo, Michael keeps us riveted with Harry's exploits.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like the ability to see a long range forecast.Ireally like getting severe weather alerts thatsome apps don't have.It is nice being ableto check the weather forecast for cities I have to travel to for my job.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fifty-something guy here; probably not the target demographic.  Still, as a long time Sci-Fi & Fantasy fan, thought I'd give it a try....  I thought that after watching the movie first, the book might be boring. It wasn't.  This book was easy reading, touching, entertaining and thought-provoking.  I'm especially excited that now I can read the sequels without knowing what is coming!  Gave it 5 stars because although not quite on a level with the greatest of all time, it is definitely a cut above and more memorable than the typical 4 star book.  (Plus I'm hoping that maybe the trilogy as a whole will be that good.)
B00020HEG6|5.0|I am a big fan of John Williams. When I saw this I had to order it. It fantastic for any music lover.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This film kept me entertained and enthralled on several levels. The archetypal adventure storyline that included the map and &#34;keys&#34; to unlock the location of the &#34;treasure&#34; was engaging. The &#34;adventurers&#34; were on a &#34;quest&#34; of a lifetime to save their way of life. The frailest character turned out to be the strongest. The perspective of &#34;time&#34; and whose &#34;time&#34; it was continues to ring true. The interwoven humor along with the tension of &#34;the chase&#34; of the &#34;bad guys&#34; kept me cheering for the &#34;good guys&#34; throughout the film. Good triumphed over evil, the boy won the girl's heart, and the outcasts accepted another outcast and taught us to look beyond physical appearances to the &#34;heart&#34; of a person. The cinematography was inspiring. Well done!

B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great Movie! If you're a Sci Fi fan, its definitely a must see. The beginning is a little slow and the trailer doesn't do much justice. By the time you finish the movie, you will be glad that you didn't pass this one up. Sure .. its another time travel movie but there are a lot of other original ideas that come into play. One of my favorites for 2012

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Story is exciting and suspenseful but tends to jump around a bit. I have to ask, what are the chances of successfully pulling off every contingency to get what you want in any situation, much less in this highly complex one? Just really had to strech my reality/believability factors to the max. Otherwise, very well written and enjoyable.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I adored this book! At first I was a little hesitant to pick it up, but after someone reviewed about it being a good read for twilight lovers I knew it was a must, and I'm definitely glad that I did. Although there were times that would make you a little bit exasperated and impatient it was a very adorable story about two soul mates with issues struggling to get to forever. I loved it.<br />Would I read it again? Definitely. And I recommend it to not just twilight lovers but anyone in general.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book is a look at potential warfare in the near future.  Very well researched and written. Young Jack is a chip off the old block but with new high tech wrinkles. Couldn't put it down.

B0086700CM|1.0|This works great on my Motorola Atrix but I wanted this game for my Kindle fire. Either I'm missing something, or the game isn't functioning properly. I can't tilt to collect coins or position my character when the ground breaks up so I keep dying pretty quickly. A fun game when you can actually play, so I'm frustrated.

B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought at $29 preorder and the price had dropped by about $2.50 before shipping to me.  I had not bought the 2nd movie yet so overall it was an awesome deal to purchase all 3 movies on blu ray for only about $27.  I would have spent more than that buying The Dark Knight and Dark Knight rises seperately most likely.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was just what I needed during a short flight, the book is well written with out the typos seen in a lot of e-books. Fast read with a serious story offset by good humor.
B00846REIS|5.0|Quick and easy read. Keeps you wanting more even after you finish the book I can't wait to read the next one.
B009IHED0E|5.0|I too agree with philippe deroin's review of this album.  The story is sad, but the music, with a nice Celtic touch, is phenomenal.  Hats off to the creator and producer, Rob Reed (Magenta), and all the talented musicians involved...and there are many...Steve Balsamo (The Storys), Angharad Brinn (Fy Enaid Gyda Ti), Steve Hackett (Genesis), Gavin Harrison (Porcupine Tree, King Crimson), Francis Dunnery (It Bites), Neil Taylor (Tears for Fears), Nick Beggs (Kajagoogoo, Iona),  B.J.Cole (Cochise), Mel Collins (King Crimson),  Jakko Jakszyk (Level 42), Troy Donockley (Iona), Nick Barrett (Pendragon), John Mitchell (It Bites, Arena, Frost*, Kino), Synergy Vocals, Shan Cothi, Rhys Meirion, Barry Kerr, Chris Fry (Magenta), Hywel Maggs, Christina Booth (Magenta), The London Session Orchestra arranged by Dave Stewart, and The English Chamber Choir...WOW.  This is, in my opinion, one of the finest prog albums to be released in a long time.  A must have for any prog collection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game. it's challenging, and difficult, which forces the player to think outside the box when using a strategy that will help you to win.
B008220D5K|4.0|Forget about this being a sequel, you don't have to have the entr&eacute;e of seeing \\"Knocked Up\\". If you've lived, say, 40-years or so that is a good pre-requisite and even that isn't a requirement as it mainly just exaggerates the strangeness between youth and middle-age.<br /><br />\\"This Is 40\\" looks at, seemingly, at endless slices of life where the almost perfect implodes into various chaotic downturns.  Paul Rudd as Pete and Leslie Mann as Debbie are turning 40.  They have it all, the house, the trendy businesses, three kids (you'll see), and \\"bank commercial\\" (ha!) perfect looks.  However there is trouble brewing from both inward and out.  The struggle to keep it progressing forward is stalled, in fact it is gnawing away their former foundation so dutifully laid as they are reaching maturity (this is suppose to be the best years as noted in the dialog).  Almost everything that can attack both of these two as a couple and individuals, save infidelity, is unfolding.  And that rock of fidelity is the tie that binds because as much as they fail to communicate, and as they invite any number of hostilities to tear them apart, they are, underneath, hopelessly in love.<br /><br />This movie takes a while as director Apatow keeps bringing more and more slices of crazed dishevel for Pete and Leslie to face.  It never gets too realistically dark, however, because of the wicked humor woven throughout.  The movie isn't meant to be overly real, but topically figurative instead.  It succeeds because first, and foremost, this is a comedy and the focus is sharp as to that goal.<br /><br />So, is the movie a complete success?  Of course not, but mostly yes, as director/writer Apatow, like Tarrentino, uses massive amounts of witty dialog for perfect comedic pace.  \\"This Is 40\\" pokes sharp fun at beautiful people as it exaggerates the silly immature self-centered quirks common to all human beings.  The underpinning of it all is Pete and Debbie's deep love, which everyone, beautiful or not can connect with.  A love which takes its sweet time in saving the day - as is often very true-to-life.  Add to this the beautifully bright cinematography and the sly use of some 70's influenced, yet timeless, music and it all adds up to a light hearted look at \\"sticking it out\\" through the changes of mid-life.  It ain't poignant, and it's about as deep as puddle in how every problematic turn is dealt with lighthearted absurdity, but it is quite a fun romp. See it as you've spent two hours, likely recently, without being entertained half as much.not can connect with.  A love which takes its sweet time in saving the day - as is often very true-to-life.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book so much. It was everything I heard it would be. From the moment I read the first sentence I was hooked. I recommend this book to all that have loved, lost, and  lived.

B00AHSINKO|4.0|Fun movie to remind us of how to have fun in relationship and keep the love alive.  It was funny, romantic, moving, sensuous and thought provoking.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was great but definitely not the way I thought it would end<br />And I'm just hoping for the movies to come out
B008KZVNLC|5.0|In what should on surface seem a completely silly and irrelevant story one finds an echoing reminder from our own youth of the importance - the existence - of such things as ardent enduring love, honor and duty.  and that these things can thrive in the harshest environment. Cumberbatch perhaps a bit too twitchy. But loved him and all of the cast. Worth buying and keeping.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Vocals aren't as strong, instrumental is a bit too strong. I have a strong memory of the broadway version, which is still my favorite for this show.  I was blown away by the movie, but without the acting to support the vocals, I found this lacking.

B002VQ7PVS|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book and I found just as enthralling as the first. Only the ending is disappointing....... I kept expecting more to be revealed, a few more knots to be tied in several dangling ends. AN enjoyable experience.

B001G7HKZ4|4.0|When you look at any Amy Adams movie, she starts out in left field but gradually brings it all down to reality so you understand the character. She is an understated and under appreciated actress.<br /><br />When you watch this move, you see the character development happening all over the place. It is a chaotic romp that has no logical conclusion until finally there is a very logical and satisfying conclusion.  All of the characters grow up in front of you and Amy Adams is in the middle of it all.<br /><br />Watch this movie and then watch the Academy Awards. I swear Amy Adams will receive her due credit soon. This movie will make you a fan.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|No one movie could do this work justice. The theme is timeless and worth reading every year! I highly recommend.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|It's a good set but no special packaging to make it special.  Once we have blu ray we will get a collectors edition but this will do just fine for now
0307386171|5.0|Ian McEwan proves once again that he is brilliant at conveying emotions and desires through beautiful, subtle writing.<br /><br />\\"On Chesil Beach\\" is set on the first night of the Honeymoon for the two main characters, Edward and Florence. The story is heavy flashbacks, which reveal a range of complexities that spell impending doom for the newlyweds. The book is really a gorgeously told train wreck. McEwan is such an adept writer, that he is able to pack in a ton of character information into this short novel and it never feels anything less than perfectly crafted, as he does not waste words or have extraneous information. The story is simply beautifully done.

B003E88TKS|4.0|It was nice to watch this movie. The plot is not predictable and, thankfully, the characters and writing are without cliches. As someone who has fantasized about living a life in the air traveling the world, what grounds me is knowing the relationships and human connections I would have to sacrifice to have such a life. It was nice to have this movie depict what the reality of a life \\"in the air\\" would probably be like.<br /><br />The shocker in the movie for me was the truth that came out about the character Alex. I was not expecting it, but after watching it I'm sure that what she was doing goes on quite a bit in real life. I also liked the scenes with George Clooney's character's family. Their lives came across as just the right kind of boring, but real, especially compared to the exciting, jet-setting lives Clooney's and Anne Farmiga's characters seemed to be enjoying.<br /><br />In the end, the truth of the emptiness of lives spent \\"up in the air\\" surfaced. For me, this movie was a lesson in the fact that, yes, real life with houses to take care of and family weddings to go to may not be all that exciting, but it has great value and we need it. No matter how much we can travel the world, that kind of life would be meaningless without people to love, care about, and be committed to. Clooney's character realized this in the end.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Full of emotions and thrills. Good read all the way through. Somewhat predictable, but good nonetheless.  Cannot wait for the movie.

Very cool how it's based on a story and if you are lucky enough to have the album art/book, you can follow along with Bell's lyrics. These guys know how to hit hard and fast, so be ready if you pick this up. It's worth paying the couple extra bucks and picking up the bonus tracks. In today's technology-run world, this album makes sense. Pick it up, read the lyrics, you'll see.
1423140605|4.0|I read tons of books and sometimes I like to go for a little more adventurous read. Just because I'm an adult doesn't mean I can't enjoy a book geared towards a younger group. Rick Riordan did an excellent job in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, and he did not disappoint in the Heroes of Olympus series either. The third book was fun, well paced, exciting and leaves you wanting more, which Riordan will gladly deliver in his fourth book scheduled in Fall 2013. I can't wait to keep reading!
B008HK3S4K|5.0|was perfect to carry .i got my pals to buy it and they were very please.reccommend other pals to buy
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Marvel movies tend to go back and forth between being really awesome and being total let downs. Though not a perfect movie, The Avengers was exciting and fun to watch. Great effects and worth owning on bluray.
B005EGXNLS|1.0|I'm reading Ch 3 now.  I still haven't been able to get into this book.  The minutia is very distracting and really doesn't lend anything to the storyline.  The names alone are perplexing--i haven't read anything like them in 60 years.  E for effort but no cigar.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I loved it it was a great read Ian's I hope more and more people will be able to enjoy it as much as I did
B0099G3I96|4.0|I like the handful of their songs that have been on the radio lately, but I wasn't crazy about the CD as a whole. Good, but not great.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|protects and I would recommend. not costly.The color red helps me to locate it when I have misplaced my Kindle.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this app is slow and doesn't want to load. I have a kindle fire and I already have a facebook app for mobile and that is so much better and faster and gets the job done. this app is the worst. don't get it. I took it off my kindle within 5 minutes.
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|I love Howard Shore's music, and this is no exception.  The recognizable themes from The Lord of the Rings are back, and lots of new stuff as well.  This is a wonderful Journey...as I expected it would be.
B006EYQHMG|5.0|NCIS LA is one of my favorite series.  However, sometimes it doesn't stream in HD which kind of sucks.  I have UVERSE and 16 mb speed so I think I have the bandwidth for it but maybe a lot of people are using the service which might slow it down.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This is an amazing book, it helps you see that whatever you are going through in life you can find meaning and to look how that situation can be a positive. It also lets you see how self absorbed we are.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|My wife and rented this movie via amazon it was very easy to do via out tv, we loved this movie it was very funny and entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|That book is amazing I can't wait to read the next book .Although they left me hanging, I hope the next book is as good as the first.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a family favorite.  People of all ages can play this easy-to-learn, visual-spatial game.  It's difficult to stop, once you've started playing.  I've bought several games as gifts after purchasing one for my family. I highly recommend it for awesome family fun.
0143123165|5.0|Admittedly, I purchased this collection of books not because I wanted to read the book, but because I am a huge fan of Jessica Hische (she designed the drop caps on the covers) and so I felt it really important to have them. I'm reading the books now too (they're great, glad I've got them to read as I find time) but the design is truly beautiful. The hardcover book has a gorgeous aqueous / soft matte coating, and it's almost as if the letters/ cover text are screened on top. Really beautiful. One should note that the page edges are also painted to match the color of the cover, so this book's page edges are red. The book is wonderfully typeset so it's very easy to read. I'm so pleased with my purchase. I've purchased A-F (the only ones available at present, and will undoubtedly purchase the entire collection. Not only will I have a gorgeous collection of books by one of my favorite designers, but I'll be reading classic works. There's nothing better!
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I'm a hardcore gamer and this was the first headset I had bought. I was so excited and when I first used them, the sound quality was amazing and they worked great. About a month later, it began to randomly have a static noise coming from the background whenever I talked with friends and whenever they didn't speak, it got louder and louder until I ended up having to turn down my mic until someone talked again which I would then have to turn it up again so I could hear them. I got the 2-year warrenty on this item, thank God, and ended up returning this headset. Maybe it was only bad luck that this happened, because otherwise, the headset was great and didn't feel cheap at all and it was very comfortable.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I love this movie.  My daughter who is 3 watched it for the first time and she was clued to the tv. So happy that I bought it
B0000669JL|5.0|It was the music I expected and more. The price was very reasonable but hoped to find it for my Kindle Fire
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than the movie. I can't wait to read the next book.It was an unexpected great read. I plan to read it again when I am done with the trio.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Another feel good family show that leaves you laughing uncontrollably. It begins and ends with Skrat. Probably one of the best Ice Age movies so far-although they were all excellent.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is a great movie that we have enjoyed! The DVD was in new condition, great and quick delivery service.  I recommend this DVD for children and the whole family.  Will become a Christmas time favorite!  Amazon and sender service was great.
0890090572|5.0|If you like mysteries and/or English authors, this is a must!  The price is a bargain for so many wonderful stories.
6304595247|3.0|Good movie. This movie was not as dramatic and detailed as the Wuthering Heights DVD with Timothy Dalton.  The movie and delivery service was great but the movie was ok.
B000T433CO|5.0|Love this movie... Could watch it over and over again, and now I can!!  Great feel good story that will make you laugh and cry!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book trilogy really came full circle. This book really makes you look at your reality to see if it is just yours or someone else.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Not a typical DeMille thriller.  Boring plot and a platform for one liners among characters.  The ending was the setting for his next book and a let down.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Unbelievable for the price. I  use it for my Panasonic 250 camcorder, I only fits with lens shade off.  Tight fit, but great if you are on the run.
B009SQOGZ2|4.0|Its kinda preachy at times but funny and fun for whole family. Some parts are kinda scary at first so be carefull if your kids are too young.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|What can I can.  Anything you ever wanted to know you can fine through google.  Wish I had purchase stock in this baby.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Just obtained a copy of this new album and must say that for the first time since Kelly Clarkson and Daughtry, I'm semi-impressed with a product of American Idol.  Phillip Phillips is rock solid consistent through the whole album.  While I loved \\"Home\\" earlier this summer it has been commercialized to death - nevertheless, there are other quality songs here!  I'd really compare it to Dave Matthew's 'Some Devil' album from a few years back.
B0041D843M|5.0|Thank you Dr.Campbell, you have blessed my life with your dedication and hard work in the field of nutritional science. I absolutely love you for this book. My father is on his second week of his new lifestyle. It's not a diet, it's an understanding of how we process the often horrendous food we punish our bodies with. I will spread the word to anyone willing to listen to reason. I will also put up a new review in around 12 weeks, to show our progress, and hopefully inspire another person to adopt these truths in their daily meal choices. Mr. Campbell, thanks again for your help and guidance. You are part of my family now, thats how much we love ya.<br /><br />It's been around 3-4 months now and I am in amazement. My father is down from 247 to 204. His high blood pressure has been gone for awhile now. He has no more pain from his trigeminal nuralgia. That's actually how I came across a lecture from Dr. Esselstyn on you tube. Then later Dr Campbell, Dr. McDougall, Dr. Barnard, and many others with incredibly valuable information. I was searching for help with vascular inflammation. I hypothesized the artery that runs along the trigeminal nerve could be healed and thus reduce in size and relieve pressure and pain without surgically inserting a pad.  Unlike previous methods of treating symptoms and forgetting the causation. I don't know if this is related at all, but after seven long years of pain... I feel free of the burden, the stress of knowing your dads hurting bad. It's just amazing. I am finally under 200 for the first time in five years, and I feel great. I'm healthy, my spirit is rejuvenated. My family is happier, and more together than ever. Thanks for the great information. If people just look at the science, all the answers are there. These guys deserve so much respect, and I just love being in the know. Read it and join me.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This is a fun book, but it has a surprising amount of typos in it. I like the speed at which the book moves.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel has made me cry more  tears than probably any other book. Do not be doped into believing this is any other cancer book because it certainly is not. It is full of love, wit and heart ache. This book will change your perspective on life itself. I recommend this to anyone who is an advanced reader. I love this book.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|Snooze fest in comparison to other Bourne movies. Lots of mystery that never comes up with answers. Ending was only meant to allow for yet another show
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book had a lot of twists and plots but the end is fitting.  I would recommend reading to anyone that enjoy the movie or the first book.
B000NW79WW|5.0|Took a step into the wayback machine last night, put on this album and was instantly reminded of me and my girl hanging out at the coffee shops, sketching, smoking, laughing and flirting! Remember when Bruce's music inspired you want to slow dance with your date, and a song later turn the volume way up and cruise (fill in the name of your favorite car) down Hwy. 99... well, for this Seattleite, it did. There's been a lot of years between then and now and, man, I really missed that girl. Luckily, after a 25+ year absence, I got to marry her last year and we sure had a great time putting The River on the turntable last night and smiling at each other. Maybe tonight, when the house is empty, we'll get to slow dance to \\"Drive All Night\\" without embarrassing our kids.<br /><br />As for the quality of the purchase... very clean (perhaps a conservative condition rating from the seller) and no warps or anything to be critical about. 100% satisfied with this album.
B005LAII08|5.0|GREAT, I split it up with three people,  we all enjoyed having the 5 disc.  I really enjoyed watching it and my great grand daughter can't get enough of it.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|No complaints about the movie itself but it took about an hour to download it.  It got stuck at 9% and I had to actually shut my DVR down and restart it to get the movie to download completely.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|GREAT&#60; I had one before and I gave it away so I ordered a Blueray version, it' really good, Yhank you......
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Good match game but void of specifics and difficult to determine how to improve score.<br />Would recommend to all who enjoy 3 plus matching.
0307730697|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. 'Fearless' was an amazing story of a true American Hero that embodied the meaning of persistence, loyalty, and faithfulness. This book is extremely inspirational. I would highly recommend reading!
B004F1F32A|2.0|The video quality was poor and it is not based on my internet speed. My internet is 100mps and my TV is direct wired to my apple router. Streaming video is not for me when it is on a 65&#34; TV. If I was using my I-Pad then I am sure it would be fine.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|My kids love this movie and my wife an I have caught ourselves watching it with them more than once. This edition comes with a bunch of discs, including 3D. I haven't used it yet since I don't have a 3D TV, but it cost about the same as the regular version at the time so I bought it anticipating a time when 3D is standard for TVs.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|love having the weather channel on my kindle fire! I always check it daily! I have excellent viewing and I love the simple set up!
B004DNWPY4|5.0|One of my accounting professors had us read this back in school and it is a fantastic book. It offers a great summary of data about millionaires collected over a long period of time and reinforces the importance of wealth vs the perception of wealth. It's an easy read and well worth the time and money.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|one of the best games on the kindle. great twist on TD games<br /><br />what are you waiting for? Go download it now!!
B004G6009K|5.0|This is a family favorite of ours. I bought the edition that included the 3D disc in case I end up with a 3D TV in the future.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Book 1 was awesome, book 2 almost as good but I was disappointed in book 3.  Kind of said how beautiful she was a million times and i found it to be very repetative. But, it was still good enough to finsh.  If you're a prude, don't get these books!  But I definately read them every free minute I had. I did enjoy them.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was good overall, but I felt like the ending snuck up on the author so she just wrapped it up in a hurry. I'm sure there is a technical description from a writer's perspective but I don't have it to offer.
0688014291|5.0|Book served its purpose, gave great tips on making management a better experience for someone with no previous management experience. Great learning tool, good choice to those who need somewhere to start on technique.
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin is the greatest band of all time. This album is great. Buy it and love it like so many have before you.
1595825045|5.0|The price was right.<br />The book is beautiful animation and how nice it was illustrated, written super nice<br />My daughter loved it and shes a teen.
B000002H97|5.0|I don't know how to review this other than to say that it is Metallica and can be listened to from start to finish. Great album.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This makes it alot easier to get on Facebook when hubby is on the computer.  It gets an A+++ from me.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Cute book. A very easy read. Mostly for mature, teen readers. Has a deep meaning, but is very easy to understand.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Matt Damon's performance is strong in the recreation of this historical accomplishment.  Viewers should have a new appreciation of working with wide ranges of personalities.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|nice clear case fits snugly and protects my iphone very well but does not get in the way of typing. I highly recommend this case if your are looking to show off your iphone. All buttons are easily accessible as well as head phone jack.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I'm not a fan of remakes and this is a prime example.  The movie is very well made but they would have been better suited giving it a different name rather than trying to piggyback on the original.  I imagine most will enjoy the movie, especially those who haven't seen the original Total Recall.  Myself, it was a waste of a couple of hours and $4
B001H9MYPW|4.0|In Treatment is both in turns helpful in describing the Analytic process and frustrating as one bears witness to boundary violations that have already occurred and have repercussions for the present . The acting is excellent and authentic throughout
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Touching. Intelligent. Beautiful. John Green Green has written not a \\"cancer story\\" but a love story for today's world. Just lovely.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have tried other weather apps,<br />and this is my favorite, for Android.<br />It works well, is fairly fast and has good features<br />It is also has intuitive menus thus is easy to use<br /><br />C.
1451696205|5.0|Seniors in high school great gift- they loved it and purchased for son and then 4 paper backs bought for his friends
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games series, and my 15 yo<br />daughter did as well.<br />It has a great story line that stays true and<br />doesn't wonder off as sometimes they do.<br /><br />If you enjoyed books like Enders Game,<br />you'll like this as well.<br /><br />C.
0143120530|4.0|A neat little book. Brought up a lot of things that I seem to remember hearing in school but can't really place. It really made me think about how memories work and why we remember things. The journey that he took from a spectator to becoming the US memory champion was entertaining to me. He also brought up history about different kinds of memories and case studies done on these individuals. What I thought was the coolest thing was that no one claimed to be special, they were just regular people who taught themselves ways of remembering, although it tends to be used for remembering useless things. The title has weird when I first started but near the end he gives away what it means which made it a lot better. Remember, this is non-fiction so it is boring at some parts but overall I really enjoyed it and will be using some of the techniques to remember for myself.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games series, and my 15 yo<br />daughter did as well.<br />It has a great story line that stays true and<br />doesn't wonder off as sometimes they do.<br /><br />If you enjoyed books like Enders Game,<br />you'll like this as well.<br /><br />C.
0345803485|2.0|Countless other reviewers have pointed out the repetitiveness of this book. I will give the author a break on that because I don't think I could do much better. What I refuse to give her a break on is the main character repeatedly wearing her roommate's plum dress. I just don't get it. Okay the dress looks good on her, he wants to peel it off of her, great. But why does she wear it out to dinner, then again on their next date to his house, and then one more time! (Spoiler alert! She wears it in the next book too.) I find it hard to believe than anyone, even the most awkward of us, would wear the same outfit two dates in a row that took place just a few days apart. Any self respecting woman would mix it up a little bit and at least give it a good week before recycling an outfit with a guy you have been dating for less than a week. The author made Christian a billionaire, not a millionaire, a billionaire; but she couldn't make Ana more than one outfit? Is it supposed to be like the Simpsons or a cartoon where the characters always look the same? Come to think of it Christian wears a lot of the same clothes too. I don't think it added to the story in any way because I don't think her being poor was the point. She had a job and had never mentioned money problems. Yeah she wasn't rich but non-rich folk still can own their own clothes and have a variety of outfits.<br /><br />Beyond that I have to say that if at the end of the book there was a surprise twist ending and both characters died I would not have cared.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I loved the Twilight series so I'm not exactly what you would call a literary snob.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games series, and my 15 yo<br />daughter did as well.<br />It has a great story line that stays true and<br />doesn't wonder off as sometimes they do.<br /><br />If you enjoyed books like Enders Game,<br />you'll like this as well.<br /><br />C.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Suspenseful.<br />Intriguing.<br />Twists & Turns.<br />Great actors.<br />Well worth the watch!<br />Some foul language, brief violence at beginning of movie and adulterous theme.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for the season 3 to begin.  The preview looked wonderful.  The acting is so good and the new addition to the cast will be very interesting.
B004KWVDWI|5.0|I am very great full they put this movie on blu ray because I have a pull down, eight foot screen, so, the higher the definition the better.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, it is my all time favorite.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a good author, enjoyed her book and will be watching for all of her books.  I have this on my Kindle and love reading it on the Kindle.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|The original had a very different feel to it, but this was a fun adventure with good action to it!
B00080Z53O|5.0|This movie and the product was absolutely in great timing, quality  and everything just was unbelievably good and very affordable!
B00866JL96|5.0|I am fan of this book, and i am really happy to see this movie, it is simple to resemble of the book.
B00499LTLM|5.0|Leery of another Holmes drama, I begrudgingly entertained Sherlock as my flatmate's viewing selection for the evening. And despite my fixed opinion that I was about to be lulled into a nice boredom-induced nap, the show quickly seduced me instead.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are not just apropos casting as these characters; they convincingly are Holmes and Watson.  Sherlock is simply amazing.  The show is well written, produced, and infuriatingly addictive.  The only complaint there is to lodge at its writers, directors, and producers is that there just isn't enough.  We need more, and now.  When an audience is given thoughtful drama and mystery, how can it have an appetite for anything less?  Anxiety and even a tinge of bitter resentment will linger until season three appears.  People deserve a bit more mad genius and high-context character interaction; intelligent and engaging contemporary drama is the sort of cultural nourishment popular taste has long been deficient in.<br /><br />Based on this show, television is back.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I am fan of different dance and style.. I love this story.... I feel more comfortable to watch the movie over again!
0618918248|5.0|This book is like Pringles, you can't stop. It's a great book especially if you've never thought deeply about the absurdity of God or gods. Richard Dawkins lays out a very good set of points and uses his background as an evolutionary biologist to bring the absurdity that is religion into focus. The parts of the bible he talks about is similar to The book, \\"God is not great, how religion poisons everything.\\" It's a complete embarrassment to religion.
B000274THQ|5.0|It is sooo amazing movie, so i love it.. It is make me feel comfortable to watch the movie. I love that movie
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i dont really have a review like everyone else, it's the Bible its always good. Its cool that its more accessible because it's on my kindle
B0001Z37HM|4.0|i bought this for myself because i like watching movies from when i was a young kid. anyone who likes arnolds movies would like this one.
B005P06AAO|5.0|Such a good show. I love the love triangle stuff and the counselor on the show is soooo funny. YOU'RE WELCOME
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Wasn't my favorite book. It was a little slow moving at parts and at times I was a bit board, dozing off to sleep. I don't know that this is a booking would recommend to friends, but it was ok
B007R3AZNK|5.0|to quote a popular song by Dire Straits.  He has been playing &#34;git-tar&#34; since he was 5 and his talent really shows on this album
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just finished and I'm left wanting more! It's been quite a while since I have fallen this in love with a series.  I just didn't want it to end.  Oh I hope there's more...\\"there's that word again...more\\" :)
B009H2PCNC|4.0|nice quiet music to dooze off to at night...I would buy more of his work.  Works well and doesn't keep me up
B00770KR7W|5.0|Masterchief is guarding my desk at work. He looks great and is fun to pose during slow times. I noticed some of the joints face weird directions but its not hard to fix. I'm so impressed with this figure I may buy a second figure from the set. Masterchief could use a teammate... or an enemy.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|For the most part-just wonderful. I have been reading MOnro's work for ages and almost always loved every word. In this collection, I thought one story somewhat weak and too long, but several were marvelous. Her tone, her use of language is exceptional and her characters interesting, thought-provoking and universal. Somehow she make every reader feel empathy for the protagonists, as though the reader has been there and had similar thoughts and experience. &#34;This could have happened to me, or did.&#34;
B005VPRFSY|5.0|Bought this for my nephew & he loved it.  Put it together right away.  It was on his wish list for Christmas.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Fascinating, mysterious, quirky. For the literary reader as well as those who enjoy a good spy story. The literary allusions abound so there is the fun of knowing what literature or events the characters are talking about, and the uncertainties of what is reality and what is fancy. Characters are very varied in education, class, and lifestyles and all sharply drawn. Very satisfying and I am thinking of rereading it to see what else I can plumb from the tale.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is off the beaten path of my usual interest.  I have to admit that I skipped thru some parts. I may go back and re-read it, maybe I won't.  But I do admire everyone associated with the mission.  God Bless America
B0028IDXDS|5.0|so cute will occupy him while soothing him goes with all the other awesome things I have purchase from amazon.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Much like others, I wanted to see what all the talk was about.  It was a little much but I did read it thru and bought the other 2 books.  Not interested in the physical but in the life and the changes taking place.  We are all on a journey.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|This is basic packaging. It is adequate but not with alot of the extras of the movies. It worked fine for me
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Since I read book one I may as well buy the other 2 books.  This one I did skip thru parts, I realized that it was about life and its challenges not just about physical relationship.  That kept my interest.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|It's great listen to it a lot got it when it was free on a deal two days ago so didn't have to pay a penny the kindle Is amazing .
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I started on the 3 books to see what everyone was talking about.  Did I skip thru some of it, yes I did.  But I know that we are all on a journey and it was good to see the end of this one for that family.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A lovely story - right amount of happy and sad. A book I still think of often well after I've finished it. Definately a book to keep on the bookshelf.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Interesting story, can't wait for the movie ....I recommend this book.<br /><br />Easy read. 5 stars it would be nice to be able to zoom the pictures.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is, with no doubt, the best book I have ever read. The phase is perfect for the events and it left so many mysteries, I could never put the book down.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't like how the games are run. And the security on fb is not stable. I always have to leave early on my games because of the website. I don't know if its because of Norton? And they are always asking for more friends? How many do you need to<br />play one of there games.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome novel! This book was very mind boggling and kept me interested from start to finish, I loved the layout that Colleen displayed as well with the dates for each chapter title. For sure  a must read!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|It's rare for me to give a five star rating on anything, but this is deserving.  The pace was excellent, no slow scenes.  Downloading was quick and easy.<br /><br />Thanks
B008CFN95I|4.0|Just when we thought bookstore's had become extinct, a former web designer, Clay Jannon, discovers and becomes employed at a mysterious, independently owned used book establishment, located amongst the rolling hills of San Francisco.<br /><br />Only a few die-hard customers frequent the store, and usually in the middle of the night. Clay learns to masterfully work the ladder, 'like a monkey', pulling out selective titles from their vertical shelves, but is not allowed to look inside them, a condition of his employment.<br /><br />It doesn't take long before the unconventional Clay lets the timeless mystery of the store get the better of him. He can't resist working on a software model to track the books being taken out, and later returned. There's a pattern, it seems, and with the help of his new (Google employed) girlfriend, they create a data visualization that only makes them more curious, yearning for more.<br /><br />And thus, a journey begins to solve a long-standing mystery that dates back to the year 1515.<br /><br />'Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore' is an easy, light-hearted, humorous read. It's mixed with some ancient history, theft, book cults, tech-speak, geekness, love and friendships. A juxtaposition of new technology and olde. And there's that never-ending search for immortality.<br /><br />This is a fine addition to your vertical, or not-so-vertical, bookshelf.

B009JBWOU0|4.0|Great collection for the money, no need for BluRay the quality is just the same without the pausing during watching
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game. Wish the coins generated quicker or that there were other options to earning more coins. Not interested in buying them.
B001OGWY1W|1.0|The movie was fine - what I could see of it.  The streaming video was so bad that we had to turn it off mid-way through.  Never saw the end.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The twists and turns keep coming.  Ms Flynn does a great job of making her characters both mesmerizing and repugnant.  I was left not knowing who to root for or against. This is a book I will recommend to friends primarily for the conversations that will ensue.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Very well laid out, clear pagination, nice illustrations.  And you can't beat the price!  Was a great read, especially if you like Dickens.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Do you have a Tinkerbell fan in your house?  Then you have to have the latest movie!  This was a great gift for our biggest fan and a fun movies to watch as a family.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Mark Wahlberg is going to have to live this one down. Jack Ass 1 and 2 were better and they were really bad movies.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It was pretty much what I expected and played like most solitaire computer games that I have played.  I would recommend this game.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|This was kind of hard to follow if your not up on SciFi tech stuff. Not something I would suggest for a couples movie.
B006O3MU96|1.0|I just didn't get this game.  There are no instructions that I could easilly find.  Another customer's review was well written, so it provided me the much needed info that this game failed to provide.  I ended up removing it from my Kindle Fire HD.  Since the app was free, I wasn't out anything.  I suppose for those who are familiar with the Doodle Jump game series and enjoy them, this app probably works fine.
