B00005JPLU|4.0|Who cares if it isn't historically accurate?  Who cares if the actors are ultra-buff and the women ultra-beautiful.  (Okay, it doesn't hurt any.)<br /><br />This is the rarest of all movies, a riveting, compelling action movie.  I was thoroughly impressed with the acting, the story, the spellbinding cinematography, the dialog, the sub-plots, the violence, the nastiness and the love.  It's a great capsule of the human experience that you must see to believe.  I waited too long to see it.<br /><br />My favorite line (in a movie filled with great lines) is the Queen telling the man she just stabbed (and who raped her shortly before) mocking his earlier lines:  You will not enjoy this.  This will not be over quickly.  I am not your Queen.  (Forgive me if I have slightly misquoted.)<br /><br />This is a great movie, worthy of your time.  Do not look for great historical accuracy or great lessons (although there are some lessons.)  View it and have a good time rooting for the good guys!
0812975219|4.0|The books views on trading and economic aspects, has been critiqued in other reviews .  <br /> <br />To me, this book got me thinking about the influence of randomness in my life and career in both my successes and failures.  Is my Success due to the coincidental wave of History e.g the Internet boom, or is it due to my innate skills which would have helped me succeed in any environment? Did I benefit from a Black Swan or an act of randomness ? Is the frustration in work because success in the line of work is only possible from a Black Swan event e.g Research ? I dont think everything can be attributed to Randomness especially when it comes to relatively closed/controlled systems. In sports some teams like Australia  in Cricket consistently play at a superior level to other teams , whereas for the rest of the teams, randomness does kick in every now and then, resulting in defeats.  <br /> With a honest appraisal of randomness in our life, it can be humbling, help maintain peace of mind when things are not really in our control, get us to exercise caution if one has been riding their luck for a while.

0375758992|3.0|This is the story of Alexandra (\\"Bobo\\") Fuller's gone-to-the-dogs family in 1970's Rhodesia and of a girlhood spent in Africa, born of racist alcoholics who - like so many settlers, in Rhodesia particularly - were too hopelessly dysfunctional to make it in their own country and so thought it wise to go and trash someone else's.<br /><br />Fuller was raised during the Rhodesian civil war (1971-1979), a time when white children over the age of five \\"learned how to load an FN rifle magazine, strip and clean all the guns in the house, and ultimately, shoot-to-kill.\\" Fuller regales her readers with tales of how, as a small child, she would respond to African servants' attempts to discipline her with warnings that she could have them fired, \\"or worse.\\"<br /><br />Fuller artfully describes her parents' racism, the war and relationships between blacks and whites in the soon-to-become nation of Zimbabwe through a child's  relentlessly observing eyes and her remarkable affection for her parents and her brutally oppressed homeland shines through. This affection, in spite of its subjects' prominent flaws, reveals their humanity and allows the reader direct entry into her world. Fuller accurately and artfully portrays bigotry (her own included), segregation, and deprivation.<br /><br />I have great respect for Alexandra Fuller's writing, but must admit to having grown impatient with and irritated by the racism in this book. As a nasty, self-obsessed child desperately in need of parental oversight, the author gladly takes part in the degradation, segregation and insulting of the Africans she is around. Ms. Fuller doesn't offer any apologies or justifications for her own and her family's intransigent defense of white rule, and recounts her parents boasting \\"If we could have kept one country white-ruled, it would be an oasis.\\"<br /><br />My reactions toward this book are mixed. While on the one hand there were wonderful descriptions of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, its peoples and the all-enveloping conflict of the 1970's, I found the stream-of-consciousness style of large tracts of text and tacit acceptance of unrelenting, self-indulgent racism sometimes difficult to deal with., I found the stream-of-consciousness style of large tracts of text and tacit acceptance of unrelenting, self-indulgent racism sometimes difficult to deal with.

B00005JPLU|5.0|My favorite line, delivered in response to being told to lay down their weapons, is King Leonidas' reply: \\"Persians, Come and Get them!\\" followed by the perfectly synchronized moving of their shields into one inpenetrable shield. I understand that is an actual quote, according to Herodotus, who wrote of this historical event. I'm glad the story of such men is being told. What does it matter if there is some artistic license? Who among us knows every actual detail anyway? It's the lesson that counts. <br />Gerard Butler is Fantastic as King Leonidas. He has absorbed the heart and soul of the man, and brought him to life so beautifully and heroically, that you leave the theater a little bit in love with the man he is showing you.  <br />Vincent Regan delivers a memorable performance as his captain, actually all the performers have done a beautiful job, as well as the director, Zack Snyder.   <br />In addition to the beautiful acting, the scenery was like a constant work of art, and the movements of the warriors were truly, as one person described: \\"a warrior ballet.\\"  I appreciated the fact that the blood was cartoon style, as it then did not distract from the action and movements of these graceful story tellers. The music was a perfect compliment, deepening the emotionality.  <br />I would just like to thank the people who brought us this fabulous movie. I watched it numerous times in the theater and can hardly wait for the DVD to come out so I can watch it again.

B000JIHP88|5.0|Did I mention I LOVE this mobile....more importantly my daughter LOVES this mobile.  After buying an endless supply of baby things to occupy my daughter even long enough to get the bottles washed, it all comes back to this mobile.  She is mesmerized by it and has a kicking good time in her crib because of it.  I don't have volume issues like others here, and the selection of music is great--although she seems to prefer Beethoven :)  In fact, if a ruckus is being heard from that direction, nine times out of ten it is because the music/motion has stopped.  A simple re-start does the trick.  I am serious.  I can get as much as an hour to do things around the house.  This is worth every penny, and knowing what I do now about it, I would have paid double!

0316166685|3.0|I gave the book just an \\"okay\\" rating.  The book is original- the story is told from a dead girl's point of view.  She was murdered by a psycho neighbor and the whole book is about her watching her family and friends as they deal with her death. She knows who her killer is, as does the rest of the family, and there is a feeling of acquiescence throughout the novel as Susie, her family, and her friends come to terms with the fact that there is just nothing anyone can do to change the events that happened.  Susie watches as the members of her family struggle to move on with their lives.  In the way that she portrayed Susie's role in her family's life after her death, the author seemed to say that even though the departed are gone physically, they are still with you in mind and spirit and in your heart.<br /><br />Overall, the book was good, but I thought that it could have been better.  I felt like it catered to a teen audience.  I had to laugh at the long lasting romance between the 14 year old dead girl and her first kiss.

B000NA2776|5.0|I fell in love with Mika instantly when I first saw his music in Asia.  Its about time we hear something fun and original.  I don't understand what's all the fuss about not knowing where to catagorize his songs in the US.

Look how well Mika is doing in the rest of the world!! This album is definately something worth recommanding to everyone.  Miks is the BEST!
B000P2A256|4.0|First and foremost, this is no \\"Songs About Jane.\\" If you plan on buying this album, do not buy this album with the impression that it's going to be a follow-up. \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" is definitely, as other people have claimed, over-produced and (as a result) sounds a bit different. <br /> <br />With that said, this album is still great and catchy. It sticks with Maroon 5's \\"jazzy\\" and \\"poppy\\" roots, but places a little less emphasis on vocals as compared to \\"Songs About Jane.\\" <br /> <br />Long story short, if you were a fan in '02, you won't be disappointed.

0783225725|5.0|Clint Eastwood starred as the \\"man with no name\\" in many of Sergio Leone's \\"Spagetti Westerns.\\" Here, Eastwood directs his own similar-type western, although, at the end of this flick, we find out that Eastwood's character really does have a name.<br /><br />After Eastwood rides into the town of Lago and kills the three hired guns who were the village's protectors, he is hired by the townspeople as a replacement gunman. They hope that Eastwood will protect them from a ruthless gang that was sent to jail on trumped up charges by the townspeople. The gang members have done their time and are now coming back to get their revenge. But it turns out that Eastwood has his own reasons for wanting some revenge too.<br /><br />\\"High Plains Drifter\\" ranks with the best of Leone's westerns. It is an excellent film and a classic of the genre, with a supernatural twist.<br /><br />Eastwood's forgettable \\"Pale Rider\\" was a sort of remake of \\"High Plains Drifter.\\" In \\"Pale Rider,\\" however, the individualistic message of \\"High Plains Drifter\\" was replaced by a communitarian one.

0316018953|2.0|I am a big fan of Michael Connelly, but this book does not meet his usual standards. It was originally published as a serialized magazine story. It should have stayed there or been published as a paperback. First of all, it is 225 pages long, BUT the publisher used a large font and double spaced the type. So it is really only about half that length (about 125 pages). There was no drama, no suspense, and no surprises. Only good thing I can say about this book is: Since it only took about 3 hours to read, it didn't waste too much time reading it. Bottom line, save your money and re-read one of his earlier books.
B00005RHGK|1.0|To be fair this film was good for about the first 20 minutes that was until you see the thing that is chasing its two victims it is some sort of beast/vampire/human type creature thing with big wings that has a drivers licences and enjoys the comfort factor of wearing farmer's boots.  You would kind of thought that when this beast with wings was going for its driving test someone at the driving test centre would have been alarmed in thinking this creature with wings might not be so human and seems a little bit odd but no it managed to pass its test and soon takes to the road with its truck to try run some guy & girl of the road and even when the creature itself is then ran over and then also reversed over 9 times it still manages to survive and just fly's of somewhere which makes you wonder why the hell it needed its driving licence in the first place. Surprisingly this film was not at all scary and was rather rank rotten at attempting to be any sort of horror film at all it would of made more sense to be a comedy film.

Anyone who says \\"rock is dead\\" should give this on a spin.

B000001DQI|5.0|Elton John has enriched us all with his incredible artistry. He remains a prolific writer and he sings with all his heart. This double LP album entitled Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, here on one CD, shows us just a glimpse of Elton's great artistry in rock, reggae and \\"lighter\\" music as well.<br /><br />The CD starts with one of Elton's greatest masterpieces entitled \\"Funeral For A Friend (Love Lies Bleeding).\\" Elton's piano and the work of his band make a smashing musical intro to a song about a love gone bad. Elton displays his raw emotion on this track as he sings about how \\"love lies bleeding in (his) hands.\\"<br /><br />The CD track set remains incredibly strong with \\"Candle In The Wind\\" and \\"Bennie And The Jets.\\" \\"Candle In The Wind\\" explores how people can be misunderstood and abused and it uses Marilyn Monroe as an example. \\"Candle In The Wind\\" also features Elton's piano playing to reflect the sensitivity of the song. In addition, \\"Bennie And The Jets\\" paints a portrait of a fictional female rock star and her band. The rock beat on \\"Bennie And The Jets\\" is strong, solid and awesome.<br /><br />The title track actually comes fourth on the set: \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" allows Elton to sing of a supposedly beautiful and luxurious lifestyle that he realizes is not as special as he thought it would be. The use of the image of the yellow brick road to a better life from The Wizard Of Oz works well; and we see, just like Dorothy concluded, that there's no place like home.<br /><br />If you REALLY want to hear Elton at his most versatile, listen to \\"This Song Has No Title.\\" Elton plays farfisa organ, electric piano, mellotron AND piano!!! This number shines like pure gold and the mixing reflects excellent judgment. The melody of this song is wonderful.<br /><br />On \\"Jamaica $erk-Off\\" Elton and the band turn out an excellent reggae tune that beckons to you to love it; Elton sings his praises for the island of Jamaica and Prince Rhino's \\"vocal interjections\\" rule!<br /><br />Other gems on this CD include the stunningly beautiful \\"I've Seen That Movie Too;\\" for this song Elton sings of how he won't let himself be fooled by a woman who doesn't truly love him. The piano and percussion work wonders in the arrangement; and Del Newman's orchestral arrangement stuns you with its beauty. \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" tells the story of a woman who \\"rents by the hour\\" as she \\"satisfies\\" the sailors in the port; Elton sings this with a type of sensitivity that I rarely experience. Del Newman once again gives \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" a gorgeous orchestral arrangement. Excellent!!!<br /><br />\\"All The Girls Love Alice\\" lets Elton sing about a young lady who enjoys pleasing some of the other girls in town; however the ending is most definitely glum. The musical arrangement shifts back and forth between a hard rockin' song and a type of love ballad with a much slower tempo and great key changes--and this impresses me greatly.<br /><br />Of course, there's that Elton John classic number, \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting.\\" This number showcases the youthful rebellion young people experience when they are starting their own lives separate from their parents. I can just envision all these young people marching and dancing through the streets chanting this anthem as they shake their fists in the air!<br /><br />Sadly, all good things must come to an end. \\"Harmony,\\" the last track on this CD, moves you with its sensitivity; and Elton delivers this with great panache. An excellent number to close the track set!<br /><br />The liner notes feature an awesome essay by John Tobler; and you get all the lyrics and song credits. The beautiful art work enhances the liner notes as well.<br /><br />Elton John is a living legend. Long after most \\"celebrities\\" are dead and forgotten, Elton John will remain in our hearts and minds because of his incredible music and his legendary performances. Thank goodness Elton has shared his work with us; and, if we're lucky, Elton will be performing for many more years to come.and, if we're lucky, Elton will be performing for many more years to come. <br />

B000DZIGDU|3.0|What can you say about a movie that has so many fine ingredients?  This is all the hallmarks of a great movie - great director, terrific acting, epic cinematography, relevant message. And yet without a real narrative to hang on, this is a movie about the atmosphere - in particular, the cumulative effect of atmosphere.  It will depend on the viewer if that atmosphere is enough to sustain interest.  Jake Gyllenhaal is terrifically convincing as the naïve young `average young man' who joins up instead of going to college.  His journey is the lynchpin of the movie, and he makes it work.  He starts off in the usual drill sergeant shouting at recruits type scenes, and finally gets to the Gulf.  There, the movie is about the waiting.  The boredom and frustration of being built up to act, and then sit on their heels unable to act..  Problem is, in convincingly conveying the boredom and frustration of the men, the viewer is equally bored and frustrated.  The war starts, and yet the frustration is never truly released for the group of marines, and in the final scenes the end is somewhat bleak to say the least.  The cream of the most macho soldiers are made to look impotent.  This is a timely look at what some of the pressures must have been like - there are probably also parallels to be made with today's conflict, even though the situation is quite different.  As the lead says towards the end - Every war is different - and every war is the same.  So is this enough to spend your two hours on the couch..? The answer is probably only just - there was more that could have been made of these memoirs. But accepting its flaws, its probably still interesting enough to get through - just not if you are an action junkie!
1591841666|4.0|This is a great little book.  It's quick to read and gets to the point fast.  It's excellent for those who need a little boost to stay in the game and continue pushing to reach the top of the heap and even better for those who have a good idea they're headed in the wrong direction.  I just wish this book had been around 20 years ago when I knew as a fist-year law student that I was headed in the wrong direction but didn't have the guts to quit law school.  Oh well, at least after reading this book, I can finally put to rest a career that should have died in its infancy.  Thanks Seth!
1594489505|5.0|After reading the Kite Runner (which is my favorite book) I knew I would like Hosseini's second book, but I had no idea it would be as good as the Kite Runner. Like the Kite Runner I could not put the book down and read it in 2 days. We often see images of Afghan women in the media but rarely do we get an up close and personal account of their lives and all they endure. This book gives us that rare glimpse. <br /> <br />Hosseini's greatest gift is the way he tells each characters story. At first you wonder how each character is connected and then seamlessly he brings everything together. After reading this book I am filled with gratitude for the life I have. Even though the book is fictional I am sure there are many women who have endured far worse than the characters in the story. When I compare the hardships I've endured with what these women had to endure, I can not help being grateful. Thank you Hosseini for a touching story that will stay with me for years to come! <br />

B00005JPRT|5.0|This low budget ($200,000) film has won uniformly rave reviews, not to mention the 2007 audience award at the Sundance Film Festival. The plot is about as simple as plot can get. An aspiring street musician whose girlfriend left him for London lives above his father's vacuum cleaner repair shop. A younger girl who has moved to Dublin from the Czech Republic after her husband left her hears him play and becomes his motivating inspiration. Their tender friendship is mediated by their mutual love for music, and many people have referred to this film as a musical, what with a dozen or so songs that move the story along. Best of all is a surprise and decidedly ambiguous ending. Actors Glen Hansard of the Dublin-based group The Frames and the Czech singer-songwriter Marketa Irglova (age 17) sing their own songs in this feel-good flick.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Shot on digital video, rather than film, David Lynch's \\"INLAND EMPIRE\\" takes him out of the mainstream, if you can call \\"Mulholland Drive\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\" mainstream, into the realm of pure Independent film making: producing films with little money and without any outside interference.<br /><br />At the beginning of this film Laura Dern plays Nikki Grace, a diva-like actress frantically waiting for word from the producers of a film that she would like to do. This part of the film is very straightforward but Lynch straightforward which means that 1+1 almost never equals 2. This is where Nikki/Laura begins. By the end of the film she/they are unhappy, bored, frantic, living in a one-story, California Ranch-style house in what looks to be the Inland Empire (Riverside, Corona): the fastest growing section of Southern California. Does this have any significance as far as Lynch is concerned or is his Inland Empire one of the mind? I don't really know for sure and in Lynch's world this ambiguity makes the proceedings troubling, puzzling and fascinating all at the same time. Rational ambivalence is called for when dealing (as in viewing and describing) with Lynch's films except maybe for the almost straightforward and appropriately named, \\"Straight Story.\\"<br /><br />In regards to Laura Dern: as Jeanne Moreau was for Godard, as Deneuve was for Bunuel and Truffaut, as Audran was for Bunuel and Chabrol, Dern is Lynch's muse: the actress he chooses to personify his dreams and nightmares. Dern is neither a plush toy nor a sexpot-type of actress. She is tall, imposing yet warm, emotionally available, argumentative, brittle, ready and willing to give any man or woman a run for their money in life as well as in bed. Look to Lynch's recurring choice of Dern for hints as to what is going on his volatile mind and his brilliant films.<br /><br />There are moments of great beauty and clarity here for Lynch is nothing if not a superior artist capable of making his striking images, film moments and whole scenes effective and thoughtful as well as funny and scary as all hell.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Get IT\\"......\\" You Got IT!\\" (as quoted from\\" Premiere\\" which also states that Lynch himself has explained \\"INLAND EMPIRE\\" as making \\"perfect sense.\\") is the mantra of Lynchists (or Lynchpins) and in regards to \\"INLAND EMPIRE\\" this phrase seems wholly appropriate.d whole scenes effective and thoughtful as well as funny and scary as all hell.  <br />\\"I Don't Get IT\\"......\\" You Got IT!\\" (as quoted from\\" Premiere\\" which also states that Lynch himself has explained \\"INLAND EMPIRE\\" as making \\"perfect sense.\\") is the mantra of Lynchists (or Lynchpins) and in regards to \\"INLAND EMPIRE\\" this phrase seems wholly appropriate.  <br />
0316166685|5.0|There are simply no words to describe this wonderful and moving story. The subject matter is hard to read through, but the minute you close the book, you will never be the same way again. This book is so touching and after I read it, I honestly couldn't pick up another book for weeks after because I was so affected by the story.<br />The story is simple; Susie Salmon is a fourteen year old teenage girl who has so much to look forward to. She is raped and murdered by her male neighbor and then finds herself in Heaven. From there she watches her family go through the aftermath of her death and how her life including theirs' along with her murderer changes, or rather how they all go on without Susie living on Earth.<br /><br />As I read this story, chills would run down my body as Susie, even though she was in a better place, couldn't let go as she experience the suffering her parents, brother and sister. We see things through her eyes including her rapist-killer and how he goes on with his life without any consequence. Will he get his in the end?<br /><br />The question remains how does one try to forgive and get through the pain of this horrendous crime including the victim themselves? Emotions are high and there are a few chapters that will have you weeping. Alice Sebold writes a truly exceptional piece of literature of forgiveness, redemption and ultimate love. Her descriptions of Heaven are beautiful and she has a way of words, including that of the mind of a teenager. Perhaps a spiritual read to some, for others a journey of one's self.<br /><br />Simply put, Thank You!<br /><br />Katiebabs<br /><br />[[ASIN:0316096199 Lucky: A Memoir]]

B000F39M9W|5.0|These are fast, exciting, and superbly executed performances. They're also not lightweight, as there's plenty of brass and percussion in all of them. It's ridiculous to argue that the 1947 version of \\"Le Sacre\\" should be dismissed because it's easier to play. It's not easier to play. Regardless of the circumstances surrounding Stravinsky's revision, the 1947 version is a legitimate alternative to the orginal. The vast majority of listeners would never know the difference. Simply put, the '47 version is slightly leaner, with textures clarified a bit. Yes, there is some minor reduction in the orchestration. But one could just easily argue that the original version is over-orchestrated. Again, the differences are just not that noticeable. Personally, I prefer the revised version for the cleaner textures that the permit the rhythms to be more sharply etched - just slightly so. Either way, this is a great performance - one that comes closer to Stravinsky's incredibly fast metronome markings than most.  <br /> <br />I also prefer the original version of \\"Night On Bare Mountain\\" to the well known Rimsky version. Here's a case where a later revision - Rimsky's complete rewrite of the original - truly makes the piece a completely different work. As unfamiliar as the original version is, it's clearly better. And yes, the Abbado recording may be just slightly better - but with emphasis placed on \\"slightly\\". This one is plenty exciting, and just as well detailed as the Abbado.  <br /> <br />For me, the benchmark for any performance of Bartok's \\"Miraculous Mandarin\\" is the fast chase sequence (located at the end, in the truncated \\"suite\\" version). This one is very fast, and very exciting. You can also hear ALL of the numerous, short (and sometimes, ringing) strokes of the tam-tam; the large orchestral gong. That adds lots of color, as well as an Asiatic tinge to the chase. If you're interested in any or all of these works, you'd be hard-pressed to do better.
B00005JLEU|5.0|We have watched this cartoon maybe a thousand times. What an amazing tale. Just like all Miyazaki's works, it is smart, mysterious and kind. We are pulled into strange world of spirits, where the main heroine fogoes transformation, and grows spiritually. Prepare yourself for dragons, heights, monsters, and witches galore. Imagination goes wild in this classic, highly recommended.
0393061310|5.0|This is a wonderful, and transformative, book.  It steps outside conventional histories and tells the story of the world's societies from the standpoint of geography, demography and agriculture. These elements are shown to be deteminative,  in ways humans don't perceive as the events occur, much as Darwinian natural selection posits an analysis of enormous and inexorable forces at work to which the affected beings are oblivious. Wonderfully written, wonderfully researched and analyzed, it is a tour de force of popular scholarship and an unforgettably fresh perspective on, well, everything that ever happened in history.
0307263118|5.0|I would never have picked up this book if it hadn't been on a friend's recommendation but, boy, am I glad I did. Normally I wouldn't want to read about an old man reminiscing but I was hooked from the very first by John Banvilles language.<br /><br />Max Morden, the main character, alternates between remembering an important time in his adolescence and reviewing his marriage with emphasis on his wife's last months before she dies of cancer.<br /><br />John Banville's style spellbound me from the first. It's poetry in prose form, every word, every sentence deliberately sculpted and positioned. I refused to be intimidated by his words and made it a challenge to add to my vocabulary.<br /><br />As I became Max Morden's confidant I was equally repulsed by his honesty and intrigued by his insights. Max speaks about things that happen to all of us but you don't normally hear people admit to them or even mention them: acting out agressively towards a beloved pet, being abusive to other children, having sexual fantasies about adults while we are children or adolescents, hating people close to us just because they are who they are. He shares his regrets and at the same time realistically admits that he'd make the same mistakes again given the choice. He's refreshingly unapologetic.<br /><br />It took me a while to finish the book and for a while I want to read easier fare; but I want to read more by Banville. He's as much an artist in his field as Gaugin, Goya, Courbet and others. He paints using language.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Bleak, Beautiful, Brilliant yet hopeful. Better than Pan's Labrynth, better than Babel, better than most. <br />I only compare it to the those two because they were also made by two other brilliant Mexican filmmakers  <br />in an evergrowing and impressive group who are just schooling everyone else at the moment. <br />I think it portrayed a very interesting, somber, intelligent future although not one I find highly plausible as far as the reproduction aspect goes. <br /> Just a fantastic vision with phenomenal execution. <br />It deserves to be seen and you should see it.
0156030306|5.0|I really, really like this book, and one of the best things about it is that it's accessible and enjoyable on many levels.   <br /> <br />On the most basic, it offers a fascinating premise with memorable characters that behave and change in believeable ways. It's well written -- extremely well written -- in a journal style that eloquently captures the changes the main character undergoes as he gains (and loses) over 100 IQ points.  This sort of style is difficult for an author to pull off because not only does the voice have to be believeable, but it has to be evident to the audience what's REALLY going on even when the narrator himself doesn't \\"get it.\\"  Keyes accomplishes this, masterfully, and the result is a riveting read. <br /> <br />That said, I really mainly enjoyed the novel for the themes it struggles with. There's the obvious one, the one about the loneliness that comes from being \\"abnormal\\" (in either direction - super smart or super stupid) in our society ... it's a good theme, and very well explored by the novel -- neither tendentious nor overly schmaltzy, and always honest.  But it's also a bit of an overused, feel-good theme, and if that were all this novel was about I would like it less than I do. <br /> <br />The book is actually a meditation on knowledge, and an honest, piercing exploration of the dual questions, \\"Is ignorance bliss?\\" and, \\"If so, should we then choose it?\\" (The book doesn't give easy or clear answers, either, which is one of its great strengths). The obvious instance of this in the character of Charlie himself, as he first chooses to become smarter without ever really understanding what it will mean, then wrestles with the consequences and implications of this choice, and finally he deals with the shattering loss of his intelligence. Some of the most amazing parts of the book are when new knowledge causes great pain: as when, for instance, he realizes that the people he once saw as his friends were making fun of him; or when he returns to his original IQ level but can no longer be as happy as he once was because he now knows what he is missing.  The same theme is explored in the scientists themselves: you can't read the book without wondering if their work is moral, if it's really \\"right\\" in a deep sense to manipulate IQ this way. And would the answer to that question change if their experiment had worked? <br /> <br />It's just a very good book.  The writing is accessible even to young teenagers, but the theme and ideas make it worth anyone's time.

0307383415|5.0|I picked this book up because I try to read the books written by presidential candidates, and because I was curious as to what all the hype about Obama was about.  I expected a typical \\"presidential candidate\\" book, written in clear but uninspired prose and carrying a pandering message wiped of anything that anyone might possibly find objectionable.  To my pleasant surprise, this book was neither.  This is probably in part because it was written a decade ago, before his political career - but mostly, I believe, it is because of the type of person Obama appears to be.  <br /> <br />One surprise is that the book is extremely well-written (and it wasn't ghost-written, either).  There are parts where you can tell that it's his first book -- an overwrought phrase here or there, a bit of meandering -- but overall, the writing quality is astounding -- better than the writing of many professional authors.  Obama is clear without being boring and has the ability to capture a situation or a feeling with a rare degree of simplicity and evocativeness. <br /> <br />The main reason I like the book is that it is honest -- it serves honesty in great heaping bucketfuls, in fact.  Obama does not try to make himself look good in this book (which, ironically, makes him look even better). It is about his journey as a biracial American, and as a result is chock-full of his mistakes and missteps as much as his gains.  The people in the book are treated with compassion and empathy, and every experience is framed and weighed by an incisive intellect that never loses its sympathy for the people involved.  I am most struck by the obvious intelligence and intellectual independence of the narrator: he really THINKS about things, and has the courage to draw his own conclusions.  That is a tremendously unusual thing to find in a person -- an even more unusual thing in a politician. <br /> <br />I'm aware that this review may look like it was written by an Obama shill, but I couldn't find much todislike. [Though I would have liked to see more about his mother and her role in his life.] Truth be told, I'm still not sure who I'll vote for for President  -- I'm not going to decide this early -- though I'm leaning Obama, in no small part due to this book.  But regardless of what sort of president he would make, I have to think that anyone who could write this book must be a pretty amazing person.
0385338082|4.0|Completely predictable but thoroughly entertaining just the same.  The main character is lovable and you feel for her during her predicament.  There are some laugh-out-loud funny moments and Kinsella writes with admirable British wit.  A light, entertaining read.
0340818867|5.0|As an American social scientist who has an English partner and has visited the UK multiple times, I found this book engrossing for many reasons.  Kate Fox does the miraculous: she makes fascinating reading out of chapters on tea, queue-jumping, arrangements of knick-knacks, incessant talking about the weather, and myriad other English characteristics that so charm, frustrate, and baffle we non-English of the world.  Moreover, her writing is hilarious - she has a droll, tongue-in-cheek, utterly English sense of humor that had me laughing through every chapter. <br /> <br />The book is incredibly useful, too.  I read it after my English partner recommended it to me, saying he had never read anything that captured the English so well. The insights in the book clarified several things to me and greatly reduced the quantity of cultural faux pas on my part.  It also gave my partner a great deal of insight into his own personality as well as his interactions with Americans.  Plus, it led to many, many fascinating discussions between us about (among other things) the markers of class and attitudes about it, the nature (and point) of politeness, and how it is that societies can make us who we are.   <br /> <br />The only shortcoming of the book is that I still don't understand Vegemite, but I think that may just be beyond comprehension.
0380713802|4.0|An account of the author's rambles across Europe.  Bryson is always entertaining, and his writing alternates from downright hilarious to the point of absurdity to dealing with some very sobering statistics.  This is a wonderful mix and he's a very gifted writer whose works sound like a really great story you once heard from a friend.
0374105235|4.0|This book has an impact that will leave you reeling -- mostly because it's true, and because there are so few books like it anywhere.  It lets you explore from the inside what it's like to be caught as a child in a senseless, apparently never-ending civil war -- then to become a child soldier in that war, and to claw your way back.  I couldn't put the book down; it was amazing. <br /> <br />That said, I gave it four stars rather than five because -- seen as a novel, not just as a harrowing true story -- I was left feeling frustrated and unsatisfied in parts.  The subject matter and pacing is riveting, but it's all told at an odd emotional distance.  For instance, we don't really see much of his transition from scared little boy into merciless child soldier -- one day he's a normal child, and literally the next day he's an inhuman killing machine.  We are told about (but don't experience) his nightmares or his headaches or the fears and difficulties he felt as he tried to return to society.  Much of the book, in fact, is telling rather than showing; the book is good because the \\"showing\\" parts are utterly amazing, and because of the power of even just the telling. Nevertheless, we as readers see what he does but don't feel what he feels: so it just feels a bit emotionally distant, especially given the impact the events could have had.  <br /> <br />That all said, it's still an incredibly good book.  And I'm aware that the author probably wouldn't want to go into that level of emotional detail in a book made for the world to read -- plus he may, either as a result of his experiences or as a mechanism for dealing with them, actually feel some emotional distance himself. And while my enjoyment of it as a piece of literature is at the four stars level, my enjoyment of it as a human being, and as citizen in today's world, is at five stars.  Go read it.
076790382X|4.0|Laugh-out-loud hilarious.  Bryson's observations about American society and its absurdities rings so true and the author is the perfect vehicle for showcasing these stories.  He is just so lovable in his books.  His absentmindedness and his sharp wit both serve him extremely well.  While poking fun at others, he also pokes fun at himself.  His work is just priceless.
B000B5OD4I|4.0|Seiko Divers' watches have a well deserved reputation for reliability and durability.  And they look great, either with a wetsuit or a tuxedo. <br />The only drawback to these watches is that they are 'non-hacking' meaning the second hand doesn't stop when the adjustment knob is pulled out.  you have to hold it to get the works to stop to set it to the second.
B000002UAU|5.0|June 1, 1967 was the day the Sgt. Pepper was released to nearly universal acclaim, astonishment and awe. I don't have anything additional to say that has not been said a thousand times before, but this recording changed everything. Thank you, John, Paul, George, and Ringo (along with George Martin and the engineers who truly changed the world of music and recording) for this masterpiece. <br /> <br />Probably the most telling comment is that Sgt. Pepper is still relevant today. I wonder if we'll be able to say that about today's pop music in 2047?
B0000041DF|5.0|I haven't listened to all, as I so love Rachmaninov that its all I can do to get beyond him. Her rendition sounds so soulful and right on, the timing perfect or as close to as possible, its absolute heaven, and hell, as his music seems to be, to listen to it. I love it, always have, and was not at all disappointed by this cd. Highly Recommended.
B000063DI8|4.0|Great hard rock album! This collection of songs by Maiden are less progressive and a lot more melodic than anything they've done with their last previous efforts. The D'ianno years are still my favorite though but not bad for a Dickinson record.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Helen Mirrim rarely misses a beat, and if she ever does, no one would ever notice (except maybe her), but she is stunning and totally convincing in her role as the Queen. I wonder if the Queen has seen it and what she thinks of how the Royal Family was portrayed in their dislike of Dianna; but whatever she felt, she put it all aside for the 'good of the people' and that came through ever so stunningly. It made us realize that the Queen of England is truly one 'for the people' and when push came to shove, she humbled herself magnificently and did what she needed to do.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|this album is amazing!i HATED hollaback girl. Couldn't stand the song and you couldn't (and still cant) pay me to listen to it. BUT this i listen to all the time why? because its creative and she definitly shows her talent to make amazing music. I loved her in no doubt and yes i love her voice when she does  use it (like  4 in the morning and fluorescent) but i love her rap thing/ robot sounding thing too. I was definitely sold immediately when i heard wind it up (and I am assuming that most of us that love the sound of music were too!) It BLEW my mind!! She way she embraces her motherhood and is (as the review stated) non apolegetic in \\"yummy\\" was very artistic. I love the colaborations with pharell very much. ROCK ON!
B00005JPAO|5.0|\\"The Queen\\" (2006) starring Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II has got to be one of the most realistic and revealing portrayals ever of any monarch on film. Mirren effortlessly becomes Elizabeth; the few stirring weeks captured in the film tell the viewer much about the entire life of the queen as well as the nature of monarchy. Too often filmmakers, particularly those from Hollywood, project the misconception that being a royal means getting to have everything you want and ordering people around in a haphazard manner. In \\"The Queen,\\" Her Majesty is portrayed as addressing everyone, especially her domestic staff, with exquisite courtesy and consideration. From what I have read about the private lives of the various royal families such behavior on the part of a sovereign is much closer to the reality than any crass barking of orders. This is not to mitigate moral shortcomings; I am referring only to surface behavior, which nevertheless can and does indicate one's general attitude towards others. Elizabeth II comes across as first and foremost a servant of her people.    The film opens with the Queen having her portrait painted, sending the message that the story one is about to see is a portrait come to life. And indeed it is. It is also the portrait of monarchy in the modern world. Tradition is confronted with waves of constant change; some concessions must be made in order to survive. The scenes of the royal family \\"at home\\" almost reminded me of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette at the Tuileries--living in a gilded cage with no actual freedom or power. And yet Mirren subtly and dynamically captures the personality of the quiet little woman who embodies an ancient institution which only her presence and her dignity can salvage. What is especially fascinating is how the queen wins over socialist Tony Blair; he becomes her champion and the savior of the monarchy. It called to mind how dedicated revolutionaries like Mirabeau and Barnave were deeply moved after meeting Marie-Antoinette and wanted to do everything they could to help her.    What is especially compelling about \\"The Queen\\" is that it involves events which many people today have lived through, with the main characters being a reigning sovereign and a sitting prime minister. It evoked memories of the day Princess Diana died. I thought people were being a bit harsh on the queen even then and I saw nothing wrong with the royal family staying at Balmoral to grieve in private, although to everyone else in the world it was a major calamity. Queen Elizabeth's devotion to duty and her dedication to the vow she made to serve her people are shown in sharp contrast to Diana's futile and tragic quest for personal happiness.    I am always annoyed when people compare Diana to Marie-Antoinette, calling the Queen of France a \\"Lady Di before her time.\\" Yes, they both loved children, fashion, and had many charities. But when her world fell apart, Marie-Antoinette steadfastly stayed at her husband's side, although everything in her wanted to get her family away from danger. But Louis would not leave his people and Marie-Antoinette would not leave her husband, although she had many opportunities to escape. Diana had very different ideas about duty and marriage. Marie-Antoinette would not leave; Diana did. I do not condemn Diana; she had a lot with which to contend. Queen Elizabeth II, however, is of the old school, when duty, honor, discretion and commitment came before the pursuit of happiness.
B000F48CD8|5.0|I'd heard a song or two on the radio while traveling and thought I'd give the cd a go.  Fabulous!  Truly these musicians enjoy what they do and each others company.  Only through genuine collaboration could such a creation happen.  They had me from the first song to the last. The style is definately not that of amateurs.  Well produced but not to the point that it sounds plastic.  In fact one thing I love the most is how they have retained a slight raw edge that was quite refreshing.   I hear influences of the Beatles, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin but with completely fresh insight and I only hope they keep it up so I can add more to my music collection! <br /> In my opinion, not just one or two songs but, all of them are good!
B000687M48|5.0|I really enjoy this purchase, but I'm a fan too.  I enjoyed the music videos, the concert footage, the music, the singing, and the behind the scenes look at their life on the road.  I really think this is worth having in your collection, if you like Evanescence.[[ASIN:B000687M48 Anywhere But Home (w/ bonus DVD)]]
1594489505|5.0|Again incredible. I fell in love with Mr. Hosseini's  writing  in the Kite Runner and I was not disappointed with A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B000066I6N|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I'm not into the covers album thing, but Robert Plant's effort is so different. Gone are the high pitched shrieks of the 60's and 70's, and replaced with a deeply mature voice, almost bordering on crooning. Robert's voice is just beautiful from beginning to end, especially on his take of Tim Rose's Hey Joe and Darkness Darkness. The latter, showed Percy very emotional but strong with his delivery. He made the sound his own with his now familiar Eastern influence, and at over 7 minutes it was in a word, gorgeous. This is by far his best album since Principle Of Moments.
B000M341QO|5.0|If you are reading this, than chances are you already have an interest in the movie and what others think; that being said, there is no need to review the plot and scrutinize everything that happens in this film. <br /> <br />Getting straight to the point; the acting in this film is suberb; and the directing is also top-notch.  The twists and turns that this movie provides are amazingly crafted and well-executed.  I was never a big fan of Mr. Leonardo DiCaprio, but his performance in this film has earned him my respect! <br /> <br />Check this movie out if you haven't already and definetly add it to your collection.  It may be a re-make, but it will develop into its own classic over time!
B000F0UUIM|5.0|Over half a century since its first release, \\"The Searchers\\" remains a landmark of American cinema, perhaps the greatest Western ever made, and the one against which all others must be measured.  John Ford, who more or less defined the conventions of this genre with films like \\"Stagecoach,\\" \\"My Darling Clementine,\\" and \\"Fort Apache,\\" never made a better, more complex Western than this one, and he may never have made a better film -- an extraordinary claim, when you consider that Ford gave us such classics as \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"How Green Was My Valley.\\" <br />\\"The Searchers\\" operates on so many levels at once, it takes nearly a dozen separate viewings to begin to appreciate them all.  Even then, you can always find something new in this film every time you view it.  It's extraordinary. <br />This film demands to be viewed in the widescreen format, so just ignore the \\"full-screen\\" edition.  It's a waste of time.  Ford never shot his Monument Valley locations as lovingly, as achingly, or as heartbreakingly as he does here, and that's part of the point.  If you consider the landscape not as backdrop or scenery, but as a separate character in its own right, whole new levels of meaning and thematic development begin to reveal themselves.  The neighboring Jorgenson family then emerges not as minor characters whose function is to help the plot along, but as a sort of Greek chorus.  Their comments about \\"This land...\\" expressed not in sentences, but in sighs and shrugs become symbolic of the personal sacrifices necessary to the settling and \\"civilizing\\" of the Western wilderness.  Seen in that light, the female characters, who are less than fully developed, suddenly become the whole point of the movie.  Remember, the quest which generates the whole story is to restore the abducted Debbie to her \\"rightful home,\\" even though that home no longer exists. <br />As Ethan Edwards, the main character, John Wayne gives the performance of his career.  Never before or since would Wayne portray a character as complex or conflicted as Ethan Edwards, and you can't imagine anyone else who could pull it off.  While Edwards exudes all of the \\"manly virtues\\" Wayne's characters are famous for: strength, toughness, the skills necessary to the task at hand, an uncompromising sense of honor, etc. with Ethan Edwards, there's a hole in that honor.  Edwards is also an uncompromising racist at heart, something which he makes clear early on and throughout the picture.  He is a character driven as much by his hatred of Indians as he is for the love of his departed family, and he must resolve this conflict by the end of the story, when his quest is finally completed.   <br />Through the internal conflicts of his characters, director Ford is able to say some very subtle things about \\"the winning of the West\\" and the price American civilization paid for it.  It's not all glorious.  Some of it is down-right ugly, but Ford is too subtle an artist to editorialize or let you know what he thinks about it.  Instead, through the vehicle of this single story, Ford is able to say: \\"Look.  This is what happened, and this is why it happened this way,\\" and let the viewer draw his own conclusions about the goodness or rightness of that. <br />This is one extraordinary movie.  If you're serious about American cinema, Westerns, John Ford or John Wayne, it's essential.  It's essential even if you're not serious about any of that.  It's one of the best, if not the best Western ever made.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I just want to go on record and say, this is my favorite movie of all time!  (Based on movies I have seen.)  I saw this movie when it was first released back in 1994, and being as young as I was, I didn't understand it. <br /> <br />Flash foward to now.  After buying and reading all of the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice, I was instantly heel-bent on getting my hands on a copy of this movie!  I was able to watch it again, and I must say I believe this movie is a true work of art, and an instant classic. <br /> <br />The adaptation from the novel to the on-screen story is changed ever so slightly (omitting some parts as most book-to-movies often do) but keeps the whole thing flowing seemlessly together, while also maintaining the substance the viewer needs to fully appreciate the film. <br /> <br />The acting is beyond amazing.  Many people called into question Tom Cruise playing the character of Lestat (I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan either) but I can honestly say he did an amazing job with such an important role.  Having Brad Pitt play alongside Cruise as the character of Louie only caused Cruise to step his game up as well.  Pitt was still fairly young in this movie and he shows a dark energy about him that gelled naturally with the movie. <br /> <br />Who can forget the young Kirsten Dunst, as the loveable and innocent Claudia!  A break-out role for the (at the time) young star that propelled her to future A-list status.  (What if Leelee Sobieski had gotten the part?)  Dunst plays her role so well, you do actually forget that she is just a child in the movie!  Add the incredible acting by Antonio Banderas, and you do have a young all-star cast! <br /> <br />The story itself remains true to the novel.  A tale of lonliness, friendship, immortality, loss, grief, and acceptance.  This movie never over-does the story to make it more \\"Hollywood,\\" they just seem to let the movie take a course of its own and let the characters do the story-telling.  This movie will leaveyou with many questions, as well as a feeling that everything is settled and the end course has been set. <br /> <br />This movie is well worth every penny you spend to rent or buy it.  I whole-heartedly recommend this movie for any and all movie fans!  A true 5-star classic.
B000NDIAWY|2.0|saw Brandi in person-energetic and focused. This CD is somewhat depressing and lacks memerable songs despite the effort.

B000FQ4M58|3.0|I have listened to this album at home, in my car and at work - in various locations and on a range of equipment.  I feel that the vocals performed by Patti Russo match so well with Meatloaf's skill, range and power.  The others seem to be coming from what to me sounds like a teenager reaching out but not acheiving anywhere near his skills and abilities.  Patti Russo - to me - reaches Meatloafs presence in performance skills, and more importently vocal range and power.   <br /> <br />Listen closely to her performance in \\"Could't Have Said It Better\\" - hear her ability to match his ability to sustain both clarity and tone and you will understand what I am alluding to.   <br /> <br />Bat III would have far greater impact with Patti at the helm on lead female vocals.
B00006D295|5.0|A line from the trailer says it best...\\"You've seen all kinds of movies, but you've never seen a movie like The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\". <br /> <br />Some say it's impossible to enjoy this movie without the audience participation. I disagree. The performances, the music, the costumes, and the dead-on parodies of various horror/sci fi movie clichés are perfectly enjoyable on their own...but, of course, the film lends itself to collective experience in a way none others have before, or since. <br /> <br />All the performers seem to have a sixth sense about how to play their roles - no small feat considering the rather offbeat material - but for me, it's all about Tim Curry. With the wrong actor playing Frank, the film would have crashed and burned (actually, with the wrong actor playing Frank, the original play would never have had a life past its initial run in London's Theatre Upstairs). He became a true film icon with this role, and it's easy to understand why. His performance is a delicate balancing act - feminine flounce with masculine power; outrageous but always controlled. His Frank is gorgeous and unbelievably sexy, with a voice from the gods - both speaking and singing. <br /> <br />I think it's time to do the Time Warp again...

Both Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are just amazing as brothers Dean and Sam. Season 2 especially focuses more on them than the monsters-of-the-week from season 1. The last few episodes especially are jaw-dropping and simply wonderful. PLEASE give this series a try, you won't regret it!

But for those of us who remember Marty Friedman era Megadeth...Well I guess this only solidifies the fact that what once was will never be again. On another note, why is everyone complaining about Dave being so political? This is a band who always made music about politics and war. So the writing is not really all that different.  But what are you gonna do? With the rest of the mediocre crap out there nowadays...I guess I should be grateful for this release.

B000M2UQDC|5.0|If this is the original pressing on the HARVEST label (owned by EMI- Capitol) then it is THE digital version of Dark Side. Subsequent releases are good and are great to have but for the REAL, as close as you can get to the original analog sound, then you need this album. The original mono analog tracks lose sound quality over the years and this is THE way to enjoy it. I am not sure how it sounds though a quadraphonic system (the original quad LP is the greatest sound- bar none, as long as the vinyl is scratch-free). As for digital releases this is the top shelf. The Cadillac of dark side CDs. As long as it's on the HARVEST label!!!! <br />Chad Koenig
B00094ARZ0|1.0|There's no doubt in my mind that the people who created this load of celluloid sewage knew that featuring Bo Derek getting her bones banged just shy of aggravated battery would have a draw, particularly for juveniles with unrestrained hormones. And that's the only reason anyone would watch this movie. The script is straight out of a fantasy contest, the acting abysmal, and the whole premise ludicrous. They do their best to create a fantasy atmosphere, indulging in the beauty of Spain for romantic backdrop and give us a Bo Derek pleading for sex. For most of this movie's audience, that's enough. For lovers (no pun intended) of quality film it isn't even close to a reason to spend a quarter watching this crud. Oh, I admit, I watched it several times whilst in my college years. But that's what college age guys do. And I would venture to guess that the demographic for this movie is 90% male, mostly from 18-30. Frankly, watching Bo get her brains banged out is worth the price of admission, especially for that group. But everything else about this movie isn't just bad, it's purely comical. I wondered to myself what was George Kennedy thinking when he accepted his role in this. If he'd have dug into his Dragline character from \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" the movie would have at least conceded to it's absurdity and not tried to be taken the least bit seriously. I find it hilarious that Amazon realized this to the point that they conceded by giving out the times in the movie where Bo gets banged. That alone should say something- that anything outside those time slots isn't worth watching. I know lots of 40 somethings that would have liked the same thing for \\"Lolita,\\" though those encounters are less frequent. All in all, this movie ranks (pun INTENDED) in the hall of fame of incredibly bad movies. The 1 star is for the Bo sex scenes, otherwise, ZERO!

0790733226|5.0|This movie is rich in ethical points of view. It ranges from the insane who believe their harmful actions are saving humanity, to non-ethical behaviour by saying what ever it takes to succeed. the moral of the movie is amazingly simple yet illusive to even the wisest of Philosophers.  <br /> The special effects are fantastic, the casting is brilliant and the writing is incredibly profound. A definite 5 star movie.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|In one of the interviews with Ben Kingsley, he expressed great apprehensiveness and even reluctance to play Mahatma Gandhi.  \\"Nobody can play this man,\\" he'd stated.  After a while, he gave it some more thought and finally decided to accept the role.  Thankfully, his decision would bring one of the best and most memorable acting performances ever shown on the silver screen.  It was a no-brainer that he won the Oscar for Best Actor that year, and that \\"Gandhi\\" won for Best Picture.<br /><br />Martin Luther King Jr once stated about Gandhi, \\"I have found it challenging at times to live by the words of Jesus, but Gandhi proved it can be done.\\"<br /><br />This beautiful autobiography of the \\"Mahatma\\" or \\"Great Soul\\" (a title bestowed upon him by the people of India and not by himself) demonstrates how one man conquered a nation through love and non-violence instead of hatred and war.  Gandhi understands that to stand up to the fear and hatred in others, you must first conquer the fears of yourself.  A master teacher of ALL religions, he recognized the spiritual paths of all men, and put into practice the universal teachings of peace, love, forgiveness, and brotherhood; teachings that every great master and saint has ever taught.<br /><br />Richard Attenborough directed this magnificent story that opens with his assassination.  This was a brilliant move, on his part.  He shows how Gandhi dies, but immediately focuses on his extraordinary life.  Filmed in India with wonderful performances by both Western and Eastern performers, they collaborated together to bring this film to life.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley plays Gandhi in such a true and humble way.  He brings Gandhi to life and endows him with the characteristics and personality that I have read so much about.  Paramahansa Yogananda (a great Master from India who came to the U.S.) spent some time with Gandhi at his hermitage and wrote about the experience in \\"Autobiography of a Yogi.\\"  Some of Gandhi's ashes were also given to him were they now lie at rest in Lake Shrine, California.<br /><br />Every actor, whether they have a small part or a large one, brought their best for this film.  You can see that in their performances.  Martin Sheen looks as if he's sitting next to he real Gandhi.  Perhaps that isn't far of a stretch, if the spirit of Gandhi was indeed working through Ben Kingsley.<br /><br />It is simply amazing how Gandhi was able to persuade the people of India into non-cooperation with the British.  Thoreau's \\"Civil Disobedience\\" coincides beautifully with Gandhi's actions.  \\"We want to see the British off as our friends, not our enemies,\\" explains Gandhi.<br /><br />The film is over three hours in length, and every time I watch it, I feel as if I've had a spiritual experience.  I can understand why he was given the title of \\"Mahatma.\\"  Albert Einstein may have said it best in a quote that is given at the very beginning of this movie, \\"Few people will scarcely believe that any one in flesh and blood ever walked the face of this Earth.\\"e also given to him were they now lie at rest in Lake Shrine, California.   <br /> <br />Every actor, whether they have a small part or a large one, brought their best for this film.

After they exorcise sam dean just look at sam and then punches him. And the second funniest part is when in the werewolf episode sam is like have you spotted the guy and dean says yes.

B000P6YNSE|4.0|It's no secret that the third season of Lost got off to a slow and shaky start, and it's even less of a secret that the show rebounded in the last episodes of the season and once again displayed that early promise it first showed back in 2004 upon it's premiere.  As the season begins, Jack (Matthew Fox), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Kate (Evangeline Lilly) are imprisoned by Ben (Michael Emerson) and the Others, while Sayid (Naveen Andrews), along with Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and Sun (Yunjin Kim) wait to see what happens.  In the meantime, the aftermath of the hatch explosion leaves Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) a changed man with deadly premonitions of the future for Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) embarks on a mission to rescue a wounded Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje).  Eventually everyone is brought back together, as Jack prepares to lead an assault on the Others in an attempt to escape the island once and for all, which leads to the explosive season finale which changes everything about Lost from this point onward.  As we've come to expect, some questions are answered while plenty of new ones appear, but this season of Lost manages to mostly satisfy thanks to the fine ensemble cast and plenty of surprises, including demises of a fan favorite character, and a not so favorite one as well.  Other than the complaints of the deliverate pacing of the show, some favorites like Hurley (Jorge Garcia), Charlie, and Claire (Emilie de Ravin) aren't focused on as much as one would like, but their centric-based episodes are enjoyable nevertheless.  The rest of the cast, which also features Elizabeth Mitchell as a shady Other who may or may not hold the key to escape, and 300's Rodrigo \\"Xerxes\\" Santoro, are also standouts as well.  Despite it's flaws though, the season finale is brilliantly delivered and truly changes everything we know about the show and it's concept, and will have you salivating for more.  All in all, the third, and somewhat maligned, season of Lost illustrates even more that not everything is always as it seems, but at least that way things manage to stay interesting.n of Lost illustrates even more that not everything is always as it seems, but at least that way things manage to stay interesting.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|I just purchased and watched this DVD.  And although Charlize Theron is near genetic perfection and she is definitly a sensual being, big pluses,  you can not make a provacetive scifi action picture in 90 minutes.  The picture lacks to much story to be truly appealing.  In order for the movie to work as it had hoped we need to care about the lead character and care about what she cares about... always an important point in good movie making.  But we are brought into the story and her life much to late to do either.  The filmed which hoped to be heavy, ends up feeling light.  We needed to see what drove her to where she is now and why it is important, we get neither.  Jonny Lee Miller is a menacing villian, very important, but has too little screen time and too little to do to really scare us. But the story just lacks, we need to know why it is so important for Aeon to do what she is doing, why has she become the no. 1 Monicle assasin, and we need to be startled that she has strong emotional feelings for the person she is determinded to kill, we get neither.  I might think budget constrictions had a lot to do with why this picture did not succeed.  All the elements are here for a really good film, but there is not enough film to make it one.  The picture comes of as sort of a modern age \\"Logon's run\\"... ( also not to be crase, but a real love scene with real sexual situations might have help convice us more that there was something deep here).  Stylish and defintly futuristic in a believable way...I am just left wanting a lot more.
1594489505|5.0|It's hard to imagine, but Khaled Hosseini's second book - A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS - is even better than his first (THE KITE RUNNER).  It's the epic story of Miriam and Laila - two Afghani women whose lives are woven together in a country where women have no rights.  There are many twists and turns in this poignant and touching story, so I won't spoil the plot by saying any more.  But I will say this: the book will take you behind the burqa - and show you exactly what it's like for women to live in a country where men can do to women whatever they like, and women have absolutely no legal recourse.  There's nothing factual revealed about the plight of Afghani women I didn't know before reading this book.  But reading a story about women who live this way every single day exposes their plight on a whole other level.  It made their misery real to me in a way it hadn't been before.   <br /> <br />A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS is beautifully written, morally sound, rich in history and culture, and one seriously compelling story.  What more can you ask from an author? <br /> <br />This is one of the best books I've ever read.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I think that most people miss the point on this movie. Yes, it is a great action film with great fight scenes. Yes, Brad Pitt is a really good bad guy. Yes, The music is great. Yes, the apocalyptic regime known as \\"Project Mayhem\\" is led by an anarchistic genius.<br /><br />The point of this movie is that we as a society have grown so accustomed to being a part of the big picture that we forget to be individuals.

I am a member of Gen-X and I know that Gen-X was and is lost in mediocrity. This film will ring true always because of one simple fact; most people are sheep. Even the people who join the fight clubs and \\"Project Mayhem\\" are following someone else's lead. Don't you see it. Don't you understand the glaring, screaming point of this film - that most of us are just cogs in a big machine; but we can break away.<br /><br />I love this movie. I love the action. I love the dialogue, the acting, the direction, the editing, the music... But what I really love is the underlying truth that is layered throughout the film and brought to the surface without any pomp and circumstance. We are all desperate for something more, something to be a part of, something that will make us feel (pain, hate, love, anger, rage, emotions of every scale).<br /><br />This is a great film in every way, and Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter deserved, at the very least Oscar nods, but the film was too controversial, to gratuitously violent and destructive. The supporting cast, including a then unknown Jared Leto, Meatloaf (yeah, the singer) who shines, and several other familiar faces, was phenomenal. As a hollywood blockbuster, this film had it all.<br /><br />But, more importantly it had something deeper. You can disagree with me if you are not the \\"artsy-fartsy\\" type (like me), but the truth remains the same, this film had a point, made the point and took no prisoners along the way.<br /><br />So, live a little, and watch this movie.

1594489505|5.0|I must say, I didn't think Khaled Hosseini would pull it off a second time.  But he has proved me wrong and created another great masterpiece after \\"The Kite Runner\\".  I was so absorbed into the reading that I couldn't put the book down.  After reading this book, I felt so attached to the main characters and wondered how many more women around the world have similar stories such as the ones he created in the story.  If you loved \\"The Kite Runner\\" you will definitely love this one, and if you have not, get both and read them. He is such a brillant writer that I cannot wait to read more books from him.

B0000657UB|5.0|\\"Liege and Lief\\" was Fairport's first album that was almost entirely inspired by traditional British music.

0156012197|3.0|I grew up reading this lovely story and when the pages fell out of my original I went to Amazon for a new one.    However, the new translation took the beauty out of the story that I had felt in earlier readings, in my opinion.     The story remains a wonderful one, but I would suggest reading the Katherine Woods translation for comparison. The language in the original translation is beautiful, creative and inspiring. I felt the newer translation was less poetic.
1594200823|4.0|This was a good and fun book to read. This reviewer is coming from a place of studying every angle of food and nutritoin and digestion and assimilation in order to find one's place and the role of food in life. I have been after the truth, let the chips fly where they might, and I have come to certain beliefs- maybe even what pollan would call food faddist. But that is not to say I don't have more to learn, and that's why I keep reading as many books as I can. I learned a lot from this interesting book. Some of the things I am already well familiar with and it is funny in the sense that he seems to be writing to and for \\"urbanists\\" (I have lived both an urban life and a rural and a suburban and small town). He is writing for people in his own reality tunnel, for his own demographic.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed learning about all the 13 ways of looking at grass. I loved learning about the history of corn and refining and I definitely want to learn more- I plan to check out some of his references in the back.  <br /> <br />I have a couple complaints right here, but aside from these I can't complain about the book, except that when you are deciding how you are going to eat, you have to do a lot more reading- but this is a good consciousness raiser, definitely. <br /> <br />My two complaints is that regarding meat eating, he frames it exclusively as an \\"ethics\\" thing, and avoids much comment on health or sustainability. He talks somewhat of sustainable raising of beef, but he frames all flesh and animal product eating as simply ethics, and not nutrition, because that was what was going on in his soul. I recommend as a good complement to this book, to read john robbins books, especially diet for a new america and the food revolution. Decide what you will, and believe what you will, but they are great books which also raise one's consciousness (or they raised mine). <br /> <br />The second complaint is that he often calls \\"low carb\\" people food faddists and criticizes them inpassing. my criticism of this is that he is being too generalist. There are two types of \\"carbohodrates\\"- starches and simple sugars. I am a low starch person myself, as well as low protein and low fat- making me somewhat like an arnold ehretist or a douglas graham follower or a raw vegan fruitarian. But I am not a low carber because I do simple sugars, yet I realize (or believe) heavy starch consumption can be harmful to health- especially heavy consumption of grains (see the books dangerous grains, or grain damage) <br /> <br />Besides these things the book is pretty good. He is a writer that takes you all along his mental journey- and it isn't always good to go into the mental labyrinth of other people- you might go crazy yourself. But I got things I like from it- wanting to learn as much as I can about corn and about the big organic movement. And in life it is not only diet but diet in the context of lifestyle, which matters as much for health because there are many lifestyle dissipations that can rob you of your nerve energy and vitality. So it is a good book but pollan still seems to lack certainty and belief and solid conviction about what food is good to eat and best to avoid eating- and I have met many people with such conviction backed by knowledge, where food is a real spiritual topic. I should also say that I believe in the adaptation and evolution of species to their environments but not the evolutionary \\"origin\\" of species, from non living things, or from amoebas, &c.. as believed by most others.
0743289684|5.0|I can't imagine why anyone would give this book less than 5 stars.  Each and every page was incredibly interesting and inspiring.  I hesitated to read it because I had just finished What is the What, another fabulous novel about African refugees.  I am glad I read both books.  Enjoy!
B000O1799U|4.0|For all the importance of music within African-American history, musicals used to be a whites-only genre in Hollywood.  Then came Queen Latifah's role in Chicago in 2002, followed by the hit Ray in 2005.  But whereas Latifah had only a supporting role in Chicago, and Ray was more a drama with great music, this movie is truly a musical in every sense of the word, with all the major roles played by African-Americans.  The story is of three women in Detroit who grow up as childhood friends and become international pop stars.  Along the way, they meet men, become rich, break up, and finally reunite at the end of the movie.  The casting is great, and includes both older (Eddie Murphy and Danny Glover) and younger (Jennifer Hudson and Jamie Foxx) stars.  Many of them turn in great musical performances, and my personal favorite is Eddie Murphy, who puts in one dazzling stage show after another.  The movie portrays multiple facets of the celebrity life such as betrayal, substance abuse, sexual rivalries, money-grubbing, contractual disputes, and the ever present dumbing down of content to increase sales.  The movie makes occasional references to race issues.   <br /> <br />As a musical, the music pieces ranged from good to great.  Their placement in the movie however, was not the best.  The movie broke out in music during proper music scenes, like during the scenes of performances.  But the movie also had songs during \\"non-music\\" scenes.  For example, many conversations became singing scenes.  Unfortunately, the most heartfult songs; those with the most emotion, fell into the latter category, whereas the the stage performance songs sounded like generic pop hits.  This might have been done on purpose, as a reflection of the character Curtis's belief that the music has to be superficial and shallow enough to please all crowds.  But it detracted from the movie as half the songs had little heart but too much glitz.  This, and the constant replacement of dialogue with music wasprobably why this movie did not receive the Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.  My belief is that it is a better musical than Ray (also starring Jamie Foxx), but had nowhere near the heart or emotional punch to it. <br /> <br />This DVD is fairly straightforward; movie plus extra scenes.  I just wished the DVD came with an option of playing the movie with all the extra scenes added into it.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  Just fascinating.  Even the music soundtrack is good - Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man is really kinda spooky.  But this movie is more like Helter Skelter - not scary per se, as it focuses on the investigation - it's not a horror movie. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie.
B000NA2776|5.0|This album is a WOW! Every song is great! Music with creative lyrics is a rarity...Mika is therefore a priceless gem. His talent transcends cultures & musical styles. His amazing vocal range is showcased in many songs, yes he is described as a reincarnation of Freddie Mercury;however, I feel Mika is in fact more creative.The music feeds your mind as well as your soul, even tunes like Lollipop many seem superfrivilous at first, until you listen to the lyrics. Mika blew me away from the first time I heard Relax while in Paris. The French love him, the Germans love him, and this American loves him. You won't be dissapointed with this one.
0618680004|3.0|Descartes declared \\"I think therefore I am\\". Certainly not a scientific pronouncement, but rather a simplistic rationalization. But it has withstood the test of time as a familiar and quotable phrase. And yet it makes a lot of sense if you don't trouble it with too much analysis. That's my take on Atheism, it just simply seems to be common sense whereas nothing about religion seems to make any sense at all. <br /> <br />Dawkin's book certainly preaches to the choir but if he wants to convince those with religious beliefs he needs to simplify. He seems much more concerned with verbal swordplay with various religious luminaries rather than getting his points across to the common man. These are the minds that need to be changed. <br /> <br />I also thought he spent too much time on creationism vs. evolution. That focus is not necessary to any rebuttal of religion. I did think chapters 1 through 4 dealing with all the reasons why there is no God were fairly interesting. However subsequent chapters regarding why religions exist seemed to me to entirely miss the point. <br /> <br />The bottom line on the major religions is the promise of an afterlife. Of course you can't get there without following the rules of the particular religion. But the key is the afterlife. People are alive and they don't want to die. <br /> <br />I think most folks fall into two categories. The first are those (like Dawkin's brainwashed children) who very simply accept what they are told and go through life without any inquiring mind to the contrary. The second group do have inquiring minds and tend to have an overdeveloped sense of their own importance. Because of this ego inflation it is an unbearable, indeed and unimaginable affront to think that they could ever cease to exist. Therefore life must continue. <br /> <br />If you look at Darwin it is easy to see that organisms will become extinct much more quickly if they don't reproduce than if they are slow to evolve. As such we see in life, astrong \\"life force\\". All life lives and dies but the species survives. For life other than humans this life force is coded. For humans there seems to be a choice but still we continue to procreate. But as thinking life forms we oft times are as concerned about the continued existence of our own life as much as that of our offspring. Yes \\"the children are the future\\", but I think I'll hang around as long as I can. Buy into religion and you get to hang around forever. <br /> <br />You can't make it too easy hence the vast amount of religious rules and regulations. Also (as an aside), having religion makes for good population control. If so many people were not killed in the name of religion we would likely have a population burden. Thus the big bang concept of life on earth goes something like this: obtain the necessary technology (which we have) to destroy all life on earth. Then we can have life's \\"singularity\\" and start all over again.  <br /> <br />So I think a grand majority of the world's population need very much to get to this afterlife. A few of the rest of us think we can live good lives and then pass into nonexistent oblivion without too much angst. So to me Dawkins book is much too dense and over intellectualized. When he makes his points they rather get lost when he continues to make them over and over again. Like Occam's Razor the simple solution is usually the right one. Choking a dog to death on butter is not the simplest solution.

B000OCXMAE|2.0|I do like Linkin Park, but this album is something completely different from their original stuff. It has more of a softer side to it that just doesn't seem to flow together. Where they were going with this I have no idea. Im sure there are a few people that will like it, but the majority will be very disappointed. I believe what happened here was they rushed to put an album together b/c Mike Shinoda broke off from Linkin Park to go with Fort Minor. Plus I think they tried to do something a little different here, other then their NU Metal sound the had originally. Don't get me wrong there are a couple of tracks I do enjoy, but those tracks were quite a bit like there old stuff. I suggest you listen to the cd before you buy it, cuz it just might be a waste of money.

The Beatles have been a major part of my life.  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the greatest pop album of the 20th century. It is is one of those timeless pieces of music that has really become the classical music of our time.   It is difficult to praise this album because all who know it have read what critics and fans have to say about it. All of us who appreciate it, know it is an album that can never be duplicated; even if anyone tried.   Whenever I listen to this album, it always blows me away. Everytime.   For those of you who have never heard this album, this is the one album you should listen to before you die. You have to listen to it straight through to appreciate the experience because it is indeed an experience. It is pure pop perfection! Those of you who know and love this album and are actually reading this comment know what I'm talking about.   Thank You Beatles for making my life complete.

006107327X|4.0|\\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" was one of the most revolutionary and influential cartoons ever created. This book, written by B:TAS writer/producer Paul Dini, is an essential look into the creation and phenomenon of the series. While a little slim on actual reading, what is there gives you that most coveted \\"behind-the-scenes\\" info on what it took to make \\"Batman\\". (For another perspective on the show's creation, check out the \\"Modern Masters: Bruce Timm\\" interview book.)<br /><br />The real meat of the book lies in its visuals: photos, line art, animation cels, background keys, licensed toys, etc. The layout of these materials seems a bit haphazard (for being done by the \\"design-god\\" Chip Kidd), with captions sometimes hard to correlate with their images and numerous fold-out pages (which I really don't care for). However, the sheer number and quality of images is amazing, and some of the full-page renderings of production key art is breath-taking. I question some of the image choices in the character-design section, particularly the villians. But, again, there's a lot of ground to cover here and the quality and quantity of pictures is overwhelming.<br /><br />The book was published before Batman Beyond and Justice League, so the ending comments might seem a little off. Still as a retrospective on the \\"B:TAS\\", you can't ask for much more. This would have been a 5 star review, if only there'd been a little more reading and a bit less visual confusion.<br /><br />Bottom line: Love \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\"? Buy this book.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Can't say enough about this album... I always liked Green Day, but kinda lost track of what they were doing the past few years.  Decided to check out this album after hearing all the hype about it.  The result: one of my favorite albums of all time! <br /> <br />The only thing I'd reccommend more is their \\"Bullet in a Bible\\" live album (from their American Idiot tour, which I saw in San Antonio).
0895260131|5.0|Islam is a serious political movement that is far more powerful than communism ever was or will be, and make no mistake: Islam is a political calling to all of us because the whole world is supposed to be Muslim so that we can truly enjoy this \\"religion of peace.\\"  Once we agree to follow Muhammad in the pure sense of the Koran or the mullah's interpretations, then there will be no car bombings and suicide jockeys. Yet if we insist on being followers of Christ or Buddha, we are the infidels, we are the damned, the deplorable, and it doesn't matter whom we elect as president. <br /> <br />Mr Spencer's book is well-researched and thoughtful.  Every American and European (for starters) should read this.  I wish this book could be taught in the government schools.
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|Jim Carrey wanted to prove,like Robin Williams,that he could do drama just as well as comedy. Well he did it in a big way.<br /><br />How funny is it that this film almost shows what the stars of Hollywood go through? Carrey was wonderful as the lead character Truman,showing the world he can do both comedy and drama.<br /><br />I'm still pissed off the that Oscars didn't even give him an nomination he deserved. Another great proformance in the film was by Ed Harris as the creator of the show, showcasing Truman's life 24/7.<br /><br />This is probably my all-time favourite proformances by Carrey (note I haven't seen Spotless Mind yet) and I recommand it to anyone who's a fan of the actor and of the gerne.
0316018953|2.0|A doctor smuggles a dangerous amount of radioactive cesium out of a hospital and is later found murdered. Harry Bosch gets the call but due to the circumstances of the case, the possible terrorist implications, he must also contend with the FBI and personnel from Homeland Security.  There's a sense right from the beginning that there's something wrong about the robbery, it is a red herring.  The problem is, a canny reader picks up on this right away and jumps to the answer even before Bosch does. That's a big no-no and a we expect better from a vet like Michael Connelly.  The book was originally written as a serial for the NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE and that may account for its choppiness. Some scenes feel unformed, sketched, giving them a vignette-type feel. There's a flashback to Vietnam, where Bosch was a \\"tunnel rat\\", that serves no narrative purpose.  A hurried and contrived effort from Connelly.  Let's hope he returns to form the next time around.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|When watching most films that were made prior to the social changes of the '60s and '70s, one is usually struck as much by contrasts to today's world as one is by the quality of the actual writing and acting.  Most films of the '40s and '50s, no matter how excellent, are firmly rooted in a particular time and place. <br /> <br />This film is an amazing exception.  The hair styles and cars are about the only things that are dated here.  The women are strong and independent, the dialogue is fresh, intelligent, and unsentimental, and the pace is quick.  If someone were to remake this film today, they'd be hard pressed to find elements that needed updating or improvement.   <br /> <br />This is a real gem of a movie that has stood the test of time.  5 stars!
B000P0IW6E|5.0|This has to be the Scorpions best release since Crazy World (1990).  As the previous reviewer stated, it contains a mixture of \\"old school\\" or as I would say the 80's heavy metal along with the latest refinements that the industry has to offer.  Desmond Child (Producer) and James Michael (Producer) have done an outstanding job laying the tracks down for what I think could be the comeback album of the year and put the Scorpions back where they rightfully belong; on top of the heavy metal mountain.
0385611463|5.0|This is one of the greatest books of all time.  The plot you ask -genius-and the characters- brilliant.  You need to read this novel!
B000P1KTW8|5.0|I live in Germany. The Blu-ray disc has been delayed here but I watched the DVD three times already. It is the best concert release ever and the finest music ever performed. I am a big Springsteen fan and I loved the Seeger Sessions tour (have been to 6 concerts) but even my friends who are totally not into Springsteen got goosebumps and agreed that this is the finest music ever played and the DVD offers the best sound quality we ever experienced. Everyone I know is going to buy the DVD and wants to see it over at my place again once I got hold of the blu-ray disc.  <br />The picture though is not as clear as on Barcelona or New York City and it is way too dark. Many songs are cut and the audience's singing is not well integrated in the mix. The audience at these shows sang their hearts out and you can hardly hear it on the DVD. Only on some passages...anyway the greatest performance ever has been captured on disc with phenomenal sound. Everybody who cares about music and is open minded to something totally different, something never heard before is in for a treat!
B000O178BY|5.0|....And it's the truth if you take the time to hear where Reznor's going with this one. For all those who loved the Downward Spiral days as well, the concept is very much the same as far as searching for answers and coming to conclusions. The brutal, almost Vietnam part 2 war that's killed over 3,000 U.S. soldiers,and unfortunately counting. The politcal cess pool on television, mediocrity, and the question or answer to \\"Does one vote really make a difference\\"? For those who loved Broken, you have here Survivalism, which sounds very similar to Wish. I've noticed that people on here have been assuming and drawing conclusions that Trent is repeating himself. I've got one thing to say about that, go out and buy a couple AC/DC albums and tell me how many times you hear the same riffs and chords in their songs. Trent made this album for himself and for anyone who wants to come along or continue the journey. I highly recommend in this day in age of glorified followers, if one chooses to be a follower, than I'd choose to follow Trent.
B000H5TVO4|5.0|Another great collection of 20 Roxette Hits but if you've got their other albums or even just their previous greatest hits collection [[ASIN:B000005RQV Don't Bore Us Get to the Chorus : Roxette's Greatest Hits]] there's not much new here for you.  The cover insert of Don't Bore Us comes with the lyrics as well to their songs which this album insert doesn't do.<br /><br />The only difference this album has song wise is that it includes songs from albums released after their album Crash Boom Bang which obviously since they weren't released yet didn't make it onto Don't Bore Us Get to the Chorus.  So if you haven't got (or haven't even heard of as they weren't that successfully promoted) the albums Have a Nice Day and Room Service or have bought the song A Thing About You that was the single release on another subsequent greatest hits album called Ballad Hits then this will give you the released songs from those albums.  The 20th song (Reveal) is also a new release for this album but none of these songs are as good as their classic songs.  I'd get Don't Bore Us Get to the Chorus instead as it has more of their big songs than this greatest hits album if you're only going to buy one Roxette album.  Otherwise they are a sensational band and I'd just buy all their independent albums and not worry about buying greatest hits albums at all!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I first saw this 5 disc series in England in December, 2006. It is now out here in the USA (I bought one of the first) and highly recommended. Fantastic photography. They went to great lengths to get some of these shots. If you enjoy scenery, nature, and the beauty of the world, this set of 5 DVD's are for you.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Sky Blue Sky released another album which is a left turn from the noise of YHF and AGIB. This album is more relaxed and focuses on the song. It is more introspective and personal than the last two albums.  <br /> <br />The song Sky Blue Sky is written from Tweedy's perspective when he was living in Belville Illinois (he explains this on the dvd on the extended version). <br /> <br />Please be patient with me is written for Tweedy's wife. <br /> <br />Impossible Germany and Side with the seeds has incredible guitar solos.  <br /> <br />My favorite song is Walkin. <br /> <br />This album is more consistent in overall style and content than A ghost is born. That album was all over the Map. <br /> <br />I have read reviews from Rolling Stone, This site , and others and some indicate that Sky Blue Sky is dull or retreats to their AM/Being there days. Some have said that this doesn't sound like Wilco. I say: Bull. <br /> <br />Here is my personal opinion on what the Wilco Sound is: <br /> <br />1. Each Album is distinct  <br /> <br />AM was Tweedy's answer to Son Volt's (Jay Farrars band) Trace.  <br />He wanted to let everybody know that he was still alive outside of Uncle Tupelo. This is Wilco's Plastic Ono Band album (John Lennon released POB after McCartney sued to dissolve the Beatles). <br /> <br />Being There was Wilco's way of expanding their sound and trying to rid themselves of the alternative country label (This was a double album in much the same way that the Clash released London Calling to shed themselves of the punk label). <br /> <br />Summerteeth is more popish but more melancholy lyrics. Wilco's first materpiece? <br /> <br />Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is one of the best albums released in the last 5 years. It is cohesive and noisy but underneith the noise are some great songs. A great headphone album in the tradition of Dark side of the moon(notice that I did not say Radiohead). <br /> <br />A Ghost is born is all over the map. There are beatlesque songs (I'ma wheel and Hummingbird would not sound out of place on the White Album). It has a noise college (in the spirit of Reveolution 9).  <br /> <br />I'm not sure what album Sky Blue Sky is but it is a definite Wilco masterpiece. <br /> <br />2.Wilco is a group of professionals. They know their instruments and their limitations and often hire individuals with talent to augment the group. <br /> <br />Right when they recorded AM, they hired professional sessionmen from Nashville. Lloyd Maines (father and manager of Dixie Chicks Natalie Maines) recorded several tracks for that album. They hired Jay Bennett for his expertise as an instrumentalist (until he fought with Tweedy). <br />They hired Glenn Kotche for his percussion (vital to the sound of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot) and they hired Nels Kline (a guitarist known in the jazz field). If you attend a Wilco concert, you will hear the professionalism. <br />They just don't sing the song from the album, they recreate the sound live (and often sounds better). Even when the sound is chaos, it is controlled chaos. <br /> <br />3. Loud and soft dynamics. This album is known for being softer but if you listen to side with the seeds,you are my face and impossible germany, the sound takes off and what was once a mellow song goes to parts unknown. In concert, they make best use of starting very softly and getting louder and louder. Their first three albums don't have much of this except for Misunderstood on Being there, the template for this Wilco trademark. <br /> <br />4.Clear and polished sound- Not so much with AM and being there but with Summerteeth and forward, the sound is polished. It sounds very clear and the instruments are identifiable. <br /> <br />5. Jeff Tweedy's vocals- His lyrics may change from album to album but his voice is a constant. Some may call it a whine while others may call it an honest voice clear of fakery or tricks. <br /> <br /> <br />Sky Blue Sky may take a few listens to appreciate. Take the time and donot rush to judgement. If your looking for instant hooks and enjoyment, move on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
8489367116|5.0|Yes, I know.  You picked the book up, felt the heft of it, and then put it back, didn't you?  Shame on you.  You missed a wonderful, engaging tale of a fugitive on the run in India.  The story is based on many incidents from the author's own life.  He wrote a lot of the book while still in prison.  I, too, was one of the ones who put the book down--the first time.  Then, having learned that Johnny Depp will play the lead in the movie (already in production), I wanted to read it.  I'm very, very glad I didn't miss this one.  You will be hooked from the first page, and you will hate to see it end.  You will laugh aloud, and you will cry, and if you don't already, you will learn to love the sights, the sounds, the colors, the music, and yes, the smells that are India.  Don't miss this book.  It will be a long time before another one comes along as good.
B000O174CM|4.0|Mixed reviews about this movie kept me away when the movie played in cinemas. However, this movie is better than expected. Dreamgirls is one of those movies that take two or more viewings for a person to like. This movie is based (in some ways) on the story of the Supremes and I think the mocvie does a good job in showing how the music business worked during the 60s. <br /> <br />Let's talk about the actors: Jamie Foxx was okay, but he lacked the passion to really play this role fully. Eddie Murphy was good, but it appears to me he couldn't make up his mind on which R&B legend to protray (he played about four R&B giants from the 60s). Beyonce did a decent job, but she is no actress. Beyonce has to be willing to go to a deeper place and find her emotion spot if she wants to win an Oscar. Jennifer Hudson was simply awesome. She stole the spotlight in the same fashion Jennifer Holiday stole the broadway show 20 years ago. Anika Noni Rose (IMO) is the rock of this movie. <br /> <br />Other aspect of this movie: The direction and production is excellent, but some of the scenes seem rushed. The music is awesome but most of the music do not have that 60s and 70s flair to it. The fashion (especially Beyonce clothes) are perfect.  <br /> <br />Get the movie...it will grow on you!
B000OVLBEO|1.0|I was a GR fan growing up so I went in with lowered expectations. Unfortunately even with lowered expectations this \\"movie\\" disappoints. <br /> <br />The script is pretty sub-par even with some pretty poor comic to film translations in the marketplace recently. The acting is worse with the only exception coming even close is Sam Elliot and even his performance was mediocre. <br /> <br />The effects are great and really fit well but the poor plot and acting killed what might have been a decent translation. <br /> <br />
B0007PALZ2|4.0|I really liked the movie. One of the best sci-fi movies I have seen. But I have a question. When Madeleine Stowe calls up the number that Bruce Willis is supposed to call, and she reaches a carpet cleaning company she is overjoyed thinking that the virus plague is a hoax after all. She nevertheless leaves a message in the voice mail of that number and recounts it to Bruce Willis who of course has heard it before and repeats the message verbatim even before Stowe could finish telling him. The whole point of the film is that Bruce Willis is reliving the past exactly as it had happened, with him as one of the main protagonist. So what actually happened in 1996? Did Stowe call up the carpet cleaning company? Did she leave a message? If she did and repeated that to Willis did Willis know beforehand what her message was? If he knew, then how did he know? He was NOT time travelling THEN. He was just a little boy of 8 years. And if it was not Willis (Cole) in 1996 who Stowe (Railly) met, then who was it? Because Cole was 8 years old in 1996. Can anybody throw any light?
B00005JM02|5.0|Adults usually write the reviews here so from an adult perspective, this film is not as rich as Monsters nor the Toy Story films.  Those had many in jokes and adult themed gags.  I would say that Nemo is entertaining enough to see once, maybe twice, but adults will tire of it soon. <br />Kids are another matter.  It is cute, colorful, and entertaining.  My only caution is that my son didn't like the lost mom and separation from dad plots.  Most of us grew up on Disney films which always had lost parents though.  I don't expect it to cause any major trauma, but more sensitive kids will be sad during those parts.  The humor is gentle and okay for tots.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is back and better than ever!  Old music, 70's cars, no CGI, tip-top dialogue, and Tarantino's stylized way of directing makes this film a modern masterpiece.  Also, watch Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, (the first half of Grindhouse).  I hope you enjoy Death Proof as much as I did!
B000IU3XTM|4.0|I don't envy Damien Rice having to follow his first CD and \\"Unplayed Piano.\\"  He's one of the best singer-songwriters to come out of this era--so far--and I'm looking forward to hearing a lot more from this poetic Irish bard.     But, there's still a lot to like about Damien Rice's second release.  The title track \\"Nine Crimes\\" is probably my favorite of this collection, but I wouldn't skip any either. Even \\"Coconuts\\" which I felt was kind of off the cuff, is still good music.
0975991477|5.0|I found Lipton's \\"The Biology of Belief\\" very readable, and worth reading. He is brave to say what he believes.     In chapter 1, Lipton describes \\"smart\\" cells, some perhaps living in a petri dish. Their collective properties are found smart. Rather than a blind competition, what is discovered is a novel collective behavior leading to multi-celled organisms. In Lipton's (page 40) words: \\"to survive at such high densities, the cells created structured environments. These sophisticated communities subdivided the workload with more precision and effectiveness than the ever-changing organizational charts that are a fact of life in big corporations. It proved more efficient for the community to have individual cells assigned to specialized tasks.\\" And Lipton finds favor in Lamarck's account of evolution. He (page 42) writes: \\"Not only did Lamark present his theory fifty years before Darwin, he offered a much less harsh theory of the mechanisms of evolution. Lamarck's theory suggested that evolution was based on an `instructive,' cooperative interaction among organisms and their environment that enables life forms to survive and evolve in a dynamic world.\\"    In chapter 2, Lipton present his ground breaking ideas on epigenetics, a body of study that looks at the impact the environment has on controlling our genes. Lipton observes that DNA is not self activating, a direct contradiction of the Central Dogma where information flows out of DNA but not back into DNA. Proteins are found necessary for activating DNA, but they are affected by the environment. Lipton (page 67) writes: \\"epigenetic research has established that DNA blueprints passed down through genes are not set in concrete at birth. Genes are not destiny! Environmental influences, including nutrition, stress and emotions, can modify those genes, without changing their basic blueprint. And those modifications, epigenticists have discovered, can be passed on to future generations as surely as DNA blueprints are passed on via the Double Helix.\\"    The cell membrane, with its protein channels and switches, is described in Chapter 3. Lipton (page 86) writes: \\"In contract ro conventional wisdom, genes do not control their own activity. Instead it is the membrane's effector proteins, operating in response to environmental signals picked up by the membrane's receptors, which control the `reading' of genes so that worn-out proteins can be replaced, or new proteins can be created.\\"    Lipton's chapter 4 is about quantum mechanics. Upon first reading chapter 4 I felt that Lipton's account was trendy, with his account of reality as a relational flux of change that is typical to some New Age interpretations of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, Lipton ideas about vibrations began to sink in after some reflective oscillations. Lipton (page 117) writes \\"the behavior of energy waves is important for biomedicine because vibrational frequencies can alter the physical and chemical properties of an atom as surely as physical signals like histamine and estrogen.\\" Lipton is not alone in these speculations involving quantum mechanics. I have myself used a threeness property in my book, \\"Trinity\\", to help resolve energy as a felt vibrations in the context offered by quantum mechanics; threeness permits a return to something less relational, less trendy    Chapter 5 relates directly of the impact of belief on biology. This includes a treatment of emotions, as feeling the language of cells (the subconscious). Lipton (page 133) writes, \\"the actions of the subconscious mind are reflexive in nature and are not governed by reason or thinking.\\" Lipton looks deeper into the placebo effect, and how it relates to his theory.    Chapter 6 treats growth and protection behaviors. Stress is said inhibit growth mechanisms, impacting our vitality. To much fear can be soul-sapping.     Lipton stresses the importance of conscious parenting in his last chapter. Lipton (page 178) gives this bit of advice: \\" You are personally responsible for everything in your life, once you become aware that you are personally responsible for everything in your life. One cannot be `guilty'of being a poor parent unless one is already aware of the above-described information and disregards it. Once you become aware of this information, you can begin to apply it to reprogram your behavior. \\" I won't force personal responsibility on my readers by telling you what the \\"above-described information\\" is all about, as it remains your free personal choice to read Lipton's fine book.    Disclosure: My agenda is declared in my profile.
B000M3452Y|5.0|this is way better than the first cd.  more refined vocals, more complex sounds, supremely grooving.
0689859414|5.0|I love this book! I can look through it over and over again and never get tired of the beautiful illustrations. This illustrated book ties into the Spiderwick Chronicles books. It is the actual field guide that they talk about in this series that all of the fantasy creatures are trying to get ahold of. It is not supposed to be in human hands. No telling what the humans would do if they knew their secrets!
B000JJRIN4|5.0|Gwen proves once again that she can be innovative and fun on this record. Although, the sound might not appeal to everyone, the record is a high note all the way through. It's pleasure to the ears.
0440237688|4.0|In this book the future is made up of communities with rules and governed with a watchful eye. In these communities there is no war, no crime, no heartache. There is also no love, no feelings of want, no colors. So which would be better? Our ways now or the ones in the future? Jonas feels that the old ways (our ways now) would be the best. Jonas has been given the job of Receiver. That job entails learning all the memories from the past from the old Receiver. Only one person can be this Receiver and he must hold all the memories within himself so it will not be released to the others in the community. For pure chaos could happen. Jonas goes through many painful memories of loss, war, starvation, etc but he also experiences memories of happiness, love and starts seeing the colors in everything. He believes everyone should have these memories and these feelings and sets out to make this happen.<br /><br />I do admit that the ending boggled me for a bit. I realized that I could make the ending out to be the way I felt it should. You will be able to do the same. It is a very charming book that leaves you thinking long after you have finished.
B000002UAU|5.0|Writing a review about what may very well be the most influential recording of popular music ever released is a daunting task.  To make matters worse, the fact that I am a progressive rock fan and that my perspectives on this album may not necessarily be welcome in this forum make it even moreso.  Suffice it to say that I am very interested in exploring the \\"roots\\" of English progressive rock as it existed during its heyday (1971-1976), and my search \\"tree\\" took me right to Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)...well that is after I listened to (and loved) Magical Mystery Tour (1967).  Just to make things clear, I loved the Beatles as a kid in the late 1970s and even signed this album out of the local library, although I can't say that I ever really LISTENED to their music; until now that is.<br /><br />Everything that has been said about Sgt. Pepper's and its relationship with the classic progressive rock style is true.  Many of the elements of the English progressive rock style are here including eclecticism; classical form; surrealism; great arrangements; sophisticated production; and incredible melodies/harmonies.  Although the unchecked virtuosity that characterized the music of bands like Yes, ELP, and King Crimson was not in place on Sgt. Pepper's, the seeds of progressive music had been sown.  In fact, I could go out on a limb and trace out one lineage whereby: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)>Moody Blues - Days of Future Passed (1967)>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King (1969)>Yes/Genesis/Van der Graaf Generator etc.  Of course, I might just be getting myself in trouble here.<br /><br />The lineup on this album included John Lennon (guitars, organ, piano, percussion, vocals); Paul McCartney (bass guitar, guitars, piano, mellotron, vocals); George Harrison (guitars, fuzz, mouth organ, percussion, tambourine, sitar, piano, vocals, tamboura);  Ringo Starr (drums, percussion, mouth organ, bells, piano, and vocals).  I suppose that I should add producer George Martin to the list too - the significance of his influence on this album (along with his team of engineers) can not be underestimated.<br /><br />Specifically, many of the sophisticated studio techniques used in progressive music turn up on this album including tape manipulation; tape loops; and other electronic experimental effects - nearly all of which were prepared by Martin.  In fact, it was the otherworldly sounds and studio wizardry used on Sgt. Pepper's that made musicians everywhere want to rush out and push the envelope of music even further.  Furthermore, the addition of brass, string, and woodwind sections (including a full orchestra at the end) and the rich arrangements on Sgt. Pepper's are also impressive.  This symphonic fullness was duplicated on later symphonic progressive rock albums with banks of keyboards (mostly Hammond organ, mellotron, and tons of synthesizers) in addition to guitars/bass/drums (examples: Yes - Close to the Edge (1972); Selling England by the Pound - Genesis (1973)).<br /><br />The music on Sgt. Peppers is amazing and is chock full of stunning melodies and harmonies.  There is also emotional sophistication too; for example, a track like She's Leaving Home is very sad and the plaintive vocals really convey this.  The classical influences also come to the fore on She's leaving Home and the use of an instrument like the harpsichord on a few pieces also reinforces this.  There is also a bit of humor too with McCartney's When I'm Sixty-Four, a nice track that features Paul's bouncy bass lines.  I am however, first and foremost a rock fan, so the more psychedelic rock tracks like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite, and A Day in the Life are among my favorites although George Harrison's track Within You Without You is quite nice.  Within You, Without You was heavily influenced by Indian music and features tables, sitars and the like.  When taken as a whole, the very differentpieces on the album seem to flow together as a single \\"concept\\" - of course, by restating the introductory theme at the end of the album really drives this point home.  Interestingly enough, this was apparently not the original intent of the Beatles.<br /><br />This version of the CD contains all of the lyrics and some informative liner notes although it would be nice to see this incredible album remastered.  The sound quality is OK.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent album of psychedelic rock that should be considered indispensable for any music fan, whether it is progressive or otherwise.  Very highly recommended along with my personal favorite, Magical Mystery Tour (1967).  Other psychedelic rock albums that might prove enjoyable to prog rock fans exploring the roots of English prog include two by the Moody Blues (Days of Future Passed, 1967; In Search of the Lost Chord, 1968) and Pink Floyd (Piper at the Gates of Dawn, 1967; and A Saucerful of Secrets, 1968).to flow together as a single \\"concept\\" - of course, by restating the introductory theme at the end of the album really drives this point home.

B000ION23K|5.0|After puchasing many non-starter movies for my preschooler daughter, I've learned to use my Netflix membership to bounce new movies off her oh-so-fickle taste.  \\"The Ant Bully\\" popped up in my New Releases category, so it got dropped in my queue without much thought or expectation. <br /> <br />What a complete surprise!  The child *adored* this movie, and the writing is witty enough that I can watch it repeatedly.  And by repeatedly, I mean over and over and over....  *sigh* <br /> <br />The more I watch, and so far we're up to eight times (ish), the more Bruce Campbell's character steals the movie for me.  Knowing the dialogue word-for-word hasn't diminished the humor yet, and I doubt more viewings will either. <br /> <br />I absolutely recommend this movie for children.  I didn't hear anything inappropriate from Nicholas Cage's character - he does have a very menacing ant-face once, but for the most part he's just an anxious and  neurotic ant.  Perfect casting... <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000002UA5|4.0|Released in 1969, this experimental album consisted of solo works by each member of the band along with a disc of live material.  I think that of the pre-Dark Side of the Moon albums, this may be the most difficult to listen to for most folks, although I really do like this album and appreciate the fact that the band was experimenting with different approaches to composition.  The lineup at this point included Rick Wright (organ, piano, mellotron, vocals); Roger Waters (bass, vocals); Nick Mason (drums and percussion); and David Gilmour (electric and acoustic guitars; vocals).<br /><br />The solo works are quite different from one another with Rick's moody keyboard opus demonstrating his fondness for Stockhausen and featuring some very dissonant and atonal sections.  Dave's piece was a bit more of a straightforward rock piece and very good, although he has been quoted as saying he did not like it very much.  Nick's drum piece is excellent and demonstrates just how creative a drummer he was (and still is) - for those of you that are curious, his track is not just a drum solo, but a very interesting \\"sound collage\\" with drums.  Roger's pieces range from the pastoral (Grantchester Meadows) to the downright bizarre (Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together In A Cave And Grooving With A Pict).  The latter piece is purely a sound collage, with little in the way of what one would regard as melody, harmony, etc.  Still, it is interesting nonetheless.<br /><br />The live disc is what I used to get excited about and features excellent versions of A Saucerful of Secrets and especially Careful with that Axe Eugene - the screams are positively hair-raising.  The energy of the live performances is pretty intense and the brooding and creepy mood of tunes like Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun is something that never fails to excite (or frighten depending on your perspective).<br /><br />This remastered version is pretty good and features a mini-poster along with the two CDs packaged in a green cardboard case.  The sound quality of the studio pieces is not bad, although the sound quality of the live disc is a bit grainy - very listenable though.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good album by Pink Floyd that features the group experimenting through their solo works, and demonstrating what an exciting live unit they were.  In fact, the live set is an excellent document from this early phase of Pink Floyd.  Ummagumma (which is slang for copulation I believe) is recommended along with Piper at the Gates of Dawn 1967); A Saucerful of Secrets (1968); More (1969); Atom Heart Mother (1970); Meddle (1971); Obscured by Clouds (1972); and Animals (1977).aged in a green cardboard case.

B00007KWHG|5.0|We all love this album and my daughter and her friends do to. A must for those of you who saw the stage musical.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|This was not a particularly good movie. I really had trouble believing that Terry Gilliam actually signed his name to it, he would probably have done better by letting Alan Smithee take the credit, if Mr. Smithee were still around. And I guess Matt Damon just needed the money.<br /><br />There was something resembling a plot, disjointed as it was. So it was better than \\"Van Helsing\\" which had no plot and was exclusively about the special effects. But \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" stands as yet another testament that you cannot make a good movie out of a bad one by throwing money at it in the form of an endless fusillade of special effects. Especially when the rest of the production is done on the cheap in eastern Europe using glorified extras with unpronouncable names masquerading as actors. This would be a good movie to watch after Thanksgiving dinner, because it's also a turkey and you are going to fall asleep anyway.
B000ION79Y|1.0|Well..., wished I'd checked into these reviews before I rented this flick. I'm learning. I just finished watching it (rental). It was so bad, I thought I just had to take the trouble to log onto Amazon and rate it, so that others may not make the same mistake. I read only a few previous reviews, so, sorry if redundant.  Yes the voice dubbing was so obvious and dorky (did Steven's original audio input get corrupted, lost, or what).   <br /> <br />Everything regarding the plot was so predictable, which at times I can live with, but not this one.  It was pathetic.  And whats up with with Steven.  He looks so out of shape, to the point of looking sickly overweight - very sluggish, except for later when the editors sped up or enhanced the action to gloss over what looks like a very tired and chunky Steven Seagal.  I hope he gets help with whatever illness or malady that he may have.  What a waste of precious time watching this movie.  Gave it 1 star (I'd give it a 1/2 star rating but Amazon's reveiw pull down menu didn't give that option).
0316018953|4.0|Dr. Stanley Kent is found on an overlook near Mulholland Drive with two bullet holes in the back of his head. Dr. Kent was a medical physicist with access to every hospital in the area.

Highly radioactive cesium is missing from a gynecological-cancer laboratory and Dr. Kent is responsible for taking it. What was an execution-style killing has become a matter of national security. <br /> <br />Michael Connelly is one my top 5 favorite authors. I'd rather read an average Michael Connelly then many other author's best work. I enjoyed the story, but this wasn't one of Michael's Connelly's best efforts. The problem might have been expanding a magazine series into a full-length novel. I found the references to Echo Park in the beginning of the book. Not everyone reading THE OVERLOOK read ECHO PARK, or as in my case, I didn't remember the plot of that book. Connelly has a talent for keeping the suspense level high, and I wasn't disappointed on that front. There are some nice twists and turns to keep the reader interested and the story moving forward. I felt a little frustrated at the ending since we are left-hanging as to the state of Harry's health. We'll know as soon as the next Harry Bosch book is written which I hope will be soon.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I'm also a Wilco fan.  I hopped on board when I bought \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,\\" and it became the soundtrack to a very key time in my life.  I loved the sonic difference between the songs, and although some songs took a while to grow on me, I can say I love every song on the album.  Same with \\"A Ghost Is Born.\\"  At first the noise experimentation on both albums were a little off-putting (in fact, the amount of feedback and screeching in \\"Ghost\\" was the reason that my father-in-law gave me his copy), but I soon grew to love that as part of the wonderful music.  However it was (and still is) disappointing that both albums have songs with swearing in them.  This limits the number of people I can recommend the album to.    Enter \\"Sky Blue Sky.\\"  Jeff Tweedy is back from rehab with a fresh outlook on life and music, and man, does it show.  He must be filled with newfound clarity and hope, and it spills over into the music.  Ignore those idiots over at Pitchfork (they gave it a 5.2 rating), since they wouldn't know a good album if it came up and kissed them on the mouth.  This is, in my opinion, their greatest record.  I have listened to the album from cover to cover a few times, and I enjoy every single song on the disc.  To top it off, there's nary a dirty word to be found on it.  Sonically, it's closer to \\"Summerteeth\\" than the last two studio albums.  I would like to take a moment to compliment Jeff's lead guitar work, which I have consistently underestimated.  Nels is awesome, but Jeff is pretty competent as well.    Bottom line: You need this album.  You need this album.  You need this album.

B00005JPPL|2.0|With a title like \\"Next\\" hopefully the studio is prepared for the inevitable ridicule likely to afflict their movie, unless it transcends its trite name with spectacular substance and quality. It doesn't. However, Nicolas Cage's most recent actioner does contain an ample amount of thrills and an intricate storyline that is surprisingly unpredictable for a movie whose main character (and therefore the audience) can see two minutes into the future. But if you learn anything from this movie, it's that it doesn't really matter what happens Next.<br /><br />Based on the short story The Golden Man by Philip K. Dick, Next follows the precarious life of Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage), a man both gifted and tormented by his unique ability to see a few minutes into his future. To stay off the radar of those wishing to exploit his powers, Johnson poses as a magician in Las Vegas and supplements his income with risk-free gambling. Desperate to avoid a nuclear terrorist attack on Los Angeles, FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) begins a search for the magician in order to use his intuitive prowess to discover the precise target location. Initially unwilling to help, Cris is eventually apprehended by Callie and agrees to cooperate to save the girl he loves from a horrifying fate. But even with his superhuman intuition and the aid of the FBI, will Cris be able to reach her in time? Does it even matter?<br /><br />A quick narration by Cage informs the viewer of Cris Johnson's powerful premonitions and sets strict parameters concerning his abilities. He can only see the events pertaining to his own life and then only for two minutes in advance. Then probably less than that amount of time later, they break these rules and every possible exception is made, posing the question of why guidelines were introduced at all. Even with such a premise, Next manages to keep the audience guessing - a feat more impressive than it sounds, and if you can see the ending coming then this movie was probably based off of you. But unexpected unpredictability aside, many sequences will probably remind you of effects and situations from such predecessors as Minority Report, The Matrix, and D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, and that same startling conclusion ultimately negates everything the movie worked so hard to build and cements the concept that it doesn't really matter how the movie ends, so long as it is wholly unsatisfying.<br /><br />Of the condensed cast, Cage is easily the most interesting character, but not because of his visionistic aptitude, but rather his sarcastic humor and cocky bravado. With the ability to see the future, no matter how brief, Cris is a force to be reckoned with, and many of the most entertaining sequences are such due to the displays of those powers, be it in combat or in wooing Jessica Biel. Moore is adequate as the domineering FBI agent, though her talents seem wasted after her performance in Children of Men. Biel lends her attractiveness and little else as Cage's mysteriously fated girlfriend and proves Cage moves fast with the charm - but to be fair he does only have 96 minutes to get the girl and save the world. As for the antagonists, a more stereotypically lackluster and standard group of villains one would be hard pressed to find, although the random mix of languages they speak, including French, is anything but typical from Hollywood terrorists.<br /><br />With a plot so outlandishly realized that you can't help but wonder what will happen next, Lee Tamahori's sci-fi thriller seems destined for something greater, but stumbles with a conclusion equal parts inventive, unanticipated, and unfulfilling. Bouts of clever dialogue and fun action only go so far, and while the film stretches these elements to their limits, several bland characters and an unfortunately ridiculous execution of interesting concepts produces a movie that feels more like the last thing you saw and less like the Next.<br /><br />- Joel Massie, MoviePulse.netwas probably based off of you.

055358202X|3.0|I seems the author is unable to carry the story beyond the pale shadow that is book 4. I get the impression he has no idea where the story is going. Not being a writer I may be wrong but don't most know where their story is going BEFORE they begin writing? The next installment is over a year overdue with no release date in site. I say overdue because he had repeatedly posted finishing dates on his website something he has now abandoned.  His website is now full of him whining about all the fun he's missing by having to skip conventions where he can bask in the worship of his adoring fans and the other 'projects' he's had to put aside. He refers to anyone who has complained about his inattention to the series as trolls. I have a feeling he is under pressure from the publishing company to deliver on his promises.  Mind you I liked the first 3 books but I am sorry I invested my time and money in something that is beginning to look more and more like it will never be finished.
B000J103YI|3.0|Of the 20 songs produced on this CD, I only liked 9 of them. I bought the CD because I enjoyed the music in \\"Dream Girls\\" the movie much more than the actual movie itself. Now, I think both are over-rated. For some reason, when I first previewed this disk at Barnes and Noble, I got the impression the CD was going to include a few tracks from the original Broadway version. Had it done that, it would've been a much better buy. J-Hudson does come alive in the all the songs to which she contributes. Without her amazing delivery in songs like \\"And I am Telling You I'm Not Going\\", \\"One Night Only\\", and \\"I Love You I Do\\", the CD would be less than mediocre. Beyonce puts in her two cents in the disco version of \\"One Night Only\\" and \\"Listen\\", but let's face it - the fan-fare and hoopla rightfully belong to Ms. Hudson; Knowle's trade-mark trembling vibrato pales in comparison to Hudson's powerhouse presence.    Put shortly, if you've seen the movie, you've heard this soundtrack in its entirety (unfortunately there are no other surprises). If you somehow survived Eddie's annoying vocals on \\"Cadillac\\", \\"Step into the Bad Side\\" and \\"Patience\\" and highly enjoyed the music, experiencing the soundtrack will be a worthwhile flashback. Otherwise, save yourself some cash and find a friend who already owns a copy.

B00005UKE0|5.0|I am one of those sad sacks who threw away all his vinyl albums when 8 tracks, cassettes and cd's all made those wonderful album covers and contents obsolete along with BSR turntables and diamond needles. Trouble is that now I miss those classic rock and folk treasures and wind up buying them again on CD and spreading them out into all my devices. One of these events involved All Things Must Pass, George Harrison.<br /><br />George Harrison, if you remember and are old enough to recall, was the lead Beatle when it came to such things as transcendental meditation, the Mahareeshi Mahesh Yoga, and controversal trips to India with musical input from Ravi Shankar. Not only was George darker, more psychological in his music, a bit wailing and depressing, but he may have been just as good in his own right as the Beatle hierarchy; John and Paul. This particular CD, All Things Must Pass has two entries, Beware of Darkness and Isn't it a Pity that are particularly ingeneous because they exemplify George Harrison's uncompromising ability to bring out from listeners both pathos and unmitigated pleasure st the same time. George's guitar skills I always thought were better than the other lads. When you add such jewels as Wah Wah, My Sweet Lord (Chiffons or no Chiffons?), and Apple Scruffs you wind up with a CD set that rivals the so-called perfect albums ie. Dark Side of the Moon, Rumours, Tapestry. So even if you don't usually double purchase, sometimes getting it right is better than denying yourself the pleasure of this masterpiece. The way things are today, you will be listening to this George Harrison album everywhere, as you will soon realize its significance and influence on past and present rock music.<br /><br />Jay Adler-Music Critic<br /><br />Massapequa, New York
B000O179FE|4.0|Loneliness is one of the most basic human emotions; when experiencing it, some people will reach out to others who understand that feeling. That sentiment seems to be at the heart of \\"Lost in Translation,\\" a film that straddles the line between odd love story and a look at loneliness and isolation.<br /><br />Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a middle-aged actor with a faded career. Currently he's alone in Japan, filming a commercial, and feels lonely and alienated despite the luxurious surroundings and royal treatment. He catches glimpses of a pretty young blonde, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who intrigues him.<br /><br />She is equally bored and lonely, and at loose ends since her husband is away working. The two finally meet over drinks, and begin to bond and explore the city of Tokyo. Bob is in a downtempo midlife crisis, while Charlotte is unsure what to do with her life. And they both learn that they have things to teach one another...<br /><br />A small warning: \\"Lost in Translation\\" has very little plot. And yes, it can be pretentious at times, sometimes politically incorrect. Fortunately, Sofia Coppola's second full-length film has qualities to make up for its improvised plot, with the beautiful cinematography, good direction and outstanding acting by its two main leads. It's a movie that requires patience and slow unfolding.<br /><br />Loneliness is the theme of this movie. Particularly, it's the loneliness of the soul -- Charlotte and Bob are surrounded by people, yet they feel alone. Hanging out together alleviates their loneliness for a little while, even though their problems won't go away. As a result, some parts of it can feel hollow. But at the same time, it gives the film a more realistic feeling -- often people in such situations DON'T deal with it.<br /><br />In keeping with the theme, Coppola keeps the movie slow and pensive, with plenty of beautiful cinematography and exquisite shots of Tokyo. The entire film has a slightly shadowy, glowing look. And the quiet dialogue has a witty, acerbic edge, such as when dizzy blonde Kelly announces \\"I'm under Evelyn Waugh,\\" only to have Charlotte inform her that, \\"Evelyn Waugh was a man.\\"<br /><br />Bill Murray rules this film, with his understated expressions and world-weary attitude. It's surprising that someone could act so blase, and yet be strangely charming. Scarlett Johansson proves that she is no longer just another child star, with a solid performance that stacks up well beside veteran Murray's.<br /><br />Strange, slow and pensive, this is a film that takes some getting used to; it may even take multiple viewings to fully \\"get.\\" Just soak it in, and see how you like it.glowing look.

1563894696|5.0|I must say that this is a great book. Well worth the time and money. It's also a very huge graphic novel. The biggest I have read so far. After the masterpiece known as \\"Batman; Year One\\" I had to read this so-called sequel to find out what exactly happens to our new, more darker Batman. I was not dissapointed. Although not as good as year one, which is close to impossible to surpass for a Batman novel, this book definately is a great followup. Only thing is Batman is now much more muscular. Alot more. I just wished they would explain how exactly Bruce and Selina met. Just curious. They both play huge roles in the story. Both in and out of costume. I have to admit that I thought the suspense started to slow down in the middle, until the huge twists at the end starting after Harvey got acid thrown in his face turning him into the infamous Two-Face. The art is great also. Gordon is a great character. The roller coaster relationship between the trio of Bats, Gordon and Dent in crime ridden Gotham City was written fantastically. Batman of course is the Man as always. Great Stuff. It got my 5 stars. Definately Pick it up.
0060837551|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars I would. From the first page I was drawn into the Cleary family's world...into their colorful lives and the journey through their truimph and pain that spans a lifetime. This is a superb novel that centers around Meggie Cleary, a girl only but 7 years old at the start of the saga. Born into a poor Irish family of sheep shearers in the beautiful land of New Zealand, Meggie learns quickly that she must look after herself. From the time Meggie was a small child she was wise beyond her years. Having to hold her own against a family of all boys, save her mother Fee, who is but a shell of her former self. Fee being too busy with chores and duties, had no time to give love or affection to any of her children, except Frank...because he was different, he didn't resemble the Cleary's, he didn't behave as a Cleary. Meggie's oldest brother Frank was the only one who showed little Meggie any affection and she clung to him as if he were the only person who ever really loved her.  <br /> <br />Fast forward 3 years....The Cleary's recieved a letter from their wicked, wealthy Aunt Mary Carson asking them to come to her home in Austrailia and learn how to tend her sheep and work her vast farm. Mary knew she was growing old and wanted the land and Drogedha, her home, to remain in the family once she died. So they left, with the promise of prosperity and a new future. Arriving after a trying journey by land and sea, they were met at the train station by priest Father Ralph De Bricassart, Mary's trusted confidant and friend.  <br /> <br />From the moment Father Ralph and Meggie met they were both in awe of eachother. She being only 10, he being a man of 28. They shared a spiritual bond that neither could ignore from the beginning. He thought she was the most beautiful little girl he'd ever seen. She thought he closely resembled God because of his magnificant beauty and charm. He took Meggie under his protective wing and showed her an affection she hadnever known. She looked to him as a father, he to her as a daughter, but it was much more... <br /> <br />This is a tale of forbidden love, a love that cannot be consumated or entertained, but also can't be smothered and ignored. It is a love of two souls who are so entertwined it squeezes the heart with longing and desperation. Beyond their control, they fight their feelings and sometimes succomb to them over the period of their lives. Throughout this sweeping saga through generations of Cleary's, life lessons are learned the hard way and passed down to the next generations to learn all over again.  <br /> <br />This book takes you on a long, winding road throughout time and the difficulties of the heart. It isn't just a romance, it is much more and any fan of great literature would appriciate this book. I recommend it highly.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Commenting on \\"The Queen\\" is a bit like daring to touch the Mona Lisa - there is little that might be done to improve it and much that would not.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is brilliant. She conveys a sense of that regal place, owned by  ruling monarchs, of tension between service and leadership - modernity and tradition - privacy and publicity. \\"The Queen\\" is a picture of paradox: a woman wholly-sacrificed for her people and a people willingly sacrificed for their sovereign. Mirren captures the paradoxes of the servant (whomever would be the greatest must be the servant of all) so beautifully and stoically.<br /><br />In our world, some arrive at their life's positions by talent, some by hard work, others by luck. But the Queen of England is thrust into her world and her position by divine Providence. And for us mere mortals, Mirren's performance is all that.
B000N6U0E2|1.0|I went into this movie thinking I was going to see an inspiring story of someone overcoming adversity. What it delivered was a hokey attempt to pull at the viewer's heart strings with an overly depressing and contrived set of circumstances. <br /> <br />A well made movie understands how to tease the moviegoer with waves of sadness, relief, and joy. The director threw all that out the window and leaves you depressed for 115 minutes and happy for 2 minutes. The problem is that the viewer is so inundated with the negative that we begin to resent the movie as a disingenuous attempt to appeal to our sympathies. By the time the climax, and only non-depressing moment of the movie, comes the viewer no longer cares about the outcome of the film or for the well being of the characters. <br /> <br />In addition, upon further analysis of the movie one can only come to the inescapable conclusion that Will Smith's character is a bad role model and a poor father figure. Not only do we have to watch him continually make bad life decisions, but we also have to witness him force his son from his mother, who had a steady job and residence, only to neglect him in day care and force him to sleep in homeless shelters and public toilets. In addition, all of this hardship is under the pretense of him getting a better job and a better life. However, by all definitions the job he is attempting to get is a pipe dream, akin to winning the lottery. So not only  is he gambling with his future, but more importantly, he is gambling with his son's future.  <br /> <br />In the end one can't help but to feel that he neither deserves the job nor the company of his son. And although he may now be a multi-millionaire in real life, we the viewers will always know that when push came to shove, he unfairly made his own selfish desires a priority over the well being of his son.
0316018953|2.0|Very disappointed in the latest Harry Bosch novel. No character or plot development. Actually, somewhat boring and not a lot to hold the interest of the reader..or at least this reader. I have pretty much read all of the authors novels and the Bosch series has always been one of my favorites however, this book was very shallow and not very good. Just not much to it. I got the impression that the publishing contract called for a certain number of books and this was part of the agreement.
0307346609|4.0|It's not often one can divide the world into simple categories but this, as they say, is one of those times. There are those who feel that zombies make anything better and those who just don't. I'll admit I'm in the first category. But you really don't have to be to read this amazing bit of alternate reality created by Max Brooks, the son of Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.     While you might guess from the subject matter this is horror (and there is some of that), this story-told in interviews years after the events unfolded-is really brilliantly and very seriously constructed. Brooks obviously put a lot of thought and research into this. This story is told beginning with the doctor who treated Patient Zero in rural China and takes off running in multiple directions. Israeli intelligence, Chinese navy, American army, survivalists in Canada, \\"coyotes\\" (smugglers of international refugees) and the American who made millions off of a \\"Rabies vaccine\\" are just some of the people interviewed by the unnamed protagonist. Forget all zombie flicks you've either watched or purposefully avoided. Brooks has pondered in all seriousness how the world's citizens, armies and governments would respond if indeed the dead were to come to life (a contagious virus is provided as the reason.) I especially liked the little touches of reality, like how the American soldiers nicknamed the zombies \\"Zack\\" and \\"G\\" or how one blind Japanese gardender found his connection to Shinto by fighting zombies in Hokkaido. You can take this as horror, as social commentary, as science fiction or as a speculative military history-the last element being the one I surprisingly liked the best. However you approach this book, it is as intense as it is entertaining and as intellectually stimulating as it is unexpectedly touching. How much of the zombie cannon can you say that about?
6304711905|5.0|This movie is absolutely awesome.  Sure, that sounds like a young awe struck boy in its description of the film, but that is what it reduced me to.  Some of the best one-liners of all-time, and a great chemistry between the always solid Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer.  Kilmer is at his best as the Consumption addled (read TB) Doc Holliday.  This is a novie that I have never heard a bad thing about, even though the discussions almost always involve guys.  Really a fun and well-made film.  One of the few movies that I can watch time and time again.  A 5 star classic.  Enjoy!!!
1878424114|5.0|No kidding.  Seven spiritual laws.  Understand them, understand yourself.  I have read this so many times the binding is broken.  Deepak speaks in a way that I understand what he is saying.  Maybe he'll speak to you too.
B000001EL3|5.0|As a 10-year-old boy in 1978, I discovered a cassette tape with a very interesting cover.  It was Destroyer, by Kiss.  I gave it a listen, listened again, and then could not/would not stop listening.  This for me was the beginning of truly enjoying Rock music.  From drawing pictures, to carrying the lunch box, I was one of the Kiss Army.  I recommend this CD to anyone that loves Kiss, or is just interested in what the fuss was all about.  For all the glitz, showmanship, and gimmicks... at the end of the day, it was the music that started it and the music that carried the band through.  I don't think there is a bad song in the group.  Sweet Pain and Do You Love Me have always been two of my favorite Kiss songs, yet there is something to enjoy in each of the others.  Yes, even Great Expectations, which I have to admit, I really like.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|this is easily lynch's best work to date, and to quote my friend thomas sarago \\"and this is his FIRST offering using digital?\\"...that sums it up. i can't believe lynch hit it on the head with this one. i knew as soon as i saw the opening with the record playing and the static and grainy black and white that this would be my favorite film of the year. it's beautiful, horrifying, dark, funny, scary, creepy and chilling at the same time. dern is arguably at the top of her career with this performance. lynch is as well. lots of creepy shots. lots of darkness. unreal sound design (easily the best thus far). i saw this film at the cleveland institute of art CINEMATEQUE and the director john ewing warned everyone before not to try to figure it out. i think after thinking about it parts of it make sense and ideas fall into place, but really, you'd have to watch it a few times which would not bother me at all. i can't wait to get it on dvd so i can watch it for a week straight...great work david.  <br />  <br />another plus about this release is that there are 2 discs listed!!! what can possibly be on that second disc? hopefully commentaries by lynch (this is the best part of the eraserhead dvd-lynchs 2 hours of \\"stories\\" in the extras section)
0140285601|5.0|I discovered Vonnegut in high school and fell madly in love. Besides being a wonderful writer, he's a perfect transition point for someone just beginning to tackle literary fiction, because while his style is accessible, his ideas are complex.<br /><br />I've read all of his stuff, and CAT'S CRADLE was always one of my favorites, along with BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS and MOTHER NIGHT. But this is the one I've returned to most often, probably three or four times, so the day after he died, I picked it up again as a personal farewell. Like all of his stuff, it's deeply human, mingling a sincere love for our best with a wry acknowledgment of our ever-present worst. Summarizing this book takes the joy out of it, so I'll just say that it's about a new religion, a nuclear scientist, a midget, a failed writer, and the end of the world. If you've never read Vonnegut, you could do worse than to start here.
0385340559|3.0|I'd rate it 3.5 stars, actually.<br /><br />I'm a huge Reacher fan and had the pleasure of meeting the author at a book signing last week. He gave a great talk.<br /><br />After that, I read the book in two days. As I do with all Reacher books. They're hard to put down and quick to read.<br /><br />By way of comparison, my favorite Reacher book is Persuader. There are a few Reacher books that are written in first person, Persuader being one of them, and the first-person books are the best. I wish Child would do more of those. Being inside Reacher's head is much better than not.<br /><br />Anyway, in this book, things are different. It's not the same old Reacher. He's not quite as ruthless. He's not quite as cruel. With a few exceptions, it felt like this could be any generic character. This is more like a mystery story, without a lot of emphasis on qualities unique to only Reacher.<br /><br />The math thing did feel very tacked on. We've known Reacher for 11 books now and this is the first time this is mentioned?<br /><br />Also, the part where they had to leave their hotel room to go buy a CD just to find out the tracklisting was really crazy. They had a computer with Internet access right there. You can find out the tracklisting to any CD in about 30 seconds, but no, they had to go to the store and buy the CD  just to see what songs are on it? Really contrived and just unrealistic.<br /><br />Having said all that, it's still a great book and it only suffers when compared to other Reacher books.
0316018953|3.0|The story moves way too fast and, when you feel you are starting to get into it, the book concludes.<br /><br />It is an engaging story nonetheless. All of Bosch's releases are great reads. But this one feels a bit rushed and reminds of an earlier story, which I will not mention as it would give away too much of the plot.<br /><br />For those who wait expectantly Connelly's releases, this is a bit of a disappointment. That, in my book, means that I will be hoping for Connelly to release his next one sooner, so I can go ahead and purchase it.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Loved the movie, will buy the DVD, even though this single-disc release of a three-hour feature means there will be a later \\"Collector's Edition\\" release on the horizon.  But what's with the terrible cover art?  The original poster of just the bridge, the fog and the film's title was a thing of beauty. Granted, the marketing types feel it's absolutely necessary to have the actors' faces plastered on the DVD covers.  But that image of Jake Gyllenhaal looks more like an artist's rendering of a fugitive suspect than an actual photograph of the actor (not to mention the fact that he looks more than a little cross-eyed and Neanderthal-ish).
B000MZHW1S|1.0|Blood Diamond is an excellent movie, and would give the Movie itself 41/2 stars. <br /> <br />HD-DVD is a dying format that only a FEW movie studios support. <br /> <br />Buy the HD format of the now and future BLU-RAY HD for superior picture and sound.
B0002EXH4K|3.0|Beware!  If you have the original recording of this album, do not --repeat--DO NOT get rid of it.  While it's stated on the case that it was remixed and remastered, it's become obvious to me that certain parts have been re-recorded as well.  I can't speak for the vocal or guitar parts but the drum tracks, I'm fairly certain, have all been re-recorded.  I'm a drummer with incredibly sensitive ears.  I'm also intimately familiar with Nick Menza's work on this album (great work, too) and I can say without hesitation that he's not the person who played on this remix. Whoever it was is pretty good at imitating him but not perfect.  I'm not sure why Dave would do this--maybe he wasn't able to get the sound he wanted from the original tracks. Whatever.  Nice try, Dave.  Download the extra songs off of I-tunes or something but avoid the rest of this one and find the original.
B00000AF98|4.0|This album will always be debated as to whether or not it's good or bad. First of all what bothers me is how Gene and Paul have totally written this album off when it was a big seller, had great videos for the singles, and received very good airplay. Mostly, I'm talking about the song \\"Crazy Nights.\\" It's a great song, it has cool riffs, a great chorus and it's about believing in yourself and having a good time. It's not any sillier than \\"Shout it Out Loud\\" so why don't they PLAY IT LIVE!!!??? Anyways, Almost all of Paul's songs on here are very good except for \\"When Your Walls Come Down\\" which goes nowhere. But I think that... yes, this record does have too many keyboards on it, but the guitars crunch and the drums are big and the songwriting (from Paul) is very good. \\"My Way\\" is a great song, but it does sound like it comes from a \\"Rocky\\" soundtrack. \\"Bang Bang You\\" is very cool and was even better live. Gene...well, I'll give him maybe 2 good songs and 2 real stinkers on here. \\"Thief in the Night\\" rocks hard and is a cool Gene song. \\"Hell or High Water\\" is good too. But \\"No No No\\" and \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" are pretty stinky. Overall, I just remember that Kiss did very well with this record, and for those of us that lived through it... it was the 80s and this was pretty poppy music, but I can't see how they don't recognize songs like \\"Crazy Nights\\" which stands the test of time and is a great song. It rocked harder than the record version when they played it live in 1988-90.It wasn't on Alive 3 and they don't play it today and it was one of their biggest songs from this period.
B000089RW0|5.0|this was a great movie the best ive seen ive seen it about 35 times ITS THE BEST buy it buy it!
B00003CXDG|2.0|I was watching this on TV recently after having seen it only once before when it first came out and it dawned on me that it has the same basic storyline as Hitchcock's Notorious with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman (1946). But the result is vastly different.  Notorious doesn't rely on high-tech props or unbelievable stunts - just pure good acting and suspense like only Hitchcock can do it.
1577314808|5.0|This book has been such an unbelievable gift for me. It has been a dear friend in the cave of my heart in this process of awakening. The most important book I have ever spent time with(and still do). Thank you!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The only thing between Elizabeth and Darcy is their tender egos (pride) and misconceptions of each other (prejudice). A simple story based on the timeless theme that you truly come to know yourself through the eyes of the one you were destined for. Lizzie has her eyes on everyone around her, noting their flaws, and has a very small circle of people she believes in. Through Darcy she is able to see that she doesn't know everything, that she has faults and makes mistakes, but that she is still a person of integrity and worthy of love.
B0002UMCNQ|5.0|Very good, like all the Pixar movies.  Extremely imaginative, and gives kids a different view of \\"monsters.\\"
0385333846|4.0|The author's recent death caused me to explore this remarkably well written novela, an outcry against the atrocities of human life and particularly war. The matter-of-fact, low key narration of the life of a common man, Billy Pilgrim, swept up in peresonal and societal upheavals utterly beyond his control is painted  as utterly ordinary but wholly unbelievable by Billy's claim of alien abduction in flying saucers, and the simple literary device of punctuating the frequent deaths of people associated with Billy with the phrae, \\"So it goes.\\" <br />With the advent of the current mindless brutality of crusaders and jihadists in that hot bed of stupidity, the Middle East, we can once again sigh, \\"So it goes.\\" Sadly, the immolation of the open city of Dresden without cause may well be repeated in Tehran as well as Fallujah.
1401201911|4.0|This is one of the better graphic novels I have picked up in the last few months.  I anticipated it to be good - but I never expected it to be this good.  What it's strengths were breaking away from the molds in which the DC characters are made from and recasting them in different circumstances.  The \\"humanness\\" of Superman comes through as well as his capacity to protect all mankind.   <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised to find myself rooting for Lex Luthor at the end.  Throughout the book you get a keen sense of his intellect that rarely shines when he is bent on world domination.  I believe this graphic novel gives Lex a new light in which he shines beyond capacity.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this to any Superman fan, or anyone familiar with the series.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This film was incredible!  The editing, sound and direction was powerful and explosive.  Ellen Burstyn gives the performance of her career as an aging Jewish mother and Jared Leto is her son; both fall into addictions that tear their lives apart.  This film is not for the squeamish, but those who watch it will come away from it with great respect for director Aronofsky's massive talent.  One of the best works of cinema out there, no kidding!
B00005JPFH|5.0|Spider-man 3 has it all. Action, Romance and a touch of horror. Based on my viewing of the movie i can honestly say it is the best of the three. There is a lot packed into 2 hours and 20 minutes. There re three vellians and three different stories. The movie introduces Venom and Sandman and also re-vamps the Green Goblin into his succesor The New Goblin. Peter Parker is engaged to MJ when the alien symbiot lands on earth from a meteor and bonds itself with peter to form the black spider. While this is going on, Flint Marco has escaped the police and is now immpowered with the ability to control and sustain sand particles. Furious with the recent evidence that flint killed uncle been, peter sets out on a crusade to destroy sandman. Meanwhile Eddie brock is stalking spiderman for a perfect picture to earn him the perfect job. After being exposed brock's life is destroyed and he vows to destroy peter parker. Soon after encountering sandman, spiderman fights off his symbiot realizing that its increases all his bad characteristics such as anger and hatred. After to suit is leaves parker it bonds with brock to create Venom. At the end of the movie Spider-man takes on Sandman and venom with the help of his new allie New Goblin(aka Harry osborn) and the ultimate battle comes to a climatic closs.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|I got into Black Sabbath back in the mid-80's, when I would find albums like \\"Born Again\\", \\"Paranoid\\", and \\"Mob Rules\\" in the bargain tape bin at Gemco, so I really got to hear a great sampling of music from ALL eras of Black Sabbath. And let me tell ya, I loved it all. Then \\"Seventh Star\\" came out and it was a radically new direction, but I loved it just the same. After that, I sort of forgot about Black Sabbath for a while. <br /> <br />Flash foreward to 1989, I saw a copy of \\"Headless Cross\\" and thought, \\"Wow, this looks really interesting, I wonder what it sounds like?\\". So I picked it up, and it quickly became one of my favorite albums of all time and remains so till this day. The songs were all so unbelievably great. They sounded so fresh and well crafted, and they still sound just as fresh today. With this album, Black Sabbath returned to their roots, lyrically.. there are songs about the Devil, about Kills in the spirit world, about Death Calling.. all sung to what I can only describe as very UPBEAT heavy metal, and the results are this landmark CD. From beginning to end, this CD is nothing short of BRILLIANT. Tony Iommi, and everyone else in the band were at thier peak when they made this record. It sounds like it was a hell of a lot of fun to make as it is to listen to. If you buy only ONE Tony Martin era Sabbath CD, this is it.
B000005RFQ|4.0|This is not one of my favorite Sabbath albums. Ian Gillian vocally took a no bull atittude with \\"Born Again\\" as it shows in this recording. I do like Ian Gillians amazing vocal talent with Deep Purple and of course on \\"Born Again\\" with Sabbath. Gillian does some screaming on this recording and at times I swear I'm listening to Guns and Roses Axel Rose. I guess Axel himself was influenced with \\"Born Again\\" and used Ian Gillians vocal style on his Guns and Roses recordings. At times the lyrics are hard to make out, that aside there is some good songs here. \\"Zero The Hero\\" is a classic, \\"Trashed\\", \\"The Dark\\", \\"Digital Bitch\\", \\"Born Again\\", \\"Hot Line\\" and my favorite \\"Keep It Warm\\" are really good catchy songs. Ian Gillian has stated he threw up after hearing the final cut of \\"Born Again\\" before its release in 1983. \\"Born Again\\" respectfully reached #4 on the record charts in September 1983, Sabbaths highest charting since Sabbath Bloody Sabbath in 1973. Fans and critics were expecting something more from Sabbath with \\"Born Agains\\" release in 1983. I have to say this is an odd Sabbath recording compared to Ozzy and Dio years. I do find myself listening to \\"Born Again\\" from time to time, and as odd as it is to me I enjoy it at times, even though it is different from Sabbath years 1970-1981. I give \\"Born Again\\" four stars because it has grown on me in the last 24 years and has become a somewhat of a gem over the past two and a half decades. \\"Born Again\\" is different, but can grow on you, if you give it a chance........
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Will Ferrell is Harold Crick, an auditor for the IRS whose life could hardly be more routine and mundane. As he adheres strictly to that routine he begins to hear a woman's voice. She does not tell him what to do, but rather she offers a detached, third-party narration as he goes about his day. With the help of a professor of literature, who is deemed to be more helpful than his psychiatrist, Harold is able to solve the mystery of the voice's origin. But what he finds may not be what he wants to hear.  <br /> <br />I was skeptical -- at the very least -- of Will Ferrell's involvement in this movie. While not altogether a \\"serious\\" movie, I still felt that this role might be too much for him. As it turns out, I was wrong. I was worried that he would try too hard to shun his class-clown nature to be more adaptable to a wide range of film. He was very likeable in this role, but I would not say that he was great. I just don't think the part was that strong, but he did well enough in it.  <br /> <br />Emma Thompson was excellent in her neurosis as she was deconstructed by her writer's block.  <br /> <br />Maggie Gyllenhaal has been a tough nut to crack for me. In the few performances of hers that I have seen, she has seemingly played the same character over and over. I felt she brought that same character to Stranger Than Fiction, but it just fit better here than in other movies. Because of that, or whatever else, Maggie was at her most charming in Stranger Than Fiction.  <br /> <br />With all of these performances from a cast of notable names, the highlight was Dustin Hoffman. Looking back at the film's credits I guess I can't be too surprised that Hoffman stole the show, but I guess I hadn't expected it. He was funny, intelligent, mysterious, compassionate, quirky...he was all over the place. And he was great.  <br /> <br />There was an arguably unnecessary visual effect used for most of the movie. To really hammer home how Harold Crick's mechanical and mathematical mind worked, the movie continuously featured on-screen effects to show protracted angles, measurements and percentages. The movie probably didn't need these effects, but I loved them. They were an added emphasis on the attention to detail which I appreciate so much.  <br /> <br />I am not sure if it was in any way related to my expecting so little from this movie, but I really loved Stranger Than Fiction. The story was incredibly creative and everyone who contributed, both cast and crew, made it an enjoyable movie to watch. I have already been recommending this movie to others and now I recommend it to you.  <br />
B000063V8S|5.0|Season 4 of ST:TNG blew me away.  I can think of only one episode out of the entire season that I found a bit lacking.  This show just gets better and better with each subsequent season.  The writing is top-notch, the acting keeps improving, the rapport of the crew gets perpetually stronger...and such character development!  Picard deals with the repercussions of having been one of the Borg; Troi finds out what it would be like to no longer have her empathic abilities; Dr. Crusher falls in love with an alien; LaForge BECOMES an alien; Riker almost dies while studying an alien planet; Data explores human romance and love; Wesley finally goes to Starfleet Academy; Worf loses his mate and gains a son; and Tasha Yar returns as...a Romulan??? <br /> <br />I can only hope season 5 is just as good as season 4!
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|Buddy Guy is so good at guitar shredding that it takes us aback when we hear him playing smooth, mellow, and laidback, which is what he does on \\"Bring 'Em In.\\"<br /><br />Guy does some interesting covers, and has some high-powered guest stars on this record. He covers \\"I Put A Spell On You,\\" \\"Lay Lady Lay(Guy covers Dylan?)\\" \\"Cheaper To Keep Her,\\" and \\" Do Your Thing.\\" Joining him ove various cuts are Carlos Santana, Keith Richards, and John Mayer.<br /><br />Guy's playing is a lot more subdued on this record, but it's no less compelling or thrilling. Guy always delivers the goods, and \\"Bring 'Em In\\" is no exception. This is definitely worth checking out.
B000063V8R|5.0|ST:TNG Season 3 begins with a slow burn that ends with a blazing bonfire. <br /> <br />Yesterday's Enterprise is the episode, halfway through the season, that begins the hectic race to the dramatic cliffhanger episode, The Best of Both Worlds, part I.   <br /> <br />While slow at the outset, this season gives the viewer payoff after payoff that will keep you coming back for more in season 4. <br /> <br />Plus, Dr. Crusher is back!  What more need be said?
0060853980|5.0|Laugh out loud fun and games in both heaven and hell. The battle of good and evil isn't all about the sword of truth and demon dances, there are moments of treaty and beneath that white flag both demon and angel peer bewilderdly into the fog and flummery of humanity.     Add to this the mistakes of the divine, the mix-up of the satanic, the baying hound of hell and you've got some Gaiman-y goodness and Pratchett-y prose you won't soon forget.
1594489505|5.0|With fiction I am often impatient, putting a book back after only a few pages' reading--for lack of emotional engagement.  However, I felt an  immediate connection to the characters and situations in A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS and I liked the writing style.   <br />From moment to moment, the direction of the main characters' lives is almost totally dependent not on their own choices, but on the choices of other people (often in practicing what they believe or say is commmanded in the Koran).  <br />Amidst betrayal, oppression, and cruelty, the women succeed in raising their own self-concept after it is dashed again and again. They develop and retain their own values of honesty and fairness. They reflect on the conditions, beliefs and practices which influenced their parents, some of their contemporaries, and now a new generation of children. My heart was close to tears, and I came away feeling gentler and kinder, more patient and understanding, and above all, hopeful for us all, inspired by the women's hopefulness and gathering strength. <br />Every American woman (at the very least) should read this novel, for we have much to learn from it, in head and heart, about others and about ourselves.
0767802519|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  Jean Reno is absolutely marvelous as the hit man who takes in an orphaned young girl (Natalie Portman) after a crooked DEA agent (Gary Oldman) kills off her entire family.  Reno brings depth, sensitivity and a true comedic flair to the character.  Natalie Portman is, naturally, adorable and shows true skill in the role.  And Gary Oldman?  He's just brilliant.  The best - that is the foulest, the most despicable - villain there ever was.  You've just got to see this movie![[ASIN:0767802519 The Professional]]
B000P2A256|5.0|There is nothing a band hates more than having an album that was created and produced 5 years ago be compared to their current effort.  Those comparisons, while chronologically warranted, should be done carefully and with relevance to past and present musical movements.  It is no shock to me that Maroon 5 has a new sound and they even acknowledge that much themselves.  What you hear on this new album are slick, deliberate pop recordings that were purposefully crafted for the radio.  And to their credit, they've earned the right to major production capabilities, the likes of which they most likely did not have access to the first time around.  If we can say one thing about \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\", it is masterfully written and produced, to the point where Adam Levine stated his objective to make an early Michael-Jackson-like record in terms of production.  This album is going to be absolutely huge with smash singles like the already #1 \\"Makes Me Wonder\\", and other notables \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\", \\"Back To Your Door\\", and \\"Wake Up Call\\". Almost any single on this disc could be a hit record.  That is not an easy accomplishment.  This album places the band in the top tier of the industry, along with Coldplay and U2.  It is an album that stands on its own two feet and shies away from repeating its history, a progression that alot of other bands could learn from.
B000002B5L|5.0|I've always thought the Fugees(minus Pras) was great even though their first album was solid. This follow up album destroys any memory of the first one completely. Even though Pras is the weak link of the group, he doesnt stop this album from being less of a classic. Guest apppearances like Rah Digga, The Outsidaz, Diamond D and John Forte'(somebody let me know what happened to him Peace) shine right along with the Fugees. The production for the most part was great too. Even though they caught a lot of criticism from certain up north Mcs(no names need because they're not that important)because they sold more than these bums ever will, this album is still one of the highlights of 96. Standout Tracks: HOW MANY MICS, READY OR NOT, ZEALOTS, FU-GEE-LA, FAMILY BUSINESS, KILLING ME SOFTLY(masterful rendition of the old Roberta Flack classic), THE SCORE, THE MASK, COWBOYS and MANIFEST. Filler: None. Bottom Line: Fugees' The Score is one of the best albums of 96 and is their best album ever. It still sounds great after all these years.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|I'm not a fan of the dark movies, it may create an evil effect, but also makes it hard for the viewer to enjoy all that there is to be seen.  This does live up to the Franchise history.  Good battle scenes, conflict between good and evil, and true victory to the one that out thinks or out strategizes the other.  I'm glad to see that they continue to bring the \\"technology\\" further into the future and that they allow the characters to grow and receive some \\"promotions\\" as side stories in it all.  All in all, I have to say that I wasn't really disappointed with this movie and have added it to my collection.  If you are a Star Trek fan, you should buy it.  If you like Sci-Fi movies, you should at least watch it.
1582701709|1.0|This is nothing more than a restatement of the power of positive thinking which has been around for centuries.  It made me sad to think that the general public is so uneducated that they would be impressed by this \\"new idea\\".  Maybe these basic principles of life have to be repeated from time to time. The book is a total waste of money.
1582701709|5.0|I loved this book.  It is more of a \\"how to\\" guide than just casual reading.  The teachings in this book can change your life for the better.
1400063515|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author managed to hold my attention and even if the book's main points are quickly postulated I think that the abundant anecdotes help to really grasp the main message. So read it and learn from it.    Apart from that it is really funny to see how the author falls in some traps himself (which he admits, but some  have found their way into the book). So I would like to start a little game and collect these \\"faultlines\\". My first throw: In one chapter NNT is approached by an Italian scholar who is convinced that Taleb has grown into an sceptical empiricist because he hails form the Levantine, which is supposed to be the ideal breeding ground for Talebs intellectual developement. NNT  reports that he nearly fell for it but then begged to differ: Nationalities are no good to generally predict personal pecularities. But the funny thing: He keeps on bashing the French people in the book (at least a dozen times) and contradicts the aforesaid but also confirms how easily one can fall into hardwired traps.
1594489505|1.0|The promise of exquisite language, unfailing insight, and depth of characters whom readers come to care about and claim as their own in The Kite Runner is no where to be found in Splendid Suns. It is, rather, more like many well-intentioned but failing first novels - obvious, prosaic, amateurishly predictable, and disappointing throughout.  Its structure is contrived, its editing sorely lacking, and its emotional arc sophmoric.  There are no surprises, no complexity; the storytelling is Writers' Workshop 101.  As for weaving personal stories within a political fabric of devastating reality, readers should go to  When a Crocodile Eats the Sun: A Memoir of Africa by Peter Godwin, a superb book in every way.  Mr. Hosseini can justifiably be accused of writing a followup to Kite Runner as fast and as furiously as he could - a painful waste of a talented writer's time and effort.  Let's hope his third book is a return to his more thoughtful, patient, and satisfying writing.   JK An avid reader in NYC
B000O75F7C|5.0|Fear of a Blank Planet is sure to please both old and new Porcupine Tree fans.  The writing on this album is rhythmically advanced, harmonically<br /><br />complex, and Wilson's writing just seems to get better and better despite his dark side.  The title track is very catchy, the guitar is heavy but pleasing, and Gavin Harrison's drumming is stellar.  The second track, My ashes, contains an ethereal and Floydian atmoshere with a luscious string texture.  The 3rd track, Anesthetize, is 17 minutes and 42 seconds of greatness.  Harrison's drumming is spot on, hypnotic, and beyond explanation.  Alex Lifeson from RUSH contributes to this track as well. Robert Fripp also makes a guest appearance. If you like Floyd, space rock, tool, groove, odd time signatures, sound effects, keyboard texture, and something else which is unclassifiable, Porcupine Tree is the hottest thing<br /><br />out there in 2007.
B000002UAU|5.0|Most of The Beatles records were recorded in STEREO and <br />in MONO. Sometimes, the MONO versions were much more <br />interesting that the STEREO releases. The WHITE ALBUM <br />is one and so is SPLHCB. The British MONO verision of <br />SPLHCB is incredible in that the guitars and vocals seem <br />more \\"upfront\\" and on SPLHCB (Reprise), Paul is singing <br />away at the end and it sounds great - this vocal bit IS NOT <br />on any other version of SPLHCB. I HOPE on day that APPLE <br />will release this MONO version on CD. Too bad they didn't <br />on the 40 year anniversity.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Maybe it's me, but I'm not sure exactly what happened here. There's a kid and he gets kidnapped at a carnival and then Tom Hanks gets a job at a toy factory and Mercedes Ruhl is his mom?<br /><br />If the game was unplugged how could it have worked? And how come we couldn't see Mercedes Ruhl taking a shower or maybe curling her hair in a towel?<br /><br />And Elizabeth Perkins is pretty much unlovable, but the script forces Hanks and her together. She ditches her other boyfriend at the drop of a hat, because she thinks Hanks has more corporate potential. Well, that's about as shallow as you can get, right?<br /><br />I mean I got dumped once. ONCE! And the woman who's name I won't name said to me, \\"Navy, you're too handsome and talented for me, I don't deserve someone as noble and caring and prone to wearing sequins berets like you.\\"<br /><br />And I said to her, \\"Listen, Carla Higgs who lives at 418 N. Castro St. in San Francisco, I know what you're saying. I hear it all the time. And I understand where you're coming from and just because your social security number is 452-666-6666, doesn't not definitely mean you're the child of satan. Though, it's pretty likely with your mood swings and that fine little mustache you have.\\"
B000JSI7BM|3.0|The video quality is outstanding on a 1080p plasma but don't look to hear 5.1 audio.  It may say 5.1 but all I heard was 2.0 the entire movie.  Not impressive at all.  Even outdoor scenes in busy traffic could have  been enhanced with surround sound from the rear speakers but there wasn't any.  You'd be better off upscaling the DVD version at a cheaper price.

B000OONTFU|5.0|In HD, it's one kickin' flick! Well...three kickin' flicks.<br /><br />I already have the standard def DVD version of this same set, but with a high def version available, and for only four dollars more than the HD \\"Complete Trilogy\\" at my local retailer I went ahead and got this version. I do not regret my purchase.<br /><br />\\"The Matrix\\" has been completely remastered and looks astonishing! \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" and \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" are equally as impressive in HD!<br /><br />The biggest thing of all (well, for those with full audio capabilities) is the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack...in \\"The Matrix\\" the difference is quite notable when compared to the standard def DVD set when agent Smith's face goes whizzing by...but the entire film collection is greatly enhanced by this feature.<br /><br />If you've never seen any of the Matrices, I highly recommend this set. If you already own these on DVD and a decent upconverting DVD player, then you would be missing out on the crisper, more detailed image so weigh the cost and your own needs with this additional tidbit in the equation: if you have a way to hear TrueHD (and if you are willing to shell out again) then DEFINITELY upgrade...if you're listening through TV speakers, then just upgrade if you're willing to invest in this beautifully restored and transferred picture.<br /><br />I was planning to give my DVD set to a friend since I've got the HD DVD version now, but the standard DVD's graphics printed on the DVDs as well as the packaging still makes the standard DVD set special in its own way (my friend may not be as much a fan of the series to appreciate it anyway). The only thing special about this HD DVD collection is the HD movie content (the \\"Matrix Experience\\" bonus disc is still SD) and IME features. The packaging is standard, and the discs are double sided with no graphics (if that sort of thing makes a difference to you). However, I did find the black box and labeling on \\"The Matrix Experience Two Disc Databank\\" to be a bit on the attractive side.<br /><br />This set is a must have for a true fan of, or for any science fiction fan new to the series. \\"The Complete Matrix Trilogy\\" might be a better choice for anyone who doesn't really care about all the behind-the-scenes and bonus content, or who already has the \\"Ultimate\\" standard DVDs, as you wouldn't miss out on anything new with that purchase, you would just have two sets is all.<br /><br />In addition to the HD picture detail, the TrueHD soundtrack is well worth the upgrade to or purchase of either set!de.

B00000IQV7|5.0|The movie has a great story and message - then add to that the all-around acting talent of Robin Williams and you have got a great telling of true story. It is entertaining and inspiring!<br /><br />I serve on a a board for a non-profit organization that is trying to help today's veterans with PTSD - and Patch Adams is also on that advisory board with me. He continues to care and continues to give service. The man is for real.
0743298020|5.0|This is Diane Setterfield's first novel, but it really doesn't show! The Thirteenth Tale is curious and creepy, gratifying and ghoulish, mysterious and macabre. The two heroines are equally compelling, and the revelations will continue astounding readers page after page.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This film opens the mind and heart to explore life after death and the very meaning of love. It is totally out of the box and is like nothing else that has been done about life after death. The messages are there and so is the love. This is a film that should be seen at least once - perhaps, several times. It has some worthy issues to think about and may be an enlightening resource to some people.<br /><br />Robin Williams is at his best with a great script and wonderful and inspiring filming!
0156027321|5.0|This is a vivid story of a young man's unbelievable journey. A rich parable, this haunting tale lingers and reveals things for weeks after finishing the actual book.  It is a very interesting read, peaceful yet disturbing.

That was a signature greeting and brought many a smiles and a few laughs when they were much in need. I do not know how much of this film is based on truth or real events but in any case, it is great to see this man's work honored.<br /><br />Robin Williams continues to be a comic giant! His talents are totally on display and he makes this movie worth watching!
1400032717|5.0|Really, it is a mystery, it is a novel about a hero with autism, it is a coming of age story, it does several things at once. Entertaining, empathetic and irresistible, I think even people unfamiliar with autism would enjoy this book.
B000002HD5|5.0|Everything about this album, from the painful delivery of \\"Be Sweet\\" to the funky heart of \\"Fountain and Fairfax\\" to the very catchy \\"hit\\" of this cd, \\"Debanoir\\", every song of this album is great. It's gets better with every listen, and this is my favorite cd, and my favorite band, of all time.  If only they were still together, as their live shows were always just as amazing as this cd, as \\"1965\\", as \\"Black Love\\", and as \\"Congragration\\".  I am a little in love with Greg Dulli, and although Twilight Swingers have the same swagger, I fear they could never match the ballsy bravado of this band.  They were just that good. <br /> <br />I feel everything in the songs- the pain, the addiction, the pride, and the suffering.  This album came upon me when it meant more than could ever be realized, and the longing of the words, the music, the singing and the talant, were something that I felt bones out.  I will forever worship this band, and especially this album.
1594489505|5.0|This book is a fascinating second novel, and every bit as good as The Kite Runner. Mr. Hosseini's portrayal of the characters and his incredible descriptions of Afghanistan bring new light to the country and its people at a very important time. Not only will these books bring him great success, he is also doing the rest of the world a great service by allowing readers 'into' his homeland.
0679805273|5.0|This is a great book for all high school graduates. I have been giving them for 2 years now and will continue to give them. It is very encouraging.
1593083246|5.0|This is a classic read. I am not a fan of all Jane Austen's writing, but this one is worth reading. Almost all of us know the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, but reading this book was still a pleasure. I find this book over some other Austen books a much easier read.
B00008CLOA|1.0|Disclaimer:  If rock, country, and [c]rap disappeared from the planet tomorrow, I would the happiest man on earth.  There would be some loss, but I would be willing to sacrifice it for the general uplift in musical taste.  Having said that, I do occasionally find something I like in the pop vein (Steve Winwood, for example), but I have yet to find anything that I love because I've never uncovered anything of musical substance.  This mix of Dark Side of the Moon sure ain't it.  Having recently purchased an SACD player, I thought I would revisit this so-called classic.  If nothing else, I could play it for friends.    Thirty years ago, you couldn't walk into a hi-fi store without hearing \\"thump-thump, thump-thump,\\" followed by two hundred clocks having simultaneous orgasmic releases.  All that remains on this recording, but the simple, over-electronicized music still does nothing to move me.  The sound effects are almost as annoying as those fuzzed, distorted, god-awful guitars that several generations have amazingly accepted as THE sound and will be able to point to in old age as the source of their deafness.    I'm sure just about everyone will disagree with the above opinions, but you cannot disagree with what follows.  The mix on this recording is dreadful.  Like virtually all pop recordings, the engineer forgot that rock is VOCAL music and thus typically made the vocal lines so recessed within a wall of sound as to render lyrics unintelligible.  It's as if the band were playing in your ears but the singers are 30 feet away.  Why this is standard practice in the pop field, I cannot imagine.  I also don't much like sitting in the middle of the band and wished the instruments were all placed up front.  Moreover, the sound is harsh and overbearing, and that is likely the fault of the mixing engineer, not the source material.  While I have found in playing SACDs that I want to turn the volume up (including electronic jazz), in this case I dived to turn it down.    TheDark Side of the Moon will go onto my shelf and remain there until someone begs me to play it.    P.S.  There is a reason that Amazon sells some versions for $150 and this one so cheaply.
0780622553|5.0|CGI spectacles per se have amassed a wide enough range of ambitious narratives (from SKY CAPTAIN to 300) to constitute a blue-screen \\"graphic otherworld\\" genre, and DARK CITY fits the mold quite nicely. <br /> <br />Yes, there are flashes of Fritz Lang throughout this visually satisfying cocktail of sci-fantasy & noir.  As well as resonances of Dr. Who, ZARDOZ, SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, ALTERED STATES, BRAZIL, BATMAN--MASK OF THE PHANTASM, NAKED LUNCH and a number of movie or TV projects that arose after this film's release.  MATRIX (which apparently surfaced a year later) is an obvious example, as well as eXistenZ, MEMENTO, the Robin Williams FINAL CUT, BATMAN BEGINS, CHILDREN OF MEN, DAY WATCH, and villains from an eerily similar \\"classic\\" episode on the BUFFY tv series.   <br /> <br />One pleasant feature DARK CITY shares with most of these titles is that it takes its goals seriously enough not to fog the screen with superfluous gore or profanity.  It strives to immerse its audience in the world it creates, without jarring us with indulgent excesses of a more pedestrian sort.   <br /> <br />However, I personally find Jennifer Connelly too young for the role of the heroine--more Ella Raines with Brian Donlevy than with Elija Cook, Jr.  She's too baby-faced and thin-voiced for an unironic noir prototype, though you may have a better list than I of contemporary actresses who could pull of such a part authentically.   <br /> <br />The group commentary is better than on many DVDs that feature multiple participants, mostly because it has been edited to provide content pertinent to the frame on the screen rather than mutual adoration fests and lapsed-time forgetfulness.  But a little more straightforward chronology about the evolution of the film and its life beyond scene construction (rather than a spiral of observations in keeping with the narrative's professed motif) would have been additionally illuminating.
0743289684|5.0|I read this book twice. It was an emotional trip. The second time I had to take notes. What power, depth and insight! This is a wonderful book to read and to keep in my library. This is a conscious and candid narrative of her personal history. Kudos to Ayaan, your bravery,courage and common sense are inspiring!
1594200823|5.0|I found this book to be very enlightening. I was appalled by the CAFO system, that one/two crop approach to land use, and the plight of the farmer (which one can also read about in \\"The Worst Hard Time Ever\\" by Egan), and why there is so much corn floating around in the world. I was very surprised to learn just how much corn I consume without knowing or thinking about it. I am also now looking at the pastoral scenes on organic milk cartons in a new light...    The section on PolyFace was very interesting, and even if not every farm in the country can replicate what is happening there, I hope that others take up the mission of the farm and practice sustainability in whatever way they can. I think even non-farmers can learn something about land use, eating, and the coexistence with nature from what PolyFace does.     I found the third section to be nice, but a little boring. Pollan poured so much in to the first two sections that it seemed he had less left for the last one, though I very much enjoyed the discussion on sharing the meal and hunting for mushrooms.    I recommend this book if for no other reason that it will make you a more aware and informed eater and shopper (though the book is so much more than this).
0440238609|2.0|The series is well-written, creative, with engaging characters and some good value lessons such as loyalty and courage.  However, underlying the series is a very negative slant on organized religion and a rejection of God.  I would encourage parents to read the books before allowing their children to read them so they can decide if these messages are appropriate, and can discuss them with their children.

B000GDH9J6|5.0|Yes, that's right, one of the greatest films of all time.  Haunting. Important.  It addresses so many issues of the human, animal, and natural condition that it is an endless series of questions.  But in all this, there are those who stand against the storm, and in this may lie the lesson. <br /> <br />Each of us must do what we do because it is right.  This is what I get from this great film.  You might find something else I completely missed.  I am sure, though, that you will find something important to you in this film.
B00003CXDB|5.0|The film avoids  as much as possible the sentimental side of things and concentrates on the financial depth of the business. There is a slight touch of romanticism with the cover-girl, sorry home decorator. There is a little bit more feeling with the father, maybe because the father is playing the father and the son is playing the son, though it remains essentially business, in this case union business. Then there is nothing but buying and selling, owning and dumping, saving and killing, and the  game is only pleasant if it is always both together. To kill one by saving another and to buy one in order to make the other sell and then buy him out. Even the police and justice are used that way. I expose you to the police to humiliate you and have you arrested, but then you trap me for the police with a tape-recorder and you will get a rap on the fingers from the judge while I will get to prison. When you know that that I was the one who wanted to kill a certain company that that you decided to save by having it bought by the sworn enemy of that I, you understand what inside business and inside dealing and inside embezzling and inside anything you want means. Just read or watch American Psycho, Unrated Version, and you will have the schizophrenic reading of the same situation. This film is maybe slightly too technical, but it is the way we are totally messed up in our lives by a bunch of psychopaths who have enough money to buy the federal government out of the federal reserve at Fort Knox, or vice versa, which might even be funnier. As Gekko said so simply: \\"You're not naive enough to think we are in a democracy. It's the free market.\\" And we are the bait to catch the fish or the fish caught by the hook, or even maybe nothing but the hook itself to catch the shark.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne

B00006WKY9|5.0|The album has very good tunes.The Riot of your time has a very enjoyable blend of guitar sounds. Overal it is one of my favourite Scorpions albums from their earlier years.
B000068FY1|3.0|I don't really remember how I got into this band since it is not really the type of stuff that I normally listen too, but somewhere along the line I picked up this and another one of their albums and still enjoy them quite a bit.  I guess I would categorize the Jayhawks as American roots rock.  There are elements of folk, country, and rock to be found in their material along with tight vocal harmonies the occasional blistering guitar solo.  They are not a band that blew me away upon first listen, but over time I grew to enjoy what they do.  Highlights of the disc include \\"Waiting For The Sun\\", \\"Two Angels\\", \\"Take Me With You When You Go\\", and \\"Nevada California\\".  This is not an album I pull out often, and I have to be in the right mood, but I do enjoy it when I give it an occasional listen.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I don't understand it when people say that this movie is not realistic, it never claims to be! It is a fun ride with with a great sound track and cast. I don't want this type of movie to be realistic, it would be too boring! This was the biggest hit of the year it was released for good reason......IT'S ENTERTAINING!!!!! That is what a movie should be! I watch a movie to escape and be swooped away from reality and that is what Armageddon does very well. If you can't just sit back and enjoy this movie with some popcorn and a soda than I feel sorry for you. Life is too short to not enjoy a great flick like Armageddon! I can't wait until it comes out in HD! Now go put the DVD in the player and hang on! :-)
0312995423|5.0|I loved this book.  I have read all of Dan Brown's books (DaVince Code, Angels & Demons, Deception Point) and this one held it's own.  Please don't read to much into it it is FICTION.  So please don't try to put facts and criticize the inaccuracies of secret agencies, and computer know how.  IT IS A FICTIONAL STORY!!!! <br /> <br />I loved it!!!!!!!!!!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|This series has a \\"cozy\\" feel to it. You get to know everyone, love Lorelai and Rory, and even the town. It's really good and I recommend the whole series.
B000068FUM|4.0|If I remember correctly I first came to notice the Jayhawks after hearing the single from this album, the opening track \\"Blue\\".  It is still a favorite of mine and one of the best songs this band has ever done.  Most Jayhawks fans tend to rate \\"Hollywood Town Hall\\" over this album, but for me I think I like this one a bit better.  The music is still roots rock Americana with maybe a bit more country influence this time around.   Along with \\"Blue\\" other highlights include,  \\"I'd Run Away\\", \\"Miss Williams Guitar\\", \\"Nothing Left To Borrow\\", \\"Ann Jane\\" and the album closer \\"10 Little Kids\\".  Jayhawks albums never blow me away, but I do like them for what they are.  This is another strong effort if you are a fan of this genre of American music.
B0000009SG|5.0|In a career of brilliant work, some Zappaphiles have called this album a blatant sellout.  This is preposterous.  This is not a sellout by any stretch of the imagination.  It's simply Zappa, one of the most prolific and greatest musicians ever to exist in the US or the world, reinventing himself.  There is not one song here that can be called a blatant attempt at top 40 airplay.  Every song here display Zappa's sense of humour, sense of satire, and intricate musicianship.  My favorites are I'm the Slime (which is still valid today), Caramillo Brillo, and the Zappa classic Dinah Moe-Humm.  It's taken a while for Dinah to grow on me, but it has.  Zappa once said that thanks to songs like Dinah (and Don't Eat the Yellow Snow and T***ies and Beer), he managed to get enough cash to make his orchestral work (the LSO album in particular).  So the album was a hit, but it's still Zappa.  It can't be mistaken for anyone else.  This is great stuff, yet one more great album in the Zappa universe.
0307237699|5.0|This book is simply amazing! At 17 i am already very cynical towards politics and the government, and see it as being very corrupt, mainly because its run by Republicans (and the Bush Administration). However, Barack Obama's idealistic views on how we as a nation can come together and \\"reclaim the american dream\\" has shined a light on a bad situation and brought hope to me, and i know it will do the same for you. His book isnt about trying to create an image for himself as a presidential candidate(as he now is), its about his personal views on everything from \\"how we should interpret the intent of the Founding Fathers\\" to how he feels we can bring our nation to a better place. Also he doesnt use this book to bash other politicians! (So if you want to read a book by a true and honest politician then this is for you)
0316018953|2.0|Disappointing Bosch procedural. Nice twist that I suspected was coming, but pretty boring. I think I might be done with Michael Connelly's Bosch series.
B000002KE2|4.0|This is a very consistent Black Sabbath effort, although lighter on the gloom and doom than previous efforts. It seems the band was expanding horizons,  almost like the Grand Funk hippie version of Black Sabbath.  But most of these songs still rock, not in a heavy metal sense, but just good old hard '70's rock. For example, songs such as \\"Wheels of Confusion\\" start the album off simply, but then change tempo and work themselves into a shark feeding frenzy of intertwining drums, guitar and bass. Other songs such as \\"Snowblind\\" are straight ahead classic Sabbath in it's purest form. This was the real Black Sabbath, with Ozzy up front giving the peace signs...not the comic book trash of the post Ozzy eras (save for Heaven & Hell). I'll never forget opening the record jacket to find pages of poster quality photos of the band in concert, huge crosses dangling from their necks...Bill Ward thrashing away at his drum kit so furiously that you couldn't even see his face. This is recommended listening, and a must have for any serious '70's hard rock collection.
B000NIVJEU|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie and I look forward to a sequel.  I have not read the book which seems to be where most reviewers grade this negatively as not living up to the book's true potential. <br /> <br />So, my advice is if you haven't read the book and you love sci-fi then this is a must buy for your collection, especially on Blu-ray where the HD PQ and AQ was astounding.
B00005N9CV|4.0|Like so many of the late Baby Boomers and Gen-Xers who are drawn to the standards, Canadian vocalist and keyboardist Diana Krall fell in love with the music through her father. He was an accomplished stride pianist with an encyclopedic knowledge of 1920s and '30s jazz pianists. \\"I think Dad had every recording Fats Waller ever made, and I tried to learn them all,\\" she said. Krall performed in jazz ensembles in the Vancouver area during her teen years and at seventeen won a scholarship to the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston. After a couple albums in the early 1990s, Krall hit it big with her tribute to the Nat King Cole trio, All for You (1996). <br /> <br />Like Harry Connick, Jr., Krall is a studied and accomplished musician. Unlike Connick, though, she hasn't let book learning inhibit her musical intuitions. The best quality of her albums is thematic and aural unity. Check out her version of Bonnie Raitt's \\"Love Me Like a Man\\" from her latest offering, The Girl in the Other Room (2004), a collection of mellifluous and bluesy ballads, half of which were penned by Krall and her musician husband, Elvis Costello. Her fingers really have a way with the black keys that gets under the skin of this piece. Krall realizes that what blues is all about is what's between the notes. Many have compared her playing to that of Bill Evans, but I think there's also more than a little bit of Jerry Lee Lewis going on--this lady can really rock! <br /> <br />But it's her 2001 recording of standards in a bossa nova vein, The Look of Love, that really does it for me (and about a billion other guys). The beautiful blonde's dusky vocals spread soothingly over the calming strains of a bossa nova jazz combo, backed subtly by the London Symphony Orchestra. Opening with a relaxed version of the Gershwins' \\"S'Wonderful,\\" Krall takes you on a luxurious ride in your own private club car for the better part of an hour. Sit back with this one, kick off your shoes, and enjoy a fine single-malt Scotch that's as smoky as Krall's alluring voice. She's often been compared to Miss Peggy Lee, but on this one her unembellished sensuality is more reminiscent of Julie London's, or Keely Smith's absent Louis Prima. Besides her smash-hit title track, the best cuts are \\"Love Letters\\" (made famous by Ketty Lester), a wailing \\"Cry Me a River,\\" and \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well,\\" where the halting, stiff-upper-lip quality in her voice ever-so-gently, and so poignantly, betrays the bravado claim of the title.
0440241030|4.0|I read this because it was recommended to me by Amazon after I bought a book by Michael Connelly.  This was better.  The two have very similar styles.  Both have very plot driven, very economical writing styles.  Child's is even smoother and you find yourself frequently marvelling at little gems of description of people or things that are concise and yet perfectly capture the person or object in question.  Also, Child seems to have just a little more aphoristic sort of content than Connelly. Anyway, this was a very quick read.  I think I guessed part of the main twist of the story but not all.  The story struck the right balance between the extremes of thrillers, too simple and impossibly byzantine.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This review is about the movie and not the DVD Product-<br /><br />I saw it yesterday, Im 43, last time I saw ir I was 28 and prior to that I was 12 the first time I saw it. It still holds the magic, and now I can say its a classic for all the family.<br /><br />Yes, now I see details I previously did no see. The plot is so idillic that you don't feel the nazi presence inspiring fear, the love scenes are a perfect example of puritanism and political correctness. Yet there is love and there Julie Andrews gives a performance larger than life to captivate all public.<br /><br />I do not know why in the review preface there is some critisims of the lyrics of the song \\"Sound of music\\"- those were elaborated lyrics and none of that senseless rap or overly simplistic lyrics. Sugarcoated? You bet, but just like the pinl lemonade they were sipping on the terrace, \\"its not too sweet, not too acid, its just too pink \\"<br /><br />The movie has an ending that is rather sudden, just as it starts with that glorious song it should have ended with one as well, a triumph song. I still have the same feeling I did when I was 12, what happened to them?
B00006JKON|4.0|After a few albums of album length song-suites (\\"[[ASIN:B00000AOUD Thick As A Brick]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B00008G9JM A Passion Play]]\\"), Ian Anderson decided to guide his Jethro Tull bandmates on a more light-hearted romp. The nine songs on \\"WarChild\\" never go longer than 5:30, and there was even a Top-40 novelty single with \\"Bungle In The Jungle.\\" Even with the shorter songs, the Edwardian Prog-rock that Tull was best known for was still the main focus of \\"WarChild.\\"<br /><br />Switching from sax to his well known flute, Anderson went heavily on melodic songs here. It's hard not to get snapped up in the hooks he laid bare on \\"Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of The new Day\\" or \\"SeaLion.\\" He was also at his minstrel best with \\"Ladies\\" and \\"Back Door Angels,\\" even as the harder songs took aim at politics/religion (\\"Queen and Country\\" and the title song). There is even the brief smack-down allegedly directed at LA Times critic Robert Hilburn (who once described Anderson as \\"a wild-eyed, super-charged Captain Hook gone mad\\") in \\"Solitaire.\\"<br /><br />While earlier fans derided \\"WarChild\\" when it came out, it became one of Jethro Tull's most successful US releases. It may have not held the epic sweep of \\"Thick as a Brick\\" or the mammoth riffing of \\"[[ASIN:B00000GAIW Aqualung]]\\" it still holds up to repeat listening all these years later.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|When I was a kid, I was privileged to grow up with great music always playing in the house. From my grandfather I inherited a love for classical, and for country when it was still \\"country and western.\\" From my dad, though, I inherited my appreciation for Ray Charles. <br /> <br />At the time, I was listening to a lot of soul, like Smokey Robinson and Otis Redding, and rock, like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. After hearing a record of \\"What'd I Say\\" and \\"Hit the Road Jack,\\" I asked my father what kind of music that was. \\"That's Ray Charles,\\" he told me. I told him I wanted to know what kind of music he was playing. He gave me the same answer. <br /> <br />It took me a while to understand what he was getting at. Charles's music was beyond category; it was his own invention, completely and utterly sui generis. <br /> <br />Take, for instance, his now-classic arrangement of \\"America the Beautiful.\\" My grade school music teacher actually thought I was unpatriotic because I couldn't stand the standard version of the song. But it wasn't the words I had a problem with--only the juvenile, sing-song meter: I thought the song wasn't fit to be representing my country. Years later, after I left the Army, I saw Charles on television performing \\"America the Beautiful\\" before a baseball game. Using a gospel rhythm on his piano and singing off the backbeat, he transformed it into something so magnificently inspired that he made it all his own--and one of my all-time favorites. I guess that's why he's called, not \\"a genius,\\" but \\"The Genius.\\" <br /> <br />Charles died in 2004 at the age of seventy-three. His last work, Genius Loves Company, an album of duets, was a labor of love by an incomparable artist who knew his days were numbered. It was in the tradition of other famous duet releases, beginning in 1991 with Natalie Cole's Unforgettable: With Love--the remarkable album featuring studio-engineered duets with her deceased father, Nat King Cole--and followed by star-studdedduet albums from Frank Sinatra (1993) and Tony Bennett (Playin' with My Friends, 2001). <br /> <br />Genius Loves Company opens strong, with Charles's country/blues hit from the 1960s, \\"Here We Go Again\\"--this time a collaboration with Grammy-winning newcomer Norah Jones. There's a cover with Diana Krall of Eddy Arnold's country classic \\"You Don't Know Me,\\" which Charles also recorded in 1962. On this take, the lyrics are parsed at just the right points, letting Krall's satiny vocals work off Charles's gravelly blues. For a duet with Willie Nelson on the Sinatra classic \\"It Was a Very Good Year,\\" the two old-timers barely sing, but rather narrate the lyrics, much like Jimmy Durante, or Walter Huston in his performance of \\"September Song.\\" On \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" B.B. King is along for the ride with his beloved Lucille. With King's scorching guitar work a perfect counterpoint to the staccato rhythms of Ray's chords, and Billy Preston backing up on the Hammond organ, this is the album's strongest cut. A finger-snapping rendition of \\"Fever\\" with Natalie Cole and an a cappella gospel take on \\"Crazy Love\\" with Van Morrison round out this solid effort. <br /> <br />Although Charles passed away before Genius Loves Company was released, he must have known that he was going out on top. While recording the album, he worked with director Taylor Hackford and actor Jamie Foxx on the biopic of his life story, Ray. At the 2005 Grammy awards Genius Loves Company walked off with all the important trophies, and Foxx took home the best actor Academy Award for his uncanny portrayal of the legendary musician. <br /> <br />Okay, it's a cliché, but it's still true: Ray Charles may be gone, but his music will be with us forever. <br />
B000PMGS8G|1.0|At a comic convention last year they [Sam J Jones and Melody Anderson] were talking about the commentary they recorded for the release, and instead we get this no-frills edition.   No sale.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|I must admit,  I keep waiting for Neil and gang to put out a 'Dud'....one thing for sure, this Ain't It! Since discovering Neil as a member of the Beard, I have consistently been impressed and joyed over his ongoing musical productions.....from his first two \\"Pop\\" solo releases, all the way up to this wonderful disc----'Testimony' and 'One' are two of the best CD purchases I have made in the last Decade.....and I'm just talking about the musical content----the uplifting, positive nature of Neil's voice and lyrics are simply the 'icing on the cake'. It must be noted that I, along with many other reviewers, agree that Neil is not breaking any new ground with 'Sola', he just continues to make great 'Prog' style rock/Pop music that delights the senses.....IMO, nobody writes  memorable hook-laden musical themes as well as he does....I love the way he revisits these themes throughout the songs of his albums. I won't go into the individual movements of the disc, however the 3 epic-style songs are what Neil has consistently excelled in....and 90% of it is pure Magic! The only short song on the disc, \\"Heaven in my Heart, though not a bad song by any means, simply pales next to the 'Grandness' of the longer songs. As for the musicians on 'SS', they (Mike and Randy) continue to perfect their craft with each new release.....the guest stars, most notably Paul Gilbert and long-time collaborator Chris Carmichael, really shine here too. The bottom line-----Chalk-up another Winner for Neil and the guys.....though a large task to top 'Testimony' and 'One', he has come as close as humanly possible.....I'll be waiting with anticipation for his next \\"Masterpiece\\". Enjoy this man's music while he is at a peak. <br /> <br />P.S.  If you are a Neil fan (or prog-rock fan in general) and haven't seen his 'Testimony' DVD concert, I promise you won't be dissapointed!
B000P0IW6E|5.0|...well after 3 years from their last effort, finally they did it again, this is a masterpice, for fans and not so fans, their sound is there but somehow updated! <br /> <br />this is a concept album in the sense of dealing with certain topic: Human kind, is not a concept album in the vein of telling a whole story and all songs are related one to another, this is about de decadence of the human being and why we seem to just not care about it at all. <br /> <br />Great songs, this is a must have for any hard-rock fan, the veteran rockers prove that their still are in top of the game, they still got it and remain strong. Klaus voice reached another level, a better level than in unbrekable, it is just amazing how this guy rocks! .......as another reviewer said, go and make yourself a faver, GRAB THIS ONE!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Okay, she's not quite a standards specialist, but a lot of people think Norah Jones is well on her way to setting some new standards of her own. <br /> <br />The daughter of famed Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar, Jones grew up in Dallas with her mother, and her work is firmly rooted in the dry Texas soil. The youngest in this survey (she was born in 1979), Jones burst on the scene in 2002 with this debut album of nine original songs plus a handful of country and pop standards. Renowned for her sweet and soulful set of pipes, Jones has often been compared to Billie Holiday. There's also a touch of Roberta Flack and Emmylou Harris in there. <br /> <br />Come Away with Me is an honest-to-goodness country-blues recording that you can sit back with on the front porch rocker on a brisk autumn afternoon. Sort of like an early James Taylor, Jones mixes a little bit of country, folk, and soul into a collection that's the perfect antidote to today's insincere fare. The public must have sensed the same thing, because it bought this CD in boxcar loads, and in 2003 Jones walked away with eight Grammies, including album of the year and best new artist. <br /> <br />The title track, written by Jones, is the first new song I've heard in a long time that's utterly believable. \\"Come away with me and I'll never stop loving you,\\" she begs, and it's as though she's singing it to you, personally. To Hank Williams's \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" she brings an R & B feel, petitioning in anguish to her lover man to come back, body and soul. \\"I've Got to See You Again\\" is an exquisite modern torch song in the same vein, while \\"One Flight Down\\" is an upbeat tune with chord progressions right out of Paul McCartney's Wings songs, like \\"Carry That Load.\\" She ends with Hoagy Carmichael's \\"The Nearness of You.\\" Close your eyes, let Jones's words envelope you with their soulful caress, and you'll sense that she's a lot nearer than your living room speakers.
1594489505|4.0|In his follow-up to \\"The Kite Runner,\\" Khaled Hosseini focuses this time on women's lives under the Taliban, spanning the decades from the sixties to the present.  Young Miriam, the  illegitimate daughter of a businessman and his housekeeper, grows up isolated longing to be part of her beloved father's family.  Instead, a family tragedy forces her into marriage at age fifteen to a Kabul shoemaker, Rasheed, many years her senior, who is abusive and grows more controlling with each year.  When he takes a second wife, a young beauty named Laila whose parents also died unexpectedly, the two women are first enemies, and then allies, after the birth of Laila's daughter. Despite their differences in background, the two bond against their husband, and begin to make plans to escape.  However, in order to succeed, a heart-wrenching sacrifice will have to be made. <br /> <br />The question many will be wondering is \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" as good as \\"The Kite Runner.\\" My opinion is yes, and it's an excellent book, but it's not any better than the first.  The same strengths and weaknesses are apparent.  The villains are still one-dimensional, though to be fair a wife batterer is probably as hard to find some compassion for, as the child molesting neo-Nazi in the last book. The reader is never in any doubt of what the author wants him or her to feel at a particular point. However, because the women in the story are so likeable this isn't a real problem.  In the end, good does triumph over evil, but it was like the author finally ran out of adversity to throw at the protagonists and needed a tidy way to wrap up the book.  Still it's definitely worth a read. <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002P5W|5.0|I first heard this when it was first released on vinyl in 1967 and it was at a friend's apt. We were all musicians and we took turns listening to the opening with headphones. Today we have 5.1/7.1 surround etc; it's impossible to overstate what the creative use/mix of the stereo field did. To hear instruments sounding like voices swirling to fro left to right with Jimi's voice coming out of the top of your head was a mind altering Experience;pun intended.  So let the Experience of this second effort take over and run through you through some great headphones and while defocusing use the album art as the Mandela, even with the mistakes and warts, it was intended to be. That was 40 years ago and it's as stunning a work today as it was then and it'll light your chakras up like a pinball.
B00030590I|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I wasn't sure whether or not I thought it was as good as \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", or \\"House of Flying Daggers\\". I liked it but it took time to sink in.<br /><br />By the second time I watched this I loved it. The cinematography is outstanding. The use of special effects are very good, they don't get in the way, but simply add to each scene. The music is good. And the story itself is told in an interesting way.<br /><br />There is much more, there is a metaphoric use of colors in each scene. And there are plenty of impressive things from warriors so powerful they do battle within their minds, to a wise character named Broken Sword, who fights with just that. All of them have names except the main character, Nameless. And when watching the movie you will understand why.<br /><br />If the movie has any weakness in my opinion it's that the ending with a couple of the characters is just a bit drawn out and could have been shortened and still retained the same effect.<br /><br />There is a lot more, but really everyone who likes movies should watch this and see for themself.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|What would the Christmas holiday season be like without Frank Capra's 1946 classic, It's A Wonderful Life? For millions around the world, watching this inspiring, heartwarming movie starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed is as much a part of the Christmas celebration as putting cookies and milk out for Santa Claus, caroling, drinking eggnog, or trimming the tree.     Of the hundreds of movies I've seen during the forty-one years I've lived so far, there isn't one I can think of that is so quintessentially American as It's A Wonderful Life. Part comedy, part melodrama, and part supernatural fantasy, the film recounts the life of an apparently ordinary guy, George Bailey, who keeps getting the short end of the stick when it comes to realizing his extraordinary dreams and plans for the future.    However, I've learned first-hand that professing my love for this film is sure to provoke arguments with those who accept the ethics of objectivism (the philosophy of Ayn Rand). On its face, the message of the film appears to endorse self-sacrifice for the good of others. But I disagree with that interpretation. In fact, I think that the choices made by George Bailey during his life were truly wonderful, embodying a full and proper conception of personal, long-term self-interest, but without preaching egotism.    The movie opens to the voices of George's loved ones, family and friends who are sending up prayers to God to take care of and watch out for George, who's fallen on the hardest of hard times on Christmas Eve. George's bad luck doesn't look like it's about to change when he is assigned a guardian angel (\\"second class\\") named Clarence, a benevolent bumbler who hasn't even \\"earned his wings.\\"  We then learn what has brought George Bailey to the brink of tragedy as director Capra tells the man's life story in a long flashback that makes up most of the picture.     Ever since boyhood, George Bailey has been there for others. When he was twelve, he rescued his brother, Harry, from drowning in a pond after he had crashed through the ice while sledding. Later, working as a drugstore delivery boy, he prevented his distraught, drunken boss from accidentally dispensing poison in prescription capsules.     As he grows up, George dreams of bigger things than can be found in the confines of his small town: seeing Europe, becoming a civil engineer. About to head off to tramp through Europe before going to college, he shares with his girlfriend, Mary (Donna Reed), his secret aspirations:    \\"Mary, I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day, and next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm gonna see the world! I'm gonna build things: I'm gonna build airfields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high! I'm gonna build bridges a mile long!\\"     But at every crucial turn in his life, George's grandiose dreams are thwarted by the responsibilities of everyday life. As he's about to set sail, he learns that his father had a fatal stroke. After the funeral, George stays in Bedford Falls to run the Bailey Bros. Building and Loan, the family business that his father and Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) had built up, rather than allow it to slip into the grasp of the family's avaricious nemesis, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Potter is the town's Scrooge-like magnate, a corrupt, power-lusting slumlord who owns most of the key businesses in Bedford Falls. George puts his dreams on hold while he manages the business--and while he watches his younger brother, Harry, go off to college instead.    Then, rather than jump at the opportunity to invest in the promising plastics industry, George instead goes after his real love, Mary, finally proposing to her. One of the movie's pivotal scenes occurs on the day of their marriage. Just as they are about to embark on their European honeymoon, fate again steps in: their wedding date is \\"Black Tuesday,\\" October 29, 1929--the day of the stock marketcrash. En route to the train station, George and Mary see the people of Bedford Falls running toward the building and loan. George rushes over to find that Uncle Billy has panicked and shut the doors to depositors, having disbursed all the money on hand. Worse, Mr. Potter telephones and tells George that he will \\"help\\" bail out the building and loan by offering its members fifty cents on the dollar for every share.     While everyone is losing his head, George keeps his cool, despite the throng of terrified customers demanding their money. George staves off the building and loan's collapse not by whining to the crowd to bail him out, but by appealing to their long-term self-interest: by asking them not to sell out their future to Potter.     \\"You're thinking about this place all wrong, as if I have the money back in the safe. The money's not here. Well, your money's in Joe's house, that's right next to yours. And the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Maitlin's house and a hundred others. You're lending them the money to build, and then they're going to pay it back to you as best they can....Now, listen to me, I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets a hold of this building and loan, there will never be another decent house built in this town.... Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten, have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken down shack? Here, Ed, remember last year, when things weren't going so well, you couldn't make your payments? Well, you didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would've let you keep it? Can't you understand what's happening here? Potter isn't selling, he's buying! And why? Because we're panicking and he's not.... Now, we can get through this thing all right, we've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other.\\"     I once argued with an Objectivist about that scene, maintaining that George and Mary did the right thing by using their $2,000 honeymoon nest eggto help their depositors weather the storm. But all my friend could see in that scene--indeed, in the whole movie--was altruism. \\"One of the very first lines in that movie,\\" he told me, \\"is `he never thinks of himself'!\\"    But was that true? Consider what would have happened had George and Mary gone on their honeymoon instead of bailing out their building and loan. Yes, they would have had an enjoyable, relaxing couple of months in Europe; but what would they have come home to? The business that George's father had sweat blood to create and keep afloat would have gone bankrupt. Not only would George and Mary have had no source of income, but their depositors--family, friends, loved ones--would have seen their life savings evaporate. The housing development George had built would have fallen into Potter's hands.     For George, the choice was between short-term pleasure and long-term priorities. Did he choose irrationally?  What makes It's A Wonderful Life work so well is that we get to see a different, less readily apparent kind of heroism in George Bailey. Sure, it's easy to notice and admire the swashbuckling valor of a Scarlet Pimpernel or the \\"damn the torpedoes\\" military bravery of a John Wayne. But the real world doesn't always present opportunities for obvious and flamboyant heroism. More often than not, it presents instead tough value choices that reveal an individual's true priorities--and his true character.     It's A Wonderful Life is a testament to the power of free will when the going gets tough. In every instance when George faces adversities, he could easily make the easy choice, opting for the fleeting promise of instant gratification. But instead, he consistently makes the harder decision to delay immediate pleasure in order to achieve or preserve his larger, lasting, most profound values.     Today, most people watching the scenes in the building and loan's offices probably cannot quite grasp the bold, life-changing message on the banner that hangs there: \\"Own Your Own Home.\\" But I remember as a kid talking with my father about what it was like for him growing up in a Depression-era coal mining town in West Virginia. \\"You had to have at least a fifty percent down payment to buy a home in those days,\\" he told me. \\"If you were poor, you had to rent.\\" More than any other movie I've seen, It's A Wonderful Life makes real the enormous benefits of the credit revolution, a tribute to \\"man's faith in man.\\"     To Frank Capra, it was men like George Bailey who helped lift the working class into the middle class. Capra considered this film his personal favorite, and put into it a lot of his own experiences as a first-generation immigrant from Sicily. It's A Wonderful Life is his love letter to the American Dream.     What makes the movie so credible, and Jimmy Stewart so believable as George Bailey, is that he and Capra had both faced those tough choices just months before it was shot. It's A Wonderful Life was the first movie they worked on after World War II. Shortly after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Stewart joined the U.S. Army Air Force and served as a decorated bomber pilot. Capra spent most of the war shooting the Why We Fight series of propaganda films that proved so crucial to the Allied war effort. Both men could easily have avoided service: Capra was too old when the war began, and Stewart flunked his first physical, being too thin for service. But they put aside the glamorous lifestyle and money Hollywood afforded them for the higher purpose of defending America and freedom. I only wish that such values were held in higher esteem by Americans now, in supporting the war effort against the terrorist threat. Today, we seem less eager to make the kind of hard choices that the men and women of Capra's and Stewart's generation did.    The movie's famous climax takes place on Christmas Eve. Bedford Falls awaits the return of its hometown hero--George's brother, Harry Bailey (Todd Karns). As aNavy fighter pilot, Harry saved a transport ship full of American troops by shooting down a Japanese torpedo bomber. However, a few hours before his arrival back home, the building and loan comes up short $8,000. Uncle Billy has absent-mindedly mislaid the money, and now, with the bank examiner and police breathing down his neck, the distraught George sees his entire life coming apart. After fighting Potter all his life, he's reduced to pleading before him, begging to borrow the cash to rescue the building and loan. His only collateral is $500 equity in a life insurance policy. The smirking Potter mocks him, saying, \\"Why, George Bailey, you're worth more dead than alive!\\"    George soon finds himself standing alone in the blustery snow atop a bridge, weeping in drunken desperation, thinking about jumping into the icy rapids below.     At that very moment, guardian angel Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers) leaps into the river himself, giving George the opportunity to let his inherent goodness emerge once more. George rescues Clarence, then slowly learns the incredible truth: that the old man is an angel sent to protect him.     But still believing that his life has been a failure, he informs the eccentric Clarence that he's wasting his time. \\"I wish I'd never been born,\\" George mumbles bitterly.     The words inspire Clarence to grant George his wish. In the film's closing moments, he gives the man a shocking tour of what Bedford Falls would have been like if George Bailey had never existed.     The housing subdivision that George envisioned is never built; it becomes \\"Potter's Field,\\" a graveyard for paupers. The wife of his cabbie friend, Ernie (Frank Faylen), leaves him because Ernie wasted his money paying rent for one of Potter's tenements, instead of investing in his own home. Deprived of the chance to lead a productive life with the building and loan, eccentric Uncle Billy is eventually committed to an insane asylum. George's beloved Mary remains a spinster; their children are never born. And Bedford Falls itself--a small, thriving American community right out of a Norman Rockwell illustration--deteriorates into \\"Pottersville,\\" a sleazy town full of bars, strip joints, and pawn shops.    Most devastating to George, Clarence leads him to his brother Harry's gravestone in Potter's Field.     \\"You're brother, Harry Bailey, broke through the ice, and drowned at the age of nine,\\" he informs George.   \\"That's a lie!\\" George protests. \\"Harry Bailey went to war! He got the Congressional Medal of Honor! He saved the lives of every man on that transport!\\"    \\"Every man on that transport died,\\" Clarence corrects him. \\"Harry wasn't there to save them, because you weren't there to save Harry.... You see, George, you really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?\\"   \\"You have been given a great gift,\\" Clarence adds. \\"A chance to see what the world would be like without you.\\"    As I do every Christmas, this year I'll again be watching It's A Wonderful Life with my family. I'll once more share with my loved ones Frank Capra's timeless tale of a man who always remained loyal to his highest and dearest values, and who ennobled the lives of everyone he touched through his common sense, farsighted thinking, and uncommon integrity.     To those who might dismiss George's story as not the stuff of epic heroism, I can only repeat the director's own words. Decades after It's a Wonderful Life first appeared, Frank Capra said: \\"The importance of the individual is the theme that it tells. That no man is a failure, that every man has something to do with his life. If he's born, he's born to do something.\\"    He added: \\"To some of us, all that meets the eye is larger than life, including life itself. Who can match the wonder of it?\\"
B000NA28I4|1.0|This movie was such a poor representation of the novel that Paolini should sue.  The book was not a love story.  The movie is little else.  Only the wonderful depiction of the dragon afforded this film any salvation.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I can understand letting go of the rap aspect of rap/rock, but they also seem to have left out the rock.  I think two songs seemed worthy enough to juice up enough energy to want to see live in concert, but the rest seems like songs that would put them into a zombie type zone where they stand around playin slow tempos and consistently repeating beats. Little guitar and drum work. A lot seem to sound like Chester got mixed into Mike's side project Fort Minor,...but singing instead of rapping.  Would make for a boring live concert in words of Linkin Park.  I just don't understand why they let go of maybe trying to re-invent some hard rock tunes with this whole album.  I am not a fan of slow tunes without distorted guitars and blown out acoustic drums.  I don't know what else to say.....I am lost for words.......    update 12/11/2009.... I was generally searching music and decided to go back and read reviews for this album,....and man are the one-star reviews funny. Actually hilarious and more enjoyable than the CD itself.  I am reducing this disc to one-star because I haven't listened to it since the day it came out, and I was hardheaded not believe the reviews that it sucked.  This disc should be thrown like a frisbee down the highway.

1594489505|5.0|This book is a beautifully moving story in a real place most of us will never see but about fictious people we wish we could know in this lifetime.  A Thousand Splendid Suns moved me to tears more than once and that's not an easy thing to do.  I literally had to collect myself before continuing to read and even then I read certain passages over again.  The two main characters, Mariam and Laila still haunt me and I finished the book nearly a week ago. <br /> <br />I'm sure if you're reading this review you already know what the book is about so I won't go into all that detail.  Suffice it to say, this was a wonderful story told in a way that only Khaled Hosseini could tell it.  If you want to know about life in Afghanistan from a woman's point of view read this book.  If you want a really good story to grab you and not let go even after you've turned the last page, read this book.   <br /> <br />Don't analyze it, just read it for the book it is. <br /> <br />You will not be disappointed.
B000O178BY|4.0|I was very skeptical to get this album, as many of my favorite long term bands' recent albums have really been crappy. This NIN album is great though! The songs are well thought out and have a feel that reminds me of Pretty Hate Machine, just not as hard. Many of the tracks are catchy and will stick in your head - something I've always liked about NIN.<br /><br />Pick this album up if you support groups that are inventive, and work hard for their fans. Even the packaging is cryptic, full of messages, and the disc changes after playing it... one really cool idea!<br /><br />Go Trent!
1932100660|5.0|Every American should be forced to read this book. It has been the most eye-opening experience of my life. I was already a vegetarian when I read this and considered myself to be moderately knowledgeable on nutrition, but this book contained more information than I thought was out there. After reading this book I recommended it to my father who grew up in a very old school Italian family. When he finished it he became a vegan; that is seriously how convincing it is. I can't emphasize enough, how important it is to your health to read this book!!
B000000ORX|5.0|I have had this CD for some 15 years and consider this one of my favorite CDs of all time.  Trying to find an adjective to describe this is very difficult but from the opening crickets on Night Road Home, the Aautobiographical Come in from the Cold, to the close of Two Gray Rooms this is an aural delight from start to finish. Looking at Joni Mitchells broad spectrum of work it is very difficult to identify just one as a \\"must have\\" as so much of her work has been splendid over the years but if someone were to ask \\"Night Ride Home\\" would have my vote.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|I first discovered Rush by reading reviews of other groups. I appreciate really fine musicianship and kept seeing members of this group mentioned as potential \\"yardsticks\\" for quality. I decided to try these guys out and I purchased \\"Moving Pictures\\" and I have been hooked ever since.  <br />    Snakes & Arrows which obviously was inspired by road signs as Neal Peart rode his bike along lonesome winding roads is a fine Rush album. All of the trademark sounds are present and will keep your foot tapping and your heart pounding as you will find yourself turning the volume knob up. These three gentlemen still have the gift and keep giving us good solid rock and roll.
0618680004|4.0|I had long considered myself an agnostic upon beginning my read of this book.  So Dawkins' claim that \\"permanent agnosticism in principle\\" (PAP) is nothing but cowardly startled me; it seemed like the only reasonable solution, in my view, to the lack of conclusive evidence for or against God. <br /> <br />But Dawkins advocates a different view: \\"temporary agnosticism in principle\\" (TAP), rather than permanent.  That is, agnosticism until the evidence comes in.  His emphasis on the importance of agnosticism as only temporary and dismissal of permanent agnosticism reflects one of Dawkins' overarching and most convincing points: filling in gaps in knowledge with God stifles creativity and discourages the search for truth.  He quotes St. Augustine's condemnation of the \\"disease of curiousity\\" to point out how utterly opposite the goals of religion and science really are.  Both may claim to search for the truth, but according to Dawkins, \\"one of the truly bad effects of religion is that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding.\\"  He holds that religious people should be subject to answering the same difficult questions as science-- \\"God wants us to have faith\\" or variations on that theme are not acceptable answers to confusing questions.  To do so is cowardly, and Dawkins hates a coward. <br /> <br />With his slightly bullying, sarcastic tone, Dawkins may scare away religious readers.  But for anyone trying to sort out issues of science vs. religion, evolution vs. intelligent design/creationism, or what religion is really worth and why it exists-- in other words, creative, curious, and science-minded readers-- this is a thought-provoking and incisive read.
B000ION23K|4.0|Unlike other animated movies of recent times, this one actually does have a pertinent and clear message delivered, don't bully and respect others. This is a pretty kid friendly film (ages 6-7 and up) that tells the tale of a young boy who is small for his size, and gets picked on by a neighborhood bully.  It is affecting his life and making him feel miserable. To relieve his stress, he has been taking it out on an ant colony in his front yard.  Well, one night the ant's decide to turn the tables, and he is shrunk by magic to the size of an ant, and has to live with them to earn his way back to full size.  There are several funny stops and situations along the way, with only a few crude jokes (more tasteful than many \\"childrens\\" films of lately), and minimal scary parts.  Worth renting and watching with your kids.
B000M53R26|5.0|Taylow Swift's self debuted album could not be more complete.  She shows much maturity in her lyrics and the music fits each song meticulously.  Her vocals in every song are flawless and a real treat to listen to.  I rate this as the best cd i have heard this year, hands down.
B000127LW2|4.0|I would love to buy this season and all seasons of Voyager but there is no way I'm going to shell out that much money for DVDs, especially when I can still watch the reruns of TV. Bring down the price by about half and maybe they would get more buyers.
1594489505|3.0|Kite Runner is a hard act to follow. Unlike Kite Runner, the author uses a female voice here but it does not resonate well and less convincing narration.

There is much here that could have been fantastic, but it could have been improved with editing.
B00001NTXN|4.0|The game concept is very good. In fact, I give the game concept 5 out of 5 stars. Unfortunately, the execution of the game board is a bit lacking. <br /> <br />First, the board is small. The squares are much smaller than a traditional chess game board. This, combined with the fact that the pieces are a bit wobbly, makes the game somewhat frustrating because the pieces often fall over. <br /> <br />Second, the game is designed for two or four players, but the board is really only designed for two players. The board should be symmetrical for all four players, but there is only a \\"bank\\" to hold the fences for two of the players. Even more frustrating, the board is sized symmetrically for all four players, but for two of the players, the space is just left empty. <br /> <br />If they ever come out with a larger, truly four player edition, I will get it and rate it a five.
1591840562|3.0|Not a bad book after all, however a little bit dissappointing. I thought that the book gives you some hints and direction when you are about to start a new business from zero in the idealistic and genuine American dream. The first two chapters I enjoyed a lot, however the rest were too straight forward for me related to the venture capitalist system. Maybe also becuase I am not used with this system.
B00081U6EG|4.0|If you're a David Gilmour or Pink Floyd fan, this DVD is a must have for your collection.  David Gilmour's performance of Marooned was absolutely phenomenal.   Hank Marvin's performance was amazing. <br />   <br />You will most likely find yourself pushing the skip button a number of times, however there are some spectacular performances also.   This show could have been much better if other Masters of the Strat like Eric Clapton would have attended. <br />

B000MRX6SO|5.0|I can not remember when I was last this excited about a new purchase. All of you parents/dog owners will know, how hard it can be to keep up with our little pals' messes. Our little toddler 'lives' on the floor and puts everything she can find in her mouth. So, having a tool that helps me keep the floors clean easily is key.  The Swivel Sweeper is lightweight and works on carpet, wood and tile. It's rechargable (no cords!) and swivels 360° to take corners fast. I love it!
B000002J1L|5.0|This album, along with all Peter Gabriel and early Phil Collins efforts by Genesis, stand proudly at the fore of their genre. <br />I do not worry about the slightly poorer sound quality (very improved by digital engineering now) nor by what some may describe as self indulgence by this band. <br />They have left a wonderful legacy of music that is there simply to be enjoyed, and enjoy I will!

I have always wanted to know more about addiction and understand the person behind it.  The story of this book put an end to any judgment and discrimination I may have had against people like the characters in the book.  It moved me, saddened me, broke my heart...made me happy... to know that LIFE is so much worth living and we have the power to come out of the dark as long as we CHOOSE to...
0618680004|1.0|A Review of Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion from an evolutionary point of view. <br /> <br />Odd book for an evolutionary biologist to write. For in rejecting the adaptive function of religious belief, Dawkins also rejects the rationality of adaptation, which consists in the selection of any behavior that enhances either individual or group survival. <br /> <br />The God Delusion is not remarkable for its arguments, but for the fact that these arguments are made by the man who wrote, 30 years ago, the much more entertaining The Selfish Gene. In The God Delusion, Dawkins attempts to perform the remarkable feat of distancing himself from all the implications of his earlier work, while still trying to hold on to his credentials as an evolutionist.  <br /> <br />Dawkins does state in his chapter entitled The Roots of Religion that \\"Universal features of a species demand a Darwinian explanation.\\" But then he goes on to say that \\"It is hard to believe...that health is improved by the semi-permanent state of morbid guilt suffered by a Roman Catholic possessed of normal human frailty and less than normal intelligence.\\"  <br /> <br />As an evolutionary biologist, Dawkins should be aware that guilt is an emotion that serves an adaptive purpose. As with other unpleasant emotions, such as shame and fear, it enables individuals to survive and prosper. It is an emotion that can be experienced equally intensely by a Roman Catholic of less than normal intelligence as by an Oxford don of less than ordinary imagination. Why does Dawkins ignore such a fundamental truth about the evolutionary importance of guilt?  <br /> <br />Dawkins also mentions in passing the idea of group selection, referring to David Sloan Wilson, author of [[ASIN:0226901351 Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society]], as \\"the American group-selection apostle.\\" Group selection is the idea that the behaviors of groups, like those of individuals, can be adaptive and selected for. Dawkinsstates that he is not a supporter of group selection, adding: \\"Those of us who belittle group selection admit that in principle it can happen. The question is whether it amounts to a significant force in evolution.\\" He gives no cogent reason for his rejection of the evolutionary significance group selection, but his reasons are easy enough to deduce: <br /> <br />For one thing, acceptance of group selection would give credibility to D. S. Wilson's arguments for religion as a group evolutionary strategy, which would invalidate the thesis of The God Delusion from an evolutionary point of view; for another, group selection would tend to validate the existence of race--which is denied by today's politically correct--inasmuch as it could help to explain the behavior and survival rates of various racial groups.  <br /> <br />But in any case, Dawkins cannot dismiss religion altogether, if he wants to keep any shred of his credentials as an evolutionary biologist, so he attempts to explain religion as \\"a misfiring, an unfortunate by-product of an underlying psychological propensity which in other circumstances is, or once was, useful.\\" Dawkins' theory concerns children, and their need to believe what grown-ups tell them in order to survive. He implies that this belief is transferred onto a belief in a supernatural God. Unfortunately for Dawkins, this kind of theory is more appropriate to the social sciences in general and to the Frankfurt School's The Authoritarian Personality in particular than to evolutionary biology. <br /> <br />In the section titled Faith and the Sanctity of Human life, Dawkins bemoans the anti-abortionist sentiment that is the basis of opposition to embryonic stem cell experimentation. But let us return here to the selfish gene. No matter how selfish the gene is, and no matter how intent it is on replicating itself, it doesn't have much of a chance to do so if women are destroying their unborn children. It seems to have momentarily escaped Dawkins' notice that the unborn child contains the genes.  <br /> <br />Any society that encourages abortion while disparaging motherhood is on thin evolutionary ice. Dawkins, the promoter of the selfish gene, isn't being very considerate of his discovery. He even goes so far as to put the humanness of the selfish human gene into question. \\"The humanness of an embryo's cells cannot confer upon it any absolutely discontinuous moral status. It cannot, because of our evolutionary continuity with chimpanzees and, more distantly, with every species on the planet... [T]here are no natural borderlines in evolution.\\" <br /> <br />Dawkins concludes this section with the extraordinary statement (given the arguments in his book), that \\"it is surely very odd to think that a truth about the real world can be reversed by considerations of what would be morally desirable\\"! Very odd indeed.  <br /> <br />Dawkins' \\"group-selection apostle,\\" D. S. Wilson, in his Darwin's Cathedral, does a very good job of explaining the adaptive value of religion. In his book, he makes the case for religion's causing human groups to function as adaptive units. While admitting that some religious beliefs seem irrational to the modern mind, \\"[r]ationality,\\" he points out, \\"is not the gold standard against which all other forms of thought are to be judged. Adaptation is the gold standard against which rationality must be judged.\\" I doubt that any bona-fide evolutionary biologist would take issue with this affirmation. Indeed, as Wilson notes, \\"factual realists detached from practical reality were not among our ancestors.\\" <br /> <br />Taking Calvinism as an example, Wilson writes that its \\"seemingly irrational features...seem gratifyingly functional from an evolutionary perspective. For all its otherworldliness, Calvinism caused its community of believers to behave adaptively in the real world, which is all that evolution can be expected to accomplish.\\" <br /> <br />And in a passage that Dawkins might take to heart, Wilson writes that \\"[t]hose who regard themselves as nonreligious often scorn otherworldliness as a form of mental weakness....This stance itself can be criticized for misconstruing and cheapening a set of issues that deserves our most serious attention as scientists and intellectuals.\\" <br /> <br />Ironically, Dawkins himself seems to confirm Wilson's view that seemingly rational, non-adaptive behavior leads to extinction. \\"[E]ven if it were conclusively demonstrated,\\" writes Dawkins, \\"that belief in God's existence is completely essential to human psychological and emotional well-being; even if all atheists were despairing neurotics driven to suicide by relentless cosmic angst--none of this would contribute the tiniest jot or tittle of evidence that religious belief is true.\\"  <br /> <br />The implication here, of course, is that even if a belief system that seems rational to you leads you to despair and suicide, it is still to be preferred over a belief system that might seem irrational but faith in which enables you to go on living. Scientific truth--or what passes for scientific truth in the era you live in--overrides all other concerns, even that of survival! Hardly a likely strategy for a bearer of selfish genes.  <br /> <br />The ironic thing about Dawkins' preaching is that in the end, the society that values non-adaptive rationality over adaptiveness will succumb to others that value adaptiveness over rationality. And so the atheistic society that holds as sacred what it considers to be scientific truth will eventually disappear, replaced by a society made up of those \\"dyed-in-the-wool faith-heads\\" whom Dawkins finds so repugnant.  <br /> <br />No one can be a true Darwinian and politically correct at the same time. And readers of The God Delusion cannot be faulted for wondering why they should be expected to believe in evolution and all its implications if such high-profile evolutionists like Dawkins don't even seem to believe in it themselves.

I gave it a 4 star review because it seems like it belongs together with Turn on one set plus there are no extras or lyrics on the CD for the price. Still an all-time favorite for me, o my love.
1594489505|2.0|It is hard to argue with the central premise of this book, which seems to be that it's tough to be a woman in a patriarchal society, especially one torn by war and chaos. And the history of Afghanistan is a tragic one. Agreed. <br /> <br />But after a while I got really tired of the poor pitiful and of course always virtuous heroines pitted against the cruel, brutal and always rotten villains (mostly men). Is life really that black and white? I prefer a novel with a bit more nuance and characters of both genders that are complex and well rounded. <br /> <br />I had the same problem (to a lesser extent) with the Kite Runner. The narrator was an interesting creation but his oh so good and long suffering childhood companion was about as realistic as Tiny Tim. <br /> <br />

This is the milestone conceptual baroque album of all time. It is a very sophisticated and mannered for a psychedelic rock album and a breakthrough artistically all the way around. However, it does seem that Paul and George Martin beginning take over more artistic control. That said, \\"A Day in the Life\\" is my favorite song of all time. IMO, Good Morning, good morning, Lovely Rita, Being for the Benefit... Lucy in the Sky are all great tunes. A great album...but did not stand the test of time like the White Album or Revolver or Rubber Soul. The greatest albums of all time.<br />I would like to amend this review: this is a 5 star album, and I mean album, listening to it on vinyl again after all thse years...it is mean't to be heard on vinyl. `ISM 03-08 Long live the Beatles!

No CEO, no sports great, no \\"overnight success\\" has reached the point where they are without having to push through the \\"dip.\\" The dip is where the joy and success of learning or getting started wears off and the hard work of reaching for success begins.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|I jumped on the Mayer train when Room for Squares debuted, and I actually miss the innocence and, maybe, smallness of his first major label release.  While I agree that Continuum represents an \\"all-growns up\\" Mayer, I feel like Mayer's maturity is often confused with self-assuredness bordering on arrogance.  From Heavier Things to Continnum, it feels like the air of entitlement blows from a slight breeze to an annoying wind that is comfortably absent in the first album.  From the I-haven't-really-lived-much-but-why-not-criticize-those-who-have political overtones of Waiting on the World and Belief to the too-borrowed-from-the-Shins Heart of Life, this album makes me reminisce back to the can't-do-anything-right-so-I'll-just-play-this-guitar-and-see-what-happens boy playing salt shaker chess in Room for Squares. <br /> <br />Of course, I'm really splitting hairs.  The man's monumentally talented, and the evidence is no less clear in Continuum than any of its predecessors(see star rating).  I guess I'm partly jaded by his new too-good-for-haircut haircut and the Timberlakian tabloid spreads with Jessica Simpson.  However, I do find myself humming City Love more often than Bold as Love.  I'm not sure that hum-ability is the best barometer for great music.  Then again, Camptown Races IS a classic.
1582701709|1.0|The book consists of a bunch of quotes by second-rate self-help gurus and get rich quick hucksters interspersed with dumb, poorly written text. It is designed to appeal to people's greed and laziness and tries to put the fear into gullible readers by saying you should never feel bad because bad things will happen to you: <br /> <br />p. 31: \\"When you are feeling bad you are on the frequency of drawing more bad things. The law of attraction must respond by broadcasting back to you more pictures of bad things and things that will make you feel bad.\\" <br /> <br />So what are we supposed to be one-dimensional beings that never experience the full range of human emotions, which include anger and sadness? <br /> <br />And apparently everything bad that happens to people, whether it be genocide, child molestation, or natural disasters are the victim's own fault: <br /> <br />p. 27-28: \\"Everything that surrounds you right now in your life, including the things you're complaining about, you've attracted....Often when people first hear this part of the Secret they recall events in history where masses of lives were lost, and they find it incomprehensible that so many people could have attracted themselves to the event. By the law of attraction, they had to be on the same frequency as the event....Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it through persistent thoughts.\\" <br /> <br />Are these people trying to say that a 4-year old girl who gets raped by her grandfather brought that into her life through her persistent thoughts?? C'mon! <br /> <br />I do believe that we can spiritually attune ourselves to manifest good things in our lives, but this book twists it and egregiously oversimplifies it. David Spangler's \\"Everyday Miracles: The Inner Art of Manifestation\\" is a much better book if you are interested in a thorough and thoughtful treatment of the subject.

Death is a unique, strange, but wonderful narrator, who speaks bluntly, yet often apologetically. Liesel's story is one of the most moving tales I have read in a very long time. This book affected me more deeply than any other I can remember. A must read for teens and adults of all ages.
B000000OAA|5.0|Sheer Heart Attack (1974.), Queen's third studio album<br /><br />In  the early 1970's, there were plenty of hard rock bands trying to make it big in the music world. Many of these bands were influenced by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, who were both carving out a new direction in music. One such new band in the early 1970's was the London-based British band, Queen. Queen's first two albums showed immense potential. Both albums (`Queen I' and `Queen II') showed the band could rock, however that was only half of the story. Queen's second album in particular showed a much more progressive side of the band but also began to unveil the signature `operatic' style that Queen became famous in incorporating into their music. Following a well received reception from rock fans of `Queen II' as well as extended radio play and popularity from the song `Seven Seas of Rhye', the band were indeed gaining popularity and momentum. The next challenge which faced the band would be to build on their great start and produce something even more potent with their next album effort.<br /><br />`Sheer Heart Attack' was an album that was plagued with a number of problems during its creation. The chief problem was that Queen were in fact a three piece for much of the recording process as guitarist Brian May fell ill during that time. Eventually he had to record his parts onto the music recorded by Mercury, Taylor and Deacon. However `Sheer Heart Attack' proved, just like the Who's `Who's Next' and Led Zeppelin's `Led Zeppelin II' before it, that a disrupted recording process need not prevent a classic album from being produced. `Sheer Heart Attack' is, for me Queen's finest album effort of their career. Many may disagree, often citing the groundbreaking `A  Night At The Opera' as the band's greatest work. Indeed, I will not stand in the way of this opinion, as `A Night At The Opera' is in many ways Queen's creative pinnacle. However, there is something which always caught my eye with `Sheer Heart Attack'. There is an edge to the songwriting on this album which makes much of the work extremely memorable. It is also a display of Queen hard rocking in full swing, with their operatic and quirky take thrown in. Some songs are shorter pieces and others are much more fully developed works but the course of the album weaves a very colourful tapestry of sounds which never has a dull moment. The album marks the continuation of the band working as an effective songwriting unit, with all band members contributing at least one song (John Deacon's first songwriting effort is featured on this album). The album also spawned a couple of classic Queen hits in `Killer Queen' and `Now I'm Here' as well as the brilliant `In The Lap Of The Gods' and `In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited' which acted as concert finales for the band for much of the rest of the band's live career. In many respects this album is a melting pot of some sorts for the band as it marks the junction between the band's hard rocking beginnings, with the big Led Zeppelin-esque influences, with their much more grandiose operatic sounds and textures which were seen even more increasingly on subsequent albums. The result of this transitional period...a fascinating work which for me Queen would never quite again top.<br /><br />`Brighton Rock' opens the album in an express fashion. This is an excellent hard rocker to open the album and is more than anything a great showcase for Brian May who fires out some excellent guitar work in the instrumental part of the song. `Killer Queen' is next; there is little that needs still be said about this one. It is a fantastic single and one of Queen's best - a career hallmark. Following this the album tempo changes for `Tenement Funster'. This is an excellent song written by Roger Taylor and is one of the best tracks on the album. Roger Taylor's songs, often of youth, rebellion and freedom are regularly the overlooked dimension to Queen's catalogue and this acoustic driven song is no exception. The song runs into `Flick Of The Wrist', which is an excellent hard rocker with a classic Queen chorus. One of the shorter songs on the album, `Lily Of The Valley', is led by a strong Mercury vocal coupled with weeping guitar work. Another excellent album single is next in `Now I'm Here', centered around a fantastic May guitar line; this builds into a masterfully crafted song. The first part of the fan favourite `In The Lap Of The Gods' is next. The song has all of the drama we expect from Queen in the opening before settling into a slow but unwavering groove.<br /><br />My personal favourite track is next in `Stone Cold Crazy'. This, my friends, is thrash metal before its time. For a song from 1974, `Stone Cold Crazy' is unusually heavy and fast and proved to be a highly influential song.

B00005NDEN|5.0|Sheer Heart Attack (1974.), Queen's third studio album<br /><br />In  the early 1970's, there were plenty of hard rock bands trying to make it big in the music world. Many of these bands were influenced by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, who were both carving out a new direction in music. One such new band in the early 1970's was the London-based British band, Queen. Queen's first two albums showed immense potential. Both albums (`Queen I' and `Queen II') showed the band could rock, however that was only half of the story. Queen's second album in particular showed a much more progressive side of the band but also began to unveil the signature `operatic' style that Queen became famous in incorporating into their music. Following a well received reception from rock fans of `Queen II' as well as extended radio play and popularity from the song `Seven Seas of Rhye', the band were indeed gaining popularity and momentum. The next challenge which faced the band would be to build on their great start and produce something even more potent with their next album effort.<br /><br />`Sheer Heart Attack' was an album that was plagued with a number of problems during its creation. The chief problem was that Queen were in fact a three piece for much of the recording process as guitarist Brian May fell ill during that time. Eventually he had to record his parts onto the music recorded by Mercury, Taylor and Deacon. However `Sheer Heart Attack' proved, just like the Who's `Who's Next' and Led Zeppelin's `Led Zeppelin II' before it, that a disrupted recording process need not prevent a classic album from being produced. `Sheer Heart Attack' is, for me Queen's finest album effort of their career. Many may disagree, often citing the groundbreaking `A  Night At The Opera' as the band's greatest work. Indeed, I will not stand in the way of this opinion, as `A Night At The Opera' is in many ways Queen's creative pinnacle. However, there is something which always caught my eye with `Sheer Heart Attack'. There is an edge to the songwriting on this album which makes much of the work extremely memorable. It is also a display of Queen hard rocking in full swing, with their operatic and quirky take thrown in. Some songs are shorter pieces and others are much more fully developed works but the course of the album weaves a very colourful tapestry of sounds which never has a dull moment. The album marks the continuation of the band working as an effective songwriting unit, with all band members contributing at least one song (John Deacon's first songwriting effort is featured on this album). The album also spawned a couple of classic Queen hits in `Killer Queen' and `Now I'm Here' as well as the brilliant `In The Lap Of The Gods' and `In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited' which acted as concert finales for the band for much of the rest of the band's live career. In many respects this album is a melting pot of some sorts for the band as it marks the junction between the band's hard rocking beginnings, with the big Led Zeppelin-esque influences, with their much more grandiose operatic sounds and textures which were seen even more increasingly on subsequent albums. The result of this transitional period...a fascinating work which for me Queen would never quite again top.<br /><br />`Brighton Rock' opens the album in an express fashion. This is an excellent hard rocker to open the album and is more than anything a great showcase for Brian May who fires out some excellent guitar work in the instrumental part of the song. `Killer Queen' is next; there is little that needs still be said about this one. It is a fantastic single and one of Queen's best - a career hallmark. Following this the album tempo changes for `Tenement Funster'. This is an excellent song written by Roger Taylor and is one of the best tracks on the album. Roger Taylor's songs, often of youth, rebellion and freedom are regularly the overlooked dimension to Queen's catalogue and this acoustic driven song is no exception. The song runs into `Flick Of The Wrist', which is an excellent hard rocker with a classic Queen chorus. One of the shorter songs on the album, `Lily Of The Valley', is led by a strong Mercury vocal coupled with weeping guitar work. Another excellent album single is next in `Now I'm Here', centered around a fantastic May guitar line; this builds into a masterfully crafted song. The first part of the fan favourite `In The Lap Of The Gods' is next. The song has all of the drama we expect from Queen in the opening before settling into a slow but unwavering groove.<br /><br />My personal favourite track is next in `Stone Cold Crazy'.

B000ETRCMQ|4.0|Good movie.  I liked the intelligent decision to make Felicity Huffman's Bree character have to confront another big issue- the sudden emergence of an unknown son- in addition to the huge issue of her final transformation from man to woman.  But, on top of that, I really liked that the movie gave us a lot of variety just within the personality of Bree herself.  She displayed all kinds of interests throughout the movie, including earth history (she tells her son about the dinosaurs that used to roam around in the area their car was traversing) and proper usage of the English language.  On this latter point, she was a bit annoying- with her constant correcting of her son's grammar- but that gave her character further nuance, too.<br /><br />I also liked the naturalistic feel of the movie.  It must have been tempting to include more \\"big\\" moments when it was time for a confrontation, revelation, or resolution, but the movie mostly goes for a more realistic feel, where it's clear that life goes on and there will still be positive and negative things to deal with even after a life-changing development or catharis.<br /><br />The DVD includes a nice selection of extras, including a pair of interviews where the director chats with his stars.  Though mostly containing mutual praise for everyone's efforts, the interviews contain several nuggets of insight about what the director and actors tried to accomplish.<br /><br />As I said, good movie.  Also a good DVD.
B000RIY27M|5.0|I really don't know what to write without giving something away so all I can say is this episode made me really sad.  I thought SGA storylines were strong and entertaining enough without resorting to this.  I was really looking forward to seeing the characters get fleshed out by showing them on an off-day and of course at the same time deal with the obligatory emergency.  After it happened, I kept waiting for the dream sequence or the last minute miracle. . . . . . .but it never came.
1594489505|5.0|Not too many books have brought me to tears, but this one certainly did.  This is simply one of the most heart breaking, gut wrenching and yet beautiful books I have ever read.  The characters of Mariam and Laila will stay with me for a long time. <br /> <br />Afghanistan has always been a place \\"over there\\".  This book brings it so much closer to home and the plight of the women of Afghanistan will hopefully no longer be ignored because of this brilliant book.  A five star recommendation for this one. <br />
B000002J09|5.0|I would like to start this review by stating that this is, arguably, the greatest rock album ever recorded.  I don't see how it has an overall 4.5 star rating and it's all of the idiotic 1-star reviews that bring it down.  I'm not calling it the best rock album of all time because I'm giving in to the hype about it, because I'm not. I own it and have listened through it over a hundred times so I am more than familiar with it, along with the rest of Zeppelin's music.  This is simply the most complete, diverse and distinctive album ever.  Not only are Plant, Page, Jones and Bonham gods of their instruments but they are likewise with song writing.  The songs range from funky rock and roll (Black Dog, Rock and Roll) to groovy melodies (Misty Mountain Hop) to the more melodic ballads (Battle of Evermore, Going to California) to the epic heavy hitters on the album, Stairway and When the Levee Breaks.  These four guys have mastered blues-inspired rock and roll and play it like no other.  Jimmy Page is equally masterful and brilliant with the electric and acoustic guitars and his melodies are some of the most unconventional, odd time-signatured yet captivating ever.  This is the quintissential hard rock album and it seems like all other albums should be measured up against this one.      I give every single song on this album a 10/10 with the exception of Four Sticks, which I would give a 9.5.  Albums can't really rate much higher.      These are the gods of rock and this is their masterpiece.  No person who claims to listen to rock should be without it.  Don't pay any attention to the 1-star reviews, or the 2- and 3- star reviews, for that matter.  They are ridiculous and written solely out of rebellion.  Let them listen to their Fallout Boys and Nirvanas and Panic at the Discos.  This is real music.        I am someone who usually does not give in to fads and trends just for the sake of doing it, but Led Zeppelin IV is a trend that I can't help but follow. It's simply thebest..
1592289444|5.0|This is one of the most riviting books I've ever read. It's so rare to read about true courage and selfless patriotism, but you'll find this in Rawicz's remarkable journey with fellow escapees through the Gobi Desert and over the mighty Himalayas. Rawicz true account exposes the brutality of Communist tactics and after reading it with my daughter's middle school class, one child asked: \\"How come we always hear about Hitler, but never about Stalin?\\" Good question! The west seems to have a blind eye (and even a \\"love affair\\") when it comes to Stalin, Castro, and other \\"red fascists\\" of the \\"left/socialist leaning\\" persuasion. It sounds trite, but this book \\"pulls no punches\\", and is impossible to put down.
B000003TA4|1.0|You know, for as much hype as Nirvana gets, they really did write some mediocre music.  They get remembered as \\"legends\\" for inventing trash called grunge and simply because Cobain killed himself like the martyr that he thought he was.  I am not reviewing \\"Nevermind\\" specifically but I am moreover reviewing all of Nirvana's music, since this album is no less and no more garbage than the other 2 albums.    This music completely lacks in depth, substance and any musical talent.  The musicianship is extremely mediocre and childish and the songwriting is certainly no better.  Isn't it wonderful that this kind of music burst onto the scene in the early 90's and displaced classic rock?     Drop this music (not just Nevermind) but all of Nirvana and enlighten yourself with real music like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Yes and Queen.  Cheers
B00006GFAB|5.0|I generally try to avoid compilations like the plague b/c you will no doubt not get EVERY good song from the band on one disc, however, if i were to own one kiss album and/or was looking for a good place to start to get into the band this is the album i would start with.  all the big hits are here that have been played on the radio countless times over the years...strutter, beth, dr love (my fav) detroit rock city, rock n roll all nite, forever, lick it up, hard luck woman, etc.  if you like this album then i would venture out a little and see what else is available such as the album creatures of the night (best song war machine) and crazy nights (best song crazy nights) as those songs are not included here.
0743454537|3.0|Don't worry, this is not a spoiler. <br /> <br />The book was not bad for its type, but the ending was a total cop-out; to go to the trouble of reading this book and then have the author use this ending is a betrayal of the time spent reading the book.  Ms. Picault does not have the courage of the convictions she had tried to portray.  No more of her books for me!
B000003TA4|5.0|this is the album that brought nirvana into the mainstream as their first album, bleach, didnt do too hot at first.  EVERY song on this cd is a grungerock masterpiece.  my favs are smells like teen spirit, come as you are, breed, polly, drain you, lounge act, stay away and my personal favorite on a plain.  the last song, something in the way is the only exception its a so-so song.
B00005JPAO|3.0|Helen Mirren was hindered by a script that did not include the humorous side of Eliz II.  Multiple biographies have emphasized this side of her, yet this film chose not to include this at all.  Having her sister Margaret included in the script, and showing scenes of the light side of their relationship, would have given a more realistic view of the queen and also made the movie more fun.
B00005JM02|5.0|As far as this sounds, I read the bad reviews. \\"Finding Nemo\\" IS NOT as bad as the others who watched it say it is. Let me show some advice. So, Dory has \\"short-termed-memory-loss,\\" so, Nemo has the \\"lucky fin,\\" so, Marlin is an over-protective, cowardly clownfish, SO, WHAT?! Everybody likes this movie just the way it is. Try to find this movie in a good way. I did.
B000P6PVLC|5.0|In a story that begins with an unexpected death, the audience never quite gets over that initial pain as further burdens are unloaded.  Babel may just as well have been called Babble for its exploration of our own inability to communicate with one another, especially apparent in the American/Western distrust of all things not American or European.  Brad Pitt is either aged or without make up and Cate Blanchett gives an amazing performance, but they are overshadowed by their lesser known costars who deservedly received academy award nominations.  The circular aspect of the Morrocan/Mexican/American story is unexpected and beautifully done.  While the Japanese piece of the tale seems somewhat disconnected for much of the film, it is one of the more painful views of missed communication, misunderstanding, and missed opportunities.  The fact that the characters survive their ordeals is surprising given the severity of what happens to them in the course of the story.  Their choices frequently seem wrong although one is hard pressed to defend an alternative ~ they are caught in a constant Catch-22.  When all is resolved, the closure is brief because the emotion of the film remains raw.  [Not recommended for a first date!]
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This is a really great movie. I wasn't sure if Sandra and Keanu would pull it off as a romantic couple again, but they sure did!  I loved this movie, it kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting more when it was done.
0694013013|5.0|Another excellent Eric Carle book, best in board book version, since the target audience is susceptible to chewing, ripping, and drooling.  It's the ultimate audience participation book with its \\"Can you do it?  I can do it!\\"  You'll have little people shrugging shoulders and stomping feet before you know it.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|This film was terrible. All I can say is that if you like stupid unrealistic violent movies...this one is for you.  Dark and depressing.
0805053883|5.0|Another Eric Carle classic, also best in board book for those young \\"readers\\" who still like to put their reading material in their mouths.  This book is best when read aloud by a grandparent or other visitor unfamiliar with text ~ they start out making all the animal noises, but wait for it... guaranteed they will be flumoxed by the time they hit the flamingoes fluting!!!  Provides an excellent laugh for overtired new parents.
0743455967|5.0|This book was assigned for me to read in a creative writing class in college. It was a very interesting read, and I learned alot not only about writing, but about observing and portraying what I observed. I recommend it for anyone interested in writing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I discovered this series after it had been cancelled also.  I had heard that a feature film was being made so I watched the series before seeing the film & I became an instant fan.  FOX didn't know what they had...  the sad part is that even though millions (?) of copies of this set have been sold, the profits go to FOX.  It's kinda like a parent letting their child die from neglect & then getting rich off of their life insurance...
B0002V7ODI|4.0|First off let me say,I've never read a comic book in my life.I never found you had to read the comics to understand or love the films.And Hellboy was no expection.I never even heard of the comic book created by Mike Mignola (I'm sure some people hadn't heard of it too).<br /><br />Ron Perlman was born to play Hellboy,he was so perfectly cast has the half-human,half-demon..You just can't see anyone else play this character.John Hurt was good as Professor Broom,the man who raised Hellboy and I didn't reconize him at all,I knew lthe voice but couldn't place the face.Selma Blair who's an actress who sometimes really annoys me,but this time she didn't.<br /><br />Directed by Guillermo del Toro,whom turned down the chance to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to do this,did a great job and not really changing the story like most directors do with Comic Book films.If someone else directed Hellboy it wouldn't have been as great as it was
0800141660|5.0|My favorite movie of ALL TIME!!  Anything by Jane Austin is wonderful and Emma Thompson did a wonderful adaptation of this story.
B00005JPFB|5.0|I saw Alatriste at the Miami International Film Festival.  I enjoyed it to the max - I must admit that I am a sucker for big, sprawling, historical films (loved Braveheart and Gladiator).  To make my experience even better, I got to meet Viggo Mortersen, Ariadna Gil and the director of the film, in a Q&A session after the showing of the movie. The cast was superb (the best that Spain has to offer) and although it is a long film, it was well worth the time spent.  I can't wait for it to come out on DVD (Region 1 and/or 4)  One of my faves.
B000002MTR|5.0|I must admit, I have never been a Chili Peppers fan. With the exception of their brilliant cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground\\" (from their 1989 album Mother's Milk), I'd always found something lacking in their music. The guitar playing seemed minimalistic and vague, although I have the same problem with U2 guitarist Edge's playing on every album after The Joshua Tree, so I'm certain this is just a matter of taste. When Peppers guitarist John Frusciante took a hiatus from the band in 1992, the addition of former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro (who can be heard with that band in the recent film Anger Management), created a marriage that produced a once in a lifetime, sonically amazing roller coaster ride of an album; one which is rivaled in terms of technical skill only by Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. The comparison of these two offerings is not pretentious; the scope of One Hot Minute is absolutely amazing. The Peppers shift easily between Funk, Hip Hop, Metal, Pop and Jazz (sometimes within the same song) while making all 13 tracks sound like a cohesive whole. Undertones of Middle Eastern and Classical music carry the listener from one song to the next, while a cacophony of seemingly random sounds and uniquely voiced instrumentation pushes and pulls beneath it all, like an undertow that you can feel but can't quite see. Somehow, sometimes in spite of itself, it all works.    This is obviously not an easy album to like; many people will find that, stylistically, the album's scope is just too broad. Familiarity with the material is key to liking it; it's simply too overwhelming to take in all at once. \\"Transcending\\", the album's closer, floats on air for the first half, then suddenly turns assaultive and angry. This is not radio friendly material for the most part, and it most certainly is not safe. It is, however, exciting and a refreshing change from the usual stale AB/AB/C type of songwriting. Of course, there are hits here; \\"My Friends\\" and \\"Tearjerker\\" (a song rumored to be about Kurt Cobain) received airplay, but they don't represent the album as a whole. No one or two songs could.    In terms of technical ability, the Peppers have never been better. They seamlessly utilize odd time signatures as well as any progressive band, and production by mainstay Rick Rubin is crisp and clear. Navarro, who has always been fond of experimenting with different guitar sounds, shows surprising reserve here. Seldom does he stray from more than a simple Wah and Chorus pedal setup. Occasionally there is a bit of delay added but, for the most part, the odd sounds you think you're hearing turn out to be the style of the music rather than any added effects. Flea, too, shines, popping and slapping bass notes one minute, hammering and pulling off the next, but always serving as a solid foundation and backing off where needed. Now if we could only get the man to stop singing, although I suspect the addition of his warbling, off-key vocal \\"Pea\\" was done to make regular vocalist Anthony Kiedis sound better by comparison. As for Kiedis, his lyrics have matured as well, while still retaining his unusual wit. \\"Coffee Shop\\" boasts the terrific couplet \\"Meet me at the coffee shop / We can dance like Iggy Pop\\" while, on a more serious note, the Agnostic \\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\" announces \\"Your Hell is something scary / I prefer a loving god\\", then continues \\"And what is worse / I do not serve in fear of such a curse\\". Personal and spiritual exploration are the intertwining themes on the album. The only true problem I have with the lyrics is the continuous stream of vulgarities. While I'm not a Puritan by any means, I do love to share great music with people, and this limits my ability to do so in this case. Nevertheless, the listener should be warned: this one is raunchy even by the Peppers' standards.    The Red Hot Chili Peppers go through guitar players like Spinal Tap went through drummers. Some, like current axeman John Frusciante, have been in and out of the band for years while others, like pre-One Hot Minute guitarist Jesse Tobias, were only around for a few months. If you have always found yourself on the verge of liking the band, Dave Navarro has given them the edge you just may be looking for on an album that ranks as #1 on my list of Most Underrated Guitar (Rock) Albums of the Last 25 Years.      One Hot Minute ~ Red Hot Chili Peppers  ======================================  The Good - Amazing stylistic depth and replayability; technical skill has never been better    The Bad - Flea sings; too vulgar to share with my kids    The Final Word - This is a sonically exciting album that needs to be heard several times in order to learn, then love, the music.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|So my girlfriend begged me to rent this at blockbuster and I saw Jack Black on the cover and thought it might be a good movie.  I have never been so wrong in my life.  The list of stars in this film is pretty high yet the acting is so second rate.  None of the characters are believable.  Everything is so convenient and just flat.  The plot is so contrived.  Who in their right mind just lets someone they have never met come into their house and use their stuff on a days notice?  And then who when in a strange house in the middle of nowhere just opens the door to a drunk man and starts having sex with him.  I mean come on, is that really what girls find romantic.  If so I am going to start showing up at girls houses drunk.  I don't blame the actors for their bad acting.  I blame the director/writer for making sch a crappy film.  This is the worst film I have ever seen.  My girlfriend hated it too and she is the one making me write thi review.  If I could give this movie negative 5 stars I would. Stay away from this stinker.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This is Michael Buble's best album yet. It's hard to pick a favorite because almost every song is great. Some of his best songs on the album are actually the one's he wrote which on this album are \\"Lost\\" and \\"Everything\\". But of course I love the variety of the great songs he interprets. Michael has the ability to make a song his own. I didn't like the original \\"Me and Mr's Jones\\" or \\"I am Your Man\\" but Michael has interpreted these songs beautifully and I love these songs now. Get the album, you'll love it. And if you have an opportunity, go see him live, you will have a whole new appreciation for Michael Buble. I recommend his DVD \\"Caught in the Act\\" for a great live concert performance.

B000AWYOGE|3.0|Having watched the Japanese original a few years before this remake, I hoped this would fare better. Unfortunately, it does not. The original version is much better on all levels, be it acting, atmosphere, and pure terror. This remake is not very scary, but it is interesting to watch, just don't expect chills and scares at every turn. Jennifer Connelly [A Beautiful Mind] makes a beautiful if tragic character, playing the role of a recently divorced woman, Dahlia who leases an apartment in a dingy complex on New York's Roosevelt Island. She is in the midst of a heated custody battle over her five-year-old daughter, Cecilia and things only get worse when she finds the new apartment is anything but perfect. Now, having watched Ms Connelly in House of Sand of Fog, she does a similarly admirable job of portraying an emotionally conflicted character here too. There are some good supporting roles here, e.g. Tim Roth as Dahlia's attorney, and also John C Reilly as the loathsome apartment manager. On the whole, this movie would have been a much better horror story as it purports to be if it had focussed more on explaining the supernatural occurences in the movie than on merely dwelling on the tormented character of Dahlia. But, it is definitely a watchable movie despite its flaws, for it does a credible job of exploring the psychology of complex human emotions & relationships.
0099477319|5.0|This was a very popular book when it first came out. Millions of copies were sold in the paperback version in the 1960s. There are a few different versions on the market. The present version has an introduction by the author in which he describes the process of getting the manuscript accepted for publication, and then he describes the first book reviews after it came out. It was his first novel and he received a $1500. advance. The book was written after he taught English composition at Penn. State and while he was working in the advertising business in New York City in the 1950s .<br /><br />When the book first appeared, the reviews were mixed. The Sunday Times, for example, thought that the book was far too \\"repetitious\\" and it lacked \\"craft and sensibility.\\" But a reviewer from the Herald tribune in New York thought it was \\"a wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller coaster ride of a book.\\" Those two reviews summarize the basic traits of the book. I quote Joseph Heller himself who wrote a piece on the reviews in the introduction.<br /><br />The reviews were not unanimous because - and this is a simplification that I make here - this is not a novel in the purest sense as one might think of a novel such as Madame Bovary.

The hero, Yossarian, is an air crew member in a bomber wing which is stationed off the coast of Italy during World War II. The book has a series of strong characters, all held together by a weak plot; it is a series of very funny portraits of various characters in the bomber wing. Each chapter is about a different member of the wing: various colonels, generals, fellow crew members, the chaplain, etc. It describes their actions, motivations, and inner thoughts.<br /><br />The book describes how they cope with the isolation, the pressures of war, and the ambitions of the regular officers, especially the colonels who want to become generals.<br /><br />So, this is a great piece of literature but perhaps not the great American novel.

0767817664|5.0|This is one of the most memorable horror movies from the 80s, not because it was super scary or anything but because it was such a fun vampire flick. Charlie [William Ragsdale] is a horror buff who is convinced that his new next-door neighbor, Jerry Dandridge is a vampire. He tries to convince his girlfriend Amy [Amanda Bearse] and his best friend Evil to no avail. His last hope is Peter Vincent [Roddy McDowall] a TV actor who plays a vampire killer. The rest of the story deals with their efforts in tracking down and killing the vampire. The acting here is above average, and each character is memorable. William Ragsdale brings a certain earnestness to his role as Charlie, and Amanda Bearse plays the role of love interest to Charlie & Dandridge convincingly. However, the best role is the one of Jerry Dandridge, played most convincingly by Chris Sarandon. He is wickedly evil, with a wry sense of humor and dashing countenance.The storyline may have flaws in it, but this is just a fun vampire movie that should be enjoyed for what it is.

B000P7V46C|2.0|The compression scourge has struck again! I was really looking forward to this remaster series coming out, but I'm totally disappointed. As with any compressed audio, it is harsh and fatiguing to listen to. The '94 remasters sound better, so there's no need to buy this unless you want the videos. Don't bother thinking about the European hybrid SACD's either because they're mastered by the same person that did this one - I know - I bought them too. The remix, on the other hand, clears up the muddiness of the previous mix, allowing you to hear things that were buried before. This could have been a revelation with less compression.
B00006LSM3|5.0|The debate as to which George Harrison album is the best is a debate that will rage until trumpets sound. Honestly, I have not heard all of the man's works, but from what I have heard, this Brainwashed album is mighty hard to beat. <br /> <br />\\"Any Road\\" begins this final George Harrison chapter with enthusiasm, and 'plenty of that guitar' as the man sayes. Nothing new or extravagant, just the good old kind of song that George was best at: sweet and simple. Next comes my favorite, \\"P2 Vatican Blues\\". Sounds like an old rock n roll song from the beginning of the era, but Harrison sings the lyrics in his own recognizable way and this track-too-short becomes an instant favorite. Sort of one of those unknown pieces that nobody knows about but which is ultimately always better that the greatest hits. \\"Pices Fish\\" is calm and seems contemplative to me. Among other favorites is #6 \\"Marwa Blues\\" which is totally instrumental and pleasant, and ukulalea laden \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\". \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" is also very accomodating for George's unique voice.  <br /> <br />On the whole, there could never be a better ending chapter to George Harrison's prolific life of music. A fine farewell if ever there was one, and for such a cheap buy, its just too good to pass up. I would suggest it even to novice Harrison listeners. Enjoy it forever.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I guess now that I think about it, season two was a little step backward from season one. The season two finale almost made up for it, but overall, season two was just boring and felt like the plot took forever to get moving. Season three is one giant leap forward, and might even be my favorite season so far. I personally didn't hate the first six episodes. I thought they were ok. I was disappointed with how little happened though. When it came back in Feb, it started to be awesome again. Every episode (with the exception of possibly the worst lost episode ever \\"expose\\") was great. This season also had some of the best lost episodes ever in my opinion. The episode where we learn how Locke got into the wheelchair could very well be the best episode of Lost ever!There were revelations and answers everywhere. There were also more things explored, and even more questions raised. The season finale, was one of the best I've ever seen. Not a lot gets answered, but the last minute of the show absolutely changes the entire show's future....literally. Lost's season finales' are always great.
B000002UCN|4.0|Well, what is there to say about George Harrison that has not already been said? The great man had a most prolific musical career and here on his 'Best Of' collection, alot of his most memorable songs are all waiting to be heard. The trouble is that every time someone puts together a 'Best Of' album for an artist of this caliber, you obviously only seem to hear what has been deemed his 'Best' by the critic world. But dig a little deeper and you will find alot more character in the original albums. Now this was the first George Harrison CD that I bought, and I really enjoy it, but only after I bought up some of Harrison's other CD albums did I find the man in his element, with music arranged and paired just as he intended. I must say that \\"Brainwashed\\" is a particular favorite. But as for this compilation itself, well there's alot to be enjoyed here.    \\"Something\\" seems a proper opening followed by \\"If I needed Someone\\" and then perhapse the best Beatles song ever played, \\"Here Comes the Sun\\". \\"Taxman\\" playes the lighter side of Harrison, and \\"For You Blue\\" is one of my favorites here. The kind of simple song that George Harrison was best at. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is a perennial favorite, but \\"My Sweet Lord\\" is the kind of song you'll want to hear again and again. The rest is standard Harrison greatness and there's certainly plenty to listen to on this CD. Definitely worth the buy for anyone beginning to get interested in the man's work for the first time, especially considering the many different albums and great songs spread around on each. Perfect for the casual George Harrison fan. So sit back and enjoy this fine compilation.    To George!
B00005J6T0|5.0|True Blue is the album that changed my life forever. It made me the person I am today and released all my sexual doubts. Madonna taught me how to 'Express Myself' even before 'Like a Prayer'. For those that remember, MTV and Madonna had a 'Make my Video' contest. For 24 hours, MTV played homemade True Blue videos continuously. My video played at 11:48PM EST. I was the one dancing in the bathroom wearing my mother's underwear. Ever since then I have made a video for each and every Madonna song. My dream is to be one of her backup dancers.<br /><br />True Blue is such an awesome album. After listening to Papa don't Preach on the radio I loved it, but I was hooked after seeing the video and watching her bounce and jiggle in her black outfit.<br /><br />Open your Heart is the theme song of my life. I only wish I had someone to sing it to. I practice by singing it to my cats, so one day I will be ready to find my True Blue love.<br /><br />Live to Tell is the most magical and beautiful song of Madonna's career. The mystery and wonder of this song makes me realize that I have a purpose in life and it is to worship Madonna. I have never met her, but I bought some of her skin off eBay. I bought it from someone who took it out of Madonna's slipper. Live to Tell makes me cry.<br /><br />'White Heat' and 'Where's The Party' are great songs too. They are really fun to drive to when I deliver pizza. No matter how busy I am at work, I can always look forward to listening to Queen Madonna as I deliver piping hot goodness.<br /><br />La Isla Bonita is Madonna's opinion on politics. After listening to this and watching her play the Don't cry for me Argentina lady, I dedicated my life to sending money to South America. But now Madonna is interested in Africa, so I send my money to Africa. I send it under Madonna's name. I do this for the goddess Madonna. One day she will reward me in Madonna heaven.<br /><br />Last but not least, I changed my first and middle name to Jimmy. This is out of respect for the 'Jimmy Jimmy' song on this album that I love so much. I can only hope one day Madonna will know of my true love for her.<br /><br />When I listen to this album I like to sit on my bed and cuddle with my oversized purple pillows. Sometimes I cry, and sometimes I go through my high school yearbook, but most of the time I just sing to my cats. This album gives me hope. It is the only reason why I live.Jimmy.

B000089CJI|5.0|Good 'ole rock is my primary music, but one day, about two months ago my friend hooked me up with some of The Postal Service's music. I never really listened to this Indie rock before, but now I'm searching for more music like it (Death Cab For Cutie, Figurine), and writing reviews on it. Honestly, this album is one of the best I've ever heard from any genre of music. Not until later did I realize that The Postal Service was merely a project of Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello's collaborations (dubbed The Postal Service because they traded ideas on the music through the mail). Since then I've checked out many other Indie bands but have yet to come across a better sound than this. It's simply the best. <br />   <br />Every album has its unique feel, and when I hear Give Up, I think of each song as a different story told from the downtown suburbs of some crowded city, maybe in the midwest somewhere. Starting with \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" which is one of the best tracks we have here, to \\"Such Great Heights\\" that you may have recognized from a UPS commercial. \\"Sleeping In\\" was my favorite from the beginning but the more I listened to the CD, the more I realized that every song was just another favorite. This album is like that, packed with hit after hit. \\"We Will Become Silhouettes\\" is such a good arrangement that I went out and bought the single for it, stumbling upon another great song, \\"Be Still My Heart\\". I mean, are these guys capable of making a bad song? Listen to Give Up a few times and tell me.  <br /> <br />  I know some of you might be lukewarm about 'that' kind of music, but try it. You just might be surprised, like me.
B000FVWL2Y|5.0|Everyone seems to know who Frankenstein is.If you are familiar with the Boris Karloff versions from the 1930's or with the television show THE MUNSTERS from the 1960's, you have seen the walking giant with the steel bolts in the neck and the flat-top head! Thank God that Kenneth Branagh has come along to set the record straight with this exciting,visually stunning rendering of the classic novel by Mary Shelley. Once again, as in HAMLET, MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and HENRY V, soundtrack-writer Patrick Doyle has been called upon to underscore the films intense action  with his usual flare!<br /><br />MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN is simply about the vanity of man trying to play God.At the close of the 1700's ,a young doctor/scientist from Geneva, Switzerland,Victor Frankenstein (Branagh) has a driving obsession with the startings and the endings of life. This leads him on the maddening journey to actually create a life from what he views purely scientifically as \\"insignificant matter\\" from the remains of genius doctors as well as commoners and convicts. What results is an absolute mockery of the human being. The \\"creature\\" though (touchingly portrayed by Robert DeNiro),unexpectedly is filled with all of the extremes in emotions;he has intelligence, he loves,he hates,he has superhuman strength and simply does not know what to do about any of it.The \\"creature\\" has been abandoned by his creator! Above that,though, the \\"creature\\" is positively hideous and a scourge to humanity. He is totally alone in the world to which he has born. The \\"creature\\" even remarks to Dr.Frankenstein,\\"You have given me these emotions,but you have not told me what to do with them.\\" This is the real heart of the story which is one of the saddest and most gut-wrenching ever penned; that every life is a beauty to behold. Perhaps the phrase \\"Beauty is only skin deep\\" originated from someone's reading of Mary Shelley's book.<br /><br />As with all of Branagh's films , this one also is as visually engagingand over-the-top as all of his films are. No expense is obviously spared to bring this story to the screen. The film is pure excess with taste and panache and that is very pleasing to all of the senses.Some of the scenes are pretty grisly and is not recommended for children, though the morality that this story has should be taught at the earliest age!<br /><br />Supporting cast members include Aidan Quinn,John Cleese,Helena Bonham Carter and a truly funny performance from AMADEUS HIMSELF, Tom Hulce as Victor Frankenstein's classmate and best friend..........really top-notch!<br /><br />Branagh has rescued Mary Shelley's misunderstood and much maligned story and has visually restored this classic to the top of the list.Though Shelley's novel is quite frightening, she asks us to think beyond the horror and ask the questions that we still grapple with today: What IS life?.......Beyond 5 stars*****.<br /><br />The film still has no dvd release, but the vhs version is an exceptional digitally transfered,dolby surround print well worth owning.
0743455967|4.0|To say the least writing is an emotional career whether you write fiction or non-fiction. There's so much perspiration, so many blank pages and so much anxiety all intertwined with a little inspiration. When a fellow author insisted I read this book in the midst of one of my writers blocks, I was caught off guard. Stephen King--the horror guy--has a book on writing? Yes he does and compelling reading it is. Once you get past all the F-words in the midst of his candor about his life and the craft of writing, you will be very glad you read it. Aside from a fascinating autobiography of a multi-million selling author, ON WRITING is an inspiring how-to manual navigating serious writers right back on the road to a finished manuscript. Take a break from your writers block and read this book!
0618680004|1.0|Bestseller, what does that mean?  Well I have read so much crap on the bestseller list I think it means too many people were fooled into buying junk.  I say don't contribute to their disillusionment, don't buy this book.  While I appreciate the Mr. Dawkins should be allowed to speak about \\"his\\" truths, I find him to be a great hypocrite.  He doesn't like religion and what it does, well he perpetuates the opposite. I did a little googling and found the Richard Dawkins Foundation.  I believe this \\"foundation\\" is a sad symbol for the church of Richard Dawkins.  This planet needs harmony and acceptance, not arrogant judgement.  Mr. Dawkins, though he may or may not realize it, is as conficted about science as many are that a superior creator exists.  Why does science constantly feel the need to prove itself?  Mr Dawkins has put a faith in a system that, like religion, or spiritual belief, also has potential to be wrong.  I say live and let live.  Pick your battles Mr Dawkins, and I would suggest intolerance as a beginning.  Don't waste your time with this book unless you are of like mind with Mr. Dawkins and like science to prove to you, again, what you think you are already sure of.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I had the CD about one week early and have listened quite regularly over the past month.  Let's get around to some pointed questions you might have, oh curious reader....oh ponderer of all things Rushian: <br /> <br />1. Is it a better album than Vapor Trails?   <br /> <br />I quite like VT and yes, I think it's a stronger album.  Sonically it's far superior, if the sonic mud that was their '02 was of any consequence to you.  Musically, also the case. <br /> <br />2. What are the differences between Snakes & Arrows and recent previous releases? <br /> <br />I think the songs are better structured, although the tempo is down from Vapor Trails.  Honestly, Snakes & Arrows is a bit of an amalgam of a lot of what they've done since 2000, the cover album Feedback included.  There's more of a classic rock sound at work, complete with really nice acoustics that add to the lush quality.  It's not an album of ballads...nor does it have a classical feel....the acoustics are pretty Cream / Allman Brothers influenced, so the record still rocks....even when it's not fully plugged.  Sonically the album switches between really heavy and really melodic within songs a bunch as well, so it's rarely just lush or just heavy....and even the tempos change considerably. <br /> <br />3. Is this a return to classic Rush sound? <br /> <br />No, not really.  But it's also not anything you've ever heard on Rush album either.  I mean, in some spots, yes.  But I don't remember acoustic every playing THIS kind of a role.  Some have made Presto comparisons (more mellow, etc.) but it's really nothing like that one either.  Quite honestly, I can see how they were very influenced by doing their album of 60s/70s cover tunes (Feedback) in 2004.  While they're clearly not copping Blue Cheer or Cream dead on, there's definitely a feel of \\"Rush roots\\" in spots on this album, but mixed with lots of the sonic stuff they've been doing of late (Vapor Trails; Test For Echo). <br /> <br />4. I missed Alex on thelast album.  Is he back this time? <br /> <br />Oh, yes...!  While there still aren't solos on every single song, there's a lot of great Alex work here.  I'm not sure it's his greatest body of work, but it's surely his most diverse.  He plays everything but the kitchen sink, and often in the same song...different styles...different approaches.  There is some country-flavored soloing (don't fret...it works), classic moody Alex, experimentation with feedback and swelling, etc.  He's the MVP of this record. <br /> <br />5. How is Geddy's singing? <br /> <br />Quite cracking if you ask me...!  It's been a source of complaint by some, but I rather like his tone here.  He only goes into the high stuff on rare occasion and sticks with registers suiting him, which is great with me.  There are lots of vocal melodies throughout.  Songs like The Way The Wind Blows and the chorus to Good News First really do work some really great vocal magic to me. <br /> <br />6. What about the lyrics? <br /> <br />They deal mainly with frustration about the way the world is right now, so it's not the most chipper album ever.  (Kind of Grace Under Pressure in the political tones).  BUT the album is a great perspective that doesn't preach a side or point a finger.  It's not a \\"political album\\" it's a CD full of songs about the human condition, both in terms of spirit and climate.  In many ways there are lots of positive overtones to what appear to be bleak outlooks.  You get the feeling of Neil feeling a bit of societal oppression and wanting to express reaction....rather than preach a mantra. <br /> <br />7. Overall what do you think of this album?  Should I buy it if I'm fence sitting? <br /> <br />I think it's a great record.  Saying a CD \\"grows\\" on you has almost become (ok, it actually has) a cliché, but the truth is...this one does just that.  It's not instantly accessible, which is to say not every chorus is catchy; not every hook is seductive and instant; not every melody has an approach that's immediately satisfying.  But like with anything of real depth, you have to allow yourself time to dig into it, to peel back the layers.  Because to be instantly satisfying, in my experiences, often means sacrificing depth for immediacy.  The benefit to that is being instantly stimulated and pretty simply pleased.  The hard part when it's not so, is that you have to do YOUR part to nurture the album.  That's not some silly excuse to mean \\"beat yourself over the head with it enough times and eventually you'll like it if you hear it enough.\\"  That's not the case, although some like to twist it into that rationale.  Rather, give the album its due...and make it worth your money to be patient through four or five listens.  IF you do, and it might not take that many, it's likely you'll find it well worth the money you paid. <br /> <br />This is a great Rush record.  I show four stars but it's actually a solid 4.5 of 5 stars, pushing five.  I'd rank it in my top 5 or 6 Rush albums ever.  Yes, it's that good. <br /> <br />
B0009MAO46|5.0|and I got it half price on here.  What a deal!  I actually bought it to watch with my kids, and they love it as much as I do.  If you don't have a copy, you're missing out.
0582435676|4.0|This is a great read... a powerful and disturbing adventure. The story follows a young backpacker Richard in a fascinating fast-paced trip to the hidden Thai island, Ko Samui, where the seemingly perfect community quickly turns scary and dangerous. <br />The end is different to the film [[ASIN:B00003CWM3 The Beach]] (which I watched first) but I dont think I have a preference. Both endings are equally vivid and cleverly thought out.
B000NA77YO|5.0|a fine collection of mystical magical mayhem from one of the more inspired and interesting Sabbath incarnations. Those of us who caught the recent Heaven and Hell tour were treated to a savory overview of the uniquely powerful and enjoyable creations of this legendary band. We knew that Dio was keeping his vocals deftly working like a well-oiled machine from beyond...but Iommi's mesmerizing and trademark licks were surprisingly impressive after all these years. The soul-thunderous drumming made the price of admission worth every cent.<br /><br />For lovers of music who enjoy delving into the mystical and magical realms of the mind, few acts have been as innovative and enduring as this one. It is a true feat to revisit these songs so commandingly and blow audiences away all over again.<br /><br />A masterful accomplishment.
B000O178BY|1.0|This album just sucks. It is terrible. It has absolultey no life.  Reznor used to be able to strike an emotion just through the music. Not on this album.  He needs to get back to hating himself and not the world. And he needs his old band back. Charlie and Danny were the ones that made Nine Inch Nails - Nine Inch Nails. Stay away from this album.  Stick with The Downward Sprial. Reznor's last good album.
B00005NTJK|5.0|This is, in my opinion, Jethro Tull's best album.  It is far superior to Tull's more well known \\"Aqualung\\".
B0000024JN|5.0|License to Ill--<br /><br />Formerly a punk-rock outfit called the Young & the Useless, New Yorkers Mike D, MCA and King Ad-Rock hooked up with Def Jam founder Rick Rubin in the mid-1980's to create a hip-hop masterpiece.  Released in the fall of 1986, License to Ill took both the hip-hop world and mainstream pop culture by storm.  Though this was their debut LP, the three MC's traded verses like veterans.  Hip-hop rhythm tracks were combined with guitar licks for one of the first rap/rock fusion efforts, sowing seeds for the sub-genre's late 90's resurgence in the likes of Limp Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine.<br /><br />Lyrically, the Beasties are basically college-age party animals throughout the album, telling wild stories about getting kicked out of White Castle, get-togethers stocked with Budweiser, and related tales of cheerful, hedonistic mayhem.  In interviews, band members admitted to having a Schoolly-D fixation at the time, and so there are also some casual gun references here and there.  \\"Slow and Low\\" covers an unreleased Run-DMC song, with the unforgettable line \\"White Castle fries only come in one size..\\"  \\"Rhymin' & Stealin'\\" is pre-gangster rap pirate fantasy, where the Boys vow to send sucker MC's \\"to Davy Jones' locker..\\"  \\"No Sleep `til Brooklyn\\" has a great guitar contribution by Slayer's Kerry King, as the Boys vow to keep the party going \\"eight days a week..\\"; the now-legendary \\"Paul Revere\\" is a cowboy fantasy (co-written with Run DMC) where the Beasties play desperadoes on the frontier, set to a reverse-drum track rhythm: \\"MCA was with it, and he's my ace, so I grab the piano player and I punched him in the face; piano player's out, the music stopped; his boy had beef, and he got dropped..\\"<br /><br />The album's signature song was the top-10 pop smash \\"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right\\".  The rocker is almost out of place amidst all the straightforward hip-hop, but it's just as well that it was the album's closer.  The Beasties expanded the cultural diversity of rap as well as expanding its cultural acceptance worldwide.<br /><br />As of 2007, the LP's 20th anniversary has already passed; a deluxe re-release is in order; it should include any unreleased songs (such as the early \\"Rock Hard\\" EP; also, bootleg releases have included rare songs like \\"Scenario\\", \\"I'm Down\\" and an alternate take of \\"Fight for Your Right\\"), as well as a DVD version of the now-rare VHS home video compilation.ity of rap as well as expanding its cultural acceptance worldwide.

1596912855|1.0|I was eagerly awaiting the release of this book but I was extremely disappointed. Here's why: The writing is subpar- the dialogue often seems stilted and the author uses similes as often as take-offs of Pride and Prejudice are published (just check Amazon to see what I mean). Moreover, the characters remain undeveloped and the romance, frankly, is risible. The attempts at clever repartee between the two main characters, in the mode of Elizabeth and Darcy, are completely not successful. None of the characters are appealing including the main character Jane. The whole book (and it's only about 190 pages) just seemed to drag on and on. In short, the book is not funny, not romantic and not worth your money.    <br />
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This was already a fantastic series but I had only seen it in standard deinition.  The change to HD is incredible. This won't be the first review where you see this so I don't think I need to hype this any further. One thing I've seen in some review are complaints about the video quality in some scenes. I agree with this with the box does state \\"Due to the difficulty in filming in some habitats, a small percentage of the footage has not been shot in full HD.\\" This doesn't detract and is only slightly noticeable.  My TV is 32\\" at 720p so those with larger sets running at 1080p will probably notice this more than I did.  Then again, running on a much larger screen at 1080p you will really be in for an experiance for most of the time. <br /> <br />That being said, the documentary is excellent and the high quality of picture makes the things described much clearer.  But it is the documentary that is the stand-out aspect. On the four discs you will see some incredible sights : sandstorms rolling across the desert, great white sharks leaping out of the water to catch seals, Death Valley in bloom, time lapse through a day at a pole where the sun doesn't set, the lechuguilla cave, Venezuela's Tepui. The vast majority you will never see in person so getting this in HD you are seeing it in the closest picture quality we have right now. If you're a sensitive soul some things may upset you but this is what appens in the wild, and it doesn't dwell on it, it simply shows you what happens. <br /> <br />I would have liked to have the option of Sigourney Weaver's commentary.  No special reason, just curious to hear it having only seen this in the UK. No idea if it is scripted differently so I am curious on this.  <br />The extra \\"Planet Earth Diaries\\" from the standard definition DVD are not included which is borderline criminal.  When you watch this series you will wonder \\"How did they do that?\\", without this you will have to buy the standard definition DVD, buy the book or searchthe web for answers.  We also miss out on Planet Earth:The Future which is on the standard definition release. <br />A full 5.1 sound release and maybe an option to watch with just the musical score. <br /> <br />Amazon have a warning that this will not work on normal DVD players so if people can just exercise a little more care when buying they will see this and stop posting bad reviews of an excellent product. Perhaps an addition to this regarding the HD-DVD player for the XBox 360, you will need a connection to XBox live to download a software update so you can play this, not sure how else you can update your system.

This book (and movie) throws in a lot of spiritual greed and great-sounding delusional thinking.  It is like someone preparing a meal  starting from a great cook, but then adding tons of sugar, salt and MSG so that the basic health has disappeared.
B000AY74OG|5.0|Since Shrek, DreamWorks pictures has annually put out cartoons aimed at audiences of all ages.  Most of these end up behind Pixar's creations as best cartoon of the year.  2005 was one of the few exceptions; first, Pixar did not release any movie that year.  Second, this movie is actually very good.  It tells the story of four overly domesticated zoo animals who inadvertantly end up in Madagascar, where they have to learn to survive against the odds and in spite of themselves.  The movie is written as a comedy with no romance or terror, and some action sequences.  As a comedy, it includes elements of sarcasm, singing, slapstick and a lot of outright stupidity.  Most of the jokes are original and appropriate for all ages, and the animation is quite believable and looks like a cross between the CGI wonders of Pixar and traditional cartoon drawings from the 1960's.  The voiceovers are great, and all the characters are excellent.  Most notable is Sacha Baron Cohen's first big role in a major Hollywood release.  Here, he is the king of a band of lemurs, and his experience from the Da Ali G Show shines through as he sings away in a South Asian accent. <br /> <br />Overall, a great movie.  The plot is simple but very original, along with the comedy.  Fun for everyone.
B000687M48|4.0|I wasn't sure how many stars to give this.  I do give the live performance on the CD five stars.  But the DVD performance of the setlist was horrible.  I couldn't even finish it.  The cuts annoyed me horribly and I could only get through one song.  I don't what it is, but do the people today have that short attention span.  I know for myself I can watch a band for about 2 hours.  I'm 21 years old and I couldn't keep up with the cuts that the director decided to use. <br /> <br />Anyway, I suggest just getting the CD of this combo off of a friend or iTunes.  Amy Lee has an excellent voice live and has energy.  I love this band and I can't wait to see them on the Family Values Tour this summer.  At least I don't have to deal with the horrible editing.

It's advice is as relevant to an experienced lawyer, as it is to a law student, or average joe who wants to learn to be as persuasive in their presentations as possible.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|A very strong and concise effort which flows beautifully from start to finish.  Excellent songwriting and execution.  Please don't be influenced by some of the nit-picky comments that several critics are putting out there about Sky Blue Sky.  Artists evolve, bands evolve.  Jeff Tweedy and company know what they're doing, so just sit back and enjoy the ride.  This recording is somewhat understated relative to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born.  That's not good or bad, just different.  Less is more with Sky Blue Sky, and every note counts on this recording.  If you can appreciate anything about Wilco, you will not be disappointed with this CD.  Like most art, it takes a little time to fully appreciate.  Spend the time, you won't be disappointed.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|You want to know the truth? I actually welcome the fact that a band wants to produce an album that is different than their previous works. However, it doesn't work for some bands at all. Take, for instance, Avenged Sevenfold. The hits on \\"City of Evil\\" are actually quite good, especially \\"Bat Country\\". That album, though, doesn't even come close to their previous work \\"Waking the Fallen\\", and I am almost positive this is due to the change in styles. <br /> <br />Linkin Park is no different. I am a mediocre guitar player at best, and one day I was looking for some good sheet music in order to improve my skill. I kid you not, I picked up a book with sheet music by Linkin Park and discovered I could already play nearly all the songs. They aren't really talented musicians in that sense, but with the extremely catchy lyrics, electronic beats, and rapping of Mike Shinoda in both Hybrid Theory and Meteora, they rose above the cliche that to be a talented band you had to have a million guitar solos and impossible chord combinations. Their uniqueness defined them. <br /> <br />Although the lyrics are still good on this album, their poor musicianship (crappy drums and crappy guitar) show through because the things that defined Linkin Park are lost. To be fair, though, I do love \\"What I've Done\\", as it actually kinda reminds me of \\"My December\\", which I also love. <br /> <br />Anyways, most old Linkin Park fans will be disappointed picking up this album. These guys, back in the day, used to be my favorite band. I'm disappointed not because they changed their style of music, but because they didn't do a good job making the transition.
B000O75F7C|4.0|Wow! A lot of reviews here so, I'll be brief. I've only just started to listen to PT with in absentia, deadwing, stupid dream, signify and have not been dissapointed. Fear of a Blank Planet is as good as the rest perhaps better....but there is no way to tell. Buy it and decide for yourself. I especially like the way this bank blends heavy electric guitar riffs within a melodic song that is acoustic guitar and piano based with some synths thrown in for ambience. It all works VERY WELL !<br /><br />I plan to add more of PT to my library!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006IU73 In Absentia]][[ASIN:B000FVRRH8 Stupid Dream]][[ASIN:B0007XT87G Deadwing]]
B000O599WG|5.0|I love this movie. It's always been my favorite western, and while cinefiles may put \\"The Searchers\\" or \\"Red River\\" above it, I think no other western is more enjoyable and thrilling to watch than this one. As an examination of what the western really means, why it's such a durable art form, it is perfect. Right vs. wrong, good men vs. bad men, courage vs. cowardice, it's all in there.  <br /> <br />Even though I've owned the old cardboard-box DVD for some time now, I bought this new edition the day it came out. (For one thing, I HATE those stupid boxes Warner Brothers put out and I'm glad to see they're correcting their mistake) The new edition contains an excellent 30-minute documentary on the making of the film, including a great interview with Angie Dickinson, who I believe is the only person involved with the movie still alive. I wish she was on the commentary, but she has plenty to say here. Another, shorter documentary talk about Old Tucson, where the movie was filmed and where westerns continue to be filmed even today. Finally, an excellent older hour-long documentary on Howard Hawks himself, with liberal sprinklings of scenes of his movies and a great long interview with Hawks from the early 1970's. It's all worth the price of buying the new edition. <br /> <br />There is also a commentary track with film historian Richard Schickel and director John Carpenter, who says this is his favorite film by his favorite director. The commentary is somewhat less successful, but still very interesting. It appears to be two separate commentaries spliced together; they refer to the movie, but not to each other. I'd rather they had included both commentaries separately, although it is true that by about midway through the movie they both kind of run out of steam and for long stretches you forget you've selected the commentary track at all. <br /> <br />Nevertheless the main thing is the movie, and it is a great one. John Wayne was never better, or at least never more powerful and charismatic, than he was here. Dean Martin calls him \\"Papa\\" at one point, and you see the truth of this: John Wayne is the patriarch of the movie, guiding it and helping it along, centering it with the force of his gravity. He's befuddled by the attentions of young Angie Dickinson, to be sure, but you never doubt that he's in charge of this town and he knows what he's doing. Dean Martin is a revelation as Dude, displaying all the raw acting talent he always seemed to hold back with Jerry Lewis because he knew he was the straight man. His torture as he goes through withdrawals from alcohol feel absolutely real, and we root for him as he slowly pulls  himself up from the depths to which he's sunk the last few years. It's ironic that his next project was \\"The Young Lions\\" with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift; there are three great actors who all, in their own way, seemed to forgo on the promise of their talent and coast or dissipate themselves into oblivion. At least we have this performance, because Dean was a great, great actor. Walter Brennan is perfect as always, adding spice and flavor to every scene where he appears or is likely to appear. A greater character actor there never was. Rick Nelson is good, if a bit stiff, but he holds his own here and is enjoyable in the role. He and Dean sing a couple of great songs, too, because if you have two of the biggest singers in the world you put 'em to work. Finally, Angie Dickinson is wonderful as Feathers, she's a smart alec (alice?) and she's vulnerable all at the same time, as good as Bacall in her best days, and the difference in age between her and John Wayne is never jarring, not even for a second. You want them to get together, and since this is an old-school western you figure they probably will. <br /> <br />Great movie, great dialogue, great acting, great direction, great color cinematic scope, great everything. Great movie. Check it out. They don't make 'em like this anymore. Too bad.
B00006RAKP|5.0|I got this as a birthday present and it's fab! It has all the songs that Elton is well known for and a few you maybe have forgotten about. It's easy listening and great for singing along to. Big thumbs up from me!
B000PFUAO6|4.0|I'll be honest, when I first heard the singles \\"Constant Motion\\" and \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\", I thought \\"Systematic Chaos\\" was going to be a \\"Systematic Failure\\". There are some bands which get worse as they progress, while there are other bands which release albums of similar quality and seem worse because the fan's initial tastes have changed. When I heard the first two singles, I thought that they were solid Dream Theater songs but that I might finally be tired of their progressive style. Today, I heard the rest of the album and was proven wrong. Dream Theater have released another solid album. There's enough new material on \\"Systematic Chaos\\" to keep longtime fans of the band at least slightly interested, while fans of the Jordan Ruddess-era material will find little to complain about.<br /><br />The album opens up with a very progressive bang! From \\"In the Presence of Enemies pt.1\\" Those who know of the middle of \\"Metropolis pt. 1\\", \\"The Dance of Eternity\\", and the part 3 of \\"Octavarium\\" know what I'm talking about. After that, the song settles down and turns into something very listenable. The next song, \\"Forsaken\\" is another solid song (and a relatively short DT song, for that), and probably one of my favorite on the album. \\"Constant Motion\\" and \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" follow, neither of which I'm too fond of. The first song sounds too much like Metallica for me, while the second seems to be a bit too much of a \\"cut and paste\\" effort. Also, the lyrics to these songs are horrendously cliched. For example, Constant Motion's chorus \\"Forever More/Into the Night/Disarray!\\"<br /><br />\\"Repentance\\", which is the next song, takes the album in an interesting turn. It's certainly the next song in Mike Portnoy's AA saga, and this time it's a slow song. Very nice touch. It seems that the band is beginning to think about how the whole thing is going to work as one big piece of music. But the peice drags on for over 10 minutes without any real musical changes, and the strange narration at the end just ends the song on a very weird and awkward feeling.<br /><br />\\"Prophets of War\\" is interesting at first, and probably the best song on the album lyrically, but the music and vocals are just horrible. This is the worst song on the album, in my opinion, and it's also a shameless attempt at stealing Muse's style (again).<br /><br />The album turns to a slower pace again for \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\", a 14 minute epic that I think might be good enough to join the ranks as a \\"Dream Theater Epic\\". The only problem is it's a bit too long, and the instrumental section doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the song.<br /><br />\\"In the Presence of Enemies pt 2\\" wraps up the album quite nicely. I recommend anyone capable of burning CDs onto computers to set the first and last song as a separate play list so that it can be listened to as one piece. As a whole, \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\" is without a doubt the 25 minute epic song that we all thought \\"Octavarium\\" was going to be before that album came out. That's not to say \\"Octavarium\\" wasn't a great song, but it's nothing in comparison to this one!<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a better album than \\"Train of Thought\\" and \\"Octavarium\\". There's fireworks abound, which I would prefer less of at this point in my life, but Dream Theater have seem to become more tasteful about were they place their fireworks. Some songs go overboard in instrumental sections, while others remain more or less \\"to the point.\\" If you've liked Dream Theater at any point in their career, there's probably something for you on \\"Systematic Chaos\\".<br /><br />I'm giving this album 4 stars because though I'll admit almost half the album is garbage, the other half is really good. And it's still worlds better than anything you'll hear on the radio lately. But in terms of what I think Dream Theater are capable of, this album is probably closer to a three. One would think that the band would learn to utilize their own vocalist properly after 9 studio albums, instead of making him sing the same thrown together vocal parts over and over until they begin to sound awkward and forced. James LaBrie sounds GREAT in every recording of him, side projects included, up until Dream Theater's \\"Train of Thought\\". And, he sounds excellent on the Score DVD/CD.  Give the man something to work with! Next time, I'd like to see Dream Theater \\"Take The Time\\" and give us another well planned album like \\"Scenes\\" or \\"Six Degrees\\".<br /><br />This album is a step in the right direction after the past two letdowns, but the band haven't exactly written another masterpiece yet.him sing the same thrown together vocal parts over and over until they begin to sound awkward and forced.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|It's not a perfect film, but it is definately entertaining, very funny at times and worth watching. <br /> <br />There are no huge stars in this film, but there's an impressive cast of actors that you kind of recognize from small parts in other movies. For example \\"The Daily Show\\" alum Steve Carell plays the uncle recovering from a suicide attempt, although it was such a different role for him I didn't even realize it was him until halfway through the movie. <br /> <br />Although it might be tempting to describe this as a movie about real people with real problems, the hand of Hollywood exaggeration is at play here. The way this family just experiences one huge problem after another is a bit over the top, and probably puts this film more in the category of \\"Worst vacation ever/Road trip disaster\\" films (like \\"National Lampoon's Vacation\\", \\"Planes, trains, Automobiles\\", \\"Road Trip\\", etc, etc, etc) than a family drama. <br /> <br />Not that I'm complaining mind you. I've seen a few films that tried to imidate real life, and they bored the pants off of me. I think most of us go into movies if not for pure escapism, than at least to watch people with far more interesting or screwed up lives than our own. <br /> <br />I don't know how accurate the scene of the child beauty pagent was in this movie. Perhaps the hand of Hollywood exaggeration is at work once again. But if half of what was shown in this movie is true, the people who run these beauty pagents and the parents who participate should all be locked away for child abuse. <br />

It starts you on a journey of a 14 year old girl named Suzie Salmon. When she is murdered, she goes to heaven. A heaven that seems very much like her earth... But better, and without her loved ones on earth for the time being. She watches her family comes together in her death, then eventually start to fall apart. This is a story were family and close friends experience love, hope, dreams, their future, and their past are all haunted by Suzies death... her murderer.  <br /> There are several amazing aspects to this story. The author has a beautiful way of painting pictures in your head, then adding exactly how you are to feel about the picture. You become a character in the shadows, watching everyone's moves and hearing their thoughts. Throughout this book I was filled with a deeper understanding of sorrow, but also a sense of peace, knowing that Suzie was in a better place. <br /> Although the author writes beautifully, I dislike some of the more graphic parts of the story. It presents you with real life issues and doesn't leave any detail out. I know these issues happen in \\"real life\\", but maybe that's why it frightens me personally. Also I think the ending leaves you feeling unsatisfied. I wish it could have been more specific with certain details.  Otherwise I give it 2 thumbs up. <br />
B000IJ79UW|3.0|I dont know if anyone but me realizes but there is a lot cut from both versions of the movie. when lana asks young clark to go with the group after football practice to listen to records, he says he would like to, but the the jock comes up and says too bad he cant he has a lot to clean up, meaning all the football gear, well before he runs home then stands against the truck when all the kids in the car from the group and lana stops to ask him how he got there so fast. he, clark, cleaned everything up super fast then ran home but its been cut out. then the part when lex luthor, otis, and miss tessmocher pull the scheme to change the direction of the rockets, all the planning  and rehearsing scenes for the scam are cut out. the scam isnt even mentioned, its like all the sudden they are just doing it. the movie cuts to the car fliping, then they just start doing all this stuff no one ever talks about, well all the talk and planning was in the original movie, i remember lex luthor showing the schematic of how it was all going down, and what they all had to do, and i remeber tessmocher in that red dress all busty looking hot, getting ready to go play possum in the middle of the road, its all cut out of the movie completly. theres more cut out im sure. hollywood has been butchering all the movies for years to make them shorter and more politicaly correct. look at executive decision. about 15 minutes cut out all important stuff too.
0143038419|1.0|I am dumbstruck that so many reviewers enjoyed this book. I have always wanted to do a similar trip myself, a trip I also called my \\"i\\" trip that additionally included Ireland and Israel. My trip will wait until I finish raising my small children, so I was hopeful she could transport me a little. In fact, I was excited to read of her experiences, insights, thoughts, adventures. As a suburban mom and freelancer who chose the life she opted out of for now (and how liucky I am to have that choice), I was still curious to learn what scared her about motherhood, what drew her to work and travel and how she would eventually deal with a possible balance. I am hopeful to support women who make unique choices and are willing to explore them. Only what she offered was, well, nothing.  <br /> <br />She is the most vapid, narcicistic, insecure, self-absorbed, spoiled brat I have ever had to listen to. I could not wait to get her whiny, foolish voice out of my head.  I only finished this book because it was a selection in my book group, the group hated it as it turns out. Has this women ever thought about someone other than herself? If she has an insight about divorce or relationships or even how to give and receive love she certainly forgot to share it with her readers. She didn't show struggle or conflict or self-reflection about societies pressures versus internal longings. It sounds like she just got bored and cried a lot. <br /> <br />Am I supposed to take her word for it that her marriage was unsalvagable and her husband so unworthy that she was smart to leave him? Did he abuse her? Hate her? cheat on her? drink? do drugs? Was he depressed -- or was that just her?  She decided not to tell us why she would walk out and give up on a marriage. She isn't really deep enough to look at why she would abandon a person she promised to stick by. She doesn't explain her calling, her needs. Acutally she doesn't seem to learn anything. Or teach anything about the human condition or self-dicovery or how depression affects loved ones. Hard to like her -- or even want to read her -- at all when all she prattles on about is her weight fluctiations. Uh, when she finally gets to the third world country of India I wondered if she noticed the poverty and hunger? No, she complains instead about how hard it is to sit quietly in a room. I practice yoga myself and I think all her meditiation seems to have missed the point. Settle down, get centered sure, but then GO out and HELP someone, you creep!!! For awhile I thought this woman should, in fact, have a kid if only to teach her how to think about someone other than herself. But then I thought, maybe not. Might be too hard for her and then what? Jet off to Iraq to write about, say, army food, and abandon yet againj???  <br /> <br />If you have any insights of your own about the world we share and how to share with others in it, do not bother reading Ms. Gilberts book. There is nothing valuable there to find, outside of a silly, spoiled girls daily planner of what she did today and who she has a crush on. ugh. better to watch Sex and The City reruns! <br /> <br />She seemed really proud of how good she is at making friends. I wondered how genuine she is or just glad to collect people like stamps or glass animals. I am certain I would not be her friend. I really could not stand her.
B000LC55F2|4.0|There are numerous reviews posted on this excellent film but few of them mention the fatal flaws of the two talented young magicians that eventually leads to their separate painful downfalls. <br /> <br />Two young talented men work together and are fascinated by the field of magic performance. One accidentally, and maybe subconsciously, ties a rope too tight and this results in the drowning death of the other young magician's wife. Now the story becomes one of revenge as Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman), the handsome widower, begins to plot revenge against Alfred Borden (played by Christian Bale). Interestingly these two men would have been superb partners since Borden is the better technical illusionist whereas Alfred is the better showman. Michale Caine plays the role of a man who designs magic tricks and coaches magicians. He actually plays the conscious of Robert, the voice of morality and reason, that Robert sometimes hears and sometimes ignores. David Bowie plays the mysterious Dr. Testler in Colorado Springs, who has developed a machine that will reproduce anything put into its chamber. Testler is actually the devil, the force of evil that grants a man a superhuman gift so that the gift can bring about their downfall. This is the major character flaw of Robert. His grief and desire for revenge remain his motivation for living and even keeps him blind to the advantages of loving his lovely assistant, played by Scarlette Johansson. But Alfred Borden has his flaws too. Alfred has a twin and he keeps this secret even from his wife, which only acts to pull them apart and eventually result in her suicide. <br /> <br />Revenge and secrecy from those we love are two character flaws that bring both men down in this morality play of the first order. Highly recommended.
0156027321|2.0|I admit it, I don't read fiction. Maybe one or two a year. I prefer real life which I find much more fascinating. Pi was recommended to me by a friend as a \\"must read.\\" I tried, I really did. I read the entire book which, had someone else recommended it, I would not have done. But my friend is dear and smart and funny so I bit. After reading this book, I realized a lot of things, one of which is, I'm no intellectual. I just don't like to work so hard when I read. I love a great story and if this had been true, it would have read like fiction and that would have made all the difference to me.<br /><br />The idea that reading a book of fiction would make a person believe in God as the author seems to want us to do, doesn't work. It's like a sword hanging over one's head. You KNOW the book is fiction and yet as preposterous as it is, the author begs you to BELIEVE. I suppose this is the essence of faith. But it simply did not ring true to me. If the tale had indeed been true, then a more convincing argument might have been made that it's wonderousness was a sign of God's existence, a miracle.<br /><br />There is some imaginative and interesting writing here which is why I didn't give it one star. But for me, the constant wondering about where the story was going, along with the violence and this irritating theme of what is \\"real,\\" throughout, left a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't wait to finish, be done with it and get back to real life.
0060589469|5.0|Robert Pirsig really thinks he has revolutionized the field of philosophy. He seems to believe that his \\"metaphysics of quality\\" amounts to something new, a \\"Copernican revolution\\" he calls it. <br /> <br />Thank God he didn't use this book to outline any of that. Whatever the merits of Pirsig's Metaphics of Quality, it should be clear at this point that it's not really as great as Pirsig thinks. If you have really studied philosophy in depth, and have read the authors Pirsig cites in this book (no, this book is not the only philosophy book you should ever read!), you're going to realize that Pirsig has some big holes in his education and some major faults in his philosophical thinking. <br /> <br />Again, fortunate for us that he doesn't waste this book on the MoQ. Instead, this book is a Thoreau-like rumination on modern society and its values. We value some stuff we shouldn't, and we place less value on some stuff that we should. Pirsig is excellent at putting cogent arguments together, and many of his points--about the \\"Church of Reason\\" and technophobia, among others--stand truer today than they did then. We Americans are reaching a point in history where we will either critically analyze our values and reject quite a few of them or self-destruct, and Pirsig's book was right on top of that realization even 35 years ago. <br /> <br />Is it really philosophy? I would have to go with no. At least, it isn't philosophy in the traditional sense as practiced by Plato and Descartes and Kant. It is more like social criticism, but it is excellent, poetic, beautifully written social criticism, and I really wish Pirsig would get off his MoQ high horse and write some more of it. We could use it right now.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|\\"They're all gone,\\" intones sportscaster Jim McKay. McKay and other ABC news folks of 1972 have their TV footage mixed with a quick montage of violent filmed movie scenes of the '72 Olympics where 11 Israeli Olympians were massacred by the Arab Black September group.<br /><br />Five men led by a young Israeli named Avner are assembled to revenge the massacre of the Munich Olympians. The Munich Avengers hook up with a family that has been in private intelligence since the Vichy Government ran France during World War Two. Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) is its patriarch. He becomes a sage to the Five. \\"Never work for any government\\" he warns. Well, its a little late to change that just now. At first everything goes swimmingly. The movie looks like other well made thrillers. These 'pros' who have never exactly done this kind of work in their lives 'seem' very successful.<br /><br />Thriller afficionados will remember Michael Lonsdale as the French inspector who traced assassin Edward Fox across France in the Day of the Jackal 33 years ago. Older and heavier, Lonsdale is right at home as patriarch of the French family aiding the Israeli assassins in targeting their victims.<br /><br />The Israelis find themselves sharing a room in Athens with five Arab Assassins but arrange a truce by convincing the Arabs they are part of the German Beider-Meinhof gang. Avner discusses middle east morality and politics with the Arab gang leader. Avner is seen by the audience as losing that argument. Later the forger has to 'fix' a foiled murder attempt in a hotel room. He is wounded. Several of the Arabs Avner's crew boarded with are killed in a gunfight outside. Carl (Cirian Hands) is murdered in bed later by a comely prostitute after Avner has turned the woman down. The Israeli avengers trace her to a Brussels houseboat where each fires a shot into her as she vainly attempts a seductive but grotesque striptease to save her life. An attempt to kill the architect of the Munich Murders is foiled when five Brits, posing as drunks, interfere. Avner's men are now aware they are being followed and watched. Who do the five Brits work for, the CIA or Britain's MI-6? The hunters are now the hunted.<br /><br />The foiled Assassination perplexes and demoralizes. Their Israeli handler Ephraim calls Avner home to tell him their work is splendid. Not to them it isn't. Avner doesn't want to continue. He suspects they have killed Arabs not involved in Munich and balks at giving names and addresses of contacts to Ephraim. They discover the CIA has protection deals with some of their targets. The remaining Four don't know who is after them or for what. Two more die and a demoralized Avner and Steve(Daniel Craig) split up.<br /><br />Afraid now, Avner flees to his wife and baby in Brooklyn. But unknown agents follow and scare him. Avener fears for his wife and child. He attacks a bureaucrat in the Israeli Mossad office in Manhattan. He is desperate now. Ephraim meets with him and admits some of the six killed were not Black September but old Israeli scores being settled. Avner won't cooperate with Israel now. And Ephraim won't help him if Avner doesn't agree to continue.<br /><br />Except for a nightmare-freighted, overdone sexual episode between Avner and his wife, the film is effectively over. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner have carved this thriller into a political morality tale. The Israelis cannot assume the higher moral ground if they are as murderous as Black September. Every act of revenge sews the seeds of more violence and death. What is the point of that, ask the Authors? An Arab character argues with Avner that the Jews in Israel are outnumbered by the Arab populations that are all around them and growing in numbers much faster than the Israelis. The Authors are saying the Israelis will never win, that time is on the side of the Arabs. Israel will not win and will not survive.<br /><br />I agree with them. The American War in Iraq will not succeed either. Americans and Israelis will both lose because the Arabs are fighting for their homeland. The Americans, and the Israelis who claim THEY are fighting for their homeland, cannot succeed.<br /><br />Spielberg and Kushner have loaded the dice too heavily here. Avner and his four henchmen have an underlying innocence about international terrorism calculated to buttress this story and its moral. But would the Israelis really have chosen such a bunch of innocent plebes to carry out a mission as cynical, dangerous and important as this one? Its a great story but it won't play in Bagdhad, Tel Aviv or Peoria not to mention on the big screen.ot succeed either.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|Why waste words. The best thing that can be said about this movie is: NOTHING!
B000M5AJQS|3.0|The Departed is pretty good, but not because its large cast is good or because of Martin Scorcese's direction.<br /><br />Its good because the original Chinese film its copied from, Infernal Affairs (2004) was a superior plot.<br /><br />The story is about two impersonators who have infiltrated the Boston crime scene. One is employed by the Police Department to find any moles who might have penetrated the force. The other works for Boston Mobster Frank Costello, not related at all to the Mafioso who rapped his knuckles on a congressional desk in the fifties during a televised hearing about organized crime.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson plays Costello and wrecks the movie pretty much. In interviews, Nicholson said he wasn't inclined to be in the film because the Costello role was little more than a cameo. But Scorcese had the part built up for Nicholson, hurting the film in the process.<br /><br />The film is a tightly wound tale of intrigue about moles inside the Boston department. Leo De Caprio and Matt Damon play the spies. De Caprio is better than Damon but not by much. De Caprio knots up his forehead too often in order to be taken seriously as a slightly troubled cop.<br /><br />There's a certain amount of advanced technology to sleuth the mystery the audience already knows the answer to. But this is a great script.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's Costello is over the top, damaging a pretty good film substantially. De Caprio is off his mark too.<br /><br />But this is the best Scorcese film in years, better than Gangs of New York or the Aviator, both of which were directed by Scorcese and both of which featured Leonardo De Caprio.<br /><br />Nicholson is so awful and such a gargoyle, he reminds me of Burl Ives, who was terrible as Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1958. Nicholson is almost always miscast and overacting these days. I think the last decent film he did was the Postman Always Rings Twice in roughly 1980. He hasn't been good in anything since, but they keep paying him as if he's a bankable star.<br /><br />Other actors in what is supposed to be an ensemble film include Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and Krista Dalton. Dalton is a newcomer and is quite good. But Baldwin, Farmiga and Wahlberg don't get enough time to act with Nicholson chewing scenery all the time.<br /><br />The film, due to its extraordinary plot and a series of film surprises, is quite good, despite everything.ince, but they keep paying him as if he's a bankable star. <br /> <br />Other actors in what is supposed to be an ensemble film include Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and Krista Dalton.

Will Smith is truly a master actor and this film shows his most creative side. It's worth your time!

0375831002|5.0|I do not have the words to convey how much I love this book. It transcends the concepts of splendor and skill and puts itself in its own league--it is absolutely beautiful and masterful. <br />  It is a shame that this book is aimed toward young adults. This way, many people will just give the YA section a disdainful glance and then move on to what they believe 'true' literature is like. Those people do not know what they just so apathetically dismissed: a work of wonder, of beauty, and of excellence. <br /> <br />  'The Book Thief' is a story of a girl named Liesel Meminger and her family who live in Nazi Germany. Liesel steals books, hence the name; steals apples occasionally, but only when she is famished; learns the power and meaning of words, which played a momentous role during WWII; perennially rejects her friend's request for a kiss; and is seen by Death a few times. <br />  Death. <br />  Who knew he would be such an eloquent story-teller? <br />Death has a beautiful voice--he is a master of language. Through the use of his language, Death has forever ingrained the characters of Liesel, Rosa, Hans, Rudy, and Max. I shall never forget them. <br />  'The Book Thief' is a novel that you will want to share with others because of the impact it evokes. You will immediately want others to experience such a wonderful literary journey.  <br />  This nigh-impeccable piece of work is astounding, admirable, astonishing, and amazing. Don't even get me started; those are only the A's.  ;)

B000OZ2CZW|4.0|When Rihanna started two years ago, most people thought she would disappear within a few months. However, Rihanna is still here and better than ever! Her new album combines hip-hop, r&b, dance, reggae, rock, pop, and electronic to have a new sound all her own. While she is not the best singer in the world, her vocal skills has shown great improvement. At the age of 19, this could be the beginning of a new world for Rihanna.  <br /> <br />MY FAVORITE SONGS: <br /> <br />'Umbrella' is the hottest song this summer and its totally Rihanna. She really didn't need Jay-Z assistance and the blend of rock with hip hop is both catchy and addictive. <br /> <br />'Don't Stop the Music' mixes 80s music with a today's electronic sound and I love the MJ chant in the song. Rihanna's vocals are nearly perfect with this song. <br /> <br />'Breakin Dishes' has alot of attitude and once again, she blends rock with a more hip hop sound. <br /> <br />'Hate That I Love You' is simply pretty. Rihanna and Ne-yo's vocals sound great together. The best part about this song is its very basic and simple.  <br /> <br />'Sell Me Candy' is my favorite song because its one of her most reggae-sounding songs on the album.  <br /> <br />'Lemme Get That' is another reggae song and the lyrics are quite funny to me. Her vocals are made for songs like this. <br /> <br />'Rehab' is another proof that Rihanna's vocals has improved alot of the years. <br /> <br />The other songs are okay to me (they are not filters), especially 'Shut and Drive' which is the next single and will no doubt increase Rihanna's appeal. The final word on this cd is: Rihanna is growing and this is her summer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JPKE|5.0|I missed this film when it was in theatres, so I am very glad I finally rented \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\". It gives a viewer who - up until the time he watched it - only heard about how brutal the Japanese were during WWII - that they were monstrous fanatics during the war. Now, this may be true to some extent (and this applies to how they treated their own, as well as their enemies, as it turns out!). But, never have I ever been given such a glimpse into the more human side of the Japanese who defended the doomed island of Iwo Jima. They suffered, died, and struggled with their consciences while fighting for their country - same as their U.S. Marine adversaries did.    I also came to appreciate how - in their own strange way - the Japanese soldier fought under a certain code of honor. These guys came out to fight even when they knew they would all be killed. They didn't hide like cowards and plant bombs to be exploded as an enemy passed by.... like those who fight void of any sense of honor in certain regions of the world today.    I highly recommend that you watch \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" in addition to - either before or after - \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\". Both movies were filmed simultaneously, and the juxtaposition of viewpoints is nothing short of brilliant. Being an American, I want to say that I preferred \\"Flags\\" over \\"Letters\\". But, I have to concede that I think I like the latter film a little better.    Following The Battle of Waterloo, The Duke of Wellington was quoted as saying, \\"Next to a battle lost, the next saddest thing is a battle won.\\" Watch both of Clint Eastwood's films and these words will ring true.
1594489505|5.0|I didn't think this book could possibly top \\"The Kite Runner\\" (a real favorite of mine), but it is equally as wonderful.  The turmoil of life in Afghanistan comes alive through the lives of two women brought together under disturbing circumstances.  They learn to live together with a brutal, abusive husband and everyday hardships which make you cringe.  It is the story of motherhood, love, friendship, and sacrifice.  Mariam and Laila are wonderful characters and you hold your breath waiting for their lives to get better.  If you enjoyed \\"The Kite Runner\\", you will enjoy \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\"  It is a very moving and wonderful book.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Just twenty-two months since releasing her debut album, 19-year-old Rihanna is already on her way to superstardom, not to mention she has two #1 hits under her belt. Since embarking on her quest to top the charts worldwide, Rihanna has continued to defy original predictions that the \\"Pon de Replay\\" star would remain a one-hit-wonder.<br /><br />On her third album, `Good Girl Gone Bad,' Rihanna offers the strongest track listing to date, full of club hits like \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" and \\"Breakin' Dishes.\\" Even though her vocals arguably have not improved since her `Music of the Sun' days, the production more than makes up for this factor. The greatest example of this is her #1 single \\"Umbrella,\\" which has already become one of the songs of Summer 2007.<br /><br />Even though the majority of Rihanna's new material is up-tempo, her duet with Ne-Yo, \\"Hate That I Love You,\\" is a refreshing change of pace and doesn't slow down the momentum of the album. Although it does sound like a cookie-cutter Ne-Yo track, it still helps balance out the speed-driven \\"Shut Up and Drive\\" tracks.<br /><br />Although overall a major improvement from `Sun' and `A Girl Like Me,' `Bad' has its share of weak album tracks, including \\"Say It\\" and \\"Question Existing.\\" Neither of these tracks should have left the studio on the album. \\"Rehab,\\" on the other hand, is actually catchy (and could fit a lot of today's stars' lives like a glove), and the mid-tempo \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is a great way to end the album in Nelly Furtado fashion.<br /><br />No matter how hard Rihanna tries to convince the world that she has gone bad, nothing will change the fact that this album is surprisingly good.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale was the kick up the backside that the Bond series needed if it wished to carry on forward and compete with the younger pretenders such as the Bourne series or even the Jack Ryan series. With the absurd invisible car in Die Another Day, things were getting too cartoonish and despite good box-office receipts it will only be a matter of time before fans had enough. <br /> <br />In steps Daniel Craig, a new Bond taking on a familiar story, Fleming's first foray of James Bond, Casino Royale. Craig's chance at Bond was met with mixed feelings, some even setting up websites in protest. This, before even filming took place, was unfair and misguided. However, it worked in the film's favour anyway as the publicity helped the film shoot through the box-office roof and without much help of PR and advertising either. <br /> <br />Craig is a tougher Bond, steely like Connery and without the comedy routine that Roger Moore brought to the role. He is a brilliant Bond, a man who is at war with his own morality as well as his enemies, a theme that hasn't really explored in previous Bond films. <br /> <br />Eva Green is sexy AND intelligent as Vesper Lynd, and it is by no means just another bit of crumpet for Bond. It is through her fate that Bond becomes the cold-hearted ruthless killing machine that we have come to know. <br /> <br />Mads Mikkelsen plays the chilling - though not the main villain as we find out near the end - Le Chiffre. Unlike other Bond villains he has no clear quirks (ala Dr. evil) but he does weep tears of blood when in stressful situations. <br /> <br />In fact on the whole CASINO ROYALE loses most of the gimmicks and familiar base-situated-in-a-volcano that has grown over the years in Bond movies(to the absurd point in Moonraker). The gadgets are near non-existent, CGI is minimal, and so the stunts are amazing as always (especially the crane jump near the beginning). Even the famous, iconic Bond tune is only heard at the end. <br /> <br />The only critism that can befall CASINO ROYALE is the avoidance of today's terrorist climate. The film does involve terrorism but avoids it front on (the bad guys here are arms dealers). This still seems like a world where 9/11 hasn't happened, and that MI6 are still trudging after arms dealers and misfits rather than terror groups. The Soviets were fair game for Bond when the Cold War was on, so how about Iran or North Korea? <br /> <br /> <br />

0385340559|5.0|Revenge novels are always among the top of my Must-Read list.  The excitement of a well-written book with a dangerous hero shoved in the underdog's role and up against impossible odds hooks me every time.  Throw in a great character with a - mostly - realistic history and abilities and I'm a happy guy.<br /><br />For the last few years, Lee Child has been writing about a character named Jack Reacher.  Reacher is an awesome hero, not only is he incredibly physical (6'5\\" tall and 250 pounds), but he's also canny as a fox, something of an idiot savant when it comes to numbers, and has a near-photographic memory for people and places.  Oh, and then there's the personal radar system that signals him whenever he's on dangerous ground.<br /><br />After leaving his military career, Reacher has become something of a vagabond near-do-well.  He hasn't ever married, never had children, doesn't own a house, and doesn't even have a driver's license.  He has a habit of getting on buses and just letting them take them wherever they're going.  Footloose, fancy-free, and always in trouble.  He works just enough to get by.  The only things he owns these days is a folding toothbrush, and - as a result of the 9/11 crisis - a passport and an ATM card.<br /><br />The novels are always over the top when it comes to plot and action, but Child writes them so well that if the characters were real and the situations were true, fans just know this is how it would be.<br /><br />BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE is the eleventh Reacher novel and just came out in hardcover.  The other ten are all in paperback.  Child is so good that he's moved onto my hardcover buy-list because I don't want to wait a year for the paperback.  It takes a lot to make that list because space in my house is at a premium.  He's already working on his twelfth Reacher novel, PLAY DIRTY.<br /><br />When Reacher was a military policeman ten years ago, he headed up a special team of eight trained investigators.  Their jobs then had been to catch the bad guys - murderers, black marketers, con artists, and runaways - that operated within the United States Army.  Over the two years the unit was together, they went up against some true hardcases and put their lives on the line nearly every day.  Back then, they'd had a motto:  \\"You don't mess with the special investigators.\\"<br /><br />That motto became a lifeline for them.  No one was allowed to attack any member of the unit without the other seven taking part.  During those two years, they'd covered each other's back through a number of close calls - against bullets and against commanding officers who hadn't cared for their investigations.  They'd never lost anyone.<br /><br />Now someone had killed one of them.  Reacher and the survivors of the unit get together for one more special investigation, and their whole mission is to rock and roll the killer's world.<br /><br />I loved the whole revenge concept, and Child starts the action off with a cinematic murder.  A man is loaded onto a helicopter, flown out into the Nevada desert a short distance from Las Vegas, and dropped three thousand feet to his death.  Later we find out this was to strip all forensic evidence from the body.  (It's an interesting idea, but I'll have to do the research on that one to find out.  I'm something of an amateur forensics person.)<br /><br />Immediately Child shifts to Reacher, who has just discovered that someone has deposited $1030 into his bank account.  After a little bit of headwork, Reacher draws the conclusion that someone has sent him a message.  He knows it could only have come from his old crew.  A 1030 call signified that an agent was in trouble.<br /><br />Child's writing has always been economical.  He's never used six words when five would do.  Or one.  His plotting is quick and tight, and if you don't pay attention you're going to miss something.  He is, by turns bashing the reader with action and subtle about character interaction, history, and back story for the plot.  Everything matters in his books, and he uses everything he develops.<br /><br />BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE is written so lean and frantic that I read it in two sittings.  Since the book is almost 400 pages long and has smallish print, that was a lot of reading.  Several hours, in fact.  But Child kept me nailed to the seat because I could never quite put the book down once he had it up and running.  I finally passed out with it on my chest at night, then got up the next morning and finished it.<br /><br />Child doesn't write books that let facts or reality get in the way.  He stays close to the bone in those areas, but he's an excellent thriller writer and knows when to trust his instincts and let the story have its head no matter how wild it gets.  He's also got a great grasp of Reacher and the other characters, because even though this is thriller material, all of the old unit came to life on the pages.<br /><br />With its June release, BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE is an excellent beach read.

0440238609|5.0|As many reviewers have already stated, this trilogy is amazingly written.  It is an intense experience mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, challenging the reader to consider his or her views about the world we live in by introducing a very different world.  Also, as several reviewers have stated, it presents a strong critique of organized religion.  As with all material, parents should become aware of the issues presented in the book and discuss them with their children.  For those who believe in God (that includes me), let me say this: although the storyline does not directly reflect my beliefs about God, it says this to me: any \\"church\\" that brings about ignorance, corruption, bondage, deception, and death (rather than freedom, life and truth) is no church that I want to support or follow.  It is a wonderful story about life and growing up, as long as you are willing to confront the reasons you believe as you do.
B000AL730O|4.0|Paul McCartney's Chaos And Creation In The Backyard (2005) is another \\"McCartney\\" one-man-band exercise, where Paul writes all of the songs, plays all of the instruments (except orchestration), and sings all of the vocals. Why, I'm not sure. We all know he can do it. Anyway, McCartney is certainly more than up to performing all of these tasks, and he sounds great. There are some real gems here. Jenny Wren, an acoustic guitar Blackbird/Julia hybrid about a gentle girl who is affected by an insensitive world, is one of his solo best, and English Tea is a very British, classically orchestrated tune in the tradition of Martha, My Dear. A Certain Softness is a mildly bossa nova And I Love Her twin that works very well, and Riding To Vanity Fair is a moody but all-too-rare McCartney hate-song. This Never Happened Before and Anyway are piano based McCartney love songs, and both sound very, very good. Both are also emotionally engaging in that warm, optimistic way that many of Paul's songs are. Promise To You Girl is the only place on the album that features a major electric guitar solo, and it's nothing to write home about (I find myself wishing Paul would have brought in Eric Clapton like George did on The Beatles' While My Guitar Gently Weeps). Still, the song is really good, and so is Fine Line, which sort of almost rocks, too. Like the other songs that I have mentioned, these are the gems. Great stuff, that's not to be missed. I can't get enough of hearing them, they're that good. The songs I haven't mentioned on the album, How Kind Of You, At The Mercy, Friends To Go, Too Much Rain, and Follow Me are pleasant, but sound too much like an exercise in songwriting to be effective. Good, but...well, kind of boring. Anyway, if Paul would have rocked this album out a little more it could have been his best solo effort, and that's saying a lot. It's still a very enjoyable album, and it does have some real McCartney gems, just no real McCartney  rock.

0064407667|4.0|Reviewers name: Emily Hargrave <br />Title: The Bad Beginning <br />Author: Lemony Snicket <br />Publisher: Harbor Collins Children's books <br />Copyright date: September 1999 <br />Number of pages: 176 <br /> <br />Theirs many books I read and didn't like, but some I do like.  Well Lemony Snicket us the creator of A Series of Unfortunate Events.  He starts the series with The Bad Beginning.   <br /> <br />The whole story is about three orphans and how they live through misery.  Their parents die in a horrible fire, and have to live with a distant relative that's devoted to take the Baudelaires fortune.  He makes them cook and clean and do chores.  But with an evil plot that has someone saying \\"I do.\\"  Theirs violet who is the oldest of the three and is an inventor, then Klaus who is the genius and the middle child, and Sunny who is the baby of the family but she makes the use of her teeth very helpful when needed to.  Then there's Count Olaf who has one eyebrow, tattoo of an eye on his left ankle, and is tall and skinny.  And Mr. Poe who is the man in charge of the fortune until Violet becomes of age to get it.  Many settings get taken place like Count Olaf's house, the judge' house and the theatres where Violet almost married count Olaf. <br />I had many favorite parts, but my most favorite part is when violet was smart to put Master Count Olaf, and instead of marrying him she ended up saving her fortune.  <br />  <br />What I think the book is mainly about how not everything is peachy clean as it seems.  Instead of having a happy ending like most books The Bad Beginning is showing that not every life is living in a fantasy, they live in the real world.  And in the real world theirs no prince charming or fairies, theirs life and it isn't pretty. <br />  <br />To me the book was excellent; I enjoyed how the author went between the story, to him talking to you.  He would tell the story and then explain what he was saying, like he was talking to the person that wasreading it.  And the book had god twist and turns that I didn't want to put down the book.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good book and don't want to put it down.  Also recommend this book to anyone that doesn't really like happy endings. <br />
B00003CX9E|5.0|When wealthy media magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies, he utters the enigmatic word \\"Rosebud\\". An obituary newsreel documents the events in his public life. The producer of the newsreel asks a reporter, Thompson (William Alland), to find out about Kane's private life and personality, in particular to discover the meaning behind his last word. The reporter interviews the great man's friends and associates, and Kane's story unfolds as a series of flashbacks.<br /><br />First, Thompson approaches Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore), who refuses to tell him anything. Thompson then goes to the library of Mr. Thatcher (George Coulouris). It is there that Thompson learns about Kane's childhood. In the first flashback, Kane as a young child is abandoned by his mother (Agnes Moorehead) when he becomes suddenly wealthy, and sent to live with his banker, Mr Thatcher, despite the misgivings of Kane's father.<br /><br />Other flashbacks show Kane's entry into the newspaper business and his profit-seeking with low-quality \\"yellow journalism\\". He takes control of the newspaper and hires all the best journalists (which he gets from the Inquirer's rival, The Chronicle). His attempted rise to power is documented, including his first marriage to a President's niece and his campaign for the office of governor. A \\"love nest\\" scandal ends both his marriage and his political aspirations. Kane remarries, but his domineering personality destroys his relationships and pushes away his loved ones.<br /><br />Despite Thompson's numerous interviews with the people in Kane's life, he is unable to solve the mystery; he concludes that \\"Rosebud\\" will remain an enigma. However, the camera pans over workers burning some of Kane's many possessions. One throws an old sled, with the word \\"Rosebud\\" painted on it, into the fire, the same sled that Kane was riding as a child the day his mother sent him away. There is a shot of a chimney with black smoke coming out. After this twist ending, the film ends as it began, with the \\"No Trespassing\\" sign. The closing shot shows the \\"K\\" on top of the iron fence.<br /><br />Susan with a symbolic jigsaw puzzleCitizen Kane has inspired myriad interpretations over the decades. In Orson Welles: Hello Americans, Simon Callow argued that Citizen Kane should not just be understood as a fictional work but also as a post-fictional piece: a piece where the audience is drawn in to view themselves in the process of watching the film. In a 1941 review, Jorge Luis Borges called Citizen Kane a \\"metaphysical detective story,\\" in that \\"... [its] subject (both psychological and allegorical) is the investigation of a man's inner self, through the works he has wrought, the words he has spoken, the many lives he has ruined...\\" Borges noted that \\"Overwhelmingly, endlessly, Orson Welles shows fragments of the life of the man, Charles Foster Kane, and invites us to combine them and reconstruct him.\\" As well, \\"Forms of multiplicity and incongruity abound in the film: the first scenes record the treasures amassed by Kane; in one of the last, a poor woman, luxuriant and suffering, plays with an enormous jigsaw puzzle on the floor of a palace that is also a museum.\\" Borges points out that \\"... At the end we realize that the fragments are not governed by a secret unity: the detested Charles Foster Kane is a simulacrum, a chaos of appearances.\\"<br /><br />The film combines revolutionary cinematography (by Gregg Toland, with whom Welles shared a title card, which was a gesture of Welles' appreciation for Toland's overall contribution to the film, much like John Ford previously shared credit with Toland for The Long Voyage Home) with an Oscar-winning screenplay (by Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz -- though most film history circles consider Mankiewicz's contribution to the screenplay to be far greater than that of Welles), and a lineup of first time film actors, associates of Mr. Welles from his stint at the Mercury Theatre, such as Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead.This a true work of film art and many have tried to unsuccessfully emulate the camera angles and the methodology of the angles and pathos.<br /><br />Noel Serrano<br /><br />Gala Foundationercury Theatre, such as Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead.This a true work of film art and many have tried to unsuccessfully emulate the camera angles and the methodology of the angles and pathos. <br /> <br />Noel Serrano <br />Gala Foundation <br />
033041836X|5.0|Name: Brianna Gagnon <br />Title: Lucky <br />Author: Alice Sebold <br />Publisher: First Back Bay <br />Copyright date: 1999 <br />Total number of pages: 246 <br /> <br /> <br />Have you ever had a close call and all you could think to say is\\" that was lucky?\\" Alice sebolds book lucky is the definition of a close call. <br />Alice sebolds true life story is about how she made it through life with the knowledge that she was different from everyone else in the sense that she wasn't pure, whole, or wanted. Someone having the power to make you feel unwanted and useless for the rest of your life is the most unnecessary feeling to have. It tears your self-esteem down to nothing and disintegrates your confidents in yourself. This story is telling you her personal true experiences with her rape, and what she did to overcome her hard times. The feeling of importance can change everything around. This event takes place in Pennsylvania while she is away at college. Alice is the main person in her marvelously well written novel. The resolution to her troubles is that the man that raped her did not get away with it. He was sent to trial and was found guilty of raping two college girls. In this book there is a terrifying twist. Something that will make you want to keep reading.  <br />The best part of this particular Novel was the ending. The ending was the most rewarding to me as a reader because the man that raped these girls will be in jail thinking about how he hurt these girls and there families. How he will never get to hurt another girl again. And the fact that he got what he deserved is still not enough to make the pain and destruction go away. But even with that Alice went on with her life living it to the fullest with nothing coming in her way. <br />To me as the reader of this book the main idea was to never let anything or anyone get in the way of living your life , and to never give up hope no matter how hard things get because you are strong .Life is an important thing to keep as your own. And you have to protect it as your own. <br />I liked this book a lot because it really made me think about how I have such a  good life and how I am truly lucky to not of had this sad and depressing hard trouble like Alice because I don't think that I could have done what she has done. This book has made me rethink my outlook on my life as a person. I now know that I have a great life and that I that no matter what how much negativity is thrown out there, there is just as much or more optimist out there too. You just have to look for it. <br />
B000O77RL4|3.0|\\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" presents the Battle of Iwo Jima, where American and Japanese troops clashed in 1945, from the Japanese point of view, as a companion piece to director Clint Eastwood's \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\", which addressed the American experience of the same battle. This film is partly based on letters written by Japanese who perished there, but many characters and conversations are fictional. Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) determines that a conventional beach defense of Iwo Jima will quickly fail and orders the creation of an extensive tunnel system and a northern defensive line. Kuribayashi's unorthodox strategy breeds dissent among his officers, while he prepares the troops to fight a losing battle against the approaching American armada. The trials and fears of the average soldier are represented by Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a reluctant but resigned Private, who thinks of his family back home and runs afoul of his strict superiors.<br /><br />\\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" imbues Japanese soldiers with American values in order to make them sympathetic, and it posits the two wisest officers, General Kuribayashi and Lt. Colonel Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), as more enlightened for having had contact with American culture. This might be interpreted as American ethnocentrism, but I think that the implication is simply that these men are better-equipped to understand their enemy, because they are more worldly than many of their compatriots. Japan's isolation and ignorance of other cultures led to grave miscalculations during World War II. General Kuribayashi opposed the war with the United States that he died fighting. The familiar values that the soldiers reveal through their letters and interactions seem more like a missed opportunity to present the Japanese mindset than a serious cultural blunder.<br /><br />Once I mulled over the film's obvious manipulations, however, I found that there was little else. \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" presents a vague, impressionistic view of the Battle of Iwo Jima. We can't make out much of the Japanese strategy, what is going on, or how long it lasts. The battle lasted nearly 40 days, whereas the film gives the impression of about a week. This film ignores the Battle's salient points in favor of sentimentality: The Japanese soldiers are honorable, loyal men who would nevertheless rather be at home with their families than burned alive in a futile attempt to defend a useless little island. I never would have guessed. This doesn't do General Kuribayashi's daring strategy justice or comment on Japan's decision to sacrifice 20,000 men, without air or sea support, in a stalling tactic. The substance and drama are in the strategic decisions, rationale, and implications, which the film relegates to background. \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" does everything it can to avoid pointed analysis and embrace cliches.<br /><br />The washed-out color palette struck me from the first frame of the first scene. \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is in color but desaturated to the point of nearly monochrome, like a faded old photograph. Desaturating the color can be useful in films where a lot of bright red blood would distract the audience from other elements. This palette isn't unattractive, but my eyes never got used to it. My mind involuntarily kept concentrating to make out the color. This was distracting. The other visually notable feature is the scenes of American Marines invading the beaches of Iwo Jima, which are quite beautiful, but alas do not look remotely real. They are obviously CGI. The cinematographic stylization is probably too heavy-handed for its own good, which would not be a first for Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />The superficiality of \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" might not bother me if this material were not so rich in drama, irony, and insight: An opponent of war with America leads his troops to certain death against Americans. 20,000 men consigned to cannon fodder to buy a little time. Kuribayashiand Baron Nishi did not get along, which is more interesting than the trite friendship in the movie. A smart commander hampered by foolish underlings. A heroic defense of a hopeless cause. A completely different world view. Some Japanese soldiers lived in the tunnels for years afterward, because they didn't dare surrender. That would have made a nice epilogue if anyone really wanted to make a film about the Japanese perspective. And Iwo Jima was of no value to either Japan or the US. What could be better material for a thoughtful war movie? I was entertained by \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", but Clint Eastwood has managed to transform an incisive, disturbing moment in human history into something vague, mawkish, and utterly without substance.

Dear John is that typical book with more love and more meaning than all the other ones you may have read.  <br /> In Dear John, John and Savannah fall in love at first sight. Savannah is your intellectual, perfect southern girl. Her life's goal is to make a difference in the lives of children who are Autistic. John on the other hand grew up a rebel and as a way to get out he joined the U.S army and got a crew cut. The two fall passionately in love one summer on the coast of North Carolina in a small town where John grew up and everyone dies a hero. They spend two weeks together, and they are never apart. John learns a horrible truth about his own father through Savannah and he has to cope with the problem for a long time. But then John who is stationed in Germany has to return. He then goes to Germany for a full year. Will things ever be the same between the couple? Since John is gone so much? Savannah falls for another guy and they soon get married. Leaving John to a military life forever because he has nothing to come home to. But when he finally comes home he comes home to 2 tragedies that test his heart in so many ways. Savannah is hurting so badly but he can't help, or can he? After many years away John still loves her but there comes a time when you have to put someone else's love in front of yours to do the right thing even if it hurts. That's a greatest lesson he will ever learn. <br /> This book is so great; I can hardly choose a favorite part. Every time Savannah and John are together you feel how they feel and you can see just how much love there is between them, jus through the way they talk to each other. The ending was also my favorite part; it leaves you waiting for a sequel. So the connection between characters and the ending are my favorite parts.   <br /> The theme of the book would have to be love. Love is so general but one you read the book you'll see how every aspect of love is in this story. John learns so many lessons through true love, he has to choose when to love and when to help who you love, all he leans through heart ache and tears.  <br /> I thought Dear John was an amazing story and not one word should change to it. It's a book you can never lay down. I would recommend this book to any reader in high school or older who is searching for a great love story.  <br />
B000PHX4VA|4.0|This year, there seems to be a lot of classic rock returning to the concert touring schedules. With the hype of classic rock groups like Genesis that have hit some well-received raves, and others groups like Foreigner that have been flops, many are anxiously eager to see something different than who has to be hot on MTV. Nonetheless, the one groups that everybody is anxiously waiting for is The Police. It has been one of the biggest surprises this past year, as Sting, Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers reunited and delivered to concert seekers. Now, to celebrate the reunion, a new hits collection has hit the shelves, and here it is.<br /><br />The 2007 Police is a double album retrospective celebrating the British Rock groups 30th anniversary, and their reunion tour. The collection spans throughout the groups 70's and early to mid 80's success. The songs here have all been remastered well, and deliver the classic rock to a whole new audience. The collection includes classics like the #1 smash Every Breath You Take, Don't Stand So Close To Me, Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, the haunting Wrapped Around Your Finger, and Message In A Bottle. The collection also includes tracks that've been overlooked from their previous Every Breath You Take: The Classics hits album including Synchronicity I, and their first tracks like Fallout, Demolition Man and So Lonely. Still, there are a few tracks overlooked like their 1986 driven remake of Don't Stand So Close To Me, but the collection does deliver absolutely well.<br /><br />All in all, The Police is a great hits package that works very well in welcoming a new generation to one of the most influential Rock groups of all time. If you are a die hard Police fan, or a newcomer to their music than you'll definitely want to hear this great hits package. I absolutely recommend this. No matter what happens, every breath they took, we are still listening to them.<br /><br />Album Cover: A-<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: A<br /><br />Overall: B+>Price: B+ <br /> <br />Remastering: A <br /> <br />Overall: B+
0743277708|5.0|Author: Richard Adams <br />Book: Watership Down <br />Publisher: Scribner; Reprint edition <br /> <br />This 476 page book was a long read but it was worth it with its twists, turns and immense detail. You'll never want to put it down, I know I didn't. <br />In Watership Down by Richard Adams a bunch of rabbits must make their way through the dangers in their life if they are to survive. They have to find a new home, one where they can live free, happily and with no humans. When they finally do make it to that place there are only male rabbits  in there group so now they have to find they females that are held up in the Efrafa bunker like rabbit society without getting killed by both animal and human alike. <br />My most favorite parts are where Dandelion tells the stories about El-ahrairah rabbit. He was the chief rabbit to begin with in the very beginning of the story. He is their so called \\"Adam\\". They stories add a better twist to the book. I love all of the adventures he has. My most favorite story of his would have to be The King's Lettuce. It was a very crafty plan. <br />I thought that the theme of the story was finding your safe haven in life isn't always the easiest thing to do. <br />In the book Watership Down by Richard Adams the part that I liked best was the whole book. I wouldn't want Adams to change anything about the book. Maybe add a sequel to it is about it. I don't recommend this to people who don't like reading or animals. This book is a really long one and the main characters are rabbits. <br />
0141439661|5.0|I picked up this book largely due to fond memories of [[ASIN:0743487591 Pride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)]], but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right.  I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry.  I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.<br /><br />The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness.  Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility).  How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book.  They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were.  The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good.  There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.<br /><br />I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending.  I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.<br /><br />In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading.
0743454537|4.0|She was created as a lifeline for her sister and has had enough, but how could she just let her sister die?  The book, My Sister's Keeper, revolves around the disease, leukemia.  Anna has always been Kate's donor; she was born to keep Kate alive.  But Anna has had too much, and feels that giving one of her kidneys could hold her back and not necessarily help her sister either.  This book tells the story of Anna's battle for medical emancipation and includes the perspective of many other characters that this disease encounters. <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult did a great job of showing how one thing can have an effect on many other things.  Although the ending was heart wrenching, I loved that my assumptions were blown out of the water and kept me reading until the very last sentence. <br /> <br />I feel that the main idea of this story is the fact that one event can have an affect on a person that is completely different than what it did to another.  Picoult wrote My Sister's Keeper, in many perspectives - with chapters alternating each character's narrative and having them tell the reader how an event affected them, and then in the next chapter, another character getting a entirely opposite impact from the same event. <br /> <br />I loved that in this book each of the characters got to tell their story, but then their story related to someone else's story.  I wish that this book would have had more medical information about both Kate and Anna.  But I think that Picoult did a great job of balancing both the story line and the medical facts.  Anyone could choose to read this book, but it would be a challenging read of a 13 year old and too heavy for anyone younger than that.  So, I would say that this book would be appropriate for young adults to adults. <br /> <br />This is a great novel that everyone should read.  It is an emotional story with conflicting morals throughout, (where Picoult is unbiased and lets you see both sides of the story), yet the love and friendshipbetween the two sisters is moving and will make you seriously consider reading more of her books (and becoming an organ donor). <br />
0425200469|5.0|This was my first Hercule Poirot novel and I found it to be quite a good read. The characters were interesting and we definitely learn more about them and their motivations as the story unfolds. Relatively little is what it seems to be on the surface and it is up to the vacationing Poirot to untangle this complex web. The story moves along at a strong pace and is peppered with dialogue that remains witty and charming even after so many decades have passed since this book was written.  <br /> <br />Even though my suspicion about the solution to the crime proved to be true, there were more than enough details that I had not worked out that I was still very interested in the reveal at the end. Based on my enjoyment of \\"Death on the Nile\\" I have already purchased more novels starring the inimitable Poirot and am learning more and more why this character has endured for so long.

He caused those 19 minutes which changed the lives of the kids of sterling high forever. Peter was Josie Cormier's best friend until she became popular, and started dating Matt Rowlson who he despised, as he was one of the ones who picked on him everyday, which is what caused peters killing spree.    This book shows how one tiny event or a simple action of one single person can cause a huge chain of events ending with a massive event, or in this case, a tragedy.    This book had a huge amount of detail, and it keeps you hooked to the point where you truly do not want to put it down. The character building is done so well that while your reading, you feel like you know the characters, and you stay connected with their emotions and actions. When anything happens to the characters in the book, it almost seems like they are someone you really know.    I honestly think that high school students should read this book. The story shows perspectives and feelings of different groups and cliques in school, and makes you realize how other people might feel about actions you make, that you wouldn't realize otherwise. The story shows how harsh of an effect bullying can have on people, which most people don't realize unless they're on the receiving end of it. For high school students it would put so much into perspective, and make them think twice about how they treat people

B000P2A256|1.0|I loved their first album, Songs About Jane, and couldn't wait until they put out another album.  I was so disappointed, and wished I'd listened to the samples first before purchasing it.  The first album was very passionate, unique, and soulful.  In this one, it's obvious they've sold out and are now writing songs to the demographics their producers and agents have told them to write for - 13-18 yr. old girls.  Hopefully they will find themselves again in the future and put out music that's an expression of themselves, not what will them make a quick buck and spot on MTV.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|Rather than rating individual songs as most other reviewers do I shall try to quantify issues that could be metes for a progressive rock album in general. Ofcourse these quantifications are subjective. <br /> <br />GENERAL ISSUES <br /> <br />Coherence (4.5/5): Was the album coherent? As in would one hear the album as a whole? SFAM and SDOIT (disk 2) are examples of DT albums that are coherent. Octavarium is an example of an album thats a potpourri of generically incompatible songs -even though the song octavarium is one of dts best- and hence lacks coherence. Systematic chaos possesses this quality.   <br /> <br />Continuity (4.5/5): This too is partially related the above issue. Do parts within a song transition smoothly, and do the songs themselves transition well between each other. This again is a yes. SFAM,Images and words and SDOIT all possess this quality. <br /> <br />Creative Integrity (3.5/5): In layman's refers to how creative the \\"chord progressions\\" and the \\"scale changes\\" are. Songs like SDOIT and Octavarium are works of genius in this respect. (Observe how the scales change from one movement to another in Octavarium only to come back to where it all started; all this coupled with intricate progressions layered by the orchestra. These arent things too many people look at sadly when people listen to DT. People into Western Classical could appreciate this side of DT. Its a dimension of thought that transcends the conventional school of thought in rock music in general). This album doesnt entirely satisfy this criteria sadly. Personally I was expecting a 5 or a 6 movement song with intricate diminished chord arpeggios on the strings integrated into a mesh of finely layered minor pentatonics from Petrucci all coming together into one beautiful melody surpassing all their previous efforts in this line. In the presence of enemies keeps going into sections of chromatic interplay between petrucci and the others. Its okay if these stretches are short but if theyre too long what can happen is the listener can get into a sort of sonic ambiguity not really comprehending what scale the artist is on. There are times when I personally feel like taking the mix of \\"In the presence pt II\\" and deleting these sections. Having said that the basic tune is very nice.  <br /> <br />artistic integrity (4/5) : Here Im refering to the individual virtuosity. Personally Im more into feel guitaring than this newer school of \\"speed\\". Petrucci can do both to perfection. Portnoys role in this record was more limited than the previous records. This could be attributed to the mix which I shall address next. <br /> <br />The mix (4.5/5): Its very evident that a lot of thought was put into the mix. Most notably the drums are compactly integrated into the mix. The bass drum isnt isolated out (as it was in Octavarium). The symbals could have been louder at times. Myung has phrased his bass lines very well in this album. Hes used a more defined bass tone for one and its not all continuous basslines as in the previous albums. This has definetly enhanced the listening experience - for example look at the bass phrasing in \\"in the presence pt.1\\"-. The guitar tones could have been better in this album.While a lot of the lead patches are spot on with a certain warmth, the rhythm patches have a lot to be desired. They could have been warmer with higher mids. Labries vocals are good as usual. I for one am a Labrie fan. He has amazing range and more importantly a tone like cotton. Another interesting song regarding the mix is \\"forsaken\\" which has sort of emulated an evanescence-esq feel with the orchestra and rhythm guitar mixing very well. The general Mix is very coherent. Not too many things are heard in isolation which to me is a good thing.-Just listen to Change of seasons and listen to this; You'll see the difference -. <br /> <br />So the \\"Overall Rating\\" of this album would hence be some sort of a weighted sum of the above. Dont really have the patienceto do all that. A rough estimate is 4 stars.
B000LXHK2C|2.0|After reading some rave reviews, my husband and I settled down on the couch for our \\"date night\\". I am sorry to report that we were both sorely disappointed in the movie. We are both huge Russell Crowe fans but this may be his worst acting in a long time. I'm not sure that it is his fault so much as the script. I had a hard time believing that this \\"heartless, ruthless\\" male chauvinist (his character is ALWAYS staring at a woman's chest or derriere) is what became of the sweet, thoughtful boy that is wonderfully depicted by the young actor. In fact, the boy and Abbie Cornish, who plays his cousin, are the true stars of this movie. In my opinion, this movie does not hold a candle to true classics like \\"Under the Tuscan Sun.\\"
B000P0IW6E|5.0|True to their name, the Scorpions never fail to amaze us with their unique blend of \\"heavy rock.\\" The song writing ability of Meine/Schenker, five brilliant musicians and one of the very well-known producers combine to make Humanity Hour 1 a delightful listening experience.  \\"Hour 1\\" begins with Kottak's drums (ala Megadeth's TRUST) before the rest of the band joins in.  \\"Humanity\\" \\"Game of life\\" \\"We were born to fly\\" represent a good blend of melodies and powerful riffs...my favorite being \\"The Cross\\" cuz of its infectious rhythm and guitar work! <br /> <br />As Klaus Meine sang in Lovedrive \\"I'd like to show why scorpions got a sting...\\" they sure do! Happy listening folks :-)
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Perhaps I'm being too generous by giving the LIVE AID dvd set 5-stars. As another reviewer pointed out, many performances are left off of this set. However, some of the biggest acts of the 80s are shown performing their monster hits with the exception of TINA TURNER, WHAM, and THE THOMPSON TWINS. Although these performers do appear with other singers/musicians, the footage of them performing their hits was either destroyed or lost. I'm sure there might be other examples of groups/singers who appear on the LIVE AID dvds and they're not performing their big hits, but, as far as I can tell, most of them are.<br /><br />The fact that there's even a dvd set available is a miracle in itself.<br /><br />A booklet that comes with the dvd set explains the idea behind LIVE AID and how BOB GELDOF (singer of THE BOOMTOWN RATS) saw a BBC News report on television in 1984 (the news footage is included at the start of dvd #1) about the famine going on in Africa/Ethiopia. He wanted to do something about it and formed BAND AID in the UK. This in turn formed U.S.A FOR AFRICA in the US, which ultimately led to the LIVE AID concert which happened on July 13, 1985. The concert was filmed by MTV, ABC and the BBC, and aired on its respective channel with an estimated 1.5 billion viewers around the world.<br /><br />According to the dvd's producer, Jill Sinclair, Geldof wanted the concert to be shown only once and not recorded. ABC took Geldof at his word and destroyed the footage so it could never be re-broadcast again. The BBC ignored him but lost some of the footage, while the videos that weren't lost, sat collecting dust. MTV found over 100 tapes of b-roll of the concert and so Sinclair, and the rest of the LIVE AID dvd team, combined MTV's footage of the LIVE AID concert, with the remaining BBC footage and that's how we get this remarkable 4-dvd set! So bravo to Jill Sinclair and the dvd team.<br /><br />The concert took place at Wembley Stadium in London and JFK Stadium in Philadelphia. The dvds go back and forth from Wembley to JFK, but transitions smoothly, so there aren't any jarring cuts in between the musical acts. Considering that this concert was recorded using analog equipment and was meant for a one-time only showing, the footage itself has been restored as best as it could be and it looks pretty good (sharp, vibrant color, etc.). There are some instances where wavy-horizontal lines appear on close-up shots on some of the performances, and Sinclair explains in the booklet that this is a phenomenon called \\"microphany,\\" which happens when the \\"camera lens is affected by great volume.\\" The lines aren't that distracting since they aren't colored, and they don't distort the picture, but they're just noticeable. It only happens once in a while and according to the booklet, only on some UK performances.<br /><br />Along with the performances, the LIVE AID dvd set also includes extras:<br /><br />DVD #1<br /><br />**BBC TV NEWS REPORT<br /><br />**BAND AID - DO THEY KNOW IT'S CHRISTMAS - music video<br /><br />**U.S.A FOR AFRICA - WE ARE THE WORLD - \\"...\\"<br /><br />DVD #4-(includes performances recorded at different locations/times and either broadcast that day or never televised)<br /><br />**INXS - What You Need; Don't Change<br /><br />**B.B. KING - Why I Sing The Blues; Don't Answer The Door; Rock Me Baby<br /><br />**ASHFORD & SIMPSON with TEDDY PENDERGRASS - Reach Out And Touch(Somebody's Hand)<br /><br />**RUN DMC - King Of Rock<br /><br />**CLIFF RICHARD - A World Of Difference<br /><br />**DAVID BOWIE & MICK JAGGER - Dancing In The Streets (this is actually the music video; according to wikipedia Bowie and Jagger were supposed to do a live duet on the song, with Bowie in London and Jagger in Philadelphia, but because of technical difficulties it couldn't be done)<br /><br />**DOCUMENTARY - Food And Trucks And Rock 'n' Roll<br /><br />Instead of a scene selection menu, the dvds have \\"search by artist\\" that lets you go right to the start of that performer's set (which will then play the rest of the concert from that point on, rather than going back to the menu). You also have the option to just play the Wembley performances or the Philadelphia perfomances.<br /><br />If you're too young to remember this concert, you might miss the significance of it. But it's still worth watching. Like Woodstock was to a generation before it, LIVE AID showed the world that young people could come together, through music, and collectively believe in something that could change the world. If you do remember this moment in time, watching this concert will bring back many memories.<br /><br />Some of the stand out performances on these dvds, IMO:<br /><br />FREDDIE MERCURY/QUEEN - The rapport between the audience and Mercury is incredible. He launches into an impromptu \\"scat\\" singing certain vowels to the audience and they sing it back to him, verbatim<br /><br />ELTON JOHN & GEORGE MICHAEL - John playing the piano, while Michael belts out John's \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\"<br /><br />PATTI LABELLE - The soul diva belting out her version of Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" and then going into \\"Forever Young.\\" Towards the end of the latter song, she puts down the microphone, walking up to the front of the stage and continues singing...and you can still hear her voice, barely audible, but powerful enough to be heard over the cheering crowd and the back-up singers<br /><br />TINA TURNER & MICK JAGGER - duet on \\"State Of Shock\\" Turner matches Jagger move for move and lip for lip<br /><br />So even though this set is not complete, it still deserves 5-stars.(which will then play the rest of the concert from that point on, rather than going back to the menu).

B0000025T6|5.0|Forget \\"Born to Run\\", and \\"Born in the USA\\", this is, with out a doubt, the best Springsteen album.  Please listen, and see just how eerie, and great this album is.
B000002UAT|5.0|Anyone that considers themselves a fan of pop/rock music should have this in their collection. It is the greatest pop album ever made. Period.
B000PGTPE6|4.0|This set is a live celebration of Springsteen's Seeger Sessions --- AND songs devoted to the restoration of New Orleans, some solid performances of Celtic favorites and an added tribute to the Civil Rights Movement. All are well-recorded (on CD) and filmed (on DVD). The Sessions Band is remarkable, and Springsteen again reveals himself as one of the few extant recording artists to evolve in a meaningful way.  The consistent quality of the performances, both aural and visual, are the work of a perfectionist at the top of his game. The pieces \\"sound\\" easy, but in the flawless performances they receive here, refinement is at the core.  A pity Sony/BMG packed the three disks in a  tri-folder made of very thin card stock. The sleeves on my two copies were too tight to release disks 1 and 3 without scratching disks or ripping the packaging.  With this exception, this is one of Springsteen's most unorthodox releases, well-executed by the artists and engineers, but not by package designers. This flaw should not dissuade a purchase.  The price is right, and the performances are inspiring.
B000O75F7C|4.0|Nice songwriting. I've read that the lyrics are not as abstact in the touchy feely way that some folks like in order to frame music within their own interpretation, but that was obviously not the intent here. <br />The album's theme is social in a generational subtext like the Who's Quadrophenia, a narrative, but much more than one man's plight. I don't think the message could have been couched in an indirect way and gotten the message across. This record hits you and pulls you in, and has so many nice layers, moods and nuances that I'm going to enjoy the seduction. Ultimately it moves me as a listener and I like that
B000NDIAWY|5.0|இ Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />ѾѾѾѾѾ Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!<br /><br />I saw her live when she recently stopped in Denver.  Watching the identical twin brothers in her band play guitar and bass on each side of her, wearing identical shirts and blue jeans, was interesting too. Great voice - the power of Melissa Etheridge, the emotional lilt of Sarah  McLachlan, the country/folk styling inspired by Patsy Cline.  The main reason that I did not give this 5 stars was that most of the songs are too consistently mellow and I miss some of the energy that was in her first album. The songs grew on me with repeated listenings, but I find that I tend to reach for this CD on rainy overcast days or contemplative winters while it is snowing outside more than playing the CD in its entirety during a sunny road trip or at a party.<br /><br />When I first heard \\"The Story\\" played on the radio, it immediately reminded me of the Sister 7 song \\"The Only Thing That's Real\\"  [[ASIN:B00004RHZW Wrestling Over Tiny Matters]]  in both the feeling of the lyrics and the torchy emotional vocals reminiscent of Melissa Etheridge.  If you really like \\"The Story\\" song on this CD, take a listen to Patrice Pike singing \\"The Only Thing That's Real\\"; her album is overall more rock and less folk, but both songs seem quite similar to me.<br /><br />\\"The Story\\":<br />I climbed across the mountain tops<br />Swam all across the ocean blue<br />I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules<br />But baby I broke them all for you<br />Because even when I was flat broke<br />You made me feel like a million bucks<br />Yeah you do and I was made for you<br /><br />\\"The Only Thing That's Real\\":<br />Out here it's 95 degrees in the shade<br />There's nothing left, but ashes of the plans we made<br />I'll be the last one standing, I'm not afraid<br />Of trippin' over myself, worrying 'bout<br />the things they said<br />It feels just like being alone<br />I wish I was at home with you<br />You're the only thing that's real're the only thing that's real
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The first time I saw \\"Shrek\\" I enjoyed it, thought it had some neat characters and really good animation.  But that was about it; I wasn't bowled right over and didn't see how it ranked up there with other animated movies from the early 2000s like \\"Spirited Away\\" and \\"Lilo & Stitch\\".  But quite a while later they brought out \\"Shrek 2\\", and more recently the third chapter, and they both looked good, and I decided that instead of going right into the newer ones, I'd go back.  Rent the first one over again and see if there was something I missed - even if there wasn't, it was pretty good the first time and would probably be a good refresher for the next ones. <br /> <br />  I don't know if the stars were way out of alignment that first time, or if I just wasn't in the proper frame of mind; but the most recent time around I enjoyed \\"Shrek\\" ten times as much.  So I stand corrected, it does belong up there in the same breath with \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" and \\"Spirited Away\\" and so on. <br /> <br />   In a fabulous kingdom, a monarch named Lord Farquand has banned all 'fairy tale creatures', and the elves, blind mice (3 of 'em), little pigs (3 again), and so on seek refuge anywhere they can, ending up en masse in the swamp around Shrek's wooden hovel, where Farquand's soldiers fear to tread.  Shrek is a big, green, powerful and occasionally bumbling ogre who isn't 'trying to be cranky while hiding his tenderness underneath' - he's sumltaneously a cranky lummox and a sweet-minded, noble creature of great heart (although that latter part is kind of a light hidden under a barrel for the first half of the movie).  So as not to give the whole story away, I'll skip to the jist - in order to force Farquand to lift his ban on the fairy tale creatures (thus enabling them to leave his home and leave Shrek in peace and solitude), Shrek agrees to embark on a journey (which a talking donkey named, appropriately enough, Donkey, accompanies him on) to rescue a sleeping princess from a castle guarded by a fierce dragon. <br /> <br />   The three main players of the show - Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona - are brilliant characters who play great off of one another.  The supporting cast is loaded with colorful individuals (the Gingerbread Man is a great show-stealer), and the movie is full of humorous fantasy action and some great, often wry, wit.  If one wanted to quibble, I still think it could have done without as much of an emphasis on flatulence-humor, but when it's got as much prime comedy and as much heart as \\"Shrek\\" does, who wants to quibble?  It's got everything you want in an All Ages movie, full of charm, adventure, humor, love and fantastic visuals, and textured - like some of the old bugs Bunny cartoons - with extra, subtly hidden, little jokes and moments that older viewers will appreciate but won't elicit too many awkward-to-answer questions from three year-old viewers.  And as a last note, don't forget to stay past the end credits for some final treats.  It's priceless. <br /> <br />
B000EGCITG|5.0|\\"Stupid Girls\\" and \\"U + Ur Hand\\" got the attention but \\"Who Knew\\" and \\"Nobody Knows\\" really are great standouts as well. Pink has great vocals and she's versatile (her acoustic songs sound great as her pop/rock songs). Pink is really talented and I'm really late in finding this out. But I will be checking out her \\"artistic\\" debut \\"M!ssundaztood\\" (her proper debut was \\"Can't Take Me Home\\"). The best thing about this album is that it has personality. I know that sounds silly but what I mean it's fleshed out. It's probably the most entertaining album I've heard all year.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Between 1905 and 1971 the Australian government had enacted a policy of forcibly removed all half-caste Aboriginal children to special training schools. The grown daughter of Molly wrote a book about her mother's experiences and this movie is an adaptation of that true story.  <br /> <br />In 1931, Molly and her younger cousins, Gracie and Daisy, were three half-caste children from Western Australia who were taken from their parents under government edict and sent to an institution, were taught to forget their families, their culture, and re-invent themselves as members of \\"white\\" Australian society. The three girls begin an epic journey back to Western Australia, traveling 1,500 miles on foot with no food or water, and navigating by following the fence that has been build across the nation to stem an over-population of rabbits. <br /> <br />Though the movie shows that the government's officer in charge had essentially good intentions. That these actions brought about by this policy were misguided and ultimately very destructive to Australia's Aborigine people and to the nation's moral fabric. This story of hope and survival will give you faith in the undying strength of the human spirit. Well worth watching. <br />
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Dream Theater is probably the best known and most imitated progressive metal band in the world and if truth be told, they probably pioneered the sub genre and if the didn't pioneer it, they certainly are responsible for bringing the genre to the forefront in the music world. I must have written sixty or seventy reviews of progressive bands and some, maybe a quarter, sound very close to Dream Theater and some of them are very good. I even have a Listmania List on Amazon entitled Know some other bands similar to Dream Theater. In short, they have become the measuring stick for other Progressive metal bands. Or if you want to face reality, Le Brie, Portnoy and company are the kings of Progressive Metal.<br /><br />So, is Systematic Chaos the best thing Dream Theater ever did. Probably not. After all, they have released around a dozen albums, many of which are classics. But I will say this; Systematic Chaos is probably the best album they have released in this century.<br /><br />Systematic Chaos<br /><br />Look for a heavier sound than on their last and least favorite of mine album - Octavarium and surprisingly a hint of ...Pink Floyd. Especially in the slower but brilliant fifth track, `Repentence.'<br /><br />Overall, Dream Theater after briefly experimenting with new sounds have returned to their roots--a variable speed, sometimes hard driving metal sound, with haunting melodies presented in complex arrangements that was the hallmark of their earlier days. The eight tracks average almost ten minutes a song as the album comes in at just over seventy-eight minutes. Obviously, with Systematic Chaos you get your money's worth.<br /><br />All in all, this should be a dream come true for Dream Theater fans. Final rating 4.65 stars--BUY IT !<br /><br />Similar Bands: Dreamscape, DGM, OSI
0143038419|3.0|This book did not change my life or inspire me to find my own godly connection.  It def made me want to go to Rome and Bali, though.  The book is an entertaining read, especially with the neurotic author that you will want to commit to therapy more than once.  It slows down a bit in India but if you power through and get to Bali I found the end to be rewarding and inspiring.  I would give it 3.50 stars if I could.
1594489505|1.0|I think I new the ending as soon as Laila married Rasheed.  It seemed like a soap opera...I will not recommend this book
B000O599XK|5.0|It doesn't match up to the brilliant perfection of Hawks', \\"Red River\\", but it does have a great deal of gentle humor that the other lacks.  This was always my third favorite Western after \\"Red River\\" and Ford's, \\"The Searchers\\".  It has a sense of menace and a wonderful story, but it's so breezy and (unintentionally?) light-hearted (you can tell that everyone is having a blast making this film!), it's hard to take it seriously!  The best thing to do is just sing along with Dean and Ricky (I always do!), and enjoy the ride! <br />P.S.  It's \\"Winchester 73'\\"!
0439813786|5.0|Fans of thrilling books are fond of calling them \\"page turners.\\"  Why?  Because you can hardly wait to see what happens next.  Those are the books that keep you up late at night to get to the end.<br /><br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret delivers a whole new kind of pager turner, one where you not only want to see what happens next . . . but where the act of turning the page often gives you powerful glimpses into the story.  How?  Hand-drawn images tell a story in motion using many motion picture techniques (close-ups, fades, and pans).  A sequence of images might go on for 40 pages (as the opening sequence does) before providing any dialogue.  Unlike a graphic novel, there is no dialog or narration on the images.  Since you don't know if the next turn of a page will reveal an image or text, you also have that extra dimension of surprise.  The other difference from the traditional page turner is that this book won't take you that long to read.  It's more like the duration of a motion picture than of reading a 525 page novel.  So don't let the book's bulk intimidate you.<br /><br />The story takes place in the early days of the Depression in Paris.  Hugo Cabret is a 12-year-old boy who loses his parents and is taken in by his uncle, a timekeeper in a railway station.  The uncle makes Hugo do all of the work, but won't even feed Hugo who has to turn to stealing in order to eat.  When the uncle disappears, Hugo is left to fend for himself.  But Hugo has a dream.  He will repair an automaton (an early type of robot) that he rescued from a museum fire.  Part of his thievery is aimed at taking parts from a tiny toy store in the station to help rebuild the automaton.  One day Hugo is caught!  That capture sets new wheels in motion that will change the lives of the key characters permanently.<br /><br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret evolves like an unfolding mystery.  Be cautious that you don't read reviews that reveal too many details.  It would be very easy to spoil this story for you!<br /><br />Although the publisher's indication is that this book will appeal to 9-12 year olds, I also think that younger children would enjoy having this book read to them, especially those who show a fondness for mechanical things.  But most adults will find the book to be at least as interesting as the 9-12 year olds will.  That's true both because the story is compelling and because of the novel story-telling methods.<br /><br />The illustrations deserve special comment.  These were produced after a lot of care to reflect the scenes of the time.  I could recognize the sources of many images from various sources:  photographs, paintings, museums, train stations, and motion pictures.  Those images echoed in my memory to give the book an extra sense of authenticity, reality, and relevance.  The drawings themselves continually reminded me of Seurat's early work while also capturing many of the better aspects of early comic book art.<br /><br />The experience of reading the story is much like following a labyrinth in a haunted castle:  It's always unclear where we are headed, but the trip itself seems quite rewarding.  The black-and-white images nicely capture the mood of the characters and of the times as many noir films did in using lots of light and shadow.  In fact, the images here could be story boards for a motion picture.<br /><br />Be prepared for the magic!il this story for you! <br /> <br />Although the publisher's indication is that this book will appeal to 9-12 year olds, I also think that younger children would enjoy having this book read to them, especially those who show a fondness for mechanical things.

B000PFUAO6|5.0|WOW! Absolutely an incredible album.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed \\"Octavarium\\", but it somewhat dissapointed me. Thus, I was expecting a better album this time around, but not *this* much better. Absolutely amazing.  <br /> <br />Heavy, dark, murky, mellow, and chilling all describe this album. Though there are mellow moments on this album, there is not a *dull* mellow moment.  <br /> <br />This album proves there is a ton of creative and musical genius that has yet to be tapped in the collective brain power of Dream Theater. DREAM THEATER ARE NOT DEAD AND WASHED UP! There are many years left of Dream Theater music.  <br /> <br />Systematic Chaos is going to go down as DT's best album since Six Degrees and/or Scenes from A Memory and will end up in the ranks right near the top of DT's best albums: Images and Words, Awake, and Scenes. <br /> <br />BUY IT!  <br />

B00005LMBK|4.0|I first learned of the Gorillaz when Deamon Days was released. I absolutely fell in love with that album. Working my way backwards in the Gorillaz discography resulted in me rating this album 4 stars. It's hard to compare to Deamon Days, however this is a great album. <br /> <br />This album is pure alt/punk with strong hip hop influences. There are electronic influences, however possibly just from the person who mixed and mastered the album. Damon Albarn really mixes the album up with a wide variety of music flavors and influences. It can all be found on this impressive album. There is nothing boring about it!  <br /> <br />Below is my jotted notes on each song .... take them for what they are worth! <br /> <br />------> Great tracks &lt;---------------- <br /> <br />Re-hash ... Alt/punk feel. Excellent electronic samples/effects. Chipper beat/melody. <br /> <br />5-4 ... Alt/punk feel. At first it sounds like Smashmouth. Great song, good lyrics. <br /> <br />Tomorrow Comes Today ... Alternative. Slow and mellow song. <br /> <br />Clint Eastwood ... the #1 single from the album. Great mix of alt/punk and hip hop. Special guest Del The Funkee Homosapien spits insane lyrics. Awesome beat and melody. <br /> <br />Rock the House ... I'm not a fan, but most people like this track. Features Del once again, shows hip hop influences. <br /> <br />19-2000 ... great track. Awesome beat/melody ... electronic samples/synths ... great lyrics. <br /> <br />Slow Country - Very interesting beat and melody, reoccurring squeek throughout. Good lyrics. Excellent keyboard accompaniment. <br /> <br />Left Hand Suzuki Method - Very interesting melody. Very interesting addition to the album. Great listen. <br /> <br />-------> Strange Tracks ... but awesome!&lt;----------------- <br /> <br />Man Research - Damon sounds like a mental patient, however the song is GREAT! A lot of electronics. <br /> <br />Star Shine - Man Research Vol 2! Excellent track <br /> <br />Sound Check - Has potential, but I can't make myself sit through the whole song. <br /> <br />M1 A1 - Takes a while to pick up, bug a solid song. Very punk inspired. <br /> <br />------> Filler tracks&lt;-------------- <br /> <br />New genious ... wasn't really feeling this one. <br /> <br />Punk ... not sure about this one. <br /> <br />Double Bass ... cool instrumental. <br /> <br />Latin Simone ... Song is in Spanish. Interesting addition and influences. <br /> <br />Dracula ... Can't make myself listen to the whole song. Chipper beat. <br /> <br />Also worth mentioning, both remixes are great! <br /> <br />Rusty Rothwell <br />Louisville, KY
B000PHX4VA|5.0|This 28-track collection from one of rock's greatest bands is nearly flawless.  Unfortunately, like most compilations on the market, it's missing one or two essential tracks.  In this case, they are \\"When The World Is Running Down, You Make The Best Of What's Still Around\\" and \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me '86\\".  Regardless, this collection should be an essential part of any music lover's collection.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|\\"Children of Men\\" is definitely unconventional, and has more than a little originality, something welcome in an era when so many films are simply spat out of screenwriting software.  Cuaron achieves a triumph of cinematography and production design.  The tracking shots are amazing and reflect a mastery of direction and photography.  And the production design is interesting and gives us little bits of the future without the annoying \\"hey, look at the cool toys\\" factor of many SF movies.  Indeed, even cars of the future are handled in a way that doesn't make them instantly laughable.  The direction cannot be faulted.  Neither can the actors, who uniformly turn in excellent and convincing performances.  We are immersed in the convincing future world of 2027.<br /><br />So why just three stars?  The script is weak, and leaves you scratching your head at exactly why certain things are happening and what the motivation of certain characters and groups are.  Cuaron has shown himself in the past to be a master of character - getting great performances and characters from his actors - and of direction.  However, story has always been his weak point, and this movie is no exception.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this movie is at least worth a rent.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|yes you read right, i think this is the tightest album dream theater has released sinse scenes from a memory and six degrees of inner turbulence. now don't get me wrong. i love every album dream theater put out. the only album i was never so crazy about was falling into infinity, but never the less that album also had a number of amazing songs. but back to systematic chaos. this album is pretty much a progressive masterpeice. dream theater are at their best in this album from start to finish. this is probly their mosr progressive album sinse scenes lol. now the musician's sound at their best in the album. john petrucci plays at his best in this album. he plays some of the most memorable and catchy riffs and melodies hes ever done. and his leads are damn amazing, and jordan rudess really shines in this album. he shows he's a true master at the keyboard. his tone is amazing. john myung sticks out in this album. his bass playing always amazed me. james labrie sounds amazing. i gotta say its his best proformance yet. he mixed his more agressive sounding vocals with his higher vocals. and the result it great. and last but defidently not least mike portnoy. portnoy shines in this album. his drum playing is so dynamic and tight its scary. so heres my song by song review for ya <br /> <br />1. In The Presence Of Enemies Part 1 (10/10) - the opener and first part of the albums epic. this song is absolutely amazing. it pulls you in from as soon as it starts. the first 6 mins are instromental greatness. then the next is great. very proggy peice with lots of change of season's feels to it. <br /> <br />2. Forsaken (10/10) - the second track is a great song to follow the opener. this is the ballad of the album but dont think this is like the answer lies within. this song is great. its a more uptempo ballad. with a great petrucci solo. ballad with balls! <br /> <br />3. Constant Motion (10/10) - i love this song. its a great heavy progressive peice. shows signs of metallica influsence. johns guitar solo is sick in this song! rudess too! portnoy is great! <br /> <br />4. Dark Eternal Night (10/10) - the dark eternal night is probly dream theaters heavyest song. the first like 4 mins of the song is pure heavy catchyness. the rest of the song is pretty much instromental. its insane!! absolutely mindblowing! <br /> <br />5. Repentance (10/10) - a more mellow song off the album. at first listen i was alittle unsure about this song. but the second time around i loved it. its like nothing they've ever done. lots of opeth influence. once again petrucci shines. the whole band does. i really love the vocal arrangements on this song! labrie is top notch. and the harmonies are great! <br /> <br />6. Prophets Of War (10/10) - this song my friends was a surprise. its very different. hard to put in words. but the song itself is catchy. and you'll find yourself singing allong with this one for a few hrs lol. certan parts remind me allot of images and words. <br /> <br />7. The Ministry Of Lost Souls (10/10) - this song is possibly one of the best songs dream theater ever wrote! its 14 mins long and every min of it is great. the first 7 mins are pretty mellow, the melodies are beautiful. and johns guitar line is so damn catchy. after the 7 min point the song takes a turn.it builts to a heavy VERY progressive peak. portnoy shines on this song very much! and the solos are great! the song ends with johns epic guitar line, with portnoy's agressive playing behind it. and fades out into the next track. <br /> <br />8. In The Presence Of Enemies Part 2 (10/10) - the last track on the album, and second part of the albums epic. like the first part the second part is mazing. the song builds into a heavy section thats leads to the instromental insanity that lasts just about the last 6 mins of the song. its a absolutely beautiful song! <br /> <br />So in total the album is just about perfect. it has everything you wound want from a dream theater album. and i highly reccomend it! this will surely become a progressive metal classic!
B000001DYJ|3.0|What's on this record sounds great. The music is played well. But what a major dissappointment when I saw this was 16 songs!!!?? Where is \\"Tears are Falling\\"? \\"Crazy Nights\\" \\"War Machine\\" \\"Fits Like a Glove\\".....the list could go on of songs that SHOULD have been on here. Songs that were staples in their shows for years that fans wanted on this record! By not including them, they created a big hole in their catalog of great songs not included on the offical live records. Why do they think bootlegging got so big at this time? Because fans saw they could get a better boot of a show than what Kiss would release!! Eric Singer even stated in the Kiss Authorized biography that he listened to some boots that were better than Alive 3. I own a show from the NJ Meadowlands that murders Alive 3. On the Revenge tour Kiss were playing an awesome setlist...usually about 23-25 songs. Alive 3 is like a sampler...what a shame.
0385340559|2.0|First off, this is an extremely disappointing book.  While the opening scene is gripping, what follows for much of the book is a long, tedious and often boring attempt by Reacher to learn why he was contacted by a former Army colleague though an ATM receipt.  It is strange for Reacher to have an ATM card since he is supposed to be under the radar;  but he still only wears one shirt and one pair of pants, presed under his mattress each night!<br /><br />After the opening scene, we have to wait until page 193--after reunions with old buddies, the deaths of others and a slow revealing of the mystery (Which is not very convincing)--for the old Reacher to appear.  Until then, he is a thoughtful, sensitive guy with a penchant for mathematics.  Unfortunately, he is not Reacher.<br /><br />Maybe, the author, Lee Child, decided to let Reacher touch his feminine side.  At any rate, either Reacher has to go back to what he does best as the Lone Wolf Protector/Avenger or else he needs to be retired and sent off to the Old Soldier's Home and tell war stories with his buddies.
B000001FQQ|2.0|This is one of Kiss's worst albums. The only reason it sold at all and the tour did so well was because of \\"Forever\\". There are 4 good songs and 11 pieces of crap. Period. \\"Rise to It\\" rocks like classic Kiss; \\"Hide Your Heart\\" is classic 80's Kiss,  \\"Forever\\" is undeniably a great ballad and was a smash hit at radio; and \\"Little Caesar\\" is a rockin offering from Eric Carr. The rest of the songs stink. Gene's \\"Betrayed\\" is maybe okay. Gene does not have one other good tune on here and his songwriting is awful. \\"Boomerang\\" and \\"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell\\" are arguably two of his worst songs ever! Just total snorefests of songs. And how about Paul imitating Def Leppard's \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" with \\"Read My Body\\". Listen to it...it's almost identical. Or Paul trying to be Bon Jovi with \\"King of Hearts\\". I love Kiss, and I listened to this when it came out, but these songs don't stand the test of time at all. Did anyone at a concert ever yell, \\"Play 'Prisoner of Love'!!\\" I think not. These are almost all forgettable. They could have released those 4 songs in an EP. Looking back on it, one can see that with so many styles on here, Kiss was really lost at this point, They couldn't rock as hard as Metallica, they couldn't do classic Kiss in make-up without Ace and Peter, and they were not as pretty-boy good looking for the little chippies as Poison, Def Leppard, or Bon Jovi who wrote catchy 80's tunes. Yet, Kiss tried to fit in at this point as best they could.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Can't wait for the DVD version of Lynch's latest.  Laura Dern plays multiple characters as Lynch shows us that women's roles in society have not changed much despite the fact that it's now 2007.  Females are still looked upon as objects, as the passive recipients of whatever men wish to dole out to them, and as incapable of achieving any kind of enlightenment or redemption whatsoever.  Dern is magnificent, and Lynch is at his confounding best.  One of the best films of the milennium so far.
B000001EIA|5.0|Finally a great setlist! Even without the reunion, this would have been great. But, with Ace and Peter it's awesome and over the top. \\"2000 Man\\" is awesome! And finally \\"Beth\\" gets done the right way and is the best version of the song aside from the studio version. But I was so excited to have them do \\"See You Tonite\\" from Gene's solo record, and \\"A World Without Heroes\\" from The Elder. This is the kind of mixing up of the setlist they should have always been doing. Thank Heavens they're mixing it up recently on the Rock the Nation tour which I can't say enough about. After this album it was a very exciting summer of 1996 to scramble for tickets to a reunion show.
B000P0J02E|4.0|The 'At World's End' is better than the movie it appeared in. There are some dramatic pieces in here that stand up with anything Hans Zimmer has ever written. I'm only giving it four stars because it builds on the themes and motifs written by Klaus Bedalt for the first movie, which, while not better than this soundtrack on a technical level, is a lot more fun.
B000N6TX22|5.0|The action in this film is poignant, meaningful and unexpected. There is an amazing uncut action scene that immerses you in the hopeless, meaningless chaos of violence, which I believe is what the director intended.  <br /> <br />The film asks, why? To what end, violent conflict? It does not answer those questions.  <br /> <br />Consumers raised on Hollywood-style morality tales will be disappointed. <br /> <br />
0375703764|2.0|HoL is an incredibly uneven book.  To a fan of horror, sci-fi and Surrealism, as much as of good literature and avant garde writing, this novel promises a lot, but delivers very little.  The key to any great novel is a good story line (a problem that many PoMo writers have is that they get so caught up in their intellectual hijinks that they often entirely forget about the story).  HoL actually has a moderately interesting storyline, but this gets painfully muddled in the overlayering of narratives and overshadowed by the inanity of the \\"Johnny Truant\\" narrator. <br /> <br />Truant is as obvious and oblivious as his name (meaning \\"vagabond\\", which he, not surprisingly, is).  His narration, in comparison to the moderately powerful writing of the main narrator (Zampano), is simply painful to read.  In some instances, it's almost as if D. is worried that the reader won't get the psuedo-intellectual jargon of the main narrator, so he has Johnny chime in  to \\"explain\\" some things.  In the end, in attempting to create a sympathetic, if slightly pop-culture, character, D. unfortunately writes a caricature, so stereotypical and overdrawn, in fact, that there is nothing interesting in about half of the book.  It's like watching MTV's Real World.   <br /> <br />The rest of the writing simply isn't strong enough to support the weight of the bad writing.  Personally, it seems like D. was so interested in writing a revolutionary novel that he forgot that he was supposed to be writing a novel in the first place.  Furthermore, D.'s innovations are, in many ways, entirely pointless.  In this respect the book is far less revolutionary than other great avant garde works where the form complements the style and innovation accentuates the narrative resulting in a synthesis of form and story that pushes the notions of genre, form, content, etc. in new directions.  Random fonts, etc. do not constitute revolutionary writing - in fact, anyone with a computer can muck around with fonts, color, etc., and anyone with PhotoShop (or an equivalent) can do even more. <br /> <br />This is D.'s freshman book, and as the Truant character tells us, sometimes finding a \\"frosh\\" instead of a true academic is better, something I might agree with if this novel weren't so bad.  The truth is that a lot of people will be pulled in by the bells and whistles, by the usage of font, image and color, but since these really don't support the narrative in any meaningful way, they're kinda like painting flashy flames down the side of an '81 Honda.  The faults of this kind of literary slight of hand can be seen clearly in the reviews to his second novel \\"Revolutions\\", where the tricks are apparently beginning to wear thin, even for fans of HoL.
047119350X|5.0|Actually, it's kinda dumb to recommend this book for graduate biochemistry students. If you haven't heard about Voet while being an undergrad, it's because you weren't interested in biochemistry at all. To everyother undergrad who is really into biochemistry and is intending to follow on through research in biochemical science, I say look no further. <br />  <br />Voet & Voet IS the very best biochemistry book you will find right now in the shelves. Of course, don't expect to read through it unless you're taking a 2nd course in biochemistry or doubling a major in chemistry/biochemistry.  <br /> <br />If this is your first approach to biochemistry (and you don't care much about the chemistry/physics behind it all), this isn't the book you're looking for. Check Lehninger instead (the best INTRODUCTORY biochemistry book for DUMMIES - aka. Medschool, Biology, etc.). But, sooner or later, if you're the curious type, you'll start wondering, asking questions like \\"How did they actually find out the genetic code?\\" or \\"What's the enzymatic reaction mechanism for this complex enzyme?\\" or \\"How do they manage physical data to make all these pretty 3D crystallographic structures?\\". Of course, you could go to more specialized books to find all about these and other inquiries. But, the fact is Voet & Voet collects all the relevant scientific answers in one big chunk of paper.  <br /> <br />I've known uncountable biochemistry grads who've strived between Matthews and Devlin, Lehinger and Stryer, and Garret and Grisham, just to compile the information that's presented in a perfect order in this amazing book. Don't waste your time. If you're taking it seriously, it's Voet & Voet.
B000OZ2CZW|3.0|I can't decide if I like this album or her last one better. Her last one had a few great songs, and the rest were so so. On this effort, I'm trying to like all the songs, but they are so NOT Rihanna or R&B like. There's techno, R&B, reggae, and even rock on here, but some songs are over produced and hard to really connect to. I think some songs would be perfect if a few instruments and computer beats were left off or whatever. Her next single is Shut Up and Drive...bad choice!
B000MRA5EM|5.0|While this film is surprisingly short and has some limitations in term of continuity, I found it utterly absorbing and watched it twice the same day.  The photography is some of the most stunning marine footage I have ever seen.  The filmmakers have done a superb job of capturing some of the most charismatic, sinister, and whimsical creatures that inhabit the oceans, and the information about their life cycles, while not exhaustive, was well edited to maintain interest.  Highly recommended!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I saw Radiohead at Bonnaroo in 2006 and the three songs that made everyone (80,000+ people) burst into tears were \\"Paranoid Android\\", \\"Exit Music (for a film)\\", and \\"No Surprises\\"; all from \\"OK Computer\\".  I think this is the finest album ever produced.  Yes, THE best ever.  (Yes, I've heard The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, etc.)  They all come close, (some very close) but this album is as close to perfect as there has ever been.  Please ignore the reviews giving this album one star, for they are from pedestrian trash who have no right to express their opinion.    <br /> <br />The top five albums ever produced are: <br />5.  Innervisions - Stevie Wonder <br />4.  Abbey Road - The Beatles <br />3.  The Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd <br />2.  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - The Beatles <br />1.  OK Computer - Radiohead <br /> <br />Just you wait and see.  Most masterpieces take a long time to be recognized as genius.  They are simply over many people's heads.
B000QGAU4E|1.0|Very disappointing.  The movie seemed to be building to some point but from my perspective it never really ended up anywhere.<br /><br />This seems to be a very hyped movie with very little to the story.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is the best video series of the world we live in that I've seen so far. In High Definition 1080p, I am no longer pressured to go to some of the places shown in the series. This is definitely the ultimate justification (or excuse) any HD \\"hold out\\" may have to upgrading to HD.<br /><br />As a photographer and budding HD film maker, the only regret I have is not being one of the 40+ cameramen who were involved in the shoots. Sign me up for any next project BBC!<br /><br />I did dose off at times -- that is because I tried to watch 550 minutes (4 discs) in one sitting! So, pace yourself when watching (although like me - you will be enthralled).<br /><br />Final Note: I would recommend getting the HD 1080p version (I have the Blueray version) over the DVD version.
0385340559|3.0|Not sure if I am tired of Reacher or is Reacher a tired character. It could be the interplay of several old Reacher associates as diluting his overall presence or has it just become a bore. I think it will take the next book to figure out this mystery.<br /><br />It was ok, but unlike most of his other books I could easily put it down and move on to other things, then return to it later without much anticipation.<br /><br />I would not mind seeing  \\"Neagley\\" as a central character in a future book with Reacher making a cameo. Might be a refreshing change.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Wow... this is the best film of our world we live in that I've seen so far.

6304493681|5.0|This film suffers from the comparisons it attacts. It was heavily plagiarised by the Matrix films in terms of its visual presentation and some thematic elements, but differs to it in all other parts. Where one is a very slick adolescent action film which pretends to be philosophical, the other is an entrancing audio-visual feast which engages your subconscious in a very unexpected way. Ghost in the Shell fits better next to films like Kubrick and Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Scott's Blade Runner, in which the story, although interesting, is ultimately secondary to the experience of the film itself.  <br /> <br />From its opening credits, with its sparse pounding percussion, haunting Japanese choir, and subtle electronic tone, set against the dream-like and utterly entrancing android 'birth' on screen, engages your eyes, ears and mind in an entirely primal way.  <br /> <br />The animation, in a word, is astonishing. The combination of digital imagery is truly subtle and masterful, rather than bashing you over the head with its digital achievement. The film revels in its details, small things which go unnoticed but register with the subconscious. The main character, in her android 'shell', never once blinks throughout the film, her inanimate 'doll-like' elements managing to de-sexualise her often nude body/shell. The gorgeously rendered reflections and lights, as well as imperceptible movements of backgrounds create an entirely dream-like world which has lost its sense of human identity through its merger with the machine. The viewer feels the same mental detatchment throughout the film, and engages in an almost spiritual experience, which is thematically social as well as personal. <br /> <br />It won't be everybody's cup of tea. If you came to this film from the Matrix, there's a good chance you'll hate its lack of constant action sequences. If you come to it from a purely anime-loving background, you'll love it if you enjoyed mentally stimulating and willfully experimental anime like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Mindgame, Catsoup, Memories, or Akira. You'll definately hate it if you're a fan of the empty genre-anime such as Naruto, Final Fantasy or Full Metal Alchemist. But if you're looking for a filmic experience which transcends its genre and demonstrates some unsurpassed animation of the highest possible calibre, look no further.  <br /> <br />This dvd release is good, though not excellent. The 5.1 surround-mix in English is fantastic in its scope and enhances the experience but the english dub actors are atrocious. I don't know what it is, but english dub actors cannot emote, and speak with the same monotone 'i'm-reading-a-script' voice that anime-watchers have come to know and despise. The Japanese 2.0 stereo is okay but really could have benefited from a 5.1 mastering, especially considering the Japanese voice-actors are excellent. There is a relatively satisfying 'Making of' featurette on this dvd, including interviews with most of the creators/actors/artists involved on the project, as well as a decent overview of the technology and techniques used in the films creation.
037571457X|5.0|I read Persepolis because my brother recommended it. This gives a wonderful perspective on how the \\"Regressive Revolution\\" in Iran affected people, especially young children. Anther reason that I highly recommend ordering this item is that it gives a wonderful, easy to learn (brief) history of Iran. It sparked my interest in the middle east and, considering that these modern times seem to mean more and more concern will be focused in the area, it's good to know a little bit about the countries. Buy it. Read it. Love it.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Persepolis takes place from the view of Marjane Satrapi. She lives with her parents and grandmother. The book shows how the Revolution effected the daily lives of people and changed the community and nation. The novel also teachers the reader about Iranian religion and history in an easy to understand manner.
1400063515|3.0|This book is about a really fascinating subject but is written in a way that hurts the credibility of the author, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Let me give a simple illustration: In the book, Mr Taleb gives the example of a Turkey that is fed everyday and thinks to him/herself \\"Hey! These humans feed me everyday- They're great!\\" only to be surprised, one day, out of the blue, when it lands on the chopping block. <br /> <br />This example is given to show that using traditional reasoning to predict the future is fundamentally flawed, because it ignores \\"black swans\\". <br /> <br />Mr. Taleb argues \\"See, That turkey is dumb by predicting that humans will always be nice to him, given prior evidence- Don't be like the turkey\\" <br /> <br />This is a poorly formed argument: There is a perfectly valid argument for the turkey's beliefs- Occam's Razor: The simplest explanation is that humans are always nice to you. It may be true that the Turkey is stupid, but you're making a poorly formed argument if you do not delve into the use of Occam's Razor as a defense of the turkey's beliefs. <br /> <br />Occam's Razor, which is a central refutation of many of the arguments in this book, is never mentioned in it. This is the general problem with this treatise- Mr. Taleb sets up straw man arguments and then shoots them down- In the process, the reader often thinks \\"Hey! that's unfair- There are better arguments for the opposite position\\" but they are left avoided/unexplored. <br /> <br />This is definitely an interesting subject area, and many of the author's arguments may be true, and the book may be worth reading for some... but be aware that you may be disappointed by a lack of crispness in the argument the author puts forth.
B0000YEEHG|1.0|Incomprehensible tripe about a couple of troubled women at a mental health worker's seaside summer cottage. One of the actresses (when interviewed for the supplements) is asked to describe the film--and guess what? She couldn't. I guarantee you, not even the \\"writer/director\\" could explain what in hell he was trying to get across.    Worse than that even, the commentary consists of some guy saying things like: \\"Now we have a close up...\\"  \\"It's dark now...wait, now it's light...\\"   Huh? This individual is supposed to be a film historian! He couldn't figure out what was going on either, so he makes above useless comments throughout. Any wonder why college grads are dumb-as-dirt these days?     Film historian? Oh yeah. Sure, baby.    What was the writer/director on when he put pen to paper?     I have sat through my share of slower-paced films (ie: Polanski's The Tenant, Repulsion, The Pianist; Chabrol's The Unfathful Wife; Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru; Henning Carlsen's Hunger; various Fassbinder flicks; various slower-paced films by both American and Euro director's, etc.) So long as there is some semblance of story there, so long as the tale is about something and goes somewhere...I don't have a problem and can sit still long enough to see the entire film. But here? With this \\"masterpiece?\\" Painful--is about the only word that fits.
B000P2A256|5.0|Well, first off I'm new to this band so I've fresh ears from all of you who have heard of the band before. <br />Secondly, I'm not to keen about the music this millenium has put out so far so I can be considered a flaming critic about this generations attemts of what we would call music. <br />With that being said, Maroon 5 has immpressed me with this album quite a bit.  I was expecting the standard college trash and what is considered music, a.k.a. rap/hip-hop, but instead I found a truly talented group of young men puting out something I would not have to censor from my children if I had any. <br />Oh there are some major 'bleepos' on it (WADAT Baldo for that last term), but nothing that would kill anyone's ears.  I've heard worse from rap-garbage than this. <br />Just a briliant album with a mix of funk, blues, soul and rock-n-roll that should satify all new and old. <br />Oh, but from some of the comments I've read, there are some Phillistines still out there who would like this group to crank out the same-ol' stuff they did before, but I applaude thier daring and innventiveness, reaching out to do something different and that puts this album squarely in the A+ column. <br />Don't be fooled folks, this is great album, and like my experiance with Franz Ferdinand's second album, more than worthy in any music collection.  Not a bad song on it at all, and this is coming from a guy who still thinks The Electric Light Orchestra is the greatest band around.
B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard's 1987 classic Hysteria sounds terrific 20 years after its release. With the help of the album's straight-out 80's rock vibes, sweet lyrics, catchy tunes, harmonious choruses, and solid grade-A rock ballads, Hysteria is commended as one of the greatest albums ever made. The album features Leppard's finest work: the monumentally popular Pour Some Sugar On Me, the hair-raising Rocket, the heartbreaking Love Bites, the spine-tingling Hysteria, the elusive Animal, and the awesome Women.  <br /> <br />The album will leave you with the impression that 80's hair bands weren't so dreadful after all, and Def Leppard are to be taken nothing less than seriously! <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A
0895260131|3.0|I found the pro-Christian bias throughout the book to be very off-putting. Just because Islam has problems does not mean Christianity is good.  I would much have preferred this book if it were written from an atheist point of view.
1416914285|4.0|I must say I am happy I read this book before coming online to read the reviews. I added this book to my TBR list because it was recommended to me by Amazon. I must say thanks! I am an elementary teacher and I read teen scifi/fantasy a lot. I loved the story and am looking forward to the next one in the series. Was the story a rehash of other books? Well yes and no. Having read sooo much I see the same trends a lot. But I think that her writing/voice is different and interesting. You have to look at why you read. I read to immerse myself and escape into the story. The author did this for me. It is only a book not rocket science. Please take a chance and try it before you base your opinion of this book on what others here are saying due past mistakes.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I've been a Dream Theater fan since 1992 when a friend of mine gave me his copy of Images & Words because in his words \\"It's got way too many keyboards\\".<br /><br />I was in a MASSIVE progressive rock/music phase around this time which began around 1987 and lasted until about the late 90's in which I had an epiphany that a lot of the  progressive music that I had really indulged in really sucked in a lot of respects.  But Dream Theater is one of those bands that I've stuck with through thick and thin.  This is a band that can sometimes exhilirate at their best (see their 1994 album Awake) and perplex, counfound and/or annoy me at their indulgent worst (see Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence).<br /><br />But as a life long musician myself, it always thrills me to hear musicians who aren't afraid to shine from a player perspective because frankly, a lot of current musicians in most of the emo or mall-core bands are just horrible.  (I started playing classical piano when I was 6 and electric bass when I was 14 along with saxophone/drums as well.  I'm 32 at the moment BTW).  I like to actually hear a real well written song along with that as well though, and not just endless noodling.<br /><br />I thought that as songwriters that Dream Theater really reached a high water mark for them as a whole on their last release Octavarium.  They eased off the bombastic/progressive nature of their music for the most part and just tried to write great SONGS.  While I realize that a lot of Dream Theater fans hate their 1997 release Falling Into Infinity, I've always felt that that release captured some of their best songwriting even if the overall whole fell short of what the band and some fans wanted.<br /><br />Systematic Chaos however sees the band returning much more to the dark/metalliac elements of their album Train of Thought which came out before Octavarium.  This album is much more heavy compared to the comparatively pastoral lush sounds of Octavarium.<br /><br />But whereas it's got the heaviness that Train of Thought, the actual songwriting is much, much stronger than that release.  In fact, this is the album that I really think that the band was shooting for on TOT.<br /><br />All of the elements that DT fans have come to love (and their almost equal number of detractors loathe them for) are present.  Soaring almost operatic vocals courtesy of James Labrie.  Blisteringly fast dual keyboard/guitar solos by Jordan Rudess and John Petrucci respectively.  Equally fast but grooving bass work by the soft spoken John Myung.  Stellar and amazingly complex drum work by Mike Portnoy.<br /><br />The lyrics are also a step up in the right direction for the band as well with James Labrie writing one track of lyrics and Mike Portnoy & John Petrucci coming up with the rest.<br /><br />The surprising heaviness of this release after the much more melodic Octavarium might come as a huge shock for people expecting them to continue on in that direction for a bit, but seeing as this is their 1st release for their new record label Roadrunner records (which is a long running metal label), perhaps they felt like they needed to deliver something that a metal fan of other bands on the label's roster would dig.<br /><br />Regardless of their motives for the direction of this album, this makes up for the frustrating and sometimes mediocre Train of Thought and sees the band, like on Octavarium, hitting yet another career high water mark the likes that bring to mind their magnum opus (at least IMO) Awake.<br /><br />While there's absolutely nothing here to convert somebody who hasn't already gotten into the band, longtime fans will eat this up.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />As for the 2 disc \\"special edition\\", this sees DT taking fan service to an almost unheard of level.

Watch for many of their classic songs such as New Kid In Town and Desperado, as well as some new ones.  <br /> <br />The real treat though is the sound, the harmonies are crisp, and the music is very clear. Bring on Farewell II!

1594489505|4.0|After Gunderson couldn't follow-up Snow Falling on Cedars and Frazier missed with his follow-up to Cold Mountain, it was with some trepidation that I opened Hosseini's second novel.  I was not disappointed in the least.  This is a terrific novel.  Perhaps I only gave it a four because almost nothing compares to Kite Runner and that is the book to which this is naturally compared.  <br /> <br />The book follows the lives of two Afghani women from childhood through adulthood.  Their lives encompass Afghanistan's war with the Soviets, its civil war resulting in Taliban control and then America's taking out of the Taliban.  Mr. Hosseini's stark writing style adds to the maxim that if \\"war is hell\\" multiple wars suffered by the same people is something worse than hell.  Add to the wars  the oppressed position of women in fundamentalist Muslim culture and the women's lives are not pretty.  One begins life as a bastard child, the other as a girl who is to be educated.  Both end up in the same household with a fundamentalist Muslim man.  Their trails to that place and away from it are heart-wrenchingly poignant. <br /> <br />Like Kite Runner, Hosseini gives the reader an education on life in Afghanistan over the last several decades.  Just as life in that country during that time was was oppressingly depressing, so was most of the book, except for the fact it shows the human determination and will to live and survive.  However, also like Kite Runner, it finished with a glimmer of light in the end.   <br /> <br />Mr. Hosseini does not preach nor bash the reader over the head with any message but one.  His straight-forward writing style and story-telling leave the reader to reach his own conclusions.  His one message was clear, however: Life in Afghanistan has been awful for everyone but thugs and warlords for the past 40 years or so.  The country has been devastated and one is left to wonder how the general population ever survived.  <br /> <br />The two women, and the ancillary characters are extremely believable and have great depth.  They will be remembered by the reader for a long time. <br /> <br />The reviews at the top of Amazon's listing show that the only readers who did not like Splendid Suns were those that did not like Kite Runner.  If, like me, you thought Kite Runner was one of the best books to come along in a long, long time, you will definitely enjoy this book.

0385522401|5.0|In his latest novel, McEwan once again demonstrates a unique talent for precise examination of the pivotal moments of people's lives, the mostly unmarked, yet critical events that alter the direction of the future. In prose that perfectly captures the details of a momentous occasion, highlighted by Edward and Florence Mayhew's wedding eve jitters, the couple is unprepared for the consummate choices they face, trapped by their own expectations. The time is 1962, the place a honeymoon suite on the Dorset coast. In their early twenties, neither has life experience with which to gauge their perceptions, the stultifying social constrictions of the 1950s still hovering, years from the upheavals that will rock the late sixties.<br /><br />Certainly, Edward and Florence are conservative, goal-oriented products of their society, decidedly conventional. An intensely insular young violinist, Florence enjoys the security of her musical world, comforted by its definitions. Whatever rebellions she experiences, Florence keeps to herself, unable to bear the discomfort of conflict, although increasingly irritated with her family, her mother's distance, her father's cloying presence in her life. For his part, Edward sees his new bride as the Holy Grail, both deliverance and escape from a family of origin that has taxed his youth with unexpected pretensions. Florence is the first to step into another identity, that of a married man creating his own interpretation of family. Both nurture expectations that are unrealistic, a precarious balance of sexual anticipation and sexual revulsion.<br /><br />In the first blush of innocence, the pair seems well matched, their ineptitude nearly charming and certainly representative of the era. But a mutual penchant of obfuscation they have so far managed to ignore becomes a living presence in the wedding suite as the couple confronts an appalling lack of communication. Neither has seen fit to share their concerns and fears beforehand; hence, they are locked in an impasse, one that is only temporarily resolved by Florence's escape to the dark sliver of beach outside. While the reader understands Florence's flawed response to Edward's clumsy advances, the new husband is not privy to his wife's complications, left to puzzle out his dilemma with little information. The result is a perfectly-pitched contretemps that beautifully defines the age of innocence as it grapples with reality. Once more McEwan proves himself an unparalleled provocateur.

B000OVLBEO|3.0|I was so looking forward to Ghost Rider finally making the leap to the silver screen. All the previews I saw for it I thought were amazing. I even did some research on the Internet (not for the comic book, because, in fact, I collected both series of comics myself and loved them). So, when the time came and I saw the film, I thought it was...okay. Definitely not what I was expecting. Oh, the villians were there and they were great. It's just the casting of Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze. When I heard he would be the star, I thought he'd be satisfactory (though he could have at least changed his hair colour to match Blaze's for the movie, if he was indeed the true fan of the comics as he said he was in some movie previews I read). And I certainly wasn't expecting Eva Mendes to play Roxanne (not that I didn't mind either). However, she played the role rather flatly and seemed to be kind of dull. So, overall, for me, the movie was all right, though nothing spectacular.

B000F5GNX8|1.0|Wow!  If they had left the \\"F\\" word out of this movie, there wouldn't have been much dialog!!!! Could have been great, but our poor ears were cringing! Not even funny. What a disappointment. There are a lot better comedies out there.
B00005GL0W|5.0|This recording (40 Years old now, wow, who would believe 1967-2007) is one of the Beatles most interesting recordings. Featuring hits like Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, I Am The Walrus, and some interesting work from the late George Harrison, Blue Jay Way, it serves as testament of how the Beatles were trying new things. One possible improvement (as if there could be) a \\"deluxe\\" edition, which would feature a miniature reproduction of the album booklet (in its entirety), featuring additional pictures and so on. Otherwise fine recording. Recommended also: Rubber Soul (which I also bought with this and generally all of the Beatles catalog[ue] [as it's spelled in England]).
B00005JPLW|5.0|I defintely recommend this film who love action,adventure,history and just the best fight scenes ever!!  the whole cast did an awesome job!!  the one to watch is Gerard Butler!

B00005JKHP|4.0|This revised version of \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" definitely moves at a faster pace than the original, which was notoriously slow.   The notorious and nigh-comic scenes of people staring in awe out of windows for minutes on end have been trimmed, for instance. <br /> <br />Yet... the faster pace seems to eliminate some of the mystery and wonder of the original, as well as some of the (admitted limited) character development.  My own view is that too much was lost. <br /> <br />As for the new effects, some are definite improvements (Starfleet Headquarters in San Francisco) or at least fix continuity errors (Vulcan now looks like it does in the other movies).  Some are OK but forgettable (V'ger in orbit around Earth).  Some things that should have been easy to fix were cut instead (such as the missing matte when Kirk leaves the airlock).  Some things were changed apparently just for the heck of it (the red alert klaxons). <br /> <br />One thing that SHOULD have been fixed, and wasn't (perhaps it couldn't be), was the dim lighting on the Enterprise bridge and the endless film loops on the display screens.  This more than anything dates the film and makes it seem relatively primitive. <br /> <br />So... Some aspects better than the original, but some good points lost in the process.  On balance, I don't think it any better than the original.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|This is the type of movie that DVD rentals were made for as this movie delivers on showing you engaging underwater scenes, action, sexy sexy Paul Walker and Jessica Alba, hungry sharks, humor and a nicely packaged little love story with some flavor.<br /><br />While 4 stars may seem like too much for this type of flick (OK I give it 3++), it actually delivers in its own way. We're not talking Oscar material here as the script is full of cliches, the acting is a little wooden, poor Jessica's character had nothing to do except look stunning (lips and back ;-) and there are some plot holes. But irrespectively of all this, it kept me smiling from start to finish.<br /><br />This movie was massacred by critics and I can see why, but I always would rather see a movie deliver on its own scale than fail in every scale, like some movies that are supposed to be funny and they are not. I recommend this one if you want to feel summery and spend a couple of hours with hot/tanned people surrounded by bad guys and gorgeous blue water.
B000002UAO|5.0|This recording, one of the last during their \\"touring\\" days, features a change in the Beatles sound. No longer content to just sing \\"happy\\" light songs, or \\"British Invasion\\" songs, the Beatles went into a new direction; using (for the first time) a sitar, thanks to George Harrison, which predates, by two years, its use on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in the song \\"Within You, Without You\\". This recording reflects a maturity that would feature in the band's work all the way through Let It Be (and more importantly Abbey Road). Highly recommended.

It's honestly the best \\"making of\\" movie book ever printed, period. The level of detail is just astonishing, even more so than I expected when I ordered my copy.

B000LXH0AE|2.0|Stranger than Fiction is not a comedy, it is a drama. You wouldn't know that however, after seeing the preview. The preview shows all the funny parts, and when seeing Will Ferrell, you expect more of the same in this movie. If you are going to buy this, you must know what you are getting. This is a drama, a drama maybe meant to have a message, to be poignant or to have a greater meeting. Or as I believe, a drama that is pointless and irrelevant.<br /><br />Expect to be amused at certain parts, but never to really laugh. Many will watch this movie thinking it is a comedy, and who is to blame them. Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman all have been stars in comedies, and Will Ferrell is one of the funniest actors around.<br /><br />Every performance in understated, every scene is meloncholy and borders on sad. Queen Latifah is wasted as the assistant to Emma Thompson, the famous author with writer's block. Harold Crick is a character in her novel, nothing more. There is no point, no connection to the viewer to make us care about him. Dustin Hoffman does shine ins his role as the professor trying to help Crick figure out whether is life is a comedy or tragedy. The movie shows the most promise when Crick goes to do an IRS audit of Maggie Gyllenhaal's Ana, and everyone at Ana's bakery turns on the hated \\"tax man.\\" Crick and Ana's relationship shows the most promise in the movie, but in the end, it is discarded as just another plot in the narrated story.<br /><br />In the first few minutes, the gimick of Harold Crick hearing the narration of his life is revealed. Harold can hear a voice in his head. Sounds funny, but since this movie isn't funny, what's the catch? That's the problem with this movie. It exists in a world that doesn't matter. There's no twist at the end to make us care, there's no relevation to explain why Harold can hear a voice in his head. There's basically no reason for this movie.<br /><br />In the end, this might qualify as a rental, but you shouldn't buy this movie without knowing what you are getting yourself into. I have a feeling that most of the people that saw this movie in theaters left dissappointed.ify as a rental, but you shouldn't buy this movie without knowing what you are getting yourself into.

B00003CXC6|5.0|I usually watch many kinds of different movies, but I wasn't a fan of old Asian movies, at least not until a friend lent me this beautiful classic, directed by Akira Kurosawa. Now I know what I was missing...<br /><br />\\"Rashomon\\" (1950), shot in black and white, is nothing short of stunning. The first scenes show us a priest and a woodcutter taking refuge in an old temple, in order to escape from the heavy rain. A third man shows up, and they start talking about a recent crime that troubles them. Despite the fact that these men were at the trial in which those involved were judged, they don't have a clue regarding what happened, due  to the fact that they hear very different versions of the events that took place that fateful day. Will the truth ever be found out? And is there such a thing as truth, or an objective point of view?<br /><br />This is the first film by Kurosawa I have watched, but it won't be my last. Highly recommended ! And... thanks, Rub&eacute;n :)<br /><br />- Belen Alcat, June 2007 -
B000NQR7NO|5.0|Let me start this off my saying I found their 2006 debut, Whatever They Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, a wonderful record. In fact, it was in my top 3 of the year. That album also went on to become the fastest selling debut album in UK history, beating out the likes of Oasis, Gorillaz, Coldplay, Robbie Williams, 50 Cent, and a slew of others. It also spawned 4 top 20 singles (including two number ones), 4 sold out tours, and the coveted Mercury Music Prize. Jeez fellas, talk about setting the bar high.    Well I'm happy to report that as it stands now, this years' release, Favourite Worst Nightmare, is in my top 3 for this year as well (although the year is still young). I thought it nearly impossible to make a smarter, more grown-up, and better album, but The Arctic Monkeys might have done just that.    Nightmare's opener is Brianstorm, a stormer of a track that acts as a perfect bridge between the two albums. The song picks up were the debut left off, with blasting guitars and spastic rhythms, but it also points to some new direction ahead. Lyrically, they have never been in better form. Alex Turner's voice is once again the star of the show, his rapid fire, stop-gap delivery is sometimes very tough to decipher, but that can be part of the fun. Clever and insightful, he writes lyrics well beyond his years without sounding stuffy or calculated. \\"You used to get it in your fishnets, now you only get it in your night dress.\\" opens up one of the better tracks on Nightmare, the superb, Fluorescent Adolescent. Its a good summery of a lot of the material on this record, growing up, making mistakes, angry barbs and sentimental statements are all as heavily featured as they were the first time out. Favourite Worst Nightmare a very cohesive album, and to me, it has a little bit more to offer than the debut. Nightmare's retro-flavored melodies, thoughtful lyrics, and smarter song structure add to the notion that this record will get better with time. Other highlights includethe oddly-titled Teddy Picker, Do Me A Favour, and a very Seven Nation Army-ish song called, Old Yellow Bricks. All are wonderful and I wouldn't be surprised if I just mentioned a few future singles. Nightmare has got hooks a-plenty, and even though it may feel like it was written for the smarter set, its about as fun as a rock album can get. Its bigger sounding, more brash, more grown-up, and in the end, just better.    There's a reason they have been given the headline spot at Glastonbury this year, put simply, they deserve it. The songs they have made (up to this point) have all been good-to-great, and live they are one of the tighter bands you can see. The majority of the record buying public have recognized the quality behind the fun, and instantly catchy songs. Their fans are growing with them, but the scary thing is these boys are still boys, and have yet to hit their stride.

B00028HCDI|5.0|If you are looking for a movie to watch on Christmas day with your family, you must include this heart warming story about an angel who intervene the busy lives of an Episcopalian bishop named Henry Brougham (David Niven) and his wife Julia (Loretta Young). This movie is set in Yuletide spirit with bells ringing, choir singing, Christmas wreaths decorating the walls of churches, homes, shops and buildings, and streets and neighborhoods covered with fresh snow. During this time, an angel named Dudley (Cary Grant) enters the lives of the bishop and his wife as an office assistant. At the Victorian home of Bishop Henry not everything is going well. Years of neglect about his own family left Julia on her own while the bishop is busy raising funds for a new cathedral. Dudley's attentiveness, charm, and sheer magical powers drive Julia to him, but Dudley is only interested in helping Henry to get back with Julia. The writers have cleverly crafted many moments between Dudley and Julia that would be purely romantic, but writers did not forget to remind us that Dudley is an angel and he is not romancing Julia. Several instances of walking down the street, driving in the country and having lunch at local cafeteria makes her feel that she is appreciated as a woman. The magical ice-skating scene where Dudley charms everyone with his skating ability, and helps Julia to glide on ice is a memorable scene of the movie.<br /><br />Dudley's \\"angelic\\" effect is felt by many: He touches the lives of people he comes in contact with. As the friendship between Julia and Dudley becomes strong, Henry begins to feel that Dudley is a devil trying to steal his wife, but soon all ends well when Dudley completes his job by helping Henry to raise money for the cathedral. Cary Grant is spectacular and charms not only Julia but many viewers. I was most impressed by the performance of Julia who is attracted to Dudley; she is tender, romantic, and vulnerable, yet she also knows that she is a wife and a mother.r.
1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's \\"The Power of Now\\" is one of the best books written for self improvement.  Each sentence is powerful, well worded and easy to understand.  \\"The Power of Now\\" focuses on the importance of keeping your full attention on the \\"present\\" moment (on what is occurring right now) and not letting your mind dwell on past events or obsess with the future.  Eckhart Tolle helps the reader realize the many tricks the mind can play to avoid \\"the now\\" and describes how they are exhibited through symptoms of suffering, pain, hostility, anger, fear, complaining, longing etc.  The author thoroughly examines how these problems are created and offers methods throughout the book on how to overcome them and become more conscious.  This book has helped many recover from traumatic events and is one of the best places to start freeing your mind.<br /><br />The audio CD set of \\"The Power of Now\\" is great to have if you can't sit and read.  The book is read by the author Eckhart Tolle who has a distinguished voice that quickly captures and holds your attention.  The CD set is enjoyable as well as informative, I highly recommend it.

1594489505|4.0|Like The Kite Runner, Hosseini again painted a picture that made me understand the tragedy of Afghanistan.  It also made me understand that the degradation and brutality towards women did not start with the Taliban. A Thousand Splendid Suns gives us dreams unfulfilled, hopes dashed, and grinding, soul eroding inhumanity towards those who commited no wrong. That this evil is real and pervasive is crushing. Even at the end - when a glimmer of sunshine filtered through - it was obvious it would not last long. I did not walk away from this book optimistic about the future of Afghani women but, it is an important read.

0151013047|3.0|The author did a good job of expressing divided loyalty and visceral identification with primary culture.  A country is like a family in creating the sense of self.  As a person who grew up in a culture different from my parents, I have a dual loyalty and understand the tension. <br /> <br />I am concerned about the ending.  It seemed too simple and heavy handed in contrast to the complexity of the rest of the book.  In a James Bond scene the author perpetuates the myth that Americans kill dissidents like countries without free elections, free speech or term limits do.  (Think KGB,radioactive beverages, and oatmeal faces.)  If  America killed those who speak against those in power, we would have no one left at the Washington Post, The New York Times, the LA Times, the Philadephia Inquirer, the Detroit Free Press, CBS, NBC or ABC etc etc.  Contrast that to what happened to Daniel Pearl in Pakistan.   I have  family member whose job it is to visit imprisoned journalists in Islamic and other States.  There are no imprisoned journalists in the US last time I checked with Amnesty and PEN.  In fact the NYT's is giving coordinates of Iranian dissidents.  So this ending seemed unreal and unfair. I closed the book very depressed, thinking terrorists will feel further justified and the author will be responsible for more death. <br /> <br />It also made me think about the basis of racism being competetion for survival of the tribe, not only for cultural survival but survival of the ego and the genes, ie; sexual competetion.  Although love and marriage occurs often between races, when a culture feels threatened like the US or Muslim States now, the wagons circle and individuals are seen through the filter of race, not individual personalites.  (Even though you may like everyone more than your obnoxious loser brother and would never marry anyone like him, you will defend him with your life if he is threatened.)  <br />
B00000K31V|4.0|eXistenZ is a great mind-bender, based loosely on video games vs. reality. The acting is campy but for a purpose. Most of the people who hated this movie don't quite get this. I won't say this is a classic, only because Chronenberg's fingerprints are way too visible, and I really like him.  <br /> <br />This isn't a mainstream movie so if you don't like left-field movies you probably won't like this one, but just to be clear you don't have to be a fuzzy faced philosopher to enjoy this one.
B00000DLVA|5.0|i've listened to them all and this one grabs me the most. the whole album is good. your favorite game got a little played out but is still cool. <br />erase and rewind is very nice.
B000M341QE|5.0|Forget what any naysayers here say. Yes, Martin Scorsese has made gangster/mob movies before, and yes \\"The Departed\\" does ride the coattails of \\"[[ASIN:B000286RKW GoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0007VZ9DK Casino (Widescreen 10th Anniversary Edition)]].\\" But you are - just as you did in those classics - getting to see a Director in his element as he guides an excellent cast through some of their best work.<br /><br />The three principles here, DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson, all give committed performances, and this may be DiCaprio's finest film. Even Mark Wahlberg comes off looking like he is an actor. The smaller roles punch through (Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, who has the best lines) to make everyone in the cast come across convincingly. While the film has serious continuity errors for those of you that like to pick for that stuff, the pace is so rapid-fire that I only noticed a few while watching. What you will notice, though, is how Scorsese manipulates the gore and the corruption to the point that it creeps into every frame of the film as \\"The Departed\\" charges forward. (You got problems with splatter or the F-Bomb? Leave this one on the shelf.)<br /><br />That is a lot to say about an almost three hour movie. The twists start flying so thick at the end that you may have to back track through the DVD to make the connections. There is plenty of suspense to be had in \\"The Departed,\\" and it was worth Scorsese's finally nabbing that Oscar.
B00006AW2J|4.0|This is a \\"must have\\" release mainly because it includes, \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man.\\"  It also marks the Stones' first serious venture into Southern R&B and blues written by them.

B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I have to admit that when I first saw that Rihanna was coming out with yet another new CD so fast I thought it was going to be a quickly thrown together pile of crap. In my opinion her first 2 releases had MAYBE a handful of decent songs and then the rest were very weak.<br /><br />Rihanna's third effort: 'Good Girl Gone Bad' is without a doubt her best CD and quite possibly one of the best CD's I have heard this year so far!<br /><br />It is remarkable! It has great beats, catchy hooks, a few guests, no entire song samples (think SOS  LOL) and her voice seems a bit better than in her previous efforts.<br /><br />The CD starts off with a bang with the melody driven, smash hit: \\"Umbrella\\". Great summer song to jam to. I do not think there is a single person that does not know this song.<br /><br />The CD keeps with the pace and takes us into the slammin' \\"Push Up On Me\\" that uses a very slight sample of the classic Lionel Richie tune \\"Running With The Night\\" in the beat. Very good use of that sample. Just an awesome song.<br /><br />Next it gets kicked up a few notches with an already club friendly: \\"Don't Stop The Music\\". VERY infectious beat. A great sample (in the deep background) of Michael Jacksons \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'. This song is so infectious - has you wanting to hit the nearest dance club to tear up the floor.<br /><br />\\"Breakin' Dishes\\" keeps with the energy with the beat but she steps the attitude up about 20 notches! Talking about how she is sick of waiting on her man and \\"breaking dishes all night and I am not stopping until I see police lights\\". Very good beat and lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Shut Up And Drive\\" is another great uptempo song with a nice rock edge to it. Very catchy - you will be singing this and tapping your toes after about 3 listens....guranteed!<br /><br />From here the CD slows down a bit. Not a boring, snooze-fest slow but a good mid-tempo slow. Some really great R&B jams. The most noteworthy are \\"Rehab\\" (no, not the Amy Winehouse's culy hit) and \\"Question Existing\\" - a very sensual and sexy slow jam with a good beat.<br /><br />This CD is EXCELLENT! A must purchase! I can tell there are going to be a lot of hits that come off of 'Good Girl Gone Bad'. They are all so melodic and radio friendly and the beats are off the chain!!  A 5 star release all the way!!!Question Existing\\" - a very sensual and sexy slow jam with a good beat. <br /> <br />This CD is EXCELLENT! A must purchase!

B000002UC5|4.0|Although a first class pop band, not all the Beatles albums have aged equally well. This album is not as _consistently_ good as their best few ('Abbey Road' and 'Revolver' are superb). It contains a few lightweight tracks, but hey, so do plenty of Beatles albums.<br /><br />However, the best tracks on 'McCartney' -- 'Junk' (including the instrumental reprise) and 'Every Night' -- are every bit as good as the very very best Beatles songs. And there very nice bits in some of the other tracks (eg. 'Maybe I'm Amazed' and 'Hot as Sun/Glasses').<br /><br />But, most importantly, it's _different_ from the Beatles. It has certain great qualities most Beatles albums lack -- charm and spontaneity in particular. Let's face it, the Beatles were a great band, so they carried it off, but a lot of their material was overproduced (although magnificently so) and often lacked an edge (I actually prefer many of the takes that came out in the Anthology series), and some of it now sounds dated and kind of pretentious.<br /><br />Of course these flaws don't matter -- they were the Beatles, great talents whose flaws and eccentricities just added character to their music. The point is, with this album, you have the _most important_ of those great talents producing songs with immense charm, warmth, sincerity immediacy and soul -- the very qualities in which the Beatles were so often somewhat weak.<br /><br />It's different, and I love it!

0671027344|5.0|I only started this novel yesterday and finished it.  The books text is light and reads very quickly.  Some have branded the book as being \\"trite\\" or having a generic update quality to it.  I'm giving it 5 stars, because I think while bits of it are predictable, the book isn't looking to be \\"the Stranger\\" or even \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", even if it does cite them.  As a modern coming of age bit, it does very well,  Although I do wish that I had been handed a copy of this at 16, instead of reading it at 22 upon finally finding a copy of it at a bookstore.  Although better late then never, it touches upon some familar, and honest themes that most will be able to relate to(while reading this, I envisioned it at my old high school and saw alot of the characters as people i'd known).  Alot of the cultural references I found very enjoyable, from the books, the music (the smiths and ride!), and even the films will be something that most people who've had a \\"outsiders taste\\" will be fond of, even if its not exactly their particular outsiders taste.
0393324818|5.0|I picked this book up, thinking it would be a great sports read.

1596912855|3.0|I'll read anything that relates to Austen even a little bit, frankly, so it was no surprise when I picked this book up off the floor at Book Expo America.   <br /> <br />Hale did a great job of capturing the obsession that so many of us have with Austen, Pride and Prejudice especially, and most certainly Mr. Darcy. It was a charming little book, definitely fluffy, but a great homage to Austen, her wit, and the regency consumed.  I was particularly amused by the main character's \\"fish-out-of-water\\" emotions once she got to her fantasy world and her irritation with the role in which she'd been plopped.  Her refusal to be Fanny Price made me laugh out loud.    <br /> <br />While the end felt a little forced and more than a little contrived, I read the book in a day and closed it with a smile on my face...so that should count for something, right?   <br /> <br />Worth the read if you get your hands on it!
0316018953|3.0|\\"The Overlook\\" is Michael Connelly Lite. The book was first serialized in a sixteen week marathon in the New York Times Sunday magazine. I skipped reading it there because I don't like reading on the installment plan. When novelists who are good dealing with serial killers, broken-down precinct detectives, crimes resulting from the Seven Deadly Sins--when they break out of their mold and try their hand at terrorists, the mob, big business, government conspiracies--their books usually crumble into clich&eacute;s, stereotypes and plodding plots.<br /> Connelly has written a novel that is a well-told story and a fast read. \\"The Overlook\\" is fast-paced, and it holds your interest. His series detective Harry Bosch is on familiar territory in the LAPD, but he's out of his element when faced with a terrorist nuclear threat. The threat is real enough, but Harry is like a fish out of water, thrashing around doing what a homicide detective is trained to do. He finds a witness a little too conveniently, a witness who describes everything that happened at the crime scene. What luck.<br />Harry, being Harry, you know he's going to battle his superiors, the FBI, Homeland Security, and whoever gets in his avenging path. He meets up with and tries to work with the love of his desolate life, Rachel Walling, who is an FBI agent extraordinaire. Poor Harry. In this novel, he's really going for broke.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This has to be the best documentary ever. Because of the quality of the photography and the resolution of the DVD you feel like you are there. You are seeing things few have ever seen and will never see again. This DVD is much better that the TV series. It is more in depth and the David Attenborough narration is much more detailed than the TV version. Also I have to put in a good word for Amazon. I was out of town for a funeral when the package came and it was taken but when I called Amazon the service was great and they quickly sent a replacent

0743277457|5.0|I know how it will sound: \\"This book changed my life\\". You hear such things all the time, there are thousands books on \\"self-improvement\\", and although most of them are not worth a second gaze, somebody somewhere will always sincerely say \\"this book has changed my life!\\" <br />So what is different about this one? Josh Waitzkin is. I just don't have another answer, all I can say is: I never thought that the human mind is capable of such things. I never thought people like him actually exist. That is why I can say already now that my life is different from what it was before knowing Josh: I will never be able to forget what I discovered about what humans are really supposed to be.  <br />On a lighter note, to sum up: a great enlightening book from a great guy, with some dazzling martial arts scenes -- well worth the money :-)
B000PGTPE6|5.0|Roughly a year ago Springsteen surprised a lot of people when he released We Shall Overcome: the Seeger Sessions. A record that was not so much a tribute to Pete Seeger but more a celebration of American musical history. The record was uncommonly loose for Springsteen's standards, the song basically being the result of impromptu sessions. Musically the album mixed damn near every style in American folk music between New Orleans Gumbo & Blue Grass. A highly unorthodox style that would raise the eyebrows of purists but sounded catchy as hell. The song selection on the record went back hundreds of years but had a strong connection with today and Bruce's own catalogue.    Even before the album went on sale, concerts were announced and tickets were sold in Europe. Again, nobody quite knew what to expect from this evening of gospel, folk and blues performed by Bruce Springsteen & his 17 piece Seeger Sessions Band. Nobody knew what to expect but the shows in Europe sold out in minutes. I think few who went were disappointed.     Live in Dublin is a registration of what this tour was about, not necessarily a registration of the concert experience. The DVD clocks in at a mighty two hours, the shows were often pushing the two and a half. Some concessions seem to have been made to make the show fit on one disc. Concessions that'll no doubt bother a lot of fans. Two tour staples were cut from the set. John Henry and You Can Look were played every night, yet didn't make the DVD. A totally redundant track as Love of the Common People did, as a bonus. Springsteen has always made strange choices when it comes to releasing his live material and this is certainly one of them.    Despite those odd choices the Live in Dublin DVD gives you a pretty good sense off how good these shows were. The tour was in part a explicit political rally with anti-war songs as Ms McGrath or the New Orleans tribute How Can a Poor Man (stand such times and live). Yet most of the time its message was more subtle. Songs as Eyes on the Prize, a recast to the civil rights movement, or When the Saints Come Marchin' In served the same function, but in a more subdued manner.     The political issues that the tour tried to get back on the agenda weren't its greatest achievement by no means. The celebration of music was. Springsteen's own material fitted in seamlessly adapted to the style of the tour. Open All Night became a stomper in the style of Louis Jordan, Highway Patrolman revoked the images of Hank Williams, Louis Armstrong was omni present in the horn section and if you didn't know any better Jesse James felt like it had been in Bruce's catalogue since mid eighties.     The DVD captures all the musicians on stage in all there glory. Seldom did Springsteen give his band so much of the lime light. And during no tour he did before did the audience play such a crucial role. The band sung, danced and played with the audience. Pay Me My Money Down was sung minutes after the band left the stage, until they came back for the encores and even the most convinced atheist would belt out the words to Jacob's Ladder. The Seeger Sessions Tour was a celebration and this DVD brings it all back.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Zimmer's second offering in the Pirates of the Caribbean series easily blows both the Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Man's Chest (easily the weakest of the scores) right out of the water. At World's End has not left my CD player since I got it about two weeks ago. <br /> <br />Easily the best cues are \\"At Wit's End,\\" where the absolutely magnificent main theme is introduced, \\"Up is Down\\" which brings in and also transforms Jack's theme from the first two films, \\"I Don't Think Now is the Best Time,\\" which is a ten minute action cue that is easily one of Zimmer's best action work of his career; the music picks up a relentless base-line of action music over which Zimmer brilliantly weaves four different themes together in and out, over top one another, \\"One Day,\\" which takes the big climactic theme from \\"One Last Shot\\" from Curse of the Black Pearl and transforms it along with a breath-taking restatement of the main theme from \\"At Wit's End,\\" and weaves the two together, and the finale cue, \\"Drink Up Me Hearties,\\" which includes a restatement of those classic themes from \\"He's a Pirate,\\" on Curse of the Black Pearl, this time sustained longer than a minute, and also includes what is possibly the best statement of the At World's End main theme for the last two minutes. <br /> <br />At World's End is easily some of Zimmer's best work. It is bombastic and epic, but it is also much more densely layered - the orchestra feels much more rich and full than usual - and has a touch of subtlety about it that may take Zimmer fans by surprise.

B00005JPD0|4.0|Let's make one thing perfectly clear: director Tony Scott does action. Whether it's [[ASIN:B0002WZTOI Top Gun]] or [[ASIN:6304936303 The Last Boy Scout]], he knows how to keep viewers riveted to the screen. He's also worked with the best Hollywood has to offer, from Madeleine Stowe and Gary Oldman to Nicole Kidman and Denzel Washington. This last name is significant since Washington and Scott have worked together on several previously successful film ventures ([[ASIN:B000CDGVQ2 Crimson Tide]] and [[ASIN:B00005JN0W Man on Fire]]), and come together again with DEJA VU.<br /><br />More of a science fiction action-drama, Scott dips gingerly into the genre to test its waters utilizing his own unique style. The staged explosions. The high body count. The dessication of morality through characters. It's typical Scott fodder but brandishing the SF genre adequately if somewhat disrespectfully.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about Deja Vu and one big hunk of burnin' dislike that might make or break it for some viewers (and we'll cover that in a moment). But first, let's look at the film's machinations...<br /><br />Denzel ([[ASIN:B000GFLKF8 Inside Man]]) stars as Doug Carlin, an investigator for the ATF. He's summoned to a ferryboat explosion in Louisiana and quickly wraps-up evidence regarding its cause: terrorism. Domestic or foreign? We're not sure. But the ferry carried a bunch of navy personnel on shore leave, which brings in the FBI. Specifically, Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer, [[ASIN:B000GDH9N2 10th and Wolf]]), who realizes the brainpower of Carlin (Denzel) and asks him to join his team of experts. Carlin agrees and Pryzwarra takes him to an elaborate mobile facility where \\"monitoring\\" equipment takes on surreal proportions. Carlin meets up with the rest of Pryzwarra's crew, Denny (Adam Goldberg), Gunnars (Elden Henson) and Shanti (Erika Alexander), and checks out the new gadgets (involving wormhole/foldspace theory coupled with time-travel).<br /><br />Carlin isn't immediately let in on how the technology works, but soon surmises that they are looking at the past. Three days past, to be exact. He's also interested in finding out who killed a woman who's body was found several hours before the explosion, burned and battered like the rest of the ferryboat victims but who's time of death doesn't match up. She's a beautiful Louisiana native named Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton, [[ASIN:B000JJSL1W Idlewild]]), and even in death, Carlin is oddly attracted to her. And when he sees her walking around in the FBI's three-days-past time-machine, he knows there's a connection between the bombing and her life.<br /><br />While checking out her kitchen, Carlin also finds a message on her refrigerator (\\"U Can Save Her\\"). Who wrote that and why? How can you save someone who's already dead?<br /><br />Racing against fate, destiny, and lateral time-lines, Carlin boldly goes where no man has gone before. And this is where the hitch comes in. When Carlin offers to risk his life to save Paula, we as the audience are supposed to believe that an entire human body can be transported through time using a machine never designed for such a thing (they send back a piece of paper and, in so doing, use so much of the local power grid that they blackout most of the South). Imagine the power required to send something as complex as a person and you see where the problem lay.<br /><br />There is one other thing that I have to mention that bugged the crap out of me, and that was the film's title. Deja Vu isn't really mentioned or hit upon until the closing moments, which made me wonder why they gave it its current title. And Deja Vu is more of a feeling and that didn't come through in the movie.<br /><br />But it was certainly entertaining. Tony Scott has another successful action film on his hands. But you might want to switch-off your overly analytical brain when it comes to the SF elements.in isn't immediately let in on how the technology works, but soon surmises that they are looking at the past.

B000001GXF|5.0|The main virtue of Emil Gilels as colossal pianist was always ironically his main failure: his extreme coldness. But when he played with the Amadeus quartet, something inside him seemed to bright with radiant intensity and his temperament showed us his Dionysian side, a remarkable and not precisely his main landmark.<br /><br />This was successfully what it happened with this remarkable version of the celebrated Quintet Op 144 best known as \\"The trout\\". Filled of nostalgic reminiscences and genuine Viennese flavor, they conveyed us the own core of this work.<br /><br />\\"The Death and the Maiden\\" is beautifully performed although I think no one has been able to surmount two insurmountable historical achievements of a recent past: the first version belongs to the famous ensemble Konzerthaus of Vienna of the middle fifties and the other is performed by the famous ensemble Chiringilian.<br /><br />My favorite Trout version  until this date: Horzowski and the Julliard ensemble, although I recognize the memorable versions of Paul Badura Skoda, Andras Schiff, Clifford Curzon, Rudolf Serkin and Arthur Schnabel.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Just got this flash for my Nikon D80 and I couldn't be happier. It's a lot of flash in a small package for just over 100 bucks. It's easy to use, easy to store, arrived in a matter of days, and has literally transformed my indoor images. Sure, I could have spent a lot more for the 600 or the 800 and gotten more pro-level capabilities but I just couldn't justify the price. My logic: get this flash and see if it meets your needs. At this price, one can always upgrade later. So far, it's completely exceeded my expectations.
B0000012YO|4.0|To intend to record the whole corpus of the piano sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven is by itself a titanic task for any acclaimed pianist. This challenge demands of you a superior vision, in case naturally you want to preserve and remark the minimum facets of this giant of music.<br /><br />The result has been a convincing approach for all those who really want to explore an analytical reading of these piano works. As a matter of fact the cool incisiveness, hovered by gelid thrills guided by an Apollonian vision.<br /><br />In this sense there are certain sonatas that resist this conception such the tempest, the No. 13, Hammerklavier, the Op. 7 and even the Pathetique.<br /><br />I find a lack of resolution and vital conception in other works such Moonlight, Appassionata and the initial Op. And effectively you need something more than a brilliant intellect and phenomenal phrasing to perform successfully the last three sonatas, that still are a true tour de force for any respectable pianist around the world. It demands, maturity, profound spirituality and sense of abandonment clearly perceptible since the number 27, 28 (since Hammerklavier is an immense and majuscule parenthesis into the creative vein of Beethoven).<br /><br />Nevertheless if you like this approach, come to the world of Emil Gilels.
B000P2A256|1.0|I consider \\"Songs About Jane\\" to be one of the best albums in my collection.  That being said, I wish I had never purchased this album.  This album is a pop/bubble-gum mess that completely fails in comparison to Jane.  I'm hoping that this album is a result of a producer's influence to target a specific audience, rather than the artist's freedom of choice.  What a HUGE disappointment.  However, I will recommend it to my twelve-old niece.  She prefers the pre-packaged predictable style of music.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is the most under rated show on tv, and it is one of the best shows I have ever seen.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I was willing to hear the next Dream Theater release to see what it was going to be like. After OCTAVARIUM, an album that I still consider a \\"revision\\" of the different styles that DT have recorded over the years, what was going to be next was kind of a mystery.    SYSTEMATIC CHAOS confirms even more the notion that Octavarium was musically transitonal. In the new CD, DT returns to the style they were playing in TRAIN OF THOUGHT, with a change: the new CD sounds as heavy, but with more progressive and chord changes, sounds and riffs added. It's like a combination of SIX DEGREES and TRAIN OF THOUGHT, a perfect balance that make me like this album more than the three previous. But I found that songs like CONSTANT MOTION and DARK ETERNAL LIGHT sound heavier that DT has ever been. They really rock !    Of course, this is not SCENES FROM A MEMORY, but it's still a worthy candidate to be there as one of the best albums they have ever released. It is produced by Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci (just like the 3 previous albums), this time with the help (as engineer and mixer) of Paul Northfield, who has lent the same services to the likes of Rush and Queensrÿche.    Even though this is not supposed to be a concept album, from a first impression it DOES look to have a concept, dealing with the themes of sin (in the form of the fight between good and evil), death, repentance and soul salvation. With the exception of \\"Prophets of war\\" (a self-explanatory protest song about the on-going war in Iraq) all the songs seem to follow a thread and fall into that category, which gives the album a spiritual meaning (and avoid a pair of slowers to sound mellow). That is until you hear what each song is about -in the DVD that comes with the special edition-. For instance, THE FORSAKEN is about a vampire, IN THE PRESENCE OF ENEMIES is about the attraction of the darkness and the temptation to fall into it (mmm...not unlike Anakin Skywalker's story), the MINISTRY OF LOST SOULS is about a trascendental encounter between somebody who was saved and his saviour who died. Still, the individual meaning of the songs, although more simplistic, is interesting.    The album have some good surprises. Mike Portnoy sings more than usual Not that he sings entire songs, but he appears in some instances as a complementary voice to La Brie's, and in others like in an interaction or \\"question and reply\\" manner. He sings good, providing a stronger element to make some heavy songs feel heavier (like the aformentioned CONSTANT MOTION and DARK ETERNAL LIGHT), and this might be a sign that he will do more vocal duties in the future.    Other great surprise is the inclusion of a batch of guest musicians in the song \\"Repentance\\", but in an original way: they don't sing or play, but do spoken parts, confessing \\"sins\\", to illustrate the theme of the song. There we have Steve Hoggarth, Neil Morse, Steve Wilson, Jon Anderson, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani... (why not Geddy Lee?).    In \\"Prophets of war\\" and \\"In the Presence of enemies\\", choruses are done by a bunch of fans that were invited into the studio (damn it, I wish I had been there!).    I think the best that I can say about this album is the same that I said about their last concert DVD: The songs have energy and vitality. DT still seem happy to play. Their motivation is still there...and they're still in the peak of their skills.    Notes on the Special edition DVD:  I highly recommend the special edition, a must for any DT fan. The DVD has the 5.1 mix of the album, that enhances perfectly the heaviness of the album and presents the execution of the different musical parts and instruments clearer. The mix is for DVD video players in Dolby Digital 5.1 (meaning that it can be enjoyed in ANY DVD player, and that there is no layer for specialized DVD-Audio players). Also included is \\"The making of\\" documentary directed and edited by Mike Portnoy. Mostly, is about the band members, performing, creating and talking about the wholeprocess (except John Myung, who is consistent with his \\"no speak about anything\\" policy). It's a real pleasure to watch the stages of the creative process, and how the skills and contributions of the different musicians convey in the whole as the finished product. By the way, there are no fights or heated arguments, but the band having a good time. It's interesting also in the information of how each song was conceived, and their meaning. And the documentary is surprisingly full of humor. The program has no subtitles.
B000O1799U|5.0|What a delightful musical! (I found myself calling it a Soul Opera - the first of its kind!) Chock full of beautiful music any soundtrack would be proud to call its own, this movie carries with it a shade of nostalgia that only a Baby Boomer could love. The Dreamettes are, of course, a slight rendition of the Supremes, and the history of their times is the backdrop for this award winning introduction to Jennifer Hudson (who easily overshadows Beyonce Knowles, I'm afraid). More than a \\"chick flick,\\" I would categorize this a fun date movie. It's a work of art, and not to be missed.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000INF2 The '60s]]
0143038419|5.0|This book was a true joy to read and experience. It touches on three very necessary, yet luxurious comforts that make life wonderful and full.  She is obviously an adventuress who can laugh at her darkest moments and then come to find the wisdom in chosing a different path. I am looking forward to reading her next book. It has also reminded me to be present in my everyday moments. Thanks Elizabeth.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|SO MUCH REVIEWS HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL SONGS. BUT I GOTTA HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING, HUGH GRANT AND DREW BARRYMORE SINGING SKILLS AND DELIVERY OF THE SONGS THEY RENDERED JUST GOT ME AWED. IT'S A BEAUTIFULLY DONE MOVIE/SOUNDTRACKS. BUY IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Rihanna did not disappoint with this hot CD starting out with the hit song Umbrella, and taking it from there. Although I can't say this is the best CD I've heard this year, you can definitely listen to it without skipping songs. So far, my favorite besides Umbrella would have to be Rehab. She hit home with that joint. I can't say this is a must have but it's enjoyable. Maybe see if I-Tunes has it cheaper.
B000P2A256|5.0|I know I'm not alone in thinking that Maroon5 in and of itself is a turn on, especially the things Adam does with his voice. <br />That being said, I love the new CD. Always a faithful listener, I had \\"it won't be soon before long\\" on the day it came out. I listened to it constantly for several days and learned many of the lyrics. \\"Little of your time\\" seemed out of place on the album but soon became a favorite, mostly for the line \\"please don't leave, stay in bed, touch my body instead\\" and partially for the fun sound of it all. The first time I heard the album, I was disappointed by how many were about the end of relationships, but as you listen closely they're all different and all could become your ideal \\"breakup song\\" if you're a person who applies such things. Of course everyone loves \\"makes me wonder\\" as it is their new single. I also recommend \\"better that we break\\" which was correctly described by people magazine as \\"swoon-worthy\\" and really tugs at your heartstrings. <br />Happy listening!
B00005RG6M|5.0|It's been well over thirty years since this album came out and I finally bought it for its surround mix.  I've been missing out on a lot of fantastic music.  This album is extraordinary in its own merit, but add the surround mix and you understand what \\"Queen\\" really was all about - the entire experience!  Sure, \\"You're My Best Friend\\" was a really nice song and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" defined an entire generation, but hearing it as it was pieced together in one collage of a musical experience and you'll understand what the big fuss is all about.<br /><br />Capitol Records remixed the 5.1 mix (kudos to Ric Wilson and Jeff Levison along with the entire team).  Each and every instrument and vocal is separated and cleaned up to appear from various places around your room.  Forget about headphones - get the `feel'.  There simply is no `best' song on this album.  Every song is its own masterpiece, but I am partial to the anthemic, \\"'39\\".  God Save the Queen!<br /><br />Also, includes \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" video, lyrics and photo album.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Systematic Chaos is easily the best DT album since Scenes from a memory! If you were disappointed with Octavarium (As I was) and a little skeptical about picking up this CD don't fret because this CD will remind you that DT is the greatest Prog metal band to date.
B00005JPAO|4.0|I shall begin this review by saying that I was not an avid fan of Princess Diana.  I remember her very well when I was a child with the hubbub about the royal wedding, and she had always been one of the most prominent celebrities that I knew of.  It seems that at any one point in time someone was talking about Diana.  I said at some point that it was just celebrity garbage and fluff, and gave a big \\"Who cares?\\" about it.  But if I didn't care, why did I wake up my mom in the middle of the night on that faithful day in 1997 when she was killed in a car accident in Paris?  And watch the funeral on TV a few days later?   <br /> <br />I did not watch this movie based on a celebrity fascination with Diana or any other of the British royal family, but to see the true flow of relationship between the government houses.  Helen Mirren does a superior job of portraying Elizabeth II, refined and stiff upper lipped to the T.  At the same time, just weeks before, Tony Blair had been elected, the first time in years that the Labour Party had been appointed as Prime Minister.  It was also a very exciting time in England, as there was a sense of change with his election.  Just as Tony Blair was getting his feet wet in his new job, Diana is killed in a car accident.  The UK, let alone the rest of the world, was thrown into chaos.  We looked to the queen to make a statement, but she remained silent. <br /> <br />This movie showed the tensions and conflict very well between the royals and the public.  Elizabeth had distain for Diana, to be sure, after the tabloid fiasco of her and Charles's divorce, so she wanted to remain silent.  From another generation of royalty and duty, she wanted to remain silent to show her respects; but, the public wanted to hear a statement as it's a different world now.  Plus having a new, enthusiastic Prime Minister pressuring her to adjust (I love that scene where they meet for the first time and she said \\"Winston Churchhill sat in that very same chair\\".), she had to say something.  And she did. <br /> <br />The only critical words I have for this movie are for the portrail of Prince Charles.  I wonder how true his reaction to Diana's death was.  It's hard for me to believe that Charles shead a tear for Diana.  After their failed marriage and divorce, I'm sure there were and still are sour grapes between them.  If anything I would think that he would be glad to be rid of her once and for all, because his aunt, Princess Margaret, said it best when she said that Diana was more annoying dead than alive.   <br /> <br />Still, this is a fine movie that flows very easily and shows a good snapshot of a point in time.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is the best album of the 70's and it wasn't even recorded in the 70's. I should know, I was there. (in the 70's, of course, don't be silly.)This is the only pop/rock album that I know of that takes the mysticism of what has come before and turns it into hope for the future. You can't go wrong by owning this piece of musical history.
B000068FUM|5.0|If the band were allowed to record this the way they performed these songs in concert, it would have sold more. A terrific step forward with a band improved by the addition of piano player and a drummer who both can contribute wonderful vocal harmony to the \\"univoice\\" harmonies of leaders Olson and Louris. A little bit of overproduction makes the sound a tad dense at times, but that is really a minor consideration, as the songs are well-written and arranged.  The title song \\"Tomorrow The Green Grass\\" could have fit nicely amongst the tracks on the album that bears its name, but you have to buy \\"National Lampoon's Senior Trip\\" Soundtrack CD to get that song, along with 'Darling Today' from the soundtrack to the film \\"Blown Away\\".
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I had the fortunate opportunity of getting a promotional copy of this album ahead of time, so this is NOT a snap judgement.  I am very much looking forward to the response to this album, and hope it will attract new fans who haven't yet explored buying a DT album.  Let me just say, this an album for one and all.   <br /> <br />When I say \\"Dark\\", boy, do I mean DARK.  The feel of this album is of that of a classic Good vs. Evil matchup, and for the most part, it's felt in every song.  For starters, I can honestly say that the bookend song, \\"In the presence of enemies,\\" is very well placed.  Had it been put together as one epic, I don't know if it would have had as much of an impact on the overall feel of the album.  Believe me when I say that this one ranks right up there with A Change of Seasons and Octavarium.  The first part is an instrument-driven introduction into the story, with some great vocal work by James LaBrie.  The second part is a vicious track that starts off with an eerie, heck, almost scary feel, reminiscent of the song \\"Black Sabbath.\\"  The song continues with a ferocious ranting section by LaBrie similar to that of \\"The Glass Prison.\\"  The whole thing ends with instrumental sections, including one that reminds me of \\"Sacrificed Sons.\\"  If you have DT's catalog, you will know what I mean.  If not, my apologies, but I can't describe it any better. <br /> <br />The song \\"Forsaken\\" is an obvious radio-friendly tune, but don't let that turn you off, this track is sick.  Petrucci's riffage on this thing is mezmerizing, and it's a very simple verse-chorus, verse-chorus tune.   <br /> <br />\\"Constant Motion\\" and \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" are songs that you've probably heard by now, so all I can say is that the mastered versions sound MUCH better than the demo and studio recording versions going around on the internet.  These are two of the heaviest songs Dream Theater has ever written, and are sure to please the fans of the heavy side of Dream Theater. <br/> <br />\\"Repentance\\" is the obvious continuation of Mike Portnoy's series on Alcoholism, and the whole song is a mellow tune with the riff from \\"This dying soul\\" serving as a nice backdrop to open the song.  Might I note, that this is the ONLY song on the album that doesn't eventually kick you in the groin with heavy riffs or blinding solos.   <br /> <br />\\"Prophets of War\\" is one of those tunes you will either love or just not listen to, because it's totally not dream theater's style.  It kind of sounds like rave music with a nice, heavy guitar riff behind it.  Really, this song is more about the message than the music.  Right wingers beware, heheh. <br /> <br />Lastly, \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\" is IMO, one of the best DT songs ever.  It is quite long, but well worth the listen.  Mellow, heavy, melodic, it has everything that is DT.  To put it into perspective for DT fans, it has the feel of \\"Misunderstood\\", with an incredibly HEAVY section right smack in the middle.  It is one of those songs that tries to pull at your heartstrings, but quickly reminds you that it is still no pansy of a song. <br /> <br />Overall, I can't wait to hear what everyone has to say about this album.  I am just as excited about fan reaction as I am just having the album myself, that is how good this thing is.  It reeks of instant classic, and you should not hesitate for a second to buy it.   <br />        <br />
0767830555|5.0|I have enjoyed a 30 year affair with this film. I watched it again last night and it just keeps getting better. The screenplay is exceptional, the cast flawless, the direction is perfect and it has a world class original score. I have seen it over 100 times by now and it never gets old. It may be the best film depiction of what it must feel like to deteriorate into a paranoid, psychotic state. If you have never seen it and can manage its dark content, it should be on your must see list. Hard to believe that it lost \\"Best Picture\\" to Rocky in 1976!
157912626X|5.0|In the author's foreword to The Body in the Library Christie writes: \\"I laid down for myself certain conditions. The library in question must be a highly orthodox and conventional library. The body, on the other hand, must be a wildly improbably and highly sensational body.\\"<br /><br />Christie kept to her conditions, and the results were very nice indeed. Whenever I read a Miss Marple book that I really like, I say that \\"this is my favorite Miss Marple\\". But I really think that The Body in the Library may well be my actual favorite Miss Marple. I have read that Christie herself thought that it was the best opening she ever wrote.<br /><br />What makes it a favorite? The contrasts between a flashy dead girl and the house in which she clearly does not belong are a part of it. It allows for a very nice exploration of life in St. Mary Mead. The characters are also top notch. The Bantrys are warm and funny, but still have their own depth. Conway Jefferson, permanently in mourning, is one of the most interesting characters in the Christie body of work. Still very nice to read after all these years.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|This cd is awsome! She took a new step! Right now she is experimenting! I think thats awsome!
B000002UAU|5.0|What can I say about this wonderful piece of work which hasn't been said hundreds of times by better writers than me.  This is the third copy (one vinyl record\1967 and two CDs) which I have purchased of this album.  I remember when it was first released and the world held its breath.  It was so different from anything anyone else or the Beatle's had ever done.  My first CD, by the way, was worn out by my older daughter who is 28 years younger than I am.  This just proves the lasting quality of this music.  Here we are forty years on and there is still something new to be heard everytime I listen to these songs. <br /> <br />By the way, my daughter now has her own copy.  If you don't have one, you should seriously think about correcting that lapse.
0743454537|2.0|I enjoyed this thought provoking book until I saw where the ending was going. I hadn't expected this author to wrap the book up with this type of ending. Like someone said, it turned it into a Lifetime Movie book. I don't know if I will read more of her books, since people keep telling me this is her best.
B000GTJT16|2.0|Everyone knows the movie and you're here because you love it, like me. So this is my HD review.  For the average person, it's fine but for videophiles, it's pretty dissapointing. Another early HD DVD they wipped out. (Just like early generation dvd's, this will get remastered down the road I bet- look at the Fifth Element on Bluray- they're already remastering it).  The opening sequences with the lettter/wax are horrible and the noise in people's faces throughout the film are just bad and annoying. Sure some parts look great but most of the film has a digital video look which is a shame. To its credit- it does look better than the original dvd but you know something.  I'd almost rather watch the older standard one \\"upsampled\\" on my 56\\" RPTV because it's softer than the really \\"digital\\" looking HD DVD version. <br />I wanted a high def transfer of all the fog and mist that gives it the feel of film because this movie is worth that \\"look\\". I've seen Apocalypse Now on \\"HDnet movies\\" and it can be done. They just didn't do it here. God bless the folks that think this is a great HD disc. Their lives are easier to please than mine.
B00000K19E|5.0|I mean how can you not list Matrix as one of the most extraordinary films  in history,with one of the most intriguing storylines  to ever hit the big screen. How utterly original, how truly amazed I am every single time I watch  it. It is a movie that can sit in the background of a party, on multiple tv's and everyone is in tune with it. Visually brilliant and the sound is bar none. If you couldn't follow this one, or could not keep up with  the fast paced and intricate plot, well then do not say you are too 'American' for a film such as this like the reviewer below. How shallow is that; instead go rent Fantastic Four, that should be trite, unmoving and American enough for you.<br /><br />Matrix is one of the greatest, and always will be. Stunning, rich in depth and suspense, totally engrossing and mesmorizing.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Linkin Park's new album, Minutes to Midnight is somewhat a drastic change from their previous two. Of course Hybrid Theory is their best disc but this particular album isn't a total wash-out. The reason I gave Minutes to Midnight four stars is because the band tried something new, which I always appreciate, the songs are softer but still have a rock edge to it, and Chester Bennington's vocals have never sounded more clearer and animated (in a good way). Standout tracks include: Bleed it Out, Shadow of the Day, Hands Held High, In Between, and Leave Out All the Rest. Expect to hear a different sound but ultimately it will leave you wanting more (if you like change that is). Happy listening!
B0007X6ST2|5.0|There's nothing cooler than finding out about one of your favourite artists' taste for music, right? I remember when I first heard John Mayer and saw that he sang something like \\"it's a bitter sweet feeling hearing 'Wrapped around your finger' on the radio...\\" It was really good to know that John Mayer probably likes The Police like I do.<br /><br />But what about when things are not that clear to notice? Well, for me, there's no better way to see that another favourite artist of mine, Dave Matthews Band, has actually found a source of inspiration in this albun, BRING ON THE NIGHT.<br /><br />If you listen to any DMB live recordings, you'll see that the kind of music they play is almost like when Sting dropped out The Police and lauched this first live albun. Everything is similar: the saxophone, a great piano player, spetacular drummer, three females backing vocals, etc... And all of that so very jazzy, with a little bit of groove, but pure intense music.
0440418569|2.0|There's no real way to put this other than to say that this book was a jumbled mess.  It was such a promising series at the beginning with such strongly and wonderfully drawn characters but, in the end, it seemed like Pullman had no idea what to do with them.  The plot of this book was rather nonsensical--and, at times, nonexistent--and while I have some serious critiques of my own about the church, the book seemed to be nothing more than a vehicle for Pullman to air his views about the evils of Catholicism.  It's a shame as this could have been a truly astonishing series.  In spite of the strength of the first two books, in the end it's not really a worthwhile read.
0618164413|5.0|It's so nice to have all the classic Curious George stories in one, big, beautiful hardcover book.  Curious George tales are timeless.  This collection would certainly make a nice baby shower gift. <br /> <br />Our daughters love when I read these stories, they never tire of them.
B000001Y5X|5.0|POAAF is the most real album Manson has to offer. I mean I love Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals, and Holy Wood more than this album but they're all much too built up on storylines and his appearances. Portrait Of An American Family is without a doubt the real Manson, Brian Warner or whatever you want to call him. The album is the fruition of his first thoughts and questions on American life and it's warped daily routines. To me this is the first record that a musician has ever attacked what was never questioned before. Most notably Religion. A perfect example of this would be the dark, grinding song known as \\"Cake and Sodomy\\". A song in which Manson attacks the stereotypical religious southern, TV watching Christian; the lyrics richly inspired by Pat Robertson of the 700 Club (if you read his book you would know what I mean). While \\"Lunchbox\\" offers a more comical side of Marilyn as he takes the role of a frustrated and bullied school child who wishes to be a huge rock star, a song loosely based upon himself. \\"Get Your Gunn\\" (the first single) seems to be the most outstanding track for Portrait due ot it's well-written lyrics and imagery. None of the other songs stray away from the seeminglessly harmless childlike themes gone horribly awry ALA \\"Organ Grinder\\", \\"Dope Hat\\", \\"Wrapped In Plastic\\", \\"Sweet Tooth\\" and \\"My Monkey\\". Comical horror and sound distortions are huge components in this album. POAAF delves into the warped mind of an aspiring rock star (as of Manson's stance in the Music world in 1994) who took on the topics never once opposed and pushed them to the limits of Society's buttons. Portrait is an early deep and brooding industrial gem. Remember without this early 90's classic, Manson and his future work would cease to exist. <br />
6304601425|5.0|This film is one of my favorites, to my mind ranking just below \\"Vertigo\\" (which I consider Hitchcock's masterpiece) and above \\"North By Northwest\\", which although spellbinding at times doesn't sustain the unbroken suspense of this 1935 work. The faces of both the major and minor characters, from the cleaning woman who discovers a body in Richard Hannay's flat to the wary farmer and his pitying wife to the innocent, handcuffed blonde, are all perfect. But what makes this film soar is the impeccable use of light and shadows - on the moors, in the farmhouse, in the bedroom of the inn. \\"Vertigo\\" is Hitchcock's best psychological study; the original \\"39 Steps\\" his best action-suspense yarn. This early work by the Master is coming upon its 75th Anniversary and it holds up remarkably well - in plotline, in dialogue, in acting, but most of all in texture. It's can't-miss filmmaking at its finest.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|IMHO, Linkin Park has matured into one of the most talented and vital bands of this era.  I've listened to this CD about 15 times now and it gets better with each turn.  I feel this band lives in the present and they are very accurate with their feelings toward today's main issues... money, greed, and war.  Hybrid Theory and Meteora were excellent for their time, this CD follows that legacy, but at a higher level!  Enjoy, listen closely, and don't fall into the trap of thinking that this should sound like the past.
B000654Z2I|3.0|A classic album that I've tried hard to like. But, ultimately, I come away frustrated with it. The first four tracks are pretty darn good. Nice, understated guitar phrasing. Inventive and propulsive drumming. A hip, dark atmosphere pervades the early parts of this album. Tracks 5 and 6, however, don't do anything for me. And they are really, really long. Also, I have no idea what the vocalist is singing about most of the time.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|\\"Good girl gone bad\\" is 19 year old R&B songstress Rihanna's third CD (in as many years), and the one that got me noticing. I was never crazy about her whiny, girly voice, but her singing has improved.<br /><br />Opening with the worldwide smash, the US & UK #1 \\"Umbrella\\" with it's addictive \\"umbrella ella ella\\" chorus, and obligatory rap provided by Beyonc&eacute;'s beau Jay Z.<br /><br />The Beyonc&eacute; connection is heard once again on the title track \\"Good girl gone bad\\" (lovely harmonies), a lovely acoustic song highly reminiscent of \\"Irreplaceable\\". Both songs were written by Neyo, who duets on the similar, but even catchier \\"Hate that I love you\\".<br /><br />\\"Push up on me\\" is an upbeat number which samples Lionel Richie's \\"Running with the night\\". Daring you not to groove is the pulsing club stomper \\"Don't stop the music\\" which features samples from Michael Jackson's \\"Wanna be startin' something\\", complete with MJ's lifted vocals.<br /><br />\\"Shut up and drive\\" is a rocky driving number sampling New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\", and due to be the album's second single.<br /><br />Other standouts are the brief but catchy electro/dancehall \\"Sell me candy\\", the dancehall tinged \\"Lemme get that\\" (both produced by Timbaland) and the midtempo acoustic \\"Rehab\\" (no, not the Amy Winehouse hit, but very nice too).<br /><br />For ballads we get the sultry \\"Question existing\\" (whose introspective lyrics are the album's lone attempt at lyrical depth) and \\"Say it\\". Far better than this pair however, is the beautiful soaring piano ballad \\"Cry\\", which is available on the UK edition of the CD. It's similar to her hit \\"Unfaithful\\" and features an emotional vocal performance.<br /><br />I really like the variety of sounds on this CD, and hopefully Rihanna will keep growing in leaps and bounds.
0143038419|1.0|I loved the concept, but hated this writer's voice and her insistance in interjecting her political beliefs into almost every chapter...for example, her sister's biggest fear about being pregnant was not that her baby would be born unhealthy, but that he/she would turn out to be a Republican!  How incredibly witty!  NOT!  The book lacked any real insight about what the people are really like in the countries she visited, just a bunch of bull about how much weight she gained, how she couldn't meditate, blah blah blah, stupid, boring, waste of money.  Threw it in the trash half way through.
B000MRAAJM|1.0|I was all hyped up to buy this set until I found out it's missing 110 minutes of supplimental materials that I've been told are amazing that are on the DVDs but not on the Blu-Ray or HD-DVD version. <br /> <br />WTF where you thinking? People that own Blu-Ray or HD-DVD are the people most likely to want those supplimental materials. <br /> <br />I'll buy when they are included. Until then, no sale!
B000A2W1X2|5.0|I was channel surfing a few months ago and just happened to arrive at the right channel at the right time to see this absolute gem of a film.  I thought I'd try it out and go on, but I was almost immediately entranced and couldn't look away.  I even set my clock and got up in the middle of the night to record it so I could watch it again the next day (which I did).  I had never seen any of the actors before, with the exception of the American, whose role as an observer and as a pointer to their eventual destination, seemed key to the story.  I was very impressed by every performance, each of which was so low-key and nuanced as to be a thing of beauty.  I was also knocked out by the honesty of each of the characters.  The dialogue was rather sparse, so the story had to be told in many scenes by the actors' faces, the tension in their bodies, and I have never heard such a wealth of meaning conveyed in the many one-word lines.  Such unflinching honesty is a rare thing in any age, but in this time period when so many people used words as a screen to hide their real thoughts, it must have been quite out of the ordinary to speak the truth as each character did, no matter the consequences.  I fell in love with all the characters - the lovers and their child - his sister-in-law and father - the young American - even the maid and the elderly butler who couldn't bend to the fire because his wig would fall off.  And the scene where the little girl asks her mother why she gave her away?  I've seen this movie half a dozen times and I still get goosebumps just thinking about it.<br /><br />Yes, I found this to be the absolutely perfect love story.  I wouldn't change a word or a look, and the photography and the music simply rounded out the whole.  I will undoubtedly watch it again, and again, especially now that I have it on dvd.  It touched my heart.
B000EOUSJU|5.0|Of all of the rock acts of the 1970's, Mott The Hoople was the band that experienced the most versitile creative changes of it's day. \\"The Hoople\\" is Mott's third and final release, completing the cycle that began with \\"All The Young Dude's\\" and continued with \\"MOTT.\\"  <br /> <br />Critics hated this album upon it's release in 1974 but for me this album is their defining moment. No disrespect to guitarist Mick Ralphs who left before this recording to form \\"Bad Company\\" but Ariel Bender (Luther Grovesnor formerly of Spooky Tooth) added the missing element from the Hoople's sound on all of their previous releases. His licks on this record remind me of the sound of other bands of this time including Queen and Sparks. Morgan Fisher who replaced original keyboardist Verdi Allen proved to be a superior musician and not nearly the head case that the explosive Allen could be.  <br /> <br />Ian Hunter's songwriting, progresses on this recording in leaps and bounds. \\"Marionette,\\" \\" Through the Looking Glass\\" and \\"The Golden Age of Rock N Roll\\" are just a few of the great songs that give us a peek into what would later become an outstanding solo career for Ian.  <br /> <br />If you are a \\"Hoople\\" fan from the the 1970's as I am, then you probably already have a copy of this. However if you are a younger fan of bands like \\"The Darkness\\" or \\"Keane\\" then you might want to get back to the roots with this all-time classic release. <br /> <br />Also Recommended:  <br />\\"Kimono My House\\" by Sparks <br />\\"A Night At The Opera\\" by Queen <br />\\"Desolation Boulevard\\" by Sweet
B0000C9JFO|4.0|I loved this film! Entertaining, colorful, lighthearted, and adventurous. This was a pleasant film to watch and while no deeper meanings of life were revealed it was a fun way to spend an evening.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|It was 1970, and in my eighth grade Honors Science class, we were learning about the greenhouse effect, about how CO2 helps to keep the Earth warm, and how on planets like Venus, an excess of CO2 keeps it incredibly hot.<br /><br />I raised my hand up and asked, \\"If we keep burning all this fuel and releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, wouldn't the CO2 levels start to go up, and then eventually we'll get a greenhouse effect here on Earth like on Venus?\\"<br /><br />The Science teacher blinked and thought for a moment, and then said, \\"Yeh, you're probably right, but it won't happen for another 100 years, and by then we'll all be DEAD.\\"<br /><br />Yes, for all you doubters out there, the science of global warming is really that simple - an eighth grader can figure this one out. I have  known it to be true since at least that time.<br /><br />This is a great documentary; Al Gore is terrific in this movie.  After watching this movie, having endured seven years of utter incompetence from the current occupier of the U.S. presidency, I really regretted not having voted for him.<br /><br />But will we be able to turn global warming around and stop disaster from striking?  I doubt it.<br /><br />Here's why - there is just too much human inertia, too much self-interest for people to want to step forward and sacrifice themselves when life is still good.  Al Gore makes the analogy to Churchill and the rise of the Nazis in Europe, and it is a terrific analogy, because, nobody, least of all Americans, wanted to take on Hitler at that time.  It was not until people had absolutely no choice that they were forced to act.<br /><br />And so I think that it will not be until life is unbearable that things will change.  Picture a third of the state of Florida under water.  Picture Shanghai and the Netherlands underwater. Picture a world of alternating excesses of water and massive drought all over.<br /><br />It is already happening, but the disasters have so far mostly affected the weak, the infirm, the old, and the poor.  The people who died in Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, the 30,000+  people who died in the summer heat wave in Europe in 2003, the killings in Darfur (a political conflict brought on largely by drought in the Sudan), the Pacific Islanders forced to move off their islands - the suffering of these people have barely registered in the minds of most people.<br /><br />It will not be until the vocal, affluent, middle and upper classes of America and Europe begin to suffer the effects of global warming that things really begin to change.<br /><br />And even then, how do you convince the 3 billion people of China and India to change?  They will continue to yearn for the living standards of the industrialized West.<br /><br />So, this is the Inconvenient Truth that Gore skips over in his talk: our modern standard of living simply requires vast amounts of energy, energy that we currently are able to generate only with carbon based fuels that release CO2.<br /><br />As just one example, the historic population shift in the United States into the Southern states was made possible entirely because of the development of central air conditioning.  Most of the Southern United States would be almost uninhabitable during the summer without air conditioning - modern office buildings often don't even have windows that can be opened to allow fresh air in.  Gore's own house in Tennessee was recently revealed to be a huge energy sink.  Similarly, much of the Northern states would be uninhabitable in the winter without heating fuel.  All of the things in modern society that we take for granted - air conditioning, cars, air travel, electric lights, running hot water, television, computers, aluminum, plastics, etc., etc., require huge amounts of energy which currently can only be produced by carbon based fuels.<br /><br />The truth is that in order to stop global warming, we have to stop producing CO2 entirely.  CO2 levels are already at historic highs.Merely reducing the rate at which we produce more CO2 will only slow the exponential rate at which the CO2 levels continue to rise, not reverse the trend and drop those CO2 levels.  And so all of the usual environmentalist measures for reducing CO2 emissions - solar energy, wind energy, biomass fuels, carbon taxes, greenhouse gas credits, fluorescent light bulbs, improved auto gas mileage, etc., etc., simply will not produce or save enough energy to reverse the rising CO2 levels.<br /><br />Outside of this DVD, Gore has dismissed the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to help solve global warming.  While I agree with him that nuclear fission is a dead end, for all the usual reasons, nuclear fusion has been seriously overlooked by nearly everyone in this debate.  Tokamaks and inertial confinement systems are no longer merely theoretical devices, and we are only one massive scientific development program away from producing commercially viable nuclear fusion power plants.<br /><br />Only nuclear fusion has the promise to satisfy both needs: to produce the massive amounts of energy needed to power our modern society and completely eliminate all CO2 emissions.  I believe that our future prosperity as a species will depend on our ability to harness the power of nuclear fusion.<br /><br />In the end, if we do not stop global warming, global warming will stop us.  The catastrophic disasters predicted for continued global warming can only result in a massive reduction in the number of people on this planet.  And that will cause the CO2 levels to drop, finally.the CO2 levels continue to rise, not reverse the trend and drop those CO2 levels.

0316018953|3.0|First up, I'm a huge fan of Michael Connolly and Harry Bosch.  Bosch always reminds me of that dog Harry from the kids books, the terrier aggressively and singlemindedly pursuing his own goal regardless of the opinion of his human family.  Sometimes I think Connelly must have harrythedog in the back of his mind when he writes Boschthedetective.  Second up I order these books in first edition hardcover when I can because I can't wait for them to be released in Australia.  Credentials established: I'm keen.    I've read everything in the series, plus Connolly's other writing, I admire the man for what he has put into contemporary crime writing.  I appreciate that he appreciates James Lee Burke.  BUT... to The Overlook.  Basically, it reads like he serialized it (which he apparently did for a New York publication) and then stuck it together while he had his mind on something else.  Bingo, book, bucks. I don't know.  It had potential, it did NOT descend into homeland-security-as-flavor-of-the-month. And praise God Harry didn't end up saving the world from a cesium flavoured radiation disaster. It just lacked life.  This book just wasn't three dimensional.  It was disappointing.  There was a distinct lack of character development with Bosch's new partner 'callmeIggy' and follow up on the new chief and Rachel Walling (Bosch's old squeeze).  Kiz Ryder is mentioned in a coupla lines and Jerry Edgar is definitely on the outer as usual.  Ex-wife and child are still in Hong Kong.  Brief reference to Harry's Vietnam past.  It's like Connolly needed to brush his fingertips across the landscape of Bosch which we avid fans desperately want to SQUEEZE!!!    So, fellow appreciators of Michael Connolly, I would say read it to keep up with Bosch, we will all forgive him anyway because the series is 5 star, but lets hope he's back on form for the next one.  And God let it be soon. We're a dedicated audience and it would take a mess of Cornwall-like proportions to stop most of us continuing with the series.  ps. DON'T PLEEEEAASE ever write in the first person Mr Connolly again, you're observations of Bosch in the third are far pithier and more lively.
B0000262QW|4.0|Yo, Chick!  Yanni called - he said thanks for the how-to manual.  Like how to make overwrought bombast.  Check out any \\"Elektric Band\\" offering and hear for yourselves.<br /><br />However, RTF is almost beautiful: graceful, passionate yet trippy.  Thank goodness for Stanley Clarke, Joe Farrell & Airto.  Their masterful restraint, their willingness to let the music breathe, saves the album.  Seriously, was Chick having an affair with Flora Purim, or did he lose a bet?  Having her \\"sing\\" on this smells of blackmail material.
0316018953|5.0|Yes, it's not as \\"long\\" as other Bosch novels, and yes it was serialized, but come on!  I read the first seven chapters while waiting for a book signing (I was really early) and was hooked by the second page.  It's a genuinely fun read, written in Connelly's \\"perfect prose\\" with good guys vs. the feds and the bad guys, some humour, some up-to-date insight into the LAPD and some good old Harry being Harry.  It's a shame some folks evaluate a book by it's page count.
B000P2A256|5.0|This CD is CRAZY good and SO much better than \\"Songs About Jane\\"! To be honest, I only like two songs on SAJ and I love almost every song on this release! Criticize the fact that they changed their sound if you must, but I think it's a spectacular change!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the chords (or at least the opening chords) on two of the songs are similar to other songs, but the songs were common radio-plays enough years ago that I doubt anyone else will notice. That nitpick isn't enough for me to want to subtract a whole star, just a quarter. But a 4.75-star rating is the best rating I've ever given a CD (to my remembrance) and that makes \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" the best CD I own!
B0002OERI0|4.0|The album itself is excellent, but I refer you to the other reviews for why.  However, it isn't Red Book-compliant, so I had difficult playing it at first on GNU/Linux.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Rihanna has finally made a solid album, almost void of her nasal tick of notes and need to have herself above the sound mix. Now with the right production, hello -- echo effect in play during \\"Umbrella\\" (a song Mary J. Blige turned down, yeah, kick yourself hard for that one, girl). Rihanna has dropped the too-sweet Island sun music that she never quite American-ized to have a run away hit and is able to avoid working with Teairra Marie at the food court.<br /><br />With the exception of the horrible slow jams that try to cater to her as if she had a strong voice, Rihanna does well with the sassy jams like \\"Lemme Get That\\" with its call to take every dime a man has on furniture instead of spending her own cash to do so ... why not have him buy the house too then? Even \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" which samples Michael Jackson's chant/call from \\"Wanna Be Startin' somethin'\\" is dipped in a little of reggae while still allowing her to cross over. It's nice to see her growing into her own, even though it is with massive help from studio production.<br /><br />In the past, it seems as if she had been searching for an image, this sassy, sweet vibe suits her well. Even the film-noir album cover works. The only riff: when she fails, she fails hard! Slow jams just aren't her strong note, when its too much of a vocal push for her. Its like telling Ciara to go out there and belt -- not gonna happen. Rihanna has made an excellent summer album that'll stick on the charts for a long time or until Beyonce gets Jealous and tells her to sit down.
B000E1MTY0|3.0|I own the original version and the HD version. If your thinking about double dipping maybe this can help.I popped in the original first then the HD and compared the Tumbler scene to cure Rachel. <br /> <br />Visual: Obviously the HD is a better image but not as much as you might expect. I kind of thought this might happen considering the movie has a pretty dark layout throughout. In the original Rachel's face has a hint of some colors that shouldnt be there a slight greenish blue-ish. In the HD version the color of her face is completely natural almost perfect. I also notice more detail on the bat suit in the HD than the original. Although I do notice a difference I dont recommend double dipping this film because its not such a drastic improvement as you see in other films. I plan on renting dark movies (v for vendetta) before I double up because I have a feeling this will remain consistent. <br /> <br />Sound: Once again, the sound is better but I expected it to be much better. The rumbling of the engine wasnt that much stronger than standard DD.  <br /> <br />Unless your an absolute fanatic of this movie I dont recommend doubling up on it because the improvements dont really make the movie experience that much better.

B0000AQS0F|1.0|Let me first be honest and fess up to the fact that I did not watch Firefly when it was aired on Fox.  I wasn't privy to the conspiracy theories and feelings of betrayal that stew in the hearts of \\"Whedo-philes\\" the world over.  And despite the less than appealing summaries available on the Television Without Pity website (yes, they're snarky, but when is TWoP anything less than brutally honest?), I tried to accept as reasonable the praise heaped upon the series by my friends and the legions in cyberspace.<br /><br />My first exposure to the world of Firefly was the movie Serenity.  It was entertaining, and overall not a bad piece of science fiction, but hardly the Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever, as it was recently voted in some throwaway internet poll.  So, with my interest piqued, I finally borrowed the DVDs from a friend and proceeded to watch all the episodes, in the order they were intended to be viewed (which, apparently, is a huge issue for the fanboys out there.  But I digress.)<br /><br />My judgment?  Firefly deserved to be cancelled.  Period.<br /><br />If you're a fan of science fiction and truly wanted to see this show succeed, don't blame Fox.  One person, and one person alone is to blame:  series creator Joss Whedon.<br /><br />Firefly doesn't hold a candle to his work on Buffy and Angel.  But its sin was not that it was bad in the conventional Sci-Fi Channel weekend movie manner.  No, Firefly was bad in more insidious ways.  Simply put, it represented the worst that can happen when bad writing gets green lighted.  From the theme song that is second only in crapitude to that of Enterprise, to the stock, two-dimensional characters, to the hackneyed, clich&eacute;d plots, to the obvious use of the Western motif that enabled him to film sci-fi on the cheap, Firefly was rightfully doomed to fail.<br /><br />My experience watching Firefly seemed to have the opposite effect as it had on most of the other reviewers.  Instead of affirming in my mind that Joss Whedon can do no wrong, I became increasingly frustrated as the episodes progressed.  With little exception, they're just terrible.  I winced more than a few times at what qualified as a plot, and was actually angry by the time I finished the last disk.<br /><br />Whedon, as has been shown in the past, is capable of much more.  The fact that he didn't deliver on this series was no real shocker though.  He has stumbled in the past (remember Alien:  Resurrection?).  But it's impossible for anyone to truly defend this as anything more than trite.<br /><br />I will admit that the actors accomplished wonders with what they were given, and the space effects were some of the best I've seen on network television.  But that's all I can point to as a positive.  Good acting and flashy visuals can't sustain poor writing.<br /><br />Whedon, if you're reading this.  You should apologize to all your fans and promise not to get so full of yourself ever again.  We know you've got more in you than this steaming pile.  Now go hire an editor and get back to work.don can do no wrong, I became increasingly frustrated as the episodes progressed.  With little exception, they're just terrible.

B00005JM02|1.0|The movie was a little boring and looked really fake. You could tell it wasn't real and was just a bunch of silly puppets. I hope the kids that watch it don't really think fish can talk. Most of the movie is scientifically inaccurate. At one point there are a lot of \\"baby\\" fish. These fish appear, no, not as fry or something else that makes sense, but as slightly smaller versions of the adult. After this, these \\"baby\\" fish climb onto the back of a stingray (a predatory animal that should be eating them) who is their \\"teacher\\" he swims around and sings songs while the \\"baby\\" fish ride on his back. Other associations appear in this movie that I doubt have ever been observed in the wild. At one point, a clown fish is talking to a seahorse and an octopus, two of which only associate with their own kind, and one of which will kill anything to get within several feet of it! Does this happen in the movie? NO!<br /><br />However, what I find most disturbing is not the numerous scientific inaccuracies, but the fact that most people that view this movie regard it as a documentary on ocean life. I have seen kids at the aquarium pointing at fish and referring to them as a \\"Nemo\\" or a \\"Dori\\".<br /><br />Anyway, the stingray teacher manages to lose the baby clown fish (big surprise, what do you expect with a stingray for a teacher, you're lucky he didn't eat the kid!). And the clown fish gets captured and put into an aquarium in a dentists office with, yes more talking fish, but just wait! In this tank, there are also talking shrimp, and even a talking Starfish.<br /><br />OK, now talking fish is one thing. They may not have lungs or vocal chords to produce speech, and not even close to sufficient cognitive function, but at least they're vertebrates! But having an animal without even a brain talking!? That's just ridiculous! And speaking the same language as the fish!<br /><br />Now, yes, there have been strange things in Disney movies before. In Alice in wonderland there are talking flowers, and even a talking slug that smokes opium. However, Alice in Wonderland is the delusion of a madman, and does not take place in the natural world. Hence the name \\"Wonderland\\". However, does Finding Nemo take place in \\"Wonderland\\"? NO! It takes place in the Great Barrier reed, just outside Australia! Did the maker think \\"Well, nobody that watches this movie has been to Australia, so they won't know that the fish don't talk there\\"? I don't know what he was thinking, but I wasn't fooled! I personally have been to Australia, and the fish do NOT talk there! this movie makes no sense and is in no way entertaining.<br /><br />After that, the fish attempt to make their tank dirty by clogging the filter, in which they succeed. However, the maker of this film has obviously never kept saltwater fish before. If he had, he would realise that after living without a filter for more than an hour, every fish in the tank would be dead. Does this happen? NO! The tank just gets really dirty and the fish remain just as alive as ever! I couldn't take it any more. I walked out of the theater after that.<br /><br />Do not regard this movie as factual! Do not take your children to see this movie! This is one of the WORST places to get information about fish.

B000P2A256|3.0|Not bad, not great. I heard this group twice in the same week, on both \\"American Idol\\" and \\"Saturday Night Live\\".  Specifically the song \\"Makes Me Wonder\\". My mother liked the song, so we bought the CD. <br /> <br />I wonder if the lyrics on the American Idol performance are different from the CD version of the song--I noticed the key is different (B instead of A), but I wonder if that was not the only change. On the CD recording of the song \\"Makes Me Wonder\\", they sing the F-word, three times, each time right before the chorus. Odd that a \\"Parental Advisory: Explicit Content\\" label isn't on there. The lyrics in the liner notes confirm the existence of the F-word. Of course, if you have objections to such language, then don't buy this CD. <br /> <br />BTW, does anyone out there have recordings of the guest band performances on American Idol? I know that it was a Wednesday in May, as I hadn't watched the show until the end of April, and I can't remember if the lyrics were changed for the show or not. I would really like to know.
B000A2H59M|5.0|Frank Zappa-Apostrophe(') *****<br /><br />The first half of the album is sort of a concept album, well a mini-concept album about an eskimo named Nanook and all of his wild adventures. The second half of the album just plays out like a well polished jazz record with satire thrown in for lyrical content. Filled with some of the most outragiously satirical lyrics in Zappas cannon, and some of the most amazing guitar work ever heard or played mixed with some of the strangest sounds ever recorded but by this time the world had come to expect that from the genius that is Frank Zappa, and some how all of this madness managed to become a hit album. How you ask well lets see.<br /><br />By this time Zappa had earned much respect in the musician comunity and a large fan base because of his humor. By the time Apostrophe(') was released in 1974 the world had began to realize that listening to a Zappa album is like whitnessing a shock and awe mission and many were curious about it. With the large success and suprize radio air time of 'Dont Eat The Yellow Snow' Apostrophe managed to become a gold album, Zappas first of his career. The song had catchy lyrics, and a great melody, and not to mention the amazing guitar playing through out.<br /><br />The first two tracks 'Dont Eat The Yellow Snow' and 'Nanook Rubs It' are combined together as a single just title 'Dont Eat The Yellow Snow' which is another reason why this album is essntial and so cool because this is the way that it was ment to be heard.<br /><br />'Nanook Rubs It' is a bluesy song about the murdering of Nanooks favorite baby seal. 'St. Alfonzo's Pancake Breakfast' plays out like some strange love at first sight with Tina Turner singing backup. 'Father O'Blivion' is a fushion jazz track that is just so out of this world that it must be heard to apreciate, this track ends the mini-concept album.<br /><br />The second half of the album opens with the Zappa classic 'Cosmik Debris.' This song has gone on to be a fan favorite appearing on almost all of Zappas post human compalation albums. 'Excentrifugal Forz' is just insane. Must be heard, and is truly one of the best songs that Zappa has ever written. The title track 'Apostrohe(')' is an amazing insrumental that contains some of the very best guitar playing ever recorded. 'Uncle Remus' starts out as a old time piano ballad, somewhat wild west-esq. Then it transforms into an all out guitar assualt on the ears. 'Stink Foot' is a song that not many feel is a highlight but that is just wrong, the song takes up a fifth of the 32 minute album, it is vital to the album and is perfect for closing an already great album.<br /><br />Aside from Zappas guitar playing which is amazing and prevalant through out the album he also wrote everything he himself did not play. All the background music is of his own writing. All the Xylaphone, drum, ect. are all written by Zappa so not only was he playing and singing along but conductiong as well.<br /><br />Apostrophe(') is an amazing album that no Zappa fan can not own and still call themselves a Zappa fan.

B00001OH7V|5.0|david bowie's second album with brian eno is one of the best albums in both artists discographies... the album uses the same formula that was so successful in Low.. roughly half instrumentals half vocals.. and the match is perfect - the two sides complement one another in a way you would not expect.. highlights of the album are the tracks 'beauty and the beast', sons of the silent age, and the very ethereal 'moss garden'... this is a complete musical experience of two equally gifted artists..
0439813786|5.0|You know that feeling when you're sitting in a movie theater and the lights dim? The audience hushes, the curtain opens, the music starts to play, and suddenly you feel as if anything can happen, as if your very dreams could be projected up there on the screen.  <br /> <br />OK, on the other hand, maybe you don't know --- or remember --- that feeling at all. In this age of megaplexes, stadium seating, DVDs and home theater systems, it's hard to imagine a time when going to the movies was truly a magical experience. In his fascinating new novel, THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET, Brian Selznick brilliantly recaptures this feeling and repackages it for a new generation.  <br /> <br />Selznick's reputation up until now has been primarily as an illustrator, so it's no coincidence that nearly half the novel's pages consist of wonderfully detailed line drawings. What's remarkable about the way Selznick uses illustrations, though, is that the pictures --- often as much as the text --- help to tell the story, to set a scene, even to develop characters.  <br /> <br />Take the novel's opening pages, for example. On the first two-page spread, we see a full moon peeking out of a small white box in the middle of a sea of black. On the next page, the box opens up to reveal more of the sky. Likewise, in the third and fourth pages, the black border (like movie theater curtains) retracts to reveal the Paris skyline. Subsequent pages focus on the Paris train station, and finally settle in on one particular boy in the teeming, bustling crowd inside.  <br /> <br />That boy is Hugo Cabret, whom we proceed to meet in the text that follows. Hugo is a lonely boy, an orphan who has been charged with maintaining the many clocks in the train station. Hugo secretly lives in the station, too, stealing what he needs to get by. This includes not only food, but also small mechanical toys from the grouchy old gentleman who runs a toy shop in the station. Hugo needs the parts to help him repair the clocks --- and to try to fix his greatest secret and most prized possession.  <br /> <br />It's an automaton, an incredibly intricate mechanical man. Hugo's father found the machine and spent years trying to fix it. After his father's death, Hugo is determined to fix the automaton. After all, the automaton's mechanism should allow it to write --- maybe even to pass on a message from Hugo's dead father. If only he could find a way to make it work!  <br /> <br />Soon enough, though, Hugo's thefts get him in big trouble with the toy shop owner. Hugo's new connection to the man and his busybody goddaughter seems to threaten the future of the automaton as well as Hugo's own well-guarded secrets. Or could it be that these new acquaintances are just what Hugo needs after all?  <br /> <br />Inspired by real historical characters and films, Selznick's novel is a real breakthrough in storytelling technique. By using illustrations --- including not only his intricate drawings but also film stills and other archival photos --- to further the plot, establish setting and even develop his characters, Selznick's spare prose seems to gain gravity and importance as well. Readers will pore over not only the illustrations, but also the words, which are rarely wasted and often contain real wisdom.  <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl <br />
B00006AW2J|5.0|the stones sixties output was the perfect balance for the beatles more friendly sound.. The stones had a very earthy, bluesy , rocking sound.. one of their best albums where there sound comes across in an almost perfect fashion is 'beggars banquet'... It contains some of their most socially confrontational material including the hard hitting anthem of an opener 'sympathy for the devil'.. this somehow beautifully merges with the much slower contemplative 'no expectations'.. indeed this serves as a formula for many upcoming stones releases (sticky fingers is the perfect example).. 'dear doctor' shows the stones flirting with country western... another big track on this album is 'street fighting man' another hard hitting rocker.. again the rockers are balanced out as it is followed by more acoustic bluesy music.. you can clearly hear the influence of the blues legends that the group loved so much particularly the ones that worked for chess studio like howlin wolf.. beggars banquet is indeed a banquet of classic stones material.. the main delight for me is in discovering some of their acoustic tracks which have gotten little or no radio play.. and also it is nice to see their work as it was intended in the context of an album...something their best of collections have greatly destroyed.. This is a band at its peak..
0060885378|5.0|Laura Ingalls Wilder was born in 1867 into a warm and loving family. She lived in a log cabin, traveled across the country in a covered wagon and shared the story of her life in the classic Little House book series, which millions of readers have loved since 1932 when LITTLE HOUSE IN THE BIG WOODS was first published.<br /><br />Because there was a period of Laura's life that she didn't include in her series, well-known author Cynthia Rylant wrote another Little House book called OLD TOWN IN THE GREEN GROVES to fill in the gap, and William Anderson penned LAURA INGALLS WILDER: A BIOGRAPHY. Within these 11 books, readers will discover an honest portrayal of the life of a pioneer girl --- from her travels as a toddler in a covered wagon to an airplane ride when she was elderly.<br /><br />Aside from the excellent stories, the Little House books are full of fascinating facts. Have you ever wondered how the old-time settlers made butter? Here you will find out each step in the process, along with the surprising way that Mrs. Ingalls colored the butter yellow. When Laura's mother needed a vegetable grater, Laura's father made one by punching an old pan full of nail holes. When the family wanted to eat meat in the winter, Mr. Ingalls went out to the shed and hacked off a chunk of frozen meat with an ax.<br /><br />Through good times and bad, sorrow and pleasure, danger and celebrations, the Ingalls faced hardships and fortunate times alike, united in grace, humor, love and hard work. It's a pleasure to join them in these tales, which are as relevant and gripping today as they were 75 years ago.<br /><br />P.S. Attention, boys! Do you think this series is only for girls, since Laura is the main character in all of them except FARMER BOY? Think again. The Little House books are actually exciting, gritty survival stories filled with adventure and danger. I double-dog dare you to read just one of them (especially THE LONG WINTER) and not be hooked.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon-- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I love Dream Theater and to me this is the best album they have done since Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance. Train of thought was good, octavarium had its moments but overall i didnt like those 2 as much as Images, Awake,Scenes and Six. Imo DT have a made a real awesome album with Systematic Chaos, every song is solid....Highlights would be the last 2 tracks. The only problem i had is i bought the original version today and the last 4 mins of Enemies part 2 starts to skip, maybe its just my c-d? but it could be the label too, i think i have to buy the special edition.....Anyways SOLID...5 star release.
0307275639|3.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is a sweet book, the touching account of a man who largely forgot about his favorite professor until rediscovering him through a news broadcast and sticking with him through the decline brought along by the terrible degenerative disease ALS.<br /><br />The hype surrounding this book is phenomenal. It has \\"changed the lives of millions\\" we are told. I am glad that I am not inclined to believe such hype. As it is, I enjoyed the read, but if I were expecting a life-changing experience, I would have been sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I have no doubt that this book has changed lives. I also suspect that those who will find it most profound are the ones who actually stopped living long ago, wandering instead through their daily existence without giving any of it thought: why they do what they do and where they hope to be when it's all over. For those who started out idealistically and have since become zombies, merely going through the motions of life, the book will no doubt be something of a wakeup call. I suspect that this is really the kind of book that will resonate most with baby boomers, entering or nearing retirement, thinking back on their lives and comparing how they've lived and what they've done with the ideals to which they once claimed to subscribe.<br /><br />The wisdom contained in this book is really just the perspective of one man. While an extraordinary teacher, we must be reminded that he speaks merely from his own life experience and the principles that he himself chose to adopt. That he is able to speak so clearly while facing his own mortality is admirable. Nevertheless we are asked to accept Morrie's philosophy, which quite frankly, seems to me to be incomplete.<br /><br />Among the tones of the philosophy we're asked to swallow is a certain anti-commercial tendency, the sort of thing found frequently among academics who spend their entire lives inside of large institutions--with generous salaries, even more generous benefits, and tenure that insulates them from the forces that affect many of their students. Let us not forget that the reason that we have the universities that we do and the support that enables so many professors to be employed is because of commerce. Whatever its importance, love will not pay the professors' bills. If love alone were to do the job, we would not be able to see such a difference in the public education system at the secondary level, where underinvestment has left a hollow shell of a system, little more than a state-run daycare service. (Any rational response would be to attract investment, but rational behavior is not what one should expect of bureaucrats that work not to achieve success beyond perpetuation of the bureaucracy.)<br /><br />Another feelgood soundbyte is the supposed wisdom in \\"tak[ing] responsibility for one another.\\" While it might sound nice at first, getting us to think of greater goods and to consider the needs and desires of others, the fact is that it is a solution that's worse than the problem it means to address. This is what happens when good intentions are not supported by critical analysis involving careful review of the facts and a search for unintended consequences. But consider what it means to \\"take responsibility\\" for someone else. How we handle responsibility is one of the best ways for us to demonstrate character, to show the world of what we're made. Actions speak louder than words. Take responsibility for someone else and you've robbed him of the ability express himself to the world in a way far more meaningful than what would fit on a bumper sticker or placard. Caring for our responsibilities will keep us very busy, running from one place to the next, something else that is criticized in the book.<br /><br />Where I will agree is that we must never forget the larger picture, the context in which we operate. We must always remember why we have made the commitments that we have and why we bear certain obligations. In so doing, we'll be better prepared to manage them and we can avoid being overtaken, failing to deliver what we have promised, harming our organizations, communities, and families.<br /><br />An additional example of how playing fast and loose with the facts leads to silly conclusions can be found in the discussion between student and \\"coach\\" on the Bible book of Job. Actually reading the text would reveal that it was not God who tested Job, but it was the Devil. The test was not intended to be a means to measure Job's faith but an instrument by which to break Job's principled attachment to God by removing everything that might have been called a God-given blessing. Failing to know the basic facts of the story led to an absurd and useless conclusion (\\"God went too far\\"). Missing this point is absurd because much of Morrie's philosophy is about knowing your principles and living by them instead of going along the path of least resistance--precisely the point of the book of Job.<br /><br />That readers are implicitly asked to buy into the wisdom of a dying man is a bit much. It isn't as though humanity has existed for millennia, devoid of answers to life's big questions. Interestingly, in this Tuesdays With Morrie is quite different from another recent treatise on one's own experience. In The Measure of a Man, Sidney Poitier writes that he has no desire to play the \\"pontificating fool,\\" writing as though he has the answers to the questions that each of us faces.<br /><br />Despite these criticisms of the book, I think that considerable recognition should be given to Mitch Albom for opening up as he did, for giving such an intimate look into his life at a time of major transformation. His awakening might have been a private affair that revealed itself strictly in his own life and by those who knew him directly if not for his willingness to share. Finally, a word about Morris Schwartz is in order. An extraordinary man undoubtedly carried that name. Through his own personal tragedy, he did continue to live by his principles, to give and to teach. Whether I agree with his conclusions is simply immaterial. A teacher is not one who promulgates a dogma to be assimilated, but one who raises the questions and shows enough of himself and his experience to give students the tools they need to reason and the guidance they need to use them. A teacher who can do this in his own lifetime is good. A teacher who can exert such influence beyond his own lifetime is great.ns.

032147404X|5.0|My title really says it all. This book is written in plain English with examples and easy to follow logic. The author does use a bit of his personal humor in the writing which may or may not be your thing but its easy to skip the chapter introductions and dive directly into the excellent meat of each section.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|I've always loved the batman movies, although Batman & Robin was definitely the low point in the movie series. You can rest assured that Batman Begins is truly a new beginning for the franchise.  On top of this being a great movie, the HD DVD version looks & sounds great w/ my 32\\" Olevia 1080i LCD HDTV and my JVC Home Theater in a Box.  Highly recommended for Batman fans, but also people looking for a great HD action movie.  This was the first HD DVD movie that I got with my HD DVD player, and if all movies are going to look this good in High Definition, I totally support the HD era.
B000PTYP5C|4.0|Though I have been a fan of Dream Theater for at least 15 years, I had low expectations for Systematic Chaos. I never liked Train of Thought, and though I felt that Octavarium was much better, it still didn't touch on the brilliance of previous albums like Scenes from a Memory and 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence. If this one had not been so stellar, I would probably have drifted away.  <br /> <br />BUT... Systematic Chaos is incredibly good. Listening to it reminded me of the sheer joy I felt at hearing Scenes From A Memory for the first time. While it is not, perhaps, as good as Scenes, it is every bit as much fun. <br /> <br />While one of the things that I have loved the most about Dream Theater has been their highly intelligent and often very introspective lyrics, seeing them take a departure in favor of fantasy and horror based lyrics was surprisingly cool. It was refreshing and different. Kudos, in particular, for the  lyrics to The Dark Eternal Night, which seem almost certain to be a paraphrased version of H.P. Lovecraft's classic 'Nyarlathotep.' <br /> <br />All in all, this album has restored my faith in Dream Theater's ability to surprise and entertain. Its an excellent album.
0312117337|5.0|This deck is well-packaged and well-made with beautiful images.  It is not just another Rider-Waite variant, but has been carefully designed around its theme of the teachings of Zen Buddhism.  I thoroughly recommend it as an interesting change of pace from RW decks, especially for those who are interested in practicing mindfulness and developing self-awareness.
0618526412|5.0|I loved this story and it haunted me for a long time.  The writing and imagery was chilling and inspiring.  I felt like I was a part of the story and liked the writing so much that I went to the library and read everything from Carson McCullers.  This was by far her best work.
1572814748|5.0|This is a nice-sized portable deck.  I've been enjoying my full-sized Universal Waite and wanted to get something smaller to carry with me sometimes.  This deck is a good size for smaller hands and still has good detail in the images, unlike some of the miniature decks.  What I like about the Universal Waite is that the lines of the drawings are finer than the original Rider Waite and the coloring is more shaded, making the pictures look less cartoonish.  One difference between this deck and the standard size Universal Waite is the colors are a little different.  The greys are darker and the reds are a little duller, as though the pictures were photographed in a different light for this deck.  The result is that this deck doesn't look quite as bright as the standard size deck.  However, another effect is that some of the more subtle pastel blending on the cards is more visible, which is appealing.  Another difference is that this deck doesn't have the glossy coating of the larger deck.  The packaging is excellent, a sturdy little box with a top that slides on.  Too bad the standard size deck doesn't come in the same style package.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|What else can I say? This movie was totally awesome!!!! I loved the special effects and the hidden meanings in the plot of the story!! <br />To really enjoy this movie you probably would have to be like me and have never read the comic books of Ghost Rider. Sometimes when you read the story then see the movie your usally disappointed in one way or another but yet there are a select view who are able to keep an open mind and are able to enjoy both the movie and the comic books about Ghost Rider. <br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone especially if they like the special effects and meaning of the Ghost Rider story. <br />
0880796863|2.0|This was the first Waite deck I got and it just didn't appeal to me.  The main problem is the blues of the original images that they reproduced for this deck have apparently all faded to a dull pale green that is very unappealing.  I have since acquired the Universal Waite and find it much more pleasant to use.  The Original Rider Waite is of historical interest, but I think will not appeal to many users.  The packaging is well done, though Waite's Key to the Tarot booklet is less useful to a beginner than a book such as Rachel Pollack's Seventy Eight Degrees of Wisdom.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This season of Lost is on par with the first. Season 2 was definitely a dip in quality and excitement, but these episodes redeem the show completely. The addition of Juliet was a big plus in my opinion - she's one of the most interesting characters. This season is full of answers and also new questions, in typical Lost fashion. It's an exciing ride, from start to finish.
0880794968|4.0|I began with the Original Rider Waite tarot deck and found the colors and thick lines unpleasant.  In contrast, this version of the Waite deck is beautiful.  The drawings have been retraced in a finer line and the pastel pencil coloring is carefully shaded and very appealing.  I think the images looks less cartoonish than in the standard Rider Waite deck.  This deck also has a glossy protective coating that looks like it will withstand a lot of use.  Overall the Universal Waite is a wonderful deck to use.  My one complaint is the packaging is flimsy and it's hard to get the deck back into it.  Too bad it doesn't have the same style packaging as the pocket version of the Universal Waite.  So, five stars for the deck minus one star for the packaging.
075640407X|5.0|THE NAME OF THE WIND is, quite simply, one of the strongest debut novels I have in the fantasy genre.  I picked this book up with middling expectations, and over a period of three days simply devoured it, finishing in an eight hour flurry that left me craving Patrick Rothfuss's next novel. <br /> <br />What's remarkable about the book is that it manages to be so good without really breaking much new ground.  The premise, an sleepy town inkeeper with a spectacular secret past, will sound cliche to many fantasy readers.  But, and this is what caught me so off guard in a debut novel, the execution is simply perfect. <br /> <br />Simply put, Rothfuss's style works.  While the bulk of the book consists of the main character, Kvothe, telling his life story in the first person, we first meet Kvothe in his current day inkeeper persona.  This introduction, together with third person interludes through the rest of the book, break up the action while nicely while foreshadowing subsequent significant events.   <br /> <br />Rothfuss's world is multilayered.  An excellent example of this, and how it is handled superbly in the book, is the magic system.  The book describes fundamental 'sympathetic' magic in satisfying detail, tying it believably to real world physics.  The more dark, mysterious, and powerful 'naming' magic also plays a prominent role, but we are left with only tantalyzing hints as to its secrets.  <br /> <br />The characters are also delightfully nuanced and carefully developed.  The story has dark elements, beginning with Kvothe's childhood on the streets of Tarbean and later when Kvothe walks the line between hero and antihero.  Throughout the tale, the characters are belivable in both their successes and mistakes. <br /> <br />Overall, THE NAME OF THE WIND is an excellent read and should appeal to hardcore fantasy fans while still being accessible to mainstream readers.  There is plenty of fantasy substance here, but the real excellence is in the characters andthe story.  It's just amazing to me that Patrick Rothfuss, as a first time author, has already realized what many mainstays in the genre miss:  To be a great fantasy novel, it is not enough that a book contain great fantasy.  It must also be a great novel.

I'm not saying he wasn't great in the beginning, I'm saying he showed more of his emotions/love. You just have to see this movie to see what I'm talking about...
B000PFUAO6|1.0|after a label change , you would have thought DT would try new, creative ways to define their sound. not on this album. i got this when it leaked, and i'm glad i didn't wait to buy it. only one good song, if even. i'm so tired of james labrie's whiney, whispy voice ruining great moments in the songs. he just isn't diverse enough for the band. while they may have moved way ahead in terms of ability and sound, james is just the same, album after album. they keep using the same slow song sound, and i'm just tired of the meaningless noodling. i used to love them for their instrumental prowess, but now its just old, tired and bland. i feel bad writing this, but i am no longer a fan. there is a large enough back catalog to enjoy, so i'll just pretend they broke up after Scenes. <br />they must pass on the prog title to the new kings, SYMPHONY X.

0385340559|4.0|Although I've got to agree that this isn't the best Reacher novel, Lee Child still turns out better thrillers than virtually anyone else.  The plot is tense, and a lot more suspenseful and mysterious than Reacher's previous adventures.<br /><br />That having been said, though, I felt let down by the ending.  Was there ever any doubt that the chief villain wouldn't meet the exact same fate as Reacher's buddy?  It's nice symmetry, sure, but too much of an action-movie cliche for a writer as talented as Child.  Also, the biggest mystery (who is the man continually changing identities and moving closer and closer to the action?) comes to an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion.<br /><br />In between, however, there's plenty of good snooping, spying, and an incredible breaking-and-entering scene that only Reacher could have pulled off.  Reacher's interactions with his team members felt a little flat; we get few details of their past aside from pure, unlimited loyalty to each other.<br /><br />I didn't like Reacher's sudden ability to do arcane math in his head.  Not only did it feel tacked on for the sake of plot advancement, it smacked of something the author took an interest in personally and found a way to wedge into the book.  I was never thrilled with Reacher's other \\"magic\\" ability - to put himself to sleep and wake up precisely at a predetermined time, but that at least seemed plausible, given Reacher's military history and bearing.<br /><br />If this review sounds negative, don't worry.  As a huge fan of the series, I've read all of them and am now reduced to picking nits.  \\"Bad Luck And Trouble\\" is well worth your money and your time.  It's a fun, fast, exhilarating read. If you haven't read Lee Child before, it's not a bad place to start.  If, like me, you've read all the others, then why are you reading reviews?
B000M06K5C|3.0|The album starts off very softly but then the opening song progresses into something you can really get up and move to.  It's exhilerating an spectacular. <br /> <br />\\"Hunting for Witches\\", while still an extremely good songs, reminds me a little too much like \\"Helicopters\\" from the band's original album \\"Silent Alarm\\".  The fact that it's also the 2nd track (same position as Helicopters) is slightly jarring.  If you own both albums take a listen, you'll be shocked and slightly annoyed.  To me, while \\"Hunting for Witches\\" does stand as a marked improvement from \\"Helicopters\\" the fact that the two songs are soooo similar, is slightly annoying, but I digress. <br /> <br />\\"The Prayer\\" is quite possibly one of the best songs on the album.  You can practically feel the artist pleading for the power to be a star and then feel the emotion as he imagines his own future greatness.  Really inspiring stuff. <br /> <br />\\"Uniform\\" stands well but tends to go off on awkward tangents at time that one fines a little unnecesary. <br /> <br />All the other tracks save for the last one, seem mediocre at best.  Just not all that great, but still not necessarily bad either. <br /> <br />The very last album, which describes a real drug for antidepression is one of those song that can really get to you.  One of the band's former detractors, who name escapes me at the moment, said that this is the song that made him cry into a cushion for about 15 minutes.   <br /> <br />
0743289684|5.0|Infidel is the autobiography of a Muslim Somali named Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The book tells the story of growing up in Africa and the Middle East. Without giving away all the details, suffice it to say that Infidel is an intelligent damning of the effects of the religion called Islam on the human mind. Ayaan's tale is one of forced transitions, surprising transitions and needed transitions that have not yet happened.<br /><br />Ayaan goes from being a somewhat devout Muslim to being a determined apostate living under a death sentence. Infidel is a thought provoking read about the mental cages that human beings trap themselves inside. It is a thought provoking journey between rigid, rabid devotion and reasoned, naive liberalism. It is a tale of the 21st century clash between a static, unchanging world and one that is tolerant and evolving. Highly recommended. Infidel is not a book to read for the lovely prose or the spine tingling drama. It is a book to read because it encapsulates and summarizes how fundamental Islam views women, how it views kafirs (unbelievers) and how it fiercely resists change.
B000PFUAO6|2.0|Once again, Dream Theater sought out to make a heavy metal sound, and ruin it by letting James Lebrie near a microphone.  Dream Theater \\"was\\" my favorite band, but not really since Train of Thought, and then dropped them altogether when Octavarium came out and they still thought they were god's greatest gift to music.  They need a new vocalist on each an every album, in my opinion, to pull off what they want to do.  I've heard metal done better by.. hmm.. metal bands?  I've heard Dream Theater done better by.. well you get the point.  They need a new singer, and they need to tighten their sound.  Better than Octavarium and Train? certainly.  Is it any good? NO WAY!  don't bother purchasing this album, DT doesn't deserve your money for this garbage.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|Most of my favorite movies are music related:  Spinal Tap, Fame, Grace of My Heart...but this movie was so powerful that it instantly entered my top ten faves of all time.

B000F7CMRW|1.0|Way don't these film makers simply admit this is their way to speak out against the oil? If they want the corruption stopped due to dealing with the middle east, why don't they support drilling in America.  <br /> <br />I realize those of us who watched this are suppose to support anti-oil groups due to the corruption. Not every person dealing with oil is corrupt. Those who made this movie are the corrupt ones. They are the ones who traveled in planes. They are the ones who traveled in limos. They are the ones who used jeeps and automobiles to make the movie. Oil was required to make this movie. You in hollywood need to shut up! Why don't you in hollywood develop a business to build automobiles that do not require oil/gas? Oh yeah, you just want others to do that. I WISH SOMEONE WOULD MAKE A MOVIE ON HOW CORRUPT HOLLYWOOD IS!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not sure if the previous 1-star rating (if it still is the previous one) was a serious evaluation or not. If so, it just goes to prove that different people see different things in different shows. I like Firefly very much. It is definitely not typical sci-fi, and thankfully lacks the sterility of a series such as Star Trek TNG. It has real characters who have real flaws, who use ships that could be real (certainly aren't perfect), and use kinetic weapons (though a bit updated). The sad part is that the characters weren't completely developed since the show only ran for one season. <br /> <br />For me personally, it's one of my favorite shows, well worth owning and viewing multiple times.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|If you're already aquainted with the greatness of Joss Whedon's cult television series \\"Firefly\\" then this is a no-brainer. \\"Serenity\\" is the best science fiction film since \\"The Matrix\\" and for true fans of the series, it is a literal dream come true.  Essentially, this film is not so much a stand-alone popcorn affair so much as it is the greatest series finale in history.  It's emotional, funny, action-packed, full of quirky characters both familiar and new, and just plain cool to boot.  There is also a deep philosophical argument explored as the costs of personal freedom and government control are contrasted in a brilliant manner.  Would you choose to live the life of a criminal if it was the only way you could be free?  Does a government have the right to take any step necesssary to keep it's citizens under control and happy?<br /><br />\\"Half of writing history is covering up the truth\\" is just one of the memorable observations made by our heroes over the course of this journey.  The plot centers around insane genius River and her older brother, Simon, who rescued her from a mysterious government facility where she was being experimented on.  Part of the genius of the series (and this film) are the insane rantings of River, which begin to make sense if you pay attention.  \\"Old men, covered in blood.  It never touched them but they're drowning in it\\" may seem nonsensical to some, but it is a rather poetic yet eerily accurate representation of both the government officials in her universe, and in ours.  The events taking place in this future are vaguely familair as plot devices, but what makes them brilliant is the way they relate to what's happening in our society.  Anyhow, back to the plot: River and Simon joined the crew of Serenity, the ship captained by Malcolm Reynolds, a true hero who isn't afraid to break the rules if it means doing the right thing.  Serenity's crew includes an endearing assortment of contrasting characters that all get their moments to shine in the film: Jayne the hardcore mercenary, Kailee the loveable mechanic, Mal's old war buddy  Zoe, and her pilot/comedian husband Wash are all well represented.  Having left Serenity since the original series, Book the minister and Inara -Malcolm's love interest who happens to be a well-respected prostitute (not to mention unbelievably gorgeous)- turn up along the way as well.<br /><br />The style of the universe that our heroes inhabit is still a mix of all of the cultures of \\"Earth-that-was\\", primarily american and asian, with cursing in chinese being an amusing device for letting characters express their disapproval realistically and emphatically without getting an \\"R\\" rating in the process.  If you've never seen \\"Firefly\\", do not hesitate; go buy it this very moment and see what you've been missing out on, then I can guarantee that this film will blow you away.<br /><br />If you are just looking for a spectacle like \\"Star Wars\\", legendary action sequences like \\"The Matrix\\", or just some light sci-fi fare, you will be disappointed.  This movie is both epic and personal, hilarious and heart-breaking, deeply thoughtful yet fun. It represents the fulfillment of a promise from it's creator and is a miracle unto itself that came about simply because the fans refused to let his brilliant creation die just because of a bad decision by a biased television executive.  The story behind the film is almost as uplifting as the film itself and serves to justify those of us who support the things we love, even years after they've \\"died\\".<br /><br /> Not fitting into any particular established pop culture mold -not unlike the characters themselves-, \\"Firefly\\" and \\"Serenity\\" may have flown in under the public's radar, but for those of us who know what great entertainment is capable of, this is the stuff we live for seeing and we're happy to keep it our little secret.n the film: Jayne the hardcore mercenary, Kailee the loveable mechanic, Mal's old war buddy  Zoe, and her pilot/comedian husband Wash are all well represented.

B000PTYP5C|4.0|After the last couple of albums I thought it may be time to go a different direction for the absolute geniuses of the almighty Dream Theater. I WAS WRONG!! It must have had something to do with the label change. Kudos to Roadrunner!! <br /> <br />This may be the most listenable album in the past 10 years! Although I love what these nearly flawless musicians are capable of I was ready for an album I could just listen to. All the blinding riffs, melodies, drum tracks, bass lines, and keyboards seem to bind together in an array of colors easy on the ears!!  <br /> <br />This could easily be the best for DT!!
0385733577|5.0|By mixing in characters and references from other places and times, both real and myth-based, Scott offers his readers the chance to be engaged with many stories beyond this one.  It makes for more interactive reading, but without actually requiring \\"homework\\" to understand and enjoy the book by itself.  It's a fun read, and kids should be encouraged to do their own detective work and internet searches for further exploration of the mysteries, creatures and characters the twins encounter. <br /> <br />I will definitely seek out the next in the series.
B000O77SOK|5.0|I obtained a copy of this in Australia, which I am assuming is exactly the same as the one listed here as they have the same cover and release date. <br /> <br />The episodes included are not the ones previously listed that were apparently the 'original full season one', but are the complete season one and the first seven episodes of season two: <br /> <br />Pilot <br />Part 1 <br />Trial & Error <br />Part IV <br />Part V <br />Part IV <br />Reasonable Doubts <br />Betrayal <br />The Blessing <br />Dog Bite <br />First Degree <br />Sex, Lies & Monkeys <br />Search & Seizure <br />Plus one special feature called 'Setting Up The Practice'.
B000O76T8Q|1.0|So disappointing!  I thought this would FINALLY be the anamorphic dvd we've been waiting for, but... NO!  Strange that so many \\"different\\" versions of this film have been released on dvd without the anamorphic addition.  A HUGE amount of dvd buyers now own hd tv's and home theater projectors...  the anamorphic aspect of a dvd is of significant importance to us!!  I love this movie...  what a total shame.
B00005JPP6|5.0|Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a perfect cop.  So go that he has been transferred from London to the town of Sandford.  He is making them look bad, and they want him out of their hair.  Upon arrival, he brings big city justice to the small town, until his superior, Inspector Frank Butterman (Broadbent) encourages him to relax a bit.  Angel is partnered with the inspector's son, Danny (Frost), an enthusiastic cop who isn't really that good.  He is fascinated with Angel and the stories he shares.  A sudden rash of deaths in Sandford are put off by the inspector as accidents, but Angel fears something more is happening, and feels that Simon Skinner (Dalton), the local grocery store owner, is behind it.  Angel must get to the bottom of what is going on in Sandford, and find out if Skinner really is the bad guy.<br /><br />\\"Hot Fuzz\\" is an excellent and very funny movie.  Pegg and Frost are hilarious together, playing off each other with ease.  There is a long setup that pays off with a final 30 minutes packed with action.  \\"Hot Fuzz\\" lampoons the action genre with great skill, and unlike most action movies, there is real character development that makes us care for the duo at the heart of the movie.  Dalton, as the apparent bad guy, seems to be savoring every moment of his screen time.  He is delightfully evil, and about as far from his James Bond days as he has ever been.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  The only drawback is that the movie runs a little too long.  Still, those looking for a smart, funny action-comedy will not be disappointed with \\"Hot Fuzz\\".

B000MR9D5E|4.0|This is everything it is advertised and more! The majesty and grandeur of our precious planet and the uniqueness of life in it; it is all served as part of a well-planned menu of delectable offerings, every morsel primed to satisfy even the most jaded and anti-nature individual. <br /> <br />Great for the kids, but even better for all adults who can truly appreciate the symbiotic relationships presented and are bound to be mesmerized by its' beauty. Enjoy with a well-aged Chianti! <br /> <br />I had to give it 4 stars only because of the quality of the video. I have a Samsung up converting DVD player that renders movies to near HD levels of sharpness. I can run it either in 720p or 1080i. I have set it up for 1080I and enjoyed gorgeous images from my Samsung HDTV 32\\" LCD, in everything from IMAX Coral Reef Adventure, to Spiderman 2, to King Kong, to Star Wars 3. Planet Earth image focus is clearly fuzzy at 1080I; not what I expected from a HD-quality film. I don't expect true HD-quality, but a higher sharpness than regular DVD, at the least. <br /> <br />However, this is just a minor glitch; the whole production is just too good to demote point-wise. If someone knows how to improve on this quality issue; please let me know. <br />
0517201658|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars I would. From the first page I was drawn into the Cleary family's world...into their colorful lives and the journey through their truimph and pain that spans a lifetime. This is a superb novel that centers around Meggie Cleary, a girl only but 7 years old at the start of the saga. Born into a poor Irish family of sheep shearers in the beautiful land of New Zealand, Meggie learns quickly that she must look after herself. From the time Meggie was a small child she was wise beyond her years. Having to hold her own against a family of all boys, save her mother Fee, who is but a shell of her former self. Fee being too busy with chores and duties, had no time to give love or affection to any of her children, except Frank...because he was different, he didn't resemble the Cleary's, he didn't behave as a Cleary. Meggie's oldest brother Frank was the only one who showed little Meggie any affection and she clung to him as if he were the only person who ever really loved her.  <br /> <br />Fast forward 3 years....The Cleary's recieved a letter from their wicked, wealthy Aunt Mary Carson asking them to come to her home in Austrailia and learn how to tend her sheep and work her vast farm. Mary knew she was growing old and wanted the land and Drogedha, her home, to remain in the family once she died. So they left, with the promise of prosperity and a new future. Arriving after a trying journey by land and sea, they were met at the train station by priest Father Ralph De Bricassart, Mary's trusted confidant and friend.  <br /> <br />From the moment Father Ralph and Meggie met they were both in awe of eachother. She being only 10, he being a man of 28. They shared a spiritual bond that neither could ignore from the beginning. He thought she was the most beautiful little girl he'd ever seen. She thought he closely resembled God because of his magnificant beauty and charm. He took Meggie under his protective wing and showed her an affection she hadnever known. She looked to him as a father, he to her as a daughter, but it was much more...  <br /> <br />This is a tale of forbidden love, a love that cannot be consumated or entertained, but also can't be smothered and ignored. It is a love of two souls who are so entertwined it squeezes the heart with longing and desperation. Beyond their control, they fight their feelings and sometimes succomb to them over the period of their lives. Throughout this sweeping saga through generations of Cleary's, life lessons are learned the hard way and passed down to the next generations to learn all over again.  <br /> <br />This book takes you on a long, winding road throughout time and the difficulties of the heart. It isn't just a romance, it is much more and any fan of great literature would appriciate this book. I recommend it highly.  <br /> <br />
0812975219|3.0|I went to a Top Tier Business School to earn my MBA - the degree that Taleb pillories. By top tier I mean top 50 not Harvard, MIT, Wharton, etc too.

0143034901|4.0|When my friend told me the plot of this story, I yawned at her.  It sounded like it touched on fantasy/goth lit, which I'm not interested in at all.  But I'm so glad I gave this book a chance.  The story is fairly interesting - better most things I've read in recent years.  But the writing style - it is amazing!  I wouldn't be surprised to find out the author spent hours on every paragraph, lovingly shaping each sentence with just the right words.  I couldn't believe this was a translation - it was much better than most books originally written in English.
B000002TWN|5.0|Where did D come from??? He comes on the scene and just shakes everything up with is smooth sultry neo soul style that no one else could compete with in the day. Regardless of what i say in this review this album will be an all time great because it started the neo soul movement. But if you like the dance/party r&b of today, you probably will not like this type of album because it is sticktly soul music with a band and all music is played not engineered. Which is very good for a change. And ontop of that D's vocals are unmatched. He has such a silky smooth falsetto that is uncompareable. This album will move you. Because he just gets deep down in the soul with his music, that you swear its his soul singing. I mean the shere grooviness to the single \\"Lady\\" alone makes the album worth purchaseing. Then the laid back, rolling track \\"When We Get By\\" you will find yourself grooving to weather you like it or not. From the opening song \\"Brown Sugar\\" takes you on a laid back ride that you wont forget in a long time. I can assure you there will never be another album unless its from D like this. He just knows how to get in your soul with his music. And i heard it took him 6 years to finish recording this album which explains why it is for the most part perfect. But like i said dont by this album expecting Usher R&B, because you will be mistaken. But none the less it is worth buying for your laid back chill nights with your girl!      Grade:  A-
B00005JPLU|3.0|This film it is only myth making, with a lot of historical mistakes and historical lies. First time I watched it I laughed at it a lot. The true heroism of those Spartans was completely destroyed by this film. But as entertainment it is a good film, but only as entertainment, nothing more than this. And I don't have anything against war, I am a defender of wars, I like wars. I have been a studious of wars during all of my life mainly WWII, I used to be a good fighter during my school years, I don't have any problem with violence, although as a martial arts fighter I really don't like to use it anyway and in any circunstance, because I learned to control completely my violent instincts. The problem here is that this film only serves as pure entertainment like watching the silly Harry Potter movie, nothing here portray the real facts and it is supposed to be based in a historical fact, that is the point the real point here. The worst thing was to portray Persians like black men, they were really caucasians men like the Greeks and were portrayed here as black men, this was ridiculous to say the least, It is a three stars film only because of visual effects. I have just removed the last lines of my original review because I watched this film again and I have to say that it's importance resides in remembering nowadays people about the spectacular courage those men from Sparta demonstrated, really their values are those kind of values I have believed during all of my life, in general I liked the film, I'm going to buy it. But please don't forget to watch \\"History Channel presents last Stand of 300, the legendary battle of Thermopylae\\". There you will have a more realistic approach, fantastic documentary..
1596912855|5.0|I was a little worried about the subject and how it was going to play out but Shannon Hale did a wonderful job. I just couldn't put it down.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|While there are some spectacular shots in this, for your money, you should instead buy the much greater series of The Life of Birds and The Life of Mammals - at least a quarter of the footage in this series was recycled from those programs.  I can't see how this is groundbreaking in the slightest. <br />
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Over the last several years, through much reading, it has become clear to me that many DT fans are divided between the proggier & poppier styles of the band, such as in 2005's \\"Octavarium,\\" versus the heavier side, such as \\"Train of Thought.\\" I would tend to lean somewhat closer to the latter. However, I do feel that the brute force heaviness of TOT has caused many fans to overlook the proginess of the technical virtuosity involved in that album. <br /> <br />With that said, I will say that \\"Systematic Chaos\\" lands somewhere between the two, closer to TOT in terms of thematic and tonal darkness, but as far as the amount of textures and different sounds, it is definitely more out there & closer to the proggier styles they have explored. Mike Portnoy explained in the \\"Making of...\\" DVD that everything on the album \\"...had to have balls...\\" This is clearly evident throughout, as even the mellowest track, \\"Repentance\\" (which continues Mike's AA twelve steps saga), is very moody and dark. This lends a beautiful take on many of the familiar themes already introduced into that song series.  <br /> <br />The album opener and closer, \\"In the Presence of Enemies,\\" is prog metal insanity at it's best, grabbing you from the very beginning, and leaving you spent by the time you finish. <br /> <br />The two most accessible tracks, in my opinion, are \\"Forsaken,\\" and \\"Prophets of War,\\" both taking classic DT melodicism to the ultimate extreme. These melodies & hooks are the ones that stick in your head first, and stay the longest.  <br /> <br />The two darkest, heaviest & ballsiest tracks, are without a doubt \\"Constant Motion\\" & \\"The Dark Eternal Night.\\" Of course this does not deter DT from loading them up with the usual awesome technicality, and the latter of the two songs has such a bizarre and interesting middle section, it's hard to describe. You just have to hear it. These are some of the best and heaviest riffs DT has ever written, on these two tracks. <br /> <br />\\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\" is flowing, restrained and beautiful, for around the first half of the song, and then veers off into some very interesting & technical prog parts, later returning to conclude in the flowing, melodic fashion in which it began. A beautiful piece.  <br /> <br />All in all, this album is yet another masterpiece by DT. As with any great album, it deserves to be taken on it's own merits, without endless comparisons to a previous work, so please remember that my album references above are merely to give the reader of this review a reference point as to what to expect. I am making no comparison of better or worse, only to say this album stands tall with DT's best work. The rest is a matter of personal taste.  <br /> <br />An enthusiastic 5 out of 5.
1881273156|5.0|This was recommended to me in a church workshop and now I like to give it as a wedding gift to others. It gives you a new perspective and creates topics of conversation to improve your relationship. VERY USEFUL!
B0002IU988|5.0|This is really a simple album to review.  I loved all 3 of Creed's albums, but this album is far, far better than those.  Rougher, louder, heavier, Tremonti is absolutely out of his mind on this album.  Metalingus might be one of the best songs from this gang, Stapp or no Stapp, and it doesn't even have a guitar solo!  Buy it, buy it, you will not be disappointed.
B00005JPAO|4.0|The Queen focus on two important events during the summer of 1997.  The first event is the election of Tony Blair as Great Britian's Prime Minister and the second event is the death of Lady Di in Paris. This movie is a glittering, compelling, solemnly anxious news comedy of how the Royal family reacted to her Diana's death. The Queen, Prince Philip, Mother Queen and Prince Charles, all in their own ways, disliked Diana for what she had done to them, which was to turn the public love from the royals to her (Diana). The Queen's intentions are honorable because she wanted to protect her grandsons from the hounds of the media because she believed focusing too much on Diana's death would aggravate their grief. The Queen can't help how she feels, she was being the way she was raised, keeping things to herself, maintaining the immemorial English stiff upper lip.  <br /> <br />The Brits are known for their toughness and for being rational people. These are the same people that bravely stared Hitler in the face and survived his days of terror during WW2. Its that quality (that bulldog-ness effect) that has earned the British people respect from around the world. Its my opinion that the British was ready to cry that faithful week in 1997. For so long in their long history, they held back public tears, but the loss of Diana tugged at their heartstrings and they cried (in public). This caught the Queen by surprise as she must have realized her people have changed. It was up to Tony Blair to convince the Queen she must change too (in some areas). <br /> <br />Helen Mirron is simply extraordinary. She made you feel the queens's pain, agony, and confusion. James Cromwell is a wonderful actor and his protrayal of Prince Phillip as a selfish nincompoop (well, that is true to form) is funny and brilliant. Michael Sheen bears a close resemblance to a younger Tony Blair, and has clearly studied him closely in order to catch his every gesture and nuance. I was not, however, particularlyimpressed by his performance because he seemed to mimic Blair rather than take the essence of Blair and act him out. The Queen Mother comes across as a bit of a drunk and a selfish woman. Cherie Blair, who would like to see the destruction of everything British, is admirably shown. However, the worst performance of the movie goes to Alex Jennings's Prince Charles because at times he seemed the most sympathetic of the Royals, at others weak and cowardly. <br /> <br />Near the end of the film, it is clear the Queen and Blair relationship has warmed and they both have a great deal of respect for each other. The wise Queen takes the opportunity to warned then popular Blair that the tide can easily turned against him....and 10 years later, it has thanks to Blair's foreign policy. Not a great film, but a good film with an important lesson to learn. <br />
B000P2A256|3.0|It Won't Be Soon seems to me to be an over-produced album with little of the original flair that attracted so many of us to Maroon 5.  It is percussion driven, and many songs would do well to be included on the latest Justin Timberlake album. As a long time Maroon 5 and Kara's Flowers fan, I was disappointed by this latest work.  Not Falling Apart does not compare to the band's first song by that name, and the single Makes Me Wonder is so far from the band's past work that it was only recognizable to me because of Adam's unmistakable vocals. However, though the album has definite flaws it is still entertaining, and I don't regret purchasing it. Let's just hope Maroon 5 gets back on track the next time around.
B000O178BY|3.0|Trent Reznor has been the God of Industrial Rock since he burst out onto the stage with Nine Inch Nails' debut album, \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". With songs such as: \\"Terrible Lie\\", \\"Down In It\\", \\"Head Like a Hole\\", and \\"Sin\\", amongst others, Reznor put NIN on the map for good and his/their stature only grew from that point forward. \\"The Downward Spiral\\", \\"Broken\\", and \\"The Fragile\\" built upon the momentum garnered from the first record and catapulted Reznor to God-status in the Industrial Rock world. From that point forward, every Industrial Rock act to come along would be compared to the king of the genre, Nine Inch Nails. Then came \\"With Teeth\\", where Reznor and NIN seemed to focus less on their industrial forte' and swing more in the mainstream rock'n'roll direction. Many fans were disappointed with this new direction. I admit, I was surprised and maybe a tad disappointed, but the album grew on me some, especially a few of the songs, such as: \\"Getting Smaller\\", \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", \\"Only\\", and \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\". <br /> <br />It usually takes Reznor a number of years to compile another masterpiece. This was true in the cases of \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"The Fragile\\". But, the same was not true this time around with \\"Year Zero\\" and I was, for lack of a better word, stoked to hear this album, especially due to the reviews I'd read from fans on Amazon. Many either compared it to \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" or \\"The Downward Spiral\\" or made such remarkable claims as, \\"It's his (Reznor) best work since 'The Downward Spiral'.\\" or \\"It's their best album ever!\\" \\"Nine Inch Nails is back!\\" \\"Reznor is back in genius form!\\" I read all of these exclamatory remarks and others. Through that, I admit, I was more excited than usual to hear a new album. <br /> <br />I don't know if it was due to all the excitement or what exactly, but I am (through two full listens in) very disappointed. From song one through sixteen, it's very monotonous, with little to no melody, little tono emotion, and hardly any catchy portions to any song. <br /> <br />I admit, I think/thought a concept album was a neat idea, especially since it dealt a bit with the corruption of the current administration and what direction they're leading us toward. But, a concept album is nothing without the music. I haven't looked at the lyrics too carefully yet, but I don't know that I even care to after hearing the cd in its entirety. That's saying something coming from me, a long-time critic of Bush and his administration and a long-time fan of Reznor and Nine Inch Nails. Green Day compiled a concept CD not long ago, \\"American Idiot\\", and that is far superior to \\"Year Zero\\" for the simple fact that it's their best musical effort thus far in their careers. The concept is there and the music compliments the concept all the way through track 13 on \\"Whatsername\\". There is diversity in the tracks, emotion, and catchiness. The concept will therefore likely be replayed time and time again. Two listens through on \\"Year Zero\\" and there are only 3-5 songs out of the 16 on the album that I care to hear again. <br /> <br />Many might claim that one must look at the album as a whole to see it for the masterpiece it is, as opposed to each track individually. That may be true from the concept standpoint and perhaps the story is genius in how it's told. But from a musical standpoint, I just can't fathom that. There may be a lot of noise on the record and it may sound more industrial than \\"With Teeth\\", but that does not mean it is at all similar to \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" or \\"The Downward Spiral\\" or that it's any good. In fact, there's too much noise, without any rhythm. Some songs just sound like a DJ doing his thing, Reznor having a field day on the computer, and a few kindergarten children banging pots and pans against the cement. One of the \\"hardest\\" tracks on the album, \\"My Violent Heart\\", has noise coming from every different direction, which leaves one's head throbbing from pain. It sounds like \\"Mr. Self-Destruct\\" done by a middle school band. There may have been plenty of noise in previous albums, but the noise was catchy, melodic (at times), with a rhythm to it. It was easy to bang one's head to \\"Mr. Self-Destuct\\", \\"March of the Pigs\\", \\"Head Like a Whole\\", \\"Starf***ers, Inc.\\", amongst many other songs. In a song such as \\"My Violent Heart\\", the head doesn't know what to do, so mine stood still. <br /> <br />There is way too much monotony on the album. Some might say that it's how a concept album should be constructed, since a story is being told. I disagree. As with every story, there is an intoduction and conclusion, there's dialogue, drama, happiness, laughs, emotion, and a climax. The introduction to this album/story is weak, the conclusion is fairly weak, there's hardly any emotion, and where's the climax? I couldn't find one. Wait, maybe I did, of the few songs I liked. <br /> <br />Some may even say, \\"Well, you just don't get it, do you?\\" I haven't looked at the lyrics yet. What is there to interpret or understand? This isn't a film I'm listening to, with a complex series of events and a mystery unsolved. I'm solely judging this album from a musical standpoint. If I were to write a review that I was confused by the story, then go ahead and state that I don't understand it, but based on the music alone? I'm not going to buy that argument, even if it's on sale for half off. <br /> <br />There's so much monotony, it's difficult for me to describe each song individually, but I have graded them all from 1 to 5 (or 10) with a final score for the album at the bottom. Here they are: <br /> <br />1. Hyperpower! - 2.5/5 (5/10) <br />2. The Beginning of the End - 3/5 (6/10) <br />3. Survivalism - 2/5 (4/10) <br />4. The Good Soldier - 1.5/5 (3/10) <br />5. Vessel - 2/5 (4/10) <br />6. Me I'm Not - 2.5/5 (5/10) <br />7. Capital G - 4/5 (8/10) <br />8. My Violent Heart - 2/5 (4/10) <br />9. The Warning - 3/5 (6/10) <br />10. God Given - 1.5/5 (3/10) <br />11. Meet Your Master - 3.5/5 (7/10) <br />12. The Greater Good - 1/5 (2/10) <br />13. The Great Destroyer - 4.5/5 (9/10) <br />14. Another Version of the Truth - 2.5/5 (5/10) <br />15. In This Twilight - 4/5 (8/10) <br />16. Zero Sum - 2.5/5 (5/10) <br /> <br />41.5/80 (83/160) : 51.9% <br /> <br />There you have it. While 10 out of 16 songs score out at an average 5 of 10 or better, only 6 out of 16 scored at an above average 6 of 10 or better. To match that 6 out of 16 were scored at a below average 4 of 10 or lower. <br /> <br />I hope to Buddha, Zeus, and Planet Xenu that I can get more into this album, but from what I've heard, I can't see myself giving this many more listens.
0345440900|3.0|I read this book when I was pregnant with my first child and I wonder if it did more harm than good.  The book is filled with useful advice for new parents, but it caused me a *lot* of stress because my daughter simply did not fit into any of Tracy's categories and would not conform to EASY no matter how hard I tried.  I ended up being very frustrated because Tracy made it sound like it should all be so easy, but it was not in our case!  My daughter was simply a \\"high maintenance\\" baby until about 9-12 months of age, when she became a sweet toddler.   <br />After reading numerous other books, especially about fussiness and sleeping, by authors like Sears, Ferber, Weissbluth, and Mindell, I realized that any baby book is mostly someone's best opinion.  If you read enough, you will find advice given by any one of these \\"experts\\" which contradicts with at least one other author.  So whom do you believe?  Ultimately you can try many different suggestions and find what works best for you.  With my second child I am a lot more relaxed, knowing that I can follow my own intuition and not try to conform him to a method or book.  I also now realize that babies go through stages all the time, and just when you think you have a certain area taken care of, they progress into something new. <br />I think baby books are good in giving  new parents principles, but in the end, trust your own instincts and listen to your baby, rather than trying to fit the baby into a box.  Probably Tracy's best advice in this book is at the end, when she reminds parents that the baby stage is just a \\"blip\\" on the radar screen of life.  This is so true--enjoy your baby as much as you can instead of stressing over perfect parenting, because that stage is over so quickly!
B000OCXFCO|5.0|United Abominations is the best thing Megadeth's recorded since their classic 1990 thrash album, Rust In Peace.  That isn't to say Megadeth hasn't put out great albums between then and now.  Both Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia were fantastic albums, and are on many peoples' All Time Favorites lists.  I didn't much enjoy Cryptic Writings or The System Has Failed, but quite a few did.  So, while saying United Abominations is better than all of those albums is something of a bold statement, it's nevertheless a truthful one.    <br /> <br />This isn't Megadeth's return to the technical thrash of their first 4 albums.  Rather, it sees the band return to the style that got them headlining arenas.  Many elements from Countdown to Extinction can be found on this one:  aggressive yet melodic guitar riffage, fat guitar tones, complicated but catchy composition, and streamlined song structures. <br /> <br />That said, United Abominations is more progressive than Countdown.  It takes the streamlined nature of the older album and fiddles with the verse/chorus format in different ways for every song, just to make things more interesting.  A few songs throw away the generic format altogether.  While Countdown did this occasionally, United Abominations does it constantly, making for a more varied (in a good way) album. <br /> <br />The new lineup, I can finally say, compares well to the famous Ellefson/Friedman/Menza lineup.  I won't say it's better, but it isn't worse, either.  It's on par with the best lineups of Megadeth's glory days, and much better than the lineup on The World Needs A Hero.  That's all anybody can really ask for, and I hope Megadeth stays this way for a long time to come. <br /> <br />The songs themselves are aggressive and politically charged.  The song \\"United Abominations\\" is an attack on the U.N. for sitting on their hands in the face of war.  And, before anybody can call Dave Mustaine a conservative republican for the message in that song, \\"Amerikhastan\\" comes in and attacks the Bush administration for going to war for the wrong reasons and misleading the American public.  Clearly, Dave's political beliefs are complex, somewhere between right-wing and left-wing, and he sees good and bad going on in both sides.  In a time where every band is touting the same political message of \\"War Is Always Bad,\\" this equal treatment of war being necessary AND bad is a breath of fresh air, even if you don't neccessarily agree with it.  I mean, how many more \\"War Is Always Bad\\" albums can you listen to before you start feeling like the music industry is just jumping on the bandwagon?  Dave isn't, and I like that.   <br /> <br />Speaking of Dave, his vocals have never sounded better.  And the new lineup I touched on earlier - Glen Drover is a mean soloist, shredding mercilessly through technical solos with a whammy effect (don't worry, he doesn't share Hammett's philosophy of \\"less is more\\" in the slightest).  He's also capable of those singing, soulful solos that Friedman was loved for, making him a well-rounded companion for Dave.  Shawn Drover has that Menza quality in that he's a technically great drummer without being over the top, and he applies his skill carefully where it's needed.  James LoMenzo is a good replacement for Ellefson, and his groovin' bass lines can be heard clearly in the mix.   <br /> <br />The production and mixing on this album, by the way, is the best Megadeth has ever had.  The guitars sound fat and the drumming and bass are at the perfect level.  It's a great step up from the disappointing production/mix on The System Has Failed.        <br /> <br />To conclude my review, I'd like to state that there isn't a boring song here.  That said, this is not an album that you can listen to one time and instantly like.  I'm sure some people will love it on first spin, but most will have to listen to it a few times for the superb songwriting to sink in.  The first time I listend to it, I liked it well enough, but I wasn't in love.  After listening to it 5 times, I was convinced of this being a modern classic, and one of best Megadeth records ever made.  I've listened to it over 20 times now, and every time I enjoy it more.  This album WILL stand the test of time.   <br /> <br />Highlight tracks: <br /> <br />\\"Sleepwalker\\" <br />\\"Washington Is Next!\\" <br />\\"United Abominations\\" <br />\\"Play For Blood\\" <br />\\"Amerikhastan\\" <br />\\"Burnt Ice\\"
B000P2A256|3.0|[[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]] was one of those albums that lasted a lifetime: I think we must have been listening to \\"This Love\\" for well over 2-3 years. And to this day, it holds on well, which makes things tougher for its follow-up.<br /><br />To that extent, \\"It Won't Be Soon...\\" leaves me with mixed feelings. The band starts off with the solid \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" and throws in a couple more tracks that are reminding of their original quality: \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" and the guitar-heavy \\"Can't Stop\\". However, the rest of the tracks, though impeccably produced, go up and down in roller coaster fashion leaving an empty feeling behind.<br /><br />The album comes across as too intentional and not genuine, aiming to fit the times in a very Justin Timberlake sort of way. Is that bad? Not necessarily, but these guys had proven they were capable of more... or not?
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I recently watched E.T. for the first time in many years with my 4 year old daughter. It was like I was watching it again for the very first time. She absolutely loves this film and so do I. <br /> <br />I was 11 when this movie came out, so I really could relate with the kids in the film. I grew up in that same generation, in middle-class suburbia, USA, had Star Wars toys, rode bikes with my friends, etc. Watching this film brought it all back to me again and reminded me of a time in my life when the world was much bigger and life was a lot simpler. It's amazing how age can take the innocence away from you, but this movie is the perfect way to get it back, even if just for 2 hours. <br /> <br />Even though I had seen the movie and knew what was going to happen, I still cried like a baby when E.T. \\"died\\" and when he finally went home. The scene at the very end when the spaceship leaves a rainbow in its wake and you see the reactions of the kids and the adults as the ship disappears will make your heart burst and leave you weeping like a child. <br /> <br />Most of the naysayers of this film are definitely in the minority. This film is sheer brilliance and Spielberg has forged himself a place in history by directing it. The story, the acting, the music, the cinematography are all perfectly executed. It is a film that can be enjoyed by all ages. <br /> <br />One pet peeve, though. The 2002 version is a sell-out. The digital \\"upgrading\\" of some of the effects were well-done and appreciated, but replacing guns with walkie-talkies is just plain stupid. While I was watcing the 2002 version, I thought to myself, \\"That's a strange way to hold a walkie-talkie.\\" Then I realized that in the original version, it was a gun, not a radio.  <br /> <br />I was very disappointed that Spielberg would feel pressured to alter this work of genius just because of political correctness. Police and government agents carry guns. They sometimes even use them to hurt or kill others. It's a fact of life. If that fact was too much for kids to handle, why didn't Spielberg edit out the whole part where E.T. dies? That's a cold, hard fact of life as well. If you're gonna go PC, why not go all the way? Why? Because doing so would have totally eradicated the emotional impact of the film and it would never have become such a huge hit. What can I say? Money talks; another cold, hard fact of life. <br /> <br />Enough ranting. Please, purchase this DVD. Not only is it a masterful work of movie-making, not only is it a piece of cinema history, you will actually ENJOY it! It's one of those movies you can actually enjoy with the whole family. <br /> <br />Priceless, timeless, ageless, E.T. has suspense, action, humor, and most importantly, a message of love and friendship that transcends all boundaries. What else do you need from a film?
0385340559|5.0|A decade has passed since a Reacher and seven others were members of an elite military team of special investigators. They had a slogan, \\"You do not mess with the special investigators\\". When one member of the team turns up dead, thrown out of a helicopter in the desert, Reacher receives a call for help in code from another member of the team. Reacher is on the next plane to avenge his comrades untimely death.<br /><br />When I pick up a Reacher novel, I can count on action-packed suspense. Reacher has to be one of the most interesting protagonists on the crime fiction scene. He's such a complex human being, it's hard to figure him out. He's a  charismatic man  who's a bit of an anti-hero, a drifter, a loner, a man of honor and steel. In BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE we get insight into Reacher's past. While in most Reacher novels, he is very much a loner, in this outing he is part of a team. The dynamic is different, but still compelling and still very much Reacher. The characters introduced as part of the team are well written and developed. I hope that Lee Child uses them in a future novel. The plot was well-paced. There was never a dull moment in the unravelling of the story. It's not essential to read the other books in the series to enjoy this one, but the whole series is excellent and I recommend reading them all.
0374105235|5.0|This is a remarkably frank book that leaves a haunting impression mixed with some anger (directed at no one in particular), empathy, sympathy and just disbelief. Using a very casual, matter-of-fact tone mixed with part reflection, part nostalgia, but never bitterness or judgemental, the author narrates the events surrounding his involvement in a brutal civil war - without sparing any details that could show him in \\"poor\\" light; such as his own involvement in torture, killings.  It is a huge disservice to a reader to give any details of the contents in a review, but suffice to say, this book will be one of the few that will leave an ever-lasting impression. A sort of suspended sense of disbelief, hope, and anger combined. An absolute must-read.
0151012768|5.0|The cover of \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" caught my eye when I walked past my local library's \\"New Fiction\\" bookshelf... Something made me pick up it and I'm sooo glad I did! For those of you who could care less about fishing (like me) please don't dismiss this book due to its title. While there are references to salmon fishing throughout the novel, the references are more allegorical than anything. Give it a shot!
B000PFUAO6|5.0|This review will be a real pleasure to write. Dream Theater has been my favorite band since the uber-classic album \\"Images And Words\\", the groundbreaking milestone in progressive music that cemented Dream Theater's place as the preeminent purveyors of truly progressive metal and rock music. Widely emulated and copied, yet rarely equaled, DT's unique blend of virtuosic musicianship, intelligence and consistent performance and ability never cease to amaze me. For me, as a fan of the (older) progressive metal of Metallica back in the late '80s, DT were a godsend....a band who picked up the reins where Metallica seemingly left off after the release of the infamous \\"black\\" album(which signalled the end of Metallica as prog-metal pioneers and the beginning of their more commercial style), Dream Theater took the insanely progressive nature of that style to new levels, and consistently upped the ante with each album. Besides the intricate and unbelievably complex nature of the music (which I'm sure any DT fans knows all too well, and need not be commented on at length here), one thing I have always liked about DT is the fact that they are progressive in true spirit of the term....no rules seem to apply, and each musician is given free reign within the context of the band to explore their unique talent. Dream Theater changes and grows with each album, changing their sound and experimenting with their style without destroying the sacred hallmarks of the DT \\"sound\\", which always remains. John Petrucci himself recently described Dream Theater as a \\"heavy metal Yes\\" in an interview, which I think is most appropriate. Dream Theater consistently explore any sound, mood, texture and tangent which their collective muse bestows upon them, and we are all the better for it.<br /><br />That having been said, as a rabid DT fan, I always have my personal favorite specific \\"sound\\" or album. I enjoy DT the most when they are at their heaviest and most intricate (think \\"Awake\\" and \\"Scenes From A Memory\\") and less so during their more pop-oriented, les complex offerings(\\"Ocatavarium\\"). I was understandably worried and a bit hesitant after their last album, which in my opinion is their weakest overall, with an oddly restrained and lackluster production and performances in general. My relief upon listening to the first several songs of \\"Systematic Chaos\\" was immense. An interesting and near-perfect amalgamation of all the elements of this incredible band are there; John Petrucci's unbelievable modern shred pyrotechnics and epic, imaginative songs and lyrics, truly amazing drumming and rhythmic interplay from Myung and Portnoy, the silky-smooth and powerful vocals of La Brie, and amazing keyboard dueling, patches and atmospherics from Rudess, but so much more is evident here for fans who have followed the band for many years. Another part of Portnoy's multi-part, multi-album epic based on his struggles with alcoholism on \\"Repentance\\". Fantastic, epic prog-rock-styled grandiosity on \\"The Ministry Of Lost Souls\\". Dark imagery and heavy, convoluted near death-metal riffing and bizarre, distorted vocals on \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\". Unbelievable instrumental interplay (lets face it; this band is composed of some of the best players in music today) on \\"Constant Motion\\". And so many other standout moments and tracks that show DT looking toward the further evolution of and experimentation with their style while cementing the core of what makes the band so distinctive and unique. Nearly perfect, and even more proof that Dream Theater is one of the most unique, impressive, and hard-working bands in the modern music scene. 6 stars out of 5.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|I have been a DT fan since around 1998, and was familiar with Images And Words, Awake, A Change of Seasons, and Falling Into Infinity before Scenes From A Memory came out... So I know the differences in their body of work pretty well. To me all of their albums have something to offer, perhaps some a little more intense than others, but they all have a very unique tinge to them. When Scenes and 6 Degrees came out, I knew DT's career was hitting it's stride. When Train of Thought came out, it was neat to hear them try something slightly different, with more basic-structured songs while still beating you up with those head-shaking \\"how'd they do that?\\" moments... Then came the gorgeous Octavarium which hinted at a much more complex and exciting road ahead... But nothing could have prepared me for Systematic Chaos.    I am stunned at the heart and soul put into this album. It's very fast, very tight, and so well-paced that it's all over before you can even comprehend what just hit you. I must say this has got to be their most powerful statement since Scenes and 6 Degrees... That said, you'll hear past influences of DT albums (most notably the ridiculously awesome time signatures from Scenes From A Memory), along with the typical likes of Pink Floyd, Zappa, Rush, Megadeath, even a little bit of Queen-like vocal layering which fits perfectly... Except on a scale of which only DT can manage to achieve.     The main theme (In The Presence of Enemies, Pt.1) pulls you in quickly and challenges your ears while laying the backdrop for the rest of the album. The slower pieces on this album are equally as entrancing, with unpredictable chord shifts and just the right amount of emotion and ambience. The album climaxes during the unbelievable instrumental on the last track (In The Presence of Enemies, Pt. 2) with such a masterful genius of a sound, you need to hear it to believe it.     This album really does seem to have it all. They're working together awesomely, using the same formula they did back in late 1999 and I am very pleased with the result. Even non-prog fans MUST respect the insanity that is Systematic Chaos.
0316018953|4.0|Connelly does his usual great job of presenting a fresh Harry Bosch tale that holds the reader's interest until the end.  This one takes some of the recent events of the Department of Homeland Security's involvement in terrorist related events to bring Harry's old flame and frequent case companion, FBI Agent Rachel Walling into the story.  What looks like a murder to obtain radioactive materials brings to the fray the clash between LAPD and the FBI as to how the investigation is to go. <br /> <br />Harry as the surly detective who seems to always clash with authority never seems to get boring and never seems to run out of interesting partners (Ignacio or Iggy is his new partner who replaces Kiz Rider who was injured in the last novel).  Harry has been transferred from his prior \\"closer\\" role back to homicide investigations.   <br /> <br />My only complaint about the book and reason for not giving it five stars is that is seemed too short and I finished it in just under two full sittings. <br />
B0001611DI|3.0|I love zombie movies.  Movies like Night of the Living Dead (and the remake), Dead Alive, and Return of the Living Dead are among my favorite movies.  They're an adrenaline rush, they can be funny, they can be scary, but they're almost always entertaining.  I would not, however, call the original Dawn of the Dead an entertaining movie.  For the most part, I thought it was a boring movie. <br /> <br />I really am baffled by the good reviews of this movie from both critics and fans alike.  The Rottentomatoes website has it as the second highest rated Zombie film (after the original Night of the Living Dead).  And I have some theories on why that is: the acting is, while not always impressive, certainly solid.  The story was original (It was, I believe, only the second zombie movie ever made).  For those reasons I gave it 3 stars because I felt that it deserved it. <br /> <br />But something about this movie just didn't click with me and I suspect it's not going to click with many other people my age (I'm 23).  I also have my theories about why that may be: <br /> <br />The music? <br />Something about it didn't feel right for a horror film.  It was unique and it certainly had a 70s feel to it but...ehh... I give up.  I'm not someone good at critiquing music.  It just didn't work. <br /> <br />The fact that the zombies are walking the streets when the movie starts? <br />Half of the fun with zombie films seems to be watching the world go from a civil society to virtual anarchy as the zombies become more numerous.  But in this movie the zombies have the upperhand from the start.  So where's the fun?   <br /> <br />I know this is a sequel but I guess that's the downside to being a zombie sequel. <br /> <br />No central character? <br />There's a black man that is perhaps the unofficial leader.  There's a young white man with the personality of a cowboy.  There's a sort of insecure helicopter pilot and his pregnant girlfriend. <br /> <br />Between these four characters, there are no conflicts and little or no romance.  There is no truly central character and in zombie movies (or any horror film) I like it when they focus primarily on one character so that we feel like we experienced the zombies from someone's perspective.  I never felt like I got to know any of the characters.  And this is a typical flaw in horror movies:  we have to first know the characters before we can care about them and worry about their safety. <br /> <br />Between the two Dawn of the Dead movies I prefer the remake.  I used to think that this may be because I saw the remake before I saw the original so that I would have a bias towards it.  But, more and more, I'm beginning to doubt that that is why I prefer the 2004 remake for the reasons listed above. <br /> <br />I know I may offend many people out there for saying this, but I think that this is the most overrated zombie movie.  My two cents.
B00006RCNW|5.0|In LA, Farmington creates a special kind of criminal. In addition to smaller gangs trying to cash in on the money and prestige to be had, there are the bigger gangs with bigger agendas and individuals with their own problems. This creates dilemmas of all kinds and calls for cops of all calibers to stem this proverbial tide of violence. Enter Vic Mackey, head of Farmington's elite Strike Force and a true force to be reckoned with. Far from the police units that operate within the clearly-divided blue lights of \\"justice,\\" Mackey operates his force like a cold and calculating mob of his own. This means he has enemies on all sides of the law and that he creates a story that is really worth watching.<br /><br />When it came to The Shield, I was initially hesitant because I really detest the overflow of \\"Cop drama\\" on television. I thought I had seen all the different types of dirty cops that the network minds had to offer and I wasn't in the mood for another slice of the shield-toting pie. Then I watched the pilot, saw just how far the strike team - Ronnie, Shane, Lem, and Vic - were willing to go, and reevaluated my priorities. As I continued watching the show I found that it worked on a lot of other levels as well, making me think about the motivations of every person involved and how tempting power like the type Mackey finds himself faced with could really be. A cop with a family, a child with a disability, and a job that doesn't really appreciate the things that are done in its name; that brings up the question of where does prevention end and crime really begin?<br /><br />This isn't to say that the Strike Team is the whole of the tale; far from it in fact. The 13 episodes on the disc are really the story of a lot of people trying to maintain a fine line on a personal and professional level, following two main detectives and a drove of other police officers and showcasing progression as the series goes forward. I'm writing this at the conclusion of the 6th series, too, knowing how much these people start to mean and how many of them lose small things like dignity or larger things like life. Not wanting to spoil things I have to end it there, simply saying that the show will keep giving and that Mackey always has a method in some of most beautiful forms of madness I've watched play out.<br /><br />Just watch the pilot and you'll understand what I mean.<br /><br />About the Set: Full-Frame, Subtitles: English, Spanish<br /><br />Episodes Included: 1- Pilot. 2- Our Gang. 3 - The Spread. 4 - Dawg Days. 5 - Blowback. 6 - Cherrypoppers. 7 - Pay in Pain. 8 - Cupid & Psycho. 9 - Throwaway. 10 - Dragonchasers. 11 - Carnivores. 12 - Two Days of Blood. 13 -Circles.<br /><br />Also included: commentary, \\"behind the shield\\" featurette, a few deleted sceneses, too, knowing how much these people start to mean and how many of them lose small things like dignity or larger things like life.

B000PFUAO6|3.0|The reason I give three stars is because you can't deny ever that DT are top notch musicians and always have been. I picked up Images and Words back in 1992 and was just in awww of the band with all the different versitile keyboard sounds, petruccis small but fast guitar breaks, and mike portneys(at the time popular drum trigger sound). Also have of portnoys work had double bass in almost every song, unlike today. James Labries voice was great on the first two albums but started to wear thin nearly every album after, with the exception of Metropolis Part 2 which was the best since Images. Never have DT returned to that story tellig Concept album formula and i guess never will. Instead today we get the same ole lets just show off and show off some more without realllly having any solid song structures, patterns that just don't go anywhere that leave you with basically a big sounding mess you just can't understand. Basic songs with a good hook and chorus can work but then bring all the solo and break down parts in the middle, instead DT are just all over the place like a puzzle you just can't get together. Also i must mention the mundane slow whispering James Labrie style voice on half of the songs that makes me want to go to sleep(in a bad way), his voice is just growing tiresome to me and has no versatility anymore, i know he still has it, check out his solo album which in my opinion blows this album to hell. The old school sound on Elements Of Pursuasion gives you the sense of old Images and words, mainly because James does no holding back what so ever , he sounds very fitting with his solo work. Also the new twist of agressive growls just does NOT fit DT at all, its very corny and laughable to hear portnoy in the background saying yeah yeah go yeah etc. Stick to drums brother, your the best!! So i can't just say wow this sucks big time, because it has its moments, i just can't really explain why it doesnt strike a chord in me anymore, maybe i've just grown out ofthe overplaying type of prog metal, but then again i love SYMPHONY X's new album so maybe they are just boring me, probably the later. So if you pick it up you may find nothing new under the sun, just more bland riffs, no memorable chorus's and just the sense that it was thrown together at the last minute, so buy at you own risk.  <br /> <br />ps IF YOU REALLY WANT SUCKAGE AND LAUGHABILITY WAIT FOR METALLICAS NEW ONE!!! WOO WoOoO YEAH YEAH WHOOO WHooOO.(voice cracking):)
B000I5YCCO|4.0|My daughter requested this CD as a gift, and after listening to it with her probably a dozen times, I'm really happy I bought it for her.  So many of the country songs my daughter hears on the radio are about drinking or fighting, issues that aren't really very wholesome.  However, the lyrics on this CD were written by Taylor, and they speak to the same kinds of issues that my daughter is going through---trying to fit in at school, boys that don't notice you, etc.---and the kind of insecurities that adults can relate to also.  The lyrics are great, the tunes catchy, the arrangements simple and good, and Taylor has a sweet voice.  On the downside, the bonus materials are not much, and the lyrics are harsher (with mild cuss words) than the version you may have heard on the radio.  Still, I'm happy to have my daughter listening to this CD.
B00003CXAW|3.0|I've watched this film 3 times in the past 7 months & I don't care what a lot of people or a few blind critics say: this is NOT on any level better than Peter Jackson's `05 version.  Don't get me wrong, this version is good & deserves credit for moving film into a new age but Jackson's remake makes this one look old.  Carl Denham is the only character who even APPROACHES a real 3-dimensional person status.  Wray's Ann is likeable enough, but seriouisly, is she anymore than a brainless piece of eyecandy found in any horror movie?  She certainly doesn't posses the depth (and more importantly the heartache) that Watts' Ann has.  This movie lacked everything it needed to rise above the level of an unscary horror movie (fleshed-out characters, a relationship between Ann & Kong & an epic feel in both scope & soundtrack.)  Sorry movie fans, but no matter what you think, Cooper may have had the epic idea but Jackson made it an epic reality.

0743298020|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in awhile. It was one of those books that I carried with me at all times so any time I had a spare minute I would read a little. I looked forward to red lights so I could read!! <br />The book is so well written and engrosses the reader from the first page. I highly recommend it, and it is for sure on I will re-read on down the road.
B000OT6V00|4.0|I'm not a big fan of the movie itself.  Many of the characters could have been a lot more interesting, but they appeared shallow in storyline detail.  It's not a bad movie, but it seemed like it could have been a whole lot more.  The action sequences sometimes were spaced apart too much.  On a whole, though, it's worth a look.<br /><br />The picture quality of this flick on Bluray looked excellent to me.  On par with Casino Royale, even.  The image looked to have a great amount of detail and dimension on my 50\\" PDP screen at 1080i downscaled to 768p.  It will also fill up your entire TV screen with no black bars, which I prefer.  It's really a nice showcase movie to show off your system.<br /><br />I have the Korean version (Director's Cut, which was released here May 15th).  I was very happy with the transfer.  I have a Sony PS3, and it played perfectly.  It comes with Dolby 5.1 in English and German, as well as an uncompressed PCM audio track for both.  Not sure what the USA disk has on it for languages and subs, though.<br /><br />I give this movie 4 stars just because it's not the greatest storyline.
B000002J1L|4.0|Everyone talks about Peter Gabriel and how he has such a wonderful voice and a talent for really good lyrics.  While I agree, I have to admit I mostly like Nursery Cryme for all the instrumental bits and pieces that appear throughout the album.  Whether it's the mellotron-dominated finale on \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" (which reminds me of a dark shadow creeping over planet Earth- YIKES what a scary song) or the short organ solo appearing somewhere around the halfway point of  \\"Fountain of Salmacis\\", these are mainly the things I play the album for. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the vocal melodies are great, and the fairy tale-like atmosphere of the entire album is great as well, but let's not forget Genesis was capable of some very good instrumental sections too.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|It's hard to believe that this dual disc wonder is a collection of outtakes and rarities. It really is beautiful.<br /><br />Elliott has a way with words and creating very emotional music.<br /><br />If you like brilliant guitar riffs, awesome vocals, great melodies and a jumble of emotions - do not hesitate to buy this.<br /><br />I honestly believe that this was my best album buy (besides The Shins- Wincing the Night Away) this year.<br /><br />Hope you buy it and feel the same way!
B00005V1B2|5.0|I totally agree with the reviewer below- anyone who has played the Legend of Zelda, or any RPG video game for their Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft consoles will probably love this album.  I grew up a BIG Zelda fan and absolutely think this album is great.  About four years ago I recommended this album to a huge Zelda fan and she said \\"the music was pretty\\".   <br /> <br />In fact, everything Camel did in the 70's is incredible.  They are a band that really means something to me on a personal level.  I don't know what it is- something about the way the band members make sure every musical instrument they play is perfectly in tone, and the way everything comes across so beautifully every time really shows me just how talented they are.  Whether it's the flutes, keyboards, organs, guitars, mellotrons, bass or drums, everything sounds as perfect as can possibly be.  What a band. <br /> <br />The Snow Goose is just one of many great Camel albums.  They really are a band that's impossible to hate.  I seriously mean that.  You CANNOT hate them.  It doesn't matter if you hate progressive rock, or hate rock and roll as a whole- you will like this album.  Try to pick up the version with the bonus tracks.   <br /> <br />My only complaint is that they opted not to put on a live version of \\"Dunkirk\\" that is TOTALLY awesome.  It makes me think about giant castle doors closing shut (you know, those bridge things that are connected to castles that pull up and slam shut- think Bugs Bunny!) <br /> <br />Anyway, pick up this album right away.  It's worth it.  You will agree with me and all the other reviewers.  We're praising the album because it really is THAT good.  I guarantee it.
B0002SROT0|5.0|This is by far more emotional than almost any other album I've heard. I've loved Elliott's music for some time, and when I think of other groups or artists I can't think of many that are able to convey emotions as well as he did.<br /><br />My favorites are probably \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Coast to Coast,\\" but the whole disc gets me going.<br /><br />If you like albums with diverse sounds, raw emotions, well-written lyrics and melodic chords/vocals - this is it.<br /><br />If you like Elliott, I'd also suggest Joshua Radin and Priscilla Ahn.
1592402038|3.0|\\"O tempora! O mores!\\" lamented Cicero in his speech to the Roman Senate revealing Catalina's attempt to overthrow the Republic. \\"O the times! O the morals!\\" Twenty-one centuries later, treachery is once again afoot, and self-proclaimed stickler Lynne Truss is taking a zero-tolerance approach. The villainy Truss uncovers is nothing less than the demise of English punctuation.  <br /> <br />It's hard to imagine a book on punctuation hitting the best-sellers' lists, but this is no dry manual of style. Truss may be a stickler, but she's a pedant with personality, and her writing style is breezy and biting. Her presentation of punctuation peccadilloes is truly hilarious, and they convincingly drive home the point that punctuation can make a big difference in writing. English teachers, copy editors and those gifted few who really know the difference between a colon and semicolon--and how to use them--will love this book. The book can be an entertaining romp for the punctuationally perplexed and apostrophically apathetic as well. <br /> <br />Every generation longs nostalgically for a lost golden age of virtue and valor; and usually, that golden age is an illusion. Truss calls on the greatest examples of English literature to show how punctuation once was used with purpose and precision, and then compares these with typographical transgressions from billboards and supermarket tabloids. This is hardly appropriate, though. The care with which fine literature is crafted should not be held up as a standard for more mundane purposes of writing. <br /> <br />Truss raises a number of important issues, but she quickly drops them and moves on as if she failed to see their relevance. For example, she points out the unprecedented widespread literacy of the twenty-first century and the increased use of written language among ordinary people due to email and instant messaging, but she uses this to lead into a diatribe on how people don't punctuate their cell phone text messages. She also recognizes the futility of trying to fossilize a language, fully recognizing the inevitability of language change. \\"But still... but still...,\\" you can almost hear her muttering under her breath, \\"we really shouldn't go mucking around with the rules of punctuation.\\" However, the really important issue here is this: increased literacy and new modes of written communication are changing the way we use language, including punctuation. <br /> <br />Another important point that Truss brings up and then drops is that punctuation is a printer's convention. In speech, we use pauses and intonation to impart subtle nuances to what we say. In writing, the prosodic aspects of spoken language are missing; punctuation is a poor substitute for prosody, but it can still be a useful aid to the reader. The skilled writer adjusts punctuation usage as needed: instant text messages, because of their brevity and lack of subtlety, generally need no punctuation, while scholarly prose, with its finely shaded nuances, should be highly seasoned with commas and semicolons. <br /> <br />The apostrophe plays a key role in the book; it also illustrates the conventionality (and arbitrariness) of the rules of punctuation. It is not quite clear that the apostrophe serves any useful purpose at all in English writing. Some English text is awkward to read without appropriate apostrophes, but only because readers expect them in particular places. Truss rightly points out that the original purpose of the apostrophe was to indicate where letters were left out in contractions and abbreviations. All languages use contractions, most doing just fine without a marker of omission, and presumably English did too before the introduction of the apostrophe in the sixteenth century. But speakers are at least moderately aware of contractions (that is, they can uncontract these expressions when necessary), so those who wish to master the contraction apostrophe are likely to succeed. <br /> <br />However, the storygets even more complex, because we have to contend with the apostrophe of possession as well. By historical accident, English nouns mark both plural and possessive with the \\"s\\" sound. In speech, we must rely on context to tell whether \\"sons\\" means \\"more than one son,\\" \\"belonging to one son,\\" or \\"belonging to more than one son.\\" In writing, however, a printers' convention uses a quite gratuitous apostrophe to distinguish these three meanings. But because this rule does not correspond to anything in the spoken language, it is not surprising that most people are confused by it. <br /> <br />Truss as well is confused sometimes, in particular with some of the terms she uses. For example, she confuses punctuation for grammar and writing for language. Punctuation is not, as she claims, the stitching that holds language together. Rather, writing is an attempt at recording spoken language, and punctuation is a guide to the reader in reconstructing the prosodic features of speech.  <br /> <br />Although the book is fun to read, it is not a particularly good resource for rules of punctuation. Her examples are always entertaining, as are her digressions into the history of punctuation. However, her explanations are at times redundant or irrelevant, and at others arbitrary or contradictory. Truss's style of punctuation is certainly different from mine, and I was often tempted to start marking up pages. I am well known by my students for being a stickler (my red pen is infamous for \\"bleeding\\" all over homework assignments), but I also recognize that the level of meticulousness required of academic prose is far greater than it is for grocery store advertisements, a particular peeve of Truss's. <br /> <br />Alas, will the abused apostrophe ever find its rightful place in the English language? \\"Times are bad,\\" Cicero lamented on another occasion. \\"Children no longer obey their parents, and everyone is writing a book.\\" Indeed, times are bad. People no longer punctuate their sentences, and Lynne Truss has written a book about it.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|Systematic Chaos cannot be defined.  I think it is wonderful, amazing, musical, compelling, gripping, intriging, beautiful at times, ugly at times, dark and heavy in some places, light and inspiring in others.  It is diverse, unique, and different from any new music you can buy today.  <br /> <br />This is a real treat to listen to from the first note to the end of the CD. There are things you'll like and things you'll dislike.  But even the parts you don't like you'll find that you can't stop listening.  The musicianship in this band is second to none. Even if progressive rock isn't your particular style, you'll be amazed at what you hear on this CD.
B000002GF8|5.0|The snappy, synth-laden song \\"Synchronicity I\\" has a way of delivering me back to the early 1980s like practically no other song. That's not to say it sounds dated, but there is a modernly new-wave flavor to the tune that makes it a classic of the Ronald Reagan era. It flies along at a swift pace, low on bass, high on treble and wordily intellectual, giving \\"Synchronicity\\" by The Police some spark right away.<br /><br />Interestingly, though, there are some varied sounds throughout \\"Snychronicity\\" that make it hard to pigeonhole as just an \\"'80s-sounding\\" CD. In fact, the mega-hit singles on this album are dignified and timeless -- they never seem to grow stale. The nonhits are also good. \\"Walking in Your Footsteps\\" is mellow with a tribal beat; Sting's lyrics in the song are astute and respectful of what's come before humanity here on earth. The highly annoying \\"Mother\\" by Andy Summers was a sadly inane inclusion to the record, but the catchy \\"Miss Gradenko\\" is a great song, and works as the perfect lead-in to the ominous sounds of \\"Synchronicity II\\" on \\"Side 2.\\" Speaking of which, Sting's larger-than-life bellow to open that song sounds like catharses and is as good as rock and roll vocals get. \\"Synchronicity II\\" tells the story of a mundane day in the life of a \\"suburban family,\\" where pollution reigns and each member mechanically goes about his or her by-the-numbers existence. It's brilliant stuff, but also much gloomier fare than Sting's future work as a solo artist.<br /><br />The grace and beauty on the well-known songs \\"Every Breath You Take\\" (about a man stalking a woman), \\"King of Pain\\" and \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" are practically without equal. These were the songs that lifted The Police, already a popular band, into the stratosphere of superstardom in the early `80s. \\"Synchronicity\\" ends with the loungelike \\"Tea in the Sahara\\" and \\"Murder by Numbers,\\" the latter song a great but rather quirky way to close the record out. (Joking side note: For further lessons by a rock band on the casual art of murder, listen to the song \\"Murder 101\\" off [[ASIN:B00004YACO Breach]] by The Wallflowers.) Through all these great songs, Sting's grizzled but comforting voice paves the way, while his poignant thinking-man lyrics always made The Police stand out even further.rock band on the casual art of murder, listen to the song \\"Murder 101\\" off [[ASIN:B00004YACO Breach]] by The Wallflowers.)

B000HIVOFU|5.0|This album may be not the world greatest audiophile record, but it's the one of finest album that I have. This album does not like other modern audiophile album that use electronics device in order to boost the dynamics range and complicate Mix.      Here they use only single point microphone, no overdubs, no multi tracking, no large mixing control. So the sound is very analog to my ear. It's a must for both audiophile or people who want a great music
B00003CXDG|2.0|As others have mentioned, there was no Mission Impossible Team, except for Ving Rhames, and Anthony Hopkins, the boss, (Interesting, we got to see the face that goes with the voice on the tape that introduces the case.)    I thought the worst was the agonizing slow motion flips and kicks (often while shooting a gun in midair, upside down).
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Finally Rihanna puts a complete amazing album. Her previous albums I didn't care for except for her radio hits i.e. SOS, Pon de Replay and others. The rest of her songs seemed like filler. This album finally has hit after hit starting off with the brilliant first single Umbrella, the excellent party anthem Don't Stop The Music, the funky Breakin Dishes, the sexually charged Push Up On Me, the rocking Shut Up and Drive and the haunting ballad Question Unanswered. Her voice may not be up to par with Beyonce or Christina, but she has put out a fun album that you can listen to all the way through without skipping tracks. By far my favorite album so far this year which says alot considering her last album was one of my least favorites.
B000O174CM|5.0|The transition from Broadway show to Hollywood musical finally is here with the wonderful movie Dreamgirls! I have waited for over 25 years to see this wonderful story and great music come to life on the big screen. This movie will not disappoint you. Fantastically directed by Bill Condon with amazing musical numbers from Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy & Jennifer Hudson (in her Academy Award winning performance) Dreamgirls  comes alive right from the beginning of the film and you can't help but tap your feet and move to the music all the way to the end of the finale. I thouroughly enjoyed this movie and I think it should have been nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. It did win the Best Picture Golden Globe and deservedly so. I think everyone who likes great music and musicals will really love Dreamgirls! All you've got to do is dream!
B000OCXFCO|1.0|From 1990 to 1997 it was clear that Megadeth was on to something, churning out four consecutive hit albums after a string of poorly-produced thrash albums in the 80s.  The combination of Mustaine, Menza, Ellefson, and especially Friedman, thrash metal's unsung hero, made for one of the most compelling metal acts, well, ever.    Not surprisingly, once that lineup fell apart, it all went downhill.  1999's excessively poppish Risk had one or two decent tunes, but was a bust for the most part.  The 2001 follow up, The World Needs a Hero, was an almost impossibly banal and forgettable return to traditional metal.  2004's The System Has Failed was an overrated descent into power metal cheesiness.    Now it's 2007, a decade after the band's last decent album, Cryptic Writings, and we have United Abominations.  Complete with recycled riffs, uninspired production, and lyrics that only Rush Limbaugh and his bonehead fans could love, United Abominations is simultaneously uninteresting and silly.  Right wing metal fans will probably love this album, as it alludes to the Oil-for-Food scandal in the UN (and ignores the dozen or so scandals of the Bush administration from the past two years alone).    However, there is is Washington is Next, which is actually a good rocker done in the style of early to mid 90s Megadeth.  The rest of the album is loaded with songs that are either plodding and go nowhere (Play for Blood), or just downright stupid (Amerikhastan, Gears of War).  Most of the songs, even the thrashy ones like Sleepwalker, are so dull that they're not worth talking out.      Though Megadeth never had a single definitive lineup, the 1990-1997 one came extremely close; mostly because Mustaine never put out a decent album without those guys.

B000002KLP|5.0|The title track say's it all. Even though it was his third album...this was like his first album... the definitive album in PRN's career...\\"For you\\" and \\"Prince\\"(ALBUMS 1 & 2) were filled with a more \\"POP\\" flavor but \\"Dirty Mind\\" was Prince on stage in a long trench coat,bikini briefs, and a lot of what made Prince ~ Prince...SEXUALITY. Track 2 \\"When You Were Mine\\" is still one of my fav's from him and track 4 \\"Gotta Broken Heart\\" was a sign of things to come...THE ART OF THE FALSETTO BALLAD...Prince is as complete of an artist as we\\"ll ever see! I particualrly love the way the album makes you fell as if you're in the studio with him by mixing the songs together like a stage show. Track 5 \\"Uptown\\" was his anthum by saying \\"free your sexual mind, believe in god, and ignore color lines! This is the album that got everybody to ask...\\"is he straight or gay, is he a man or woman, is he really on stage doing and wearing that???\\" The answer thank GOD to all the above was YESS! Well before it's time with other anthums like \\"Head\\" talking about...well...Head(I've always felt like \\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\" was like a part 2 of this song)  and \\"Sister\\" walks the edge more than a little( He is actually talking about a foster/step sister type)...\\"Party Up\\" is a perfect way to end this album. With screaming Synths' and crazy rock guitar and his signature gift from god of a voice, this is the definitive recording from Prince. It was the one that screamed to us saying...\\"BEWARE ...i've got talent and indviduality and i'm not afraid to use them!\\"

0812971825|5.0|I never imagined I would enjoy a novel about a religious theme to the extent that I enjoyed \\"Abide with Me\\". In fact, I could not put this book down. I read it with total enjoyment - with relish, in fact - and now aim to read the few other works by this perceptive author. The New England landscape is so well described, as are the differing attitudes of the families of the two leading players - his more humble, hers from the highest social echelons. The Minister's doomed marriage is depicted almost cruelly,  but the heartfelt relationship of Minister and housekeeper is tender and totally moving. The depiction of the various families and strays making up the Minister's congregation - their gossips, social lives and unpleasant bedroom secrets - is totally satifying. If I felt there was no real need for Tyler's (probable) role in his wife's death to be mentioned quite as often as it was, this is not really to find any fault: for here is a truly splendid achievement and my reader friends who know me to a total cynic in matters religious may be surprised to find me  recommending this as a \\"must read\\" book.
0743496728|5.0|I had not read any of Jody Picoults books, and this was my first, and I <br />was drawn in and I must say, this book is probably one of my favorite <br />books I have ever read, and I'm a hard core reader. <br />The nineteen minutes is the time that was spent when a kid when on a shooting spree in his high school.  It was Columbine and all the others all over again.  In fact I was reading this when the horrible massacre at <br />Virgina Tech took place. <br />The most amazing thing in this book, is that you read steadily about the <br />boy that finally does the shooting, the bullying he'd endured his whole <br />life, a friendship with a girl when he was a child that is still a prominent figure in this book, her relationship with her mother who is <br />a judge, and even a surprising romance in the midst of all this sadness. <br />You feel the parents of the shooters immense pain as much as you feel <br />the sadenss of the murdered children.  You learn about the parents of the shooter and the dynamics of their family and how this shattering event <br />MAKES them re-examine everything they thought to be true. <br />The wonderful and complex relationship between the female judge and her <br />daughter.  The policeman in this small town who's pulled into this  <br />nightmare, and how it affects him and everyone else involved. <br />There is an investigation, interviews, flashbacks of the shootings, up to the minute it happens, and a trial, with the defense attorney of the shooter trying to save this kids life.  You don't feel sorry for the kid who did this, but you understand him more and that may help us understand when someone else does this. <br />This book has everything in it, mystery, a twist that will surprise you, <br />sweet romance, violence, and a real look at what we all have been through when trying to fit into school, with the rules of popularity, and the need to fit in, wonderful looks at relationships, of mothers and sons, <br />and mothers and daughters, and so much more you have to read to understand.  This book has so much in it, there was not a slow page in <br />the book.  I didn't want it to end, and I'm usually more of a mystery reader than anything else, and this book had a little bit of that and <br />SO much more.  Its a fascinating, unputdownable book.  I was sad when the book ended because it is a treasure.   Jody Picoult has a way with words that make you feel like you could be that character. <br />If you want a great summer read, this one is the one to take on vacation,  <br />and just enjoy this writers talent.  This book is like no other book I've <br />ever read, and I loved it so much.  I hope she keeps writing about <br />things that ARE in the headlines now, because nobody does it better. <br />This is also a GREAT book for a book club, my Moms book club read it and <br />loved it also.  I haven't talked to anybody that didn't just love it. <br />I have ordered more of Jodys books because she is an amazing writer. <br />Get this book, you will not be disappointed. <br />Sincerely, <br />Jill C.

B000002AZ8|4.0|i stayed away from pearl jam as long as i could but with nothing to listen to i decided to hear some of their stuff.  the self titled 2006 album i didnt like.  ten is very good but looses something towards the end.  vs is pretty cool, some songs i didnt like too much.  no code is ok i guess but i didnt like it.  yield has some decent songs but overall not too good.  guess i dont like vedders voice sometimes.    this album has a great vibe. its almost like their white album or trippy album. all those throw away tracks are ok by me. so far this is the one i liked best.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is one of the most unique books I've ever read.  For the most part, the characters are all children; with overwhelmingly high IQ's.  They are recruited by the government to be trained to fight in a war with aliens from outer space.  However, since they are all children when they are recruited they are trained in the form of \\"games\\".   <br /> <br />Ender is the supreme genius of all the children.  Along with his counterpart Bean he accomplishes only the unimaginable.  I love the fact that the story is told from a children's point of view.  I think it's great how Ender is an outcast because he is the \\"third\\" child and yet he was the perfect balance of aggressiveness and compassion.  All of the ideas that surrounded this story were very well crafted.  I think this book is a must read for anyone who is a fan of Science Fiction or Fantasy.

B000022TSH|5.0|\\"Chinatown\\" is an amazing piece of film that grows richer as it grows older.  It was nominated for 11 Oscars, only winning one for Robert Towne's Best Original Screenplay.  John Alonzo, who was nominated for Best Cinematography, sets a sheen & sparkle to the vintage look of the film.  The soundtrack is also brilliant.  It was nominated for Best Picture but lost to \\"The Godfather Part II.\\"<br /><br />While \\"Chinatown\\" did not do well @ the Oscars, it was the Golden Globe winner for Best Drama and also brought Roman Polanski a Best Director Golden Globe award.  Roman Polanski has done many classics including his other Oscar nominations as Best Director for [[ASIN:B00003CXCF Rosemary's Baby]] & \\"Tess\\" to his 2002 Oscar win for [[ASIN:B00005JLT5 The Pianist]].  \\"Chinatown's detractors say that the pacing is slow, but I find that it builds intensity as each piece of the puzzle is revealed and somehow doesn't fit or indicates that there is more to the puzzle.<br /><br />As Jake \\"J.J.\\" Gittes, Jack Nicholson has never been better.  His demeanor that leads you to think he never takes anything seriously is contained, with just enough wiseacre to make him endearing.  Nicholson brought home the Golden Globe as Best Actor but lost the Oscar to surprise winner Art Carney for [[ASIN:B0009X75O2 Harry and Tonto]] in a field that also had Al Pacino for \\"Godfather Part II,\\" Dustin Hoffman for \\"Lenny\\" & \\"Albert Finney in \\"Murder on the Orient Express.\\"  As Gittes, we watch Nicholson twist and squirm.  The scene where Roman Polanski slits Gittes' nose is brutal and remains emphasized as Nicholson plays following scenes with a big bandage on the middle of his face.<br /><br />Faye Dunaway received her second Oscar nomination for this film.  Her performance is incredibly controlled, but throbbing with the underlying secrets of her past and conditioned by the opulence of her wealth.  She lost the Oscar to Ellen Burstyn for [[ASIN:B000286RO8 Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]].<br /><br />The film's large cast is peppered with faces we had seen or later saw frequently.  Darrell Zwerling whose career spanned the decade was also seen in \\"High Anxiety,\\" \\"Grease\\" & \\"Capricorn One.\\"  As Dunaway's husband Hollis, he remains bespectacled & without dialogue for much of the picture until his character's tragic demise.  John Huston's legendary career is reflected in the shadow of his presence on screen as the family patriarch Noah Cross.  Perry Lopez plays detective Lou Escobar in his most memorable film.  John Hillerman, who would play prominently on TV from 1980-1988 in \\"Magnum P.I.,\\" plays Yelburton, the assistant water commissioner.  Diane Ladd plays Ida Sessions, the fake Mrs. Mulray.  Ladd picked up a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" that same year & was later nominated for \\"Wild at Heart\\" in 1990 and \\"Rambling Rose\\" in 1991.  Burt Young who would be Oscar nominated for his character Paulie in \\"Rocky\\" in 1976 plays Curly who Gittes helps with marital matters.  James Hong who played prominently in 1994's film [[ASIN:078321958X The Shadow]] appears stoically as Mrs. Mulray's butler.  \\"Chinatown\\" picks us up and carries us through to the ending, surprising with twists & turns.  It is classic cinema.  Bravo!br /> <br />The film's large cast is peppered with faces we had seen or later saw frequently.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|Among the modern \\"Big 4\\" Progressive Rock bands (Marillion, Spock's Beard, Flower Kings & Dream Theater), I've always felt that D.T. had the toughest chops and took the greatest risks. For those seeking a solid, new album from the band, \\"Systematic Chaos\\" more than fills the bill. <br /> <br />The album wastes no time getting right in your face as the riff-heavy opener \\"In The Presence Of Enemies Part 1\\" leaps out of the speakers. The rhythm is a little reminiscent of King Crimson's various \\"Larks Tongues\\" improvs, but at the two minute mark it resolves into a very nice and melodic Petrucci solo that owes more than a little to the Steve Hackett \\"Wind & Wuthering / Seconds Out\\" era of Genesis. At the four minute mark it's a stacatto buildup to more sledgehammer riffing and James LaBrie's vocals. Petrucci shines again on \\"Forsaken,\\" and once again, the impact comes from the patented Dream Theater blend of light-speed guitar riffs, chunky rhythms, and Labrie's ability to meet all of the above with his own unflinching power. On \\"Repentance,\\" you're really gonna hear the Floyd thing the other reviewers have mentioned. The album's epic (wouldn't be a D.T. album without one) is the 15-minute \\"The Ministry Of Lost Souls.\\" Once again, Petrucci proves that his reputation as a masterful player is well-deserved. Another winner from a winning band.

B00000DCHE|4.0|After the huge success of \\"[[ASIN:B00000DDMH Glass Houses]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B00000DCHD 52nd Street]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B00000DCHC The Stranger]],\\" many of Billy Joel's early fans were crying 'sell-out.' From the popular success of \\"Just The Way You Are\\" to the modern rock of \\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me,\\" fans that had come up through those early piano-troubadour albums felt Joel had forgotten his roots. Joel even somewhat conceded the point when he released \\"Songs From The Attic.\\"<br /><br />\\"Our intention here is to provide a selective sampling of the earlier stuff, played the right way - with honest road muscle,\\" Joel writes in \\"Songs From The Attic's\\" liner notes. He gets that point across right off the top as \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out On Broadway)\\" roars forth like the stadium rocker it was always meant to be, with far more punch than its studio version. This is one of the rare live CD's that improves on its originals. The songs from the first four albums are also Joel's picks (hence no \\"Piano Man,\\" but two songs from \\"[[ASIN:B00000DCHH Cold Spring Harbor]]\\"), and this way they come off as fresh for those who had only discovered Joel around the time of \\"52'nd Street.\\"<br /><br />Even so, there are fan favorites here. \\"Captain Jack\\" and \\"The Ballad Of Billy The Kid\\" both appear, and the hit single of \\"She's Got A Way\\" came from this album. Joel was at a crossroads here. After the mega-success of \\"Glass Houses,\\" he began a string of experiments that - while yielding hits - became more experimental and off the beaten path. (His next album would be the Beatlesque song-cycle \\"[[ASIN:B00000DCHF The Nylon Curtain]].\\") Closing \\"Songs From The Attic\\" with the prematurely nostalgic \\"I've Loved These Days\\" is more than a touch ironic. This wonderful touchstone was Billy Joel both celebrating the youth of his musical career and closing the door before maturing in his pursuits. That the songs hold their vitality some 35 years later (\\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" first appeared in 1971) is testimony to the quality of Joel's songs.in 1971) is testimony to the quality of Joel's songs.

0385733577|3.0|After reading all six of Jane Austen's major novels, I was in need for a change of pace.  When I came across this title, I was sure I had found the book I needed.  Unfortunately, I was more disappointed than satisfied by the end of the book.      One of the strengths you'll hear about this book from reading the other reviews is how easy the novel is to read.  And the language is very easy to get through.  But this also became a problem for me once I realized that the narrative is largely told in summary form.  In fact, I would say somewhere around 70% is summary like.  At certain times, events can progress from point A to point E surprisingly quickly.  As far as descriptions and details go, there's a rule many writers like to follow of \\"show don't tell.\\"  Instead of giving vivid or concrete details, there's often just the description of \\"she was terrified\\" or \\"creatures that had no right to exist outside of nightmares\\" (186).  Those particular monsters are never described at all, and little time is usually spent to convince the reader that a character is terrified.  This is a large part of why the story can be read so quickly.      Another aspect the book takes credit for is its ability to blend elements like mythology and history.  While it's perfectly obvious that the author knows his stuff, it doesn't always translate well into the narrative.  Early on, Flamel claims the Great Fire of London revolved around him: \\"[He] loosed a Fire Elemental after us, a savage, mindless creature that almost devoured the city.  History calls it the Great Fire\\" (43).  Flamel says nothing more on that particular event.  With a statement that short and general, it would be easy to make the same claim about how Rome burned under Emperor Nero.  But that doesn't mean Michael Scott has \\"blended history.\\"  More often than not, the ties to myth and history are that general.    What I found to be a true disappointment is the fact that alchemy itself has almost a nonexistent role in the book.  Considering the symbols on the book, the title on the cover, and the presence of Nicholas Flamel, I was very surprised.  To be fair, Flamel does specifically state how alchemy is a scientific discipline.  But most of the book just has plain old magic.  \\"Magic\\" and \\"magician\\" appear more frequently than \\"alchemist\\" and \\"alchemy.\\"  This became fully apparent once one of the characters asked if they'll be trained as \\"magicians.\\"  Flamel replies, \\"As magicians and sorcerers, as necromancers, warlocks and even enchanters\\" (225).  (But not as alchemists.)  Essentially, every other form of magic is employed in this book as if the magic users' abilities are one big wild card.  Flamel himself has amazingly weak abilities.  Instead of showing why he's the greatest alchemist of all time, he chooses to dial a cell phone and call someone to send in a magical wind and save the day.  The main protagonists also spend virtually no time actually learning anything.  A powerful god/elder simply \\"Awakens\\" one's power or just outright transfers all of their own powers to one of the twins.  A particularly annoying aspect dealt with each person having a distinct smell when they used their magic; some had vanilla, and others smelled like eggs.  Any of the smells made it difficult to be very terrified in a confrontation scene.    Flamel himself just didn't seem like what one would expect.  He's wiser than the rest, but his speech rarely convinces the reader of that.  And even though his main adversary spent centuries chasing and trying to catch him, learning new and more deadly tactics each time, it never crossed Flamel's mind to train himself in the arcane arts to try and defend himself: \\"[He] has spent the past five centuries developing his powers; I've spent that same time hiding mine, concentrating only on those few little things I needed to do to keep Perenelle and myself alive\\" (41-2).  Yet later on, Flamel claims that he \\"had spent most of his long life studying the elemental forces\\" (163).  Those elemental forces are referring to the basic earth, fire, wind, and water elements.  It wouldn't take much imagination to picture the sort of power coming from mastering those elements.  So there's inconsistency in Flamel's character as well.  The inside of the front cover and the letter written by him just prior to the first chapter are about as intriguing as Flamel gets in this story.  The real story centers around two twins and the \\"Prophecy\\" of their great powers.    There are some positive sides.  The main antagonist began making the plot interesting once he blurred the lines between who was and wasn't trustworthy.  Little strengths like this did occur at times but usually faded.  The trustworthy issue only took about seven lines to be resolved once the character was confronted with having to make a choice, pointing back to the summary problem.      Although it has an \\"ages 12 and up\\" rating, I would guess this book might have been actually geared towards a younger audience.  It certainly wasn't what I was hoping for, and the excerpt from the sequel doesn't promise that the book's style will develop any either.  I'm undecided about whether or not I'll stick with the series.  It could take several years, but I may just wait it out and see what the final book sounds like before I commit to the rest of the novels.  I wouldn't call it a particularly bad book, but I wouldn't really recommend it considering the sort of drawbacks it has and the kind of expectations one would have when the book has a title like \\"The Alchemyst.\\"
B000002MP2|1.0|I remember dancing to \\"Basketcase\\" at my middle school mixers when I was 12. I thought the song was absolutely amazing. I loved Green Day, couldn't imagine a time when I wouldn't love Green Day.    Well, my friends, that time has come.  Green Day, along with the other alterna/grunge/punk rock groups of the nineties, have ceased to endure. It's sad, really, to think that a whole jaunre of music has boiled down to ultimate mediocrity.  I agree with another reviewer, a kid, who notes that the songs ARE good the first hundred times; they're just not good ever after. By 1996, I was done with Green Day and the like. My general dissatfication with music left me restless and by a stroke of luck led me overseas to the Brit Pop movement of the 90s propelled by The Stone Roses, Suede, and Pulp, to name a few. (\\"I'm so bored with USA\\" shouted The Clash in 1977; I felt that sentiment twenty years later.)  Finally, music as good today as yesterday and the day before that.    At any rate, back to Green Day specifically. All of this discussion as to whether or not Green Day is punk is absurd. Punk began in the seventies with The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and The Clash along with many others. The jaunre  most prominately morphed into Post-Punk (ie Joy Division, Psychedelic Furs etc., now called Neo Post Punk ie Interpol), but it never ceased to exist unto itself. Punk is most vaguely defined as three cord music accompanied by vituperative, nihilistic lyrics. Is Green Day therefore punk? Absolutely.  It could also be classified loosely as Alternative, but definately not grunge music. The better question here is whether or not Green Day is good Punk? What is it that they do with those three cords that make their work special?    The true answer is, not much.  The music on Dookie has very little range and the lyrics are positively negligible. I mean, who was ever prompted to scream \\"Anarchy!!!\\" at the sound of a Green Day song?  Think a minute... My point exactly.  Punk that misses itsmark. In addition, BJA's voice is an utter horror, which can work to the music's benefit, but not in this case. These are the three major problems with Green Day's Dookie, problems that make it not only bad punk, but also not so good music.    Now, I know I am going to get bashed with \\"unhelpful\\" votes for stating my opinion. Please be conscious then, that my review is not for someone who already loves Green Day, but for someone who uses Amazon as I do, as a source iin order to define their future investments in music.    I would like to end my review by stating that Green Day have muiscally improved over the years; I was impressed with their recent growth in the form of American Idiot. They have only gotten better when many bands just get worse. Now, do I like their music? More important, do I listen to their new music and want to scream \\"Anarchy!\\". Hell no! Thank the Lord I have Folk-Rock's subtle and poetic Bright Eyes for that.

B00008DDRX|5.0|I almost want to accuse Steve McQueen of making a self-indulgent film as driving fast cars was his passion; however, using the word \\"self\\" doesn't make much sense given how popular the automobile is with the male half of the global population. Cars are to men what shoes are to women. If you are a man and you you aren't interested in fast cars you are probably either 1) not of the majority's sexual orientation or 2) from a part of the World where they don't have them (Moomba maboday jambaa car?).<br /><br />\\"Le Mans\\" is, for most of the film, more like a documentary than fiction.

Delaney is haunted by the memory of a crash that killed an Italian driver the year before.<br /><br />There isn't much dialogue in the film. One notable quotation occurs after the widow of the Italian driver asks McQueen's character why driving is worth the risk: \\"A lot of people go through life doing things badly.

B000003CMD|3.0|This album isn't bad but it's a far cry from the Allman's first four albums . You can see them going from a hard core blues band to somewhat of a pop band . Ramblin' Man  (featuring Les Dudek on lead guitar) and Jessica  (featuring Dudek on acoustic guitar )being two prime examples . There is some good stuff on here though . Betts does a killer lead on Southbound .Wasted Words is good and so is Come And Go Blues . Jelly Jelly is a great blues song . Its actually a cover of an old Lowell Fulson song , same exact lyrics and melody but the song is credited to Gregg Allman ( no big deal ) . The problem with this album is , they replaced Duane with Chuck Leavell . Where you once had gritty raw guitar solos , you now have a very melodic piano in it's place . Leavell's great , but it really altered the bands sound and instead of being one musics great blues bands it made the Allmans synonymous with \\" southern rock \\" , a title more befitting The Marshall Tucker or Charlie Daniels Band .

I think the cd is the kind that you chill out to, not really party music.  Less of the songs are upbeat and most are a little slower, but they still have a steady beat.  My favorite songs on this album are \\"She Will be Loved\\", \\"The Sun\\", and \\"Sunday Morning\\".  Overall I love this CD, I would recommend it for people that like music in the categories: jazz, pop, alternative, and \\"chillin' music\\".

0930289234|5.0|a great book if you like the superhero thing. if you arent into that then dont even pick it up as it is 400 pages of superheros.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|4.5 might be a more realistic score, since although it's somewhat debatable whether 'Good Girl Gone Bad' has an instant dance knockout along the lines of \\"SOS\\" or \\"Pon De Replay,\\" it is undeniably Rihanna's most consistently enjoyable album, with minimal filler and her most notable instances of growth as an artist so far. Lead single \\"Umbrella\\" (which has already topped the charts in both America and the UK) verges on experimental, with an infectious R&B-pop hook and rock-influenced backbeat. It suits Rihanna's voice and style perfectly, and is one of the most triumphant successes of her career. Jay-Z's rap verse feels vaguely unnecessary; even as he raps, it's Rihanna who shines-her repeated 'ay ay's during the verse stick in the mind more than anything Jay has to say. Still, it does add a smidgen of zest, and doesn't change the fact that it's just a great song. \\"Don't Stop The Music\\" is absolutely addictive, and finds Rihanna getting in touch with her inner Kylie Minogue. The song thumps along harder and harder over time to an almost Euro-dance beat, and the Michael Jackson sample is beyond brilliant. Second single \\"Shut Up And Drive\\" is once again a Rihanna we've never heard before, but one you'll be sure to want to hear more of-it meshes 80's rock with modern hip-hop and pop dazzle, with a head-bobbing guitar intro building up to an explosive, almost anthemic chorus. This song will surely fill a hell of a lot of dancefloors. \\"Sell Me Candy\\" is produced by production giant Timbaland, so of course it's one of the hottest tracks on the record. The skittering verses build up to a transcendent chorus that radio will most definitely warm up to sooner or later. \\"Rehab\\" is also extremely radio-ready, something like a hypnotic mix between Timbaland's \\"Apologize\\" and Justin Timberlake's \\"What Goes Around...Comes Around.\\" It boasts both a production by Timbaland and backup vocals by Timberlake himself. Probable third single \\"Hate That I Love You\\" is a duet with Ne-Yo thatechoes both Beyonce's \\"Irreplaceable\\" and Ne-Yo's own \\"So Sick.\\" The song is arguably the best ballad on the disc (one of the best Rihanna's ever released, in fact), with great vocals from both artists and an irresistible chorus. \\"Lemme Get That\\" is initially not that catchy and weighted down by shallow lyrics, but it's something of a grower and is greatly assisted by a startlingly good breakdown sequence near the end. \\"Breakin' Dishes\\" is our first taste of 'angry Rihanna,' and it's a side of her that's really only convincing for about half the song. Regardless, the song has a place on the album and will please a good chunk of fans. \\"Say It\\" is a sweet, lightweight ballad that breezes by as swiftly as a flurry of feathers. The title track is hooky and has a nice beat, vaguely similar to that of \\"Hate That I Love You,\\" and reveals that the title of the album may not be as slyly racy as it seems, while \\"Question Existing\\" creates a dreamy, futuristic songscape musically, and an almost confusing, almost intriguing atmosphere lyrically. As a whole, it's by far Rihanna's tightest attempt yet, and finally utilizes her greatest strengths as a dance artist. The album isn't plagued by syrupy balladry or overly silly-summery reggae (which could only take her so far on her debut), and is a must-have for 2007's fans of R&B, pop, dance, lite rock and beyond.

B000LE1GVW|5.0|To the reviewer who only liked \\"New Shoes\\":  I'm not surprised.  It's not a knock on the reviewer or the song, it's catchy.  But I think it was a poor choice to release as a single if the goal was to introduce people to his style.  \\"New Shoes\\" has a completely different feel than the rest of the album. <br /> <br />That being said, what an amazing voice and fantastic debut album!  Personal fav's are \\"Million Faces\\" and \\"Last Request\\".  I'm guessing the only reason one of these two wasn't released as the single was because they aren't incredibly upbeat.

B000002MX7|5.0|This is awesome. I have most of her solo albums as well but most of them are patchy. (I do like the Prince produced \\"Come 2 My House\\" album and the 1991 album \\"The Woman I Am\\". No tracks from these 2 albums are on this release) There are also some new/bonus tracks which are worthwhile. <br />Everyone talks about a track which is missing which should have been on the album. Really a double disc release would have been better for Chaka, but you will love this. A double disc would have included tracks from her 1982 self titled album which is super rare, released on CD only in Japan as well as Clouds,and possibly my favorite track from Chaka which appears on the Beverly Hills 90210 soundtrack feat Michael McDonald \\"Time To Be Lovers\\". This is easily the best option for a casual fan as it has the main hits on it and even though it's a compilation, it flows very well and doesn't seem dated even though most of the tracks are from the early 80's.

Some of us may enjoy more than others the human side of 007 but I believe it does not hurt the movie. It is a well done action movie with a little romance. Please do not compare Daniel Craig to other actors that played the Bond character in the past. I would not say that one was better than other, I would say just different. You can have a personal favorite (mine continues to be Sean Connery (I particularly like it in Goldfinger). But I believe that Craig does a pretty good job. I am looking forward to the next one.

From the miniature overlay in the bottom corner of the making of WHILE YOU ARE WATCHING THE SCENES THEMSELVES IN THE MOVIE, to the amount of extras (not on extra discs thank you) they really took their time.  The Video quality is noticeably sharper and cleaner than the DVD version.  As a comparison - I have the Ultimate Neo Collection that comes with the Neo Bust and the 10-disc DVD Collection.  This 4-DVD set has all the same material in a much more organized and easily viewable format and it is much easier to find and use the information.  Even a casual viewer has to give credit to the ability to see the special effects in a mini-window during the movie - easily shut off is they do not want it. <br /> <br />Overall if you are a fan of the Matrix seris this is  a no-brainer of a purchase.  If not then I don't know what to tell you other than this might be worth the money just to be able to show-off what HD-DVD can do other than be more expensive than the original DVD sets of these movies.
0802130208|2.0|This book is good for many reasons and bad for many others.  The characters are brilliantly thought out and he combines plots and situations very well.  The statements that he makes about society in his own way are amusing and very poignant. <br /> <br />That being said, I was expecting funny.  Perhaps I have a horrible sense of humor, but I never thought I did.  I didn't laugh out loud; I hardly thought the situation were funny.  I tried to picture them actually happening visually, and I guess that was kind of funny, but still didn't do much for me.  The characters are largely unlikeable and I didn't find myself caring about any of them; thus, I really could not get into this novel.  <br /> <br />Try it out if you want, but don't pay full price at Borders as I did.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|Rush albums are so rare these days that the arrival of SNAKES AND ARROWS came seemingly an eternity after their last album five years ago. Oh, there's been a volley of live releases, as well as the quirky [[ASIN:B00028HBIY Feedback]] EP, but I was waiting impatiently to hear what new music the trio of guitarist Alex Lifeson, bassist Geddy Lee, and drummer Neil Peart would present.<br /><br />Now in their mid-50s, the gang is rocking just as hard as ever, with a desire to push the limits of rock virtuosity that hasn't flagged. Neil Peart's drumming may not have finally transitioned to the world of the digital kit, leading to a slight staleness in sound, but his drumming still requires the traditional strength and control. Geddy Lee's basslines have become more subtle now, while Alex Lifeson didn't stop with just playing a usual guitar or two, but worked in a whole host of stringed instruments. The band seems to be rejoicing in the fact that, as longtime virtuosos, they've still got it, since the album contains three whole instrumentals. And as with any Rush album, songwriting spans from all-out sonic onslaughts (\\"Far Cry\\", \\"Spindrift\\") to tamer reflections (\\"The Larger Bowl\\"), and some songs which alternate between the two (\\"Bravest Face\\").<br /><br />The sound on here is much better than [[ASIN:B000065DTE Vapor Trails]], Rush's earlier album that was a \\"loudness wars\\" fiasco of muddy audio and digital clipping. Alex Lifeson's insistence from VAPOR TRAILS that synths be left out continues on this effort. It's good that Lifeson has more room to work, but the production unfortunately emphasizes the low end and one has to try hard to follow guitar lines. Furthermore, Lee is continuing to compensate for the lack of his beloved synths by overdubbing his voice. It works quite well on this album, especially compared to VAPOR TRAILS, but I know the practice is controversial among Rush fans. All in all, however, this is a disc that's enjoyable to listen to from first song to last, which not all Rush albums have succeeded in being.<br /><br />While the music is generally excellent, the downside of the album is found in Neil Peart's lyric writing. SNAKES AND ARROWS was announced as Peart's reflections on faith, and these are not always insightful. Two songs here, \\"Far Cry\\" and \\"Bravest Face\\" are admirable descriptions of life as a constant yin and yang or Wolflian idyll and catastrophe (though Per Norgard does a better job of portraying this perspective in his [[ASIN:B000000B0Z Symphony No. 4]] \\"Hommage to Adolf Wolfli\\"). On other songs, however, Peart's lyrics are irksome. In \\"Armor and Sword\\", for example, he tells the religious to reject the traditional cry to spiritual warfare (the song evokes St. Paul most, but this is an idea found in Judaism, Buddhism, and Shinto just the same). It would make sense for Peart to call people over to his humanist philosophy, but to tell them how to practise their own religion is just silly.<br /><br />Peart also shows a pretty big ignorance of the philosophy of religion here at two points. In \\"Armor and Sword\\" he claims people come to religion only for security and to escape the fear of death, but plenty of thinkers from Richard Swinburne to Flew have chosen their faith because they find that the arguments lead to it, not because of personal angst. In \\"Faithless\\" Peart writes, \\"I don't have faith in faith, I don't believe in belief / You can call me faithless, you can call me faithless. / But I still claim to hope, and I believe in love.\\" Sorry, that's the lamest apologia for a humanist outlook I've ever heard. Put it alongside the work of atheist philosophers of religion like Mackie or existentialist thinkers like Camus and Peart's attempt is simply risible. Of course, one cannot expect a rock drummer who never finished high school to make a strong argument, but one wonders why he even tried. I think popular music acts who focus on instrumental virtuosity but recognize that simple musicians are not cut out for philosophizing have it right, and after a full disc of Peart's lyrics it's nice to put in a Cocteau Twins or a Miles Davis album.<br /><br />If you haven't heard Rush before, you could start with SNAKES AND ARROWS just as easily as anywhere else (the band has had few \\"duds\\", though I think TEST FOR ECHO and PRESTO are especially low-rated among fans). I'm personally amazed that these three musicians continue to release good new music with no sign of flagging.t right, and after a full disc of Peart's lyrics it's nice to put in a Cocteau Twins or a Miles Davis album.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|i loved the first 2 x-men movies. wouldn't it be pc to say \\"x-people.\\" brian synger, the director of the first 2 movies, was away doing 'superman returns;' (i'm still not sure if that was a remake or a sequel). superman returns also stole cyclops, which is why is was only in the beginning of X3. <br /> <br />the portrayal of the phoenix, the super-powerful jean grey, was poorly done and could have been so much more. she just sat in the background until the end. the whole premise of the movie was poor too. all they had to do was make apocalypse the main nemesis. he's an alien who was entombed in ancient egypt by the revolting people, kind of like star gate. his mutant powers are far beyond any one mutant. they are like rogue, where he absorbs them from other mutants, but can use the newly acquired powers forever, not just temporarily. that's how i understand apocalypse anyway. the \\"cure\\" for mutantism was a weak plot. there was no main, solid theme. pieces were just thrown in at random, there was no continuity or flow. <br /> <br />i loved the magneto freeing the imprisoned mutants scene a lot- throwing all those cars around. i liked seeing the wide variety of mutants like shockwave, etc., but still no gambit. it was cool to see storm do a tornado too. <br /> <br />the effects were great, but the plot was weak. it's a shame to end on a bad note. maybe if they get synger back, they can make a cool fourth one; just wait a while until the bad taste leaves everyone's mouth though. they left it open for a fourthquel, with professorX (i don't want to ruin it, but watch the last scene at the end of the credits) and magneto too. there's so many superhero movies now. venom was cool, can't wait for the silver surfer. maybe even ironman? i wonder if they'll play the black sabbath song of the same name during that movie. superheros are cool, everyone loves them. they show how we can become something beyond ourselves and help others. some people do this already in their own way,like a parent or a friend, others just want to be rescued. i used to have super powers when i would drink a lot. one moment i would be in one bar, and then, all of a sudden, i would be teleported to another bar along with some of my friends too. everyone has a little super in them. will you use it for good or for evil?

If you don't want the facts and the facts that lead to the facts, dont bother reading BT. She will bore you. If you are curious as to how history and events evolve, then she delivered again with this one. <br />What leads to Folly (defined as a group acting contrary to their own best interests) - self-interest over public interests, belief in the monopoly of power, belief that abndonment of the current course will lead to ruin. <br /> <br />An interesting conclusion I drew from this was that open systems that feared their own demise and debated it actually survived and grew stronger. The British Empire expanded for the 100 years after US rebellion, while there were many who believed it would crumble without the American colonies. Many in US policy circles believed that Communist agression, if not checked in Vietnam, would lead to the demise of free and open societies. Clearly events unfolded otherwise. <br /> <br />The open debate of folly in a society leads to progress as in the case of The British Empire and The US. The lack of debate led to the destruction of Troy, and the persistent decline in power of the RC Church since the Renassaince. <br /> <br />All leaders would do well to take heed...

B00005NWLO|5.0|This is Skynyrd at their peak, I will argue this was the best rock band on the planet at the moment this album was recorded. <br /> <br />I could partake in the Allman v. Skynyrd argument for eternity. I'm a Sourthern musician myself, and I think there's room for both bands and both albums (as well as many of their other works) in any collection. <br /> <br />I find it intriguing that the aforementioned Skynyrd ripper listed later Black Crowes and Widespread Panic albums as better than Skynyrd live; the \\"Allman wannabe\\" label is a much better fit for those latter-day jam bands. All the guitar players I've ever known (including Al Kooper, who I don't know but who I respect the hell out of, considering his pedigree) thought the Skynyrd axe men were very progressive for their day.  <br />  <br />The Allman-Skynyrd comparison is apt only from 10,000 feet. Yes, they came from the same area, and many of the influences were similar. But Skynyrd followed the more modern English blues-rock paradigm (see: Cream, Free), and they were more of a pop-song-type band (in the gunslinging, Allmans tradition, of course). <br /> <br />I would even venture to say that Skynyrd followed in the Allmans' footsteps. Indeed, Brother Duane is up there with Hendrix, methinks, and I find the Allmans' work during his lifetime unimpeachable and some of the best modern music ever made.  <br /> <br />It gets iffy for both bands after their key members passed. Skynyrd was poised to become even bigger and better with the addition of Steve Gaines -- listen to the guitar work on \\"Street Survivors.\\" And Ronnie Van Zant knew what the hell he was doing. Meanwhile, everyone knows what happened to Greg and Co. after Duane's untimely death. (I think I sense a pattern here.)  <br />  <br />I saw both bands in the space of a year in '75-'76 (including all 3 nights at Fox for Skynyrd), and there was no comparison at that point. Allman biographer Scott Freeman considers that '75 Allman tour to be the band's nadir, and the Skynyrd boys were going for the gold about 9 months later.     <br /> <br />I don't think any other Southern band has come close since then. . . <br /> <br />

B00005JL78|5.0|Every decade seems to spawn no more then 10 major SF classics  worth watching again and again ( my personal litmus test of quality).The 80's seem to have the lead in this field (Blade Runner ,Alien I & II , Empire Strikes Back , Conan , Philadelphia Experiment , The Abyss , Back to the Future Trilogy  , They Live , Star Track Wrath Of Khan , some others as well ). The 90's  OTOH were a disappointment , only a few Sci-Fi flicks seem to me to have been memorable  : Starship Troopers ,Total Recall  Blade I and The Matrix .  <br />I was thrilled therefore  in 2002 when Minority Report came out .Seemed that the new decade was off to a great start. The overreliance of CGI spawning  soulless forgettable tripe like the new Star Wars series  snozefest  seem to have been  overcome .MR  arguably stacked up right up there with the  classics of the 80's and the balance  between storyline and CGI seemed to have been struck .  . Sadly it's 2007 and the only a few  other movies which seem to have entered my personal hall of fame in this field  are  (more or less ) War of the Worlds (Spielberg again) and  Apocalypto . I Robot barely makes it .  Looks like the first 10 years of  the new millennium are going to come up the driest yet as far  as Sci-Fi  classics go .
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Octavarium was a huge disappointment to me so I'm totally psyched about the album DT just put out. DT has bounced back in a BIG BIG BIG way. After just two listens I'm completely convinced that Systematic Chaos is their third masterpiece. For me it's right up there with Scenes and Awake. It's not quite as catchy as some of their older work, but that makes it even more interesting. I can tell it's one of those albums where I'll discover something new with each listen. It's a really heavy album too with driving rythms and lots of energy, which is refreshing to hear after the bland and uninspiring sounds of Octovarium. I think SC is one of their stronger albums lyrically as well. Dream Theater is definitely back on top of their game. 6 STARS!!!
B000O178BY|3.0|I LOVE NIN - been a fan since 1990 - just want to make that clear, so bias is known. However, I don't love this CD. I do love or like certain parts of each song. However, I (so far) hate certain parts of certain songs. After many patient listens, \\"In this Twilight\\" is the only song I really like all the way through, even if it is more optimistic than most NIN material. Some songs have much potential...and a line or noise section that i can't stand. Maybe Trent has to let go of the concept album & just go back to creating amazing songs. Maybe sobriety & earnestness isn't the right fit, although I'm happy for him for losing all the bad chemicals.  Or maybe I'm just getting old, slowly catching up with Trent or something. I don't know - try it out - see what YOU think.

I didn't want the book to end. I dreaded coming up on the final page; this story could have gone on for an eternity and it still wouldn't have been long enough for me.

B000002WTI|5.0|Surrealistic Pillow, is of course, one of the best albums ever.  While, yes, it is somewhat inspired by nasty drugs, by now (40 years later), it remains as a cultural icon, time having healed the former taboo status. I believe that more than any other band, the Airplane captured the essence of at least the counterculture movement of the 1960s. Also, they had tremendous endurance as a band, and great commercial success.<br /><br />My favorite song, by far, is D.C.B.A. 25. This has to be their best album, although Takes Off is close.  I believe that the Airplane became more dark, moody, and certainly in the realm of protest-oriented from 1968-1970 or so, thus becoming dated somewhat, whereas the first two albums were rich with ballads and happy songs.<br /><br />In my opinion, there was not a finer era for popular music than the second half of the 1960s.  I cannot even begin to listen to any of today's sounds.<br /><br />Finally, while the Airplane personnel were not quite in the category of being moral, at least they and virtually all bands of this era, were usually courteous and gracious people, at least to media and in public.
1594489505|5.0|This is a powerful story of two Afghan woman who endure the bitter turmoils that have ravaged their country. We often hear about Afghanistan in the news but seldom do we have a personal account of the social life there. Hosseini offers an remarkable potrayal of Afghan life from the experiences of two women. Through this book readers can learn about veiled aspects of Afghan life and culture. The book is a testament to the power of love to triumph over difficult circumstances. <br /> <br />I read this book with Nexus: A Neo Novel which is completely different kind of novel with a psychological and spiritual theme. Both books successfully reveal the power of love to transform people in their own unique way.

B0000VAFO0|5.0|Apart from the comic trip look and feel of this film, apart from the special effects both on the side of the vampires and on the side of the werewolves, apart from the impossible love affair between a vampire girl and a werewolf boy, at the beginning qt least, soon to become something else, this film is decadent in all possible ways and somewhere kind of paranoid. And yet there is something that floats over the whole thing, that survives the animal horror that animates these pictures and bleak places. Two species have been fighting for centuries and the salvation of both is in a new blood line that will cross the two different ones. Peace can only come from crossing the bloodlines of the two rivals, the two enemies, the two antagons. And that works, in the film of course, because in reality if it were that simple...! It has been noticed that when a civil war starts we never know when it will stop. It took some thirty years for the latest episode of the Irish civil war to come to maybe an end and that was only the last episode of a war that was started by the invasion and conquest of Ireland by the English three or four centuries ago. And I will not speak of the Bosnian or Kosovar conflicts, nor of the opposition between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq and in the world. But that's the optimistic final scene of a film that targets teenagers when war comes to an end because the two bloodlines have been mixed in the veins of a new leader. Yet I found the film a little bit long and repetitive as for the fighting scenes.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
B0000084J7|5.0|After fronting the vastly underrated Talk Talk, the singer Mark Hollis, went on to fulfil his own increasingly individualistic path of music, with his own solo album. With a sound and structure that would encompass: Experimental, Post-Rock, Jazz, & Ambient.  His is a sound that centres around the fractured dynamics of \\"Mark Hollis\\" vocals, with an album, that is not simple to categorise & easily define.  Mainly because this is centred around a largely uncategorizable sound informed, by pieces of various downtempo genres reworked and composed to fit within his increasingly selective musical sensibilities, and seemingly committed to making huge musical (and artistic) strides.  <br /> <br />The mood is a resolutely subdued one, which takes in a mannered and organically gloriously uplifting piece of sophisticated reflective experimental/Post-Rock tracks.  Which are in parts breath-taking, or just simply beautiful, with an understated grace and mood, not since his work with Talk Talk.  Here, things are comprised of eight tracks, each of which are arguably stand-out in their own right.  Songs, with the barest sketches of ambient instruments, and compositions of equal parts minimalist guitar & piano. With Mark Hollis adding fractures of vocals over the top.... that like a previous reviewer commented on, has lyrics that seemed to be chosen for their tone and expressiveness, rather than their enunciation, in the subtlest way possible....its cerebral without seeming pretentious, moving without feeling forced, and a statement of artistic endeavour over commercial appeal.  <br /> <br />There simply no getting away from the fact the arrangements here, aim for maximum emotional impact, and frequently resonant with their minimalist tones, with layers of percussion and lingering guitar riff, punctuated by strings and horns, and detached vocals matched with a haunting hypnotic sound, belie a level of complexity and immense beauty, and it becomes quickly clear that the music is stretching for something far beyond conventional pop/rock themes and entering into a more spiritual realm, even if that means sacrificing mainstream appeal, in favour of something more substantial.  <br /> <br />And although most of the tracks on this album, feel like long improvised sections, with delicately balanced ambient flourishes....it's the way that each track delicately unfolds,  subtly and fitting perfectly into the dreamlike mood of the rest of the album, and feel like evolving soundscapes, constantly pushing the boundaries of atmospheric music, & instrumentation, to a level only previously felt on Talk Talk's previous albums, and thus managing to make all the elements combine, to produce something of a truly breath-taking introspective elegance.  <br /> <br />For an album that was generally ignored by the record-buying public (expect the diehard fans of Talk Talk's work), it's probably not too hard to see why this was passed over. It's not a regular album in the conventional sense, with the lilting, delicate and softly-focused performances pointing towards a quietly elegant album, which seems so largely out of step with relatively dominance of Pop/Rock/Indie bands over the last decade, that I'm sure only a small minority; of listeners actually bother to pick up this album. If you are reading this review, then you are almost certainly strongly recommended to pick this album up. It shows an air of grace, bittersweet and passionate subtlety rarely seen in the music, around the time this was released (or indeed since), and one that unfortunately relegated the album to the margins of being a cult release, It's a album that is far too subtle for mass market appeal, but those that are prepared to take the leap, will be rewarded with a creatively and artistically stunning album. Extremely recommended. <br />
B000OCXF0Q|4.0|This is Avril's third studio album, and you would think it would mark another level of maturity in her music, as she herself matures into adulthood. At first glance you'd be wrong - this album moves away from the angsty, rocky, moody efforts of the first two albums, and is pure bubblegum pop - a seeming retardation. But if you actually watch the accompanying DVD, you'll understand that Avril wants it to be exactly how it is - it didn't just end up that way through immaturity or being ditzy. This is a different style to the previous studio albums - very upbeat, happy-clappy - but still deals with those same troubling adolescent issues. A new facet to Avril, with catchy little riffs and interesting layered vocals. <br /> <br />N.B. I didn't realise this when I purchased the CD, but this is the EXPLICIT version of the album (from Target), and there are several songs with very bad language. I think I'd prefer the toned-down version, in hindsight. Swearing doesn't really suit her.

8590379825|5.0|This book is an excellent introduction to LUA programming.  <br /> <br />I also have the \\"Beginning Lua Programming Book\\" by Kurt Jung and Aaron Brown (which admittedly covers a broader scope), but I find myself constantly referring to \\"Programming in Lua\\".  <br /> <br />My own bias is that I am a C++ programming looking to embed LUA in a C++ application. Whilst I am a huge fan of this book, I would prefer slightly more coverage of the C Api for C/C++ programmers. One glaring example is the absence of any reference (that I could find) to the lua_next function. The stack concept is central to understanding interaction between LUA and C/C++ programs. I feel that my learning would have been accelerated by highlighting this fact, ideally with some pictorial representation of the stack contents when c/c++ methods are called from LUA, when lua_getfield, and lua_next methods are called. Maybe this could be covered in a third edition. <br /> <br />This book is still an excellent introduction to LUA!

The chapters written from individual perspectives of the Fitzgeralds add depth to the story, although the same can't be said for the 'Campbell and Julia' subplot. <br />And then comes the 'shocking' ending, in which Piccoult borrows a technique used by Stephen King, at the end of 'IT' and 'Rose Madder', in which the actions of the final chapter have such a significant impact on the main characters that the rest of the book is almost ruined. Almost, yet somehow, not quite.  <br />The end of 'MSK' will undoubtedly leave many readers feeling cheated or betrayed. Yet, just as King did, Piccoult manages to put a certain amount of 'distance' between the final chapters and the rest of the book, making it possible for readers to reach the resolution of the court case, and feel as if that is the 'true' ending of the book. If it only it were really the case, I'd give this book a much higher rating! <br />Still, while I was terribly disappointed with the ending, the rest of the book was good enough to overcome this disappointment. Overall, it's still a worthwhile read, but those who invest a lot emotion in a book will want to be careful here.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Inventive. Action-packed. Absurd. Hilarious. Touching. Violent. Lively. Smart.  And above all else- Superb.<br /><br />You don't need all of those adjectives to describe a great movie, but you do when describing Stephen Chow's masterpiece Kung Fu Hustle.  Taking place in 1940s China, our story involves the hundreds-strong Axe Gang, their efforts to take over the impoverished and dilapidated Pig Sty Alley, and the effects on Pig Sty's tenants.  The gang believes taking or Pig Sty will be a cakewalk, but a few of the residents aren't about to let that happen.<br /><br />Perhaps the most unique thing about the film is how our attention is shifted from one protagonist to another.  The first part focuses on three Kung Fu experts (a baker who carries a wooden staff that can shatter metal guns, a hardworking laborer, and a sensitive homosexual tailor).  The second part is about Pig Sty's tyrannical chain-smoking landlady and her philandering landlord husband.  And the third part concerns a loser (played by Chow) who tries to take up life of crime because of a traumatic childhood incident when he tried to do good deed.  I've read critics pan KFH because it lacks one true central character, but I just call it doing something different.  Oh well, whatever gets those critics through those long and lonely nights.<br /><br />Unconventional narrative style aside, there are plenty of other reasons to watch such as the eye popping effects and the humor.  Ordinarily, I can't stand CGI, but I really love the way it was used here.  Chow succeeds in using it in ways that most American filmmakers can't even dream about.  A gut-busting Looney Toons inspred foot chase and a fight with two evil street musicians both have to be seen to be believed.  Who needs people like Michael Bay who timidly believes he is pushing the envelope, while Chow demolishes the whole stationery store?
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I have tried many headphones & returned them all . they all lacked one thing \\"comfort\\" .Some headphones were just too heavy , you would have to remove them off your head every 5 minutes just to relief the weight on your head . I have tried Ultrasone proline 550 , 650 , Sennheiser hd595 , hd555 .any many more . They don't come close to the AKG K240 . First is \\"comfort\\" they are very light in weight , the sound is awesome . I am using creative sound card on my pc , nothing high end . they sound great . By the way the plug in wire on the side is very rugged no worries if you are concerned about that , i think it's better than the screw in type where i have seen people screw them in the wrong way damaging the thread. I recommend 4 hrs of breaking in time just to experience the full spectrum of these headphones .Enjoy
B00008H2LB|5.0|I've been a Linkin Park fan for about 6 years and I admit, wasn't expecting much when I picked up this CD in early '03.  Boy was I wrong, every song on this CD could most definitely be a single.  While I absolutely despise radio and all it represents (except for Howard Stern...), I understand why a band would want their album to be radio-friendly (it sells a lot more records...).  When I heard \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", like most people, I admit, I didn't like it.  But I thought, hell, I loved Hybrid Theory, and it's Linkin Park, I should pick it up.  (I know there are a lot of Reanimation fans, sorry guys, wasn't into it, if I wanted to listen to techno I would go to a dance club...)  I was aching for new Linkin Park when this came out, I wasn't disappointed, I own over 300 CDs and I still listen to this one.  If you haven't picked it up, and you are Linkin Park fan, you're insane, it is soooooooo much better than Hybrid Theory.
1400064287|5.0|What a great book! As I was reading this I found myself stopping every so often to relate one of the stories to whoever was sitting around me. Heath & Heath did a nice job making an educational book entertaining. Even their stories are continuing to stick in my head!
185715018X|5.0|This was one of, if not the 1st, mystery novel.  I can't say much for Nicholas Rance's Introduction--I don't agree with much of it though the historical background is of some interest.  The novel is Victorian & does include many attitudes from that era, but Collins (a contemporary & associate of Charles Dickens) also includes a strong-minded woman (Marian) as a major character.  The presentation is a series of chronological statements by various characters--similar to a modern detective interviewing witnesses.  The story is involved, fluid, surprising, engrossing, rewarding, ... & sensational.  It's even better, IMHO, than Wilkie Collins' famous [[ASIN:0375757856 The Moonstone (Modern Library Classics)]].  The characters are interesting.  I don't think there's that much depth to them; they aren't charicatures, but rather living symbols.  Each stays true to his/her core nature throughout the book.  Thus, it takes place on several levels at once.  The telling is masterful & the reader is drawn into the story--with its many twists & turns.  But, the author is, I think, fair to the reader.  He supplies numerous clues sufficiently early to enable one to (with some effort) figure out at least some of what is going on.  Despite some depictions of Fosco as the original evil genius (with considerable truth therein), I think he's a psychopath.  Ignoring movies erroneously portraying psychopathic killers (psychopaths no more killers than anyone else statistically), a psychopath is essentially a person without a conscience.  They only intellectually understand right/wrong, but are often very intelligent.  Fosco's amorality is a key issue in the denouement of this book.  Hartright is his foil--the utterly moral man.  So, I consider this work a wonderful mystery--one of my favorites, up there with Josephine Tey's [[ASIN:0684803860 The Daughter of Time]] & Agatha Christie--as well as something of a cosmic morality contest.  But then, mysteries & detective stories (like most Westerns) are, to an extent, morality plays--at least the good ones.  This is a GREAT one!ns) are, to an extent, morality plays--at least the good ones.  This is a GREAT one!
0060797509|4.0|I was totally surprised by this wonderful little story.  My wife is reading it out loud to our kindergartener and tonight I couldn't find my own book...so when they went to bed, I picked it up.  I didn't put it down until I was finished.  Really, really good tale of childhood and the all-importance of good parenting.
B000E6FSPW|5.0|I bought this soundtrack for the songs played during the Rocky IV training montage...which is perhaps the best sports movie montage ever (Karate Kids \\"You're the Best\\" usually takes the top spot).  I listen while working out and it gets me going every time.  If you're a fan of the movie...or a kid from Philly....you can't go wrong.
0060755598|4.0|The E-Myth Revisited CD set by Michael E. Gerber was long and kind of boring.  But... it has some great ideas and if you can hang in there and take the time to listen, it has many great ideas for any business.<br /><br />I asked a friend of mine that is very successful in business what single book he would recommend, he said E-Myth by Michael E.

He reads a lot of book and is very successful, so I thought I would purchase the CD set to listen while I was driving.<br /><br />It has very good ideas; companies need to put in place systems and processes to be the most successful.

B000N3SRRC|5.0|All Clutch is killer! This album has got more blues in it and I love it. Clutch is such a great party band. They have a great sense of humor. One of my favorites on this record is Riddley Walker. This is a solid rock album that is great from start to finish.
0316010669|4.0|\\"Blink\\" inspires me to listen to my intuition as I pay attention to my initial impulses and not over-think or second-guess myself. Malcolm Gladwell speaks of \\"thin slicing\\" - that first, unexamined \\"intuitive hit\\" that we experience before we start to analyze situations.  Trusting my intuition can be particularly challenging when I have personal agendas that conflict with intuitive information I receive.  I find that my intuitive skill set is easy to access when I am present with any given moment and not lost in my thought process, analyzing every little thing.<br /><br />Another book that has strengthened my intuitive skill-set is Ariel & Shya Kane's \\"Working On Yourself Doesn't Work\\".  It is a brilliant book that has taught me that choices are always appropriate when I don't reach for conclusions based on my past experiences. With their easy & practical principles, I have found a deep sense of ease in my life as I learn to trust my intuition.  Within the realm of wellbeing - intuition blooms!
B00003CX9S|5.0|A movie that truly touches your heart, Mr Merrick is the sweetest person I've ever seen in a movie. It's hard not to cry when you watch this movie. <br />The acting is superb and it's obvious a lot of work was put into the make-up and costumes. This is a must see.
B000O76T8Q|1.0|Dazed and confused!!!!! I feel like I am in the Abyss!!!!! What happened to the Anamorphic? The box cover even states anamorphic? What is Fox up to? I was so excited that all of the advertising for this edition stated anamorphic, but I was left so violated when I discovered that I had yet spent more money for the same version that I had on the 5 star edition. Fox please have someone check this stuff before you fool the public!
0689861141|5.0|I brought this book home because my son liked it at the store.  My husband and I read it...didn't think it was anything great, and hardly read it.  When our son was 12mo. old.  This became his favorite book.  It is very simple. The words are simple and rhyme.  Our son first started acting out the words to books when we started reading this book.  He loves to \\"scrub, scrub, scrub\\" his belly on the bath page, and he show us his muscles on the exercise page.  It is a great book.  He is just turning 2 an still loves it. (along with all of the Sandra Boynton books). <br />It reads...\\"The sun has set not long below...so everybody goes below...to take a bath in one big tub...with soap all over, Scrub, Scrub, Scrub...they hang their towels on the wall, and find pajamas big and small...with some on top and some beneath, the brush, and brush, and brush their teeth, and when the moon is on the rise, they all go up to exercise, and down once more, but not so fast...they're on their way to bed at last...they say good night, and somebody turns off the light.  The moon is high, the sea is deep, the rock, and rock, and rock to sleep.\\"
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I'm gonna keep it short and sweet. I have been a fan since 2001 and have bought all of Dream Theater's CDs and DVDs, and I'm very happy to say that Systematic Chaos is way better than the last three albums (which also rock by the way). Every song ranges from very good to great.<br /><br />Just by the darn thing!
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Interestingly suspenseful story, a compelling drama; about undying love, betrayal, and everything you'd expect in a well acted film that will most definitely keep your attention. View it, you won't be disappointed. I promise.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Ultimately, I would give this a 2.5 stars. <br /> <br />I have been a fan of theirs since there explosion into the music scene in the early 2000's with \\"Hybrid Theory\\". I loved it. When \\"Meteora\\" came out, I was anxious to hear their new album. I loved it. Not counting their 2 other remake albums (which I thought were a waste of time), and their \\"Live from Texas\\" album (I actually liked that one), I can't think of a more highly anticipated album than this one in the past few years. I did not love this. <br /> <br />Where as their previous 2 studio albums had a rapid fire sound, blended with a harmonious beat for songs, this one failed to reach the same level. Musically, you can hear that they are great musicians and have evolved lyrically. But, as a comparison to their previous tries, this one failed to do it for me. <br /> <br />The good: there are several songs on this record that are amazing. \\"Given Up\\" is a raw, emotionally driven song that shows its LP roots, but is a little harder than previous tries. \\"Bleed It Out\\" is a light, happier rock song that has a great beat. \\"Hands Held High\\" was a surprise for me. Softer than the one's I have enjoyed, Mike Shinoda performs an amazing song, even with the political impetus behind it (not a bad thing). \\"No More Sorrow\\" is the last of the songs, with a great solid rock beat. <br /> <br />The bad: everything else on this album. <br /> <br />Overall, shows a musical evolution for the band, but if their desire is to continue down this path, it does not bode well. I understand bands have to grow and \\"evolve\\", other than the few stand out tracks highlighted, I am not too thrilled in that new direction. If you are a fan of their slow, ballady songs, you will like the majority of this album. If you are a fan of their more aggressive tunes, sprinkled with a few slower bits, then you will be, overall, disappointed with this. <br />
075640407X|5.0|As an avid reader and admirer of the scifi/fantasy genres, I am often on the prowl for something that will draw me deep within and keep me on my toes till the next book.  The Name of the Wind is without a doubt on my list of books to read over and over again even when I have new books to be read.  Kvothe is brilliant but full of quirks and flaws that make you wish you could be his friend.   <br /> <br />Normally I'm not a huge fan of the flashback style, but here it is subtly and masterfully used, especially at the conclusion of the story, where a part of the past he has been retelling seems to catch up with him and you keep turning the last page hoping that some words will appear and let you know what the connections are. <br /> <br />A simple synopsis would be that this book is the story of a mysterious man named Kvothe that for some reason has chosen a quiet, slightly hidden life.  Stuff happens and he ends up telling this famous collector of stories his own life story.  This books is Day One of this storytelling, and covers his childhood, how he gets to the University where he will become a legend, and a part of his adventures.  Can't wait for the next one. <br /> <br />This is definitely an author to watch. <br /> <br />
B000ELJBAA|2.0|I was motivated to write this review because of the other over-enthusiastic 5-star reviews that are way out of proportion to how this album is generally viewed by Floyd fans. I actually bought this when it came out; my excitement was soon tempered with disapointment, although I found a few songs on here to love, particularly \\"Murder,\\" which is really the only song on here that might have made it on to a Floyd album when Waters was around (albeit with superior lyrics and sound). \\"Let's Get Metaphysical\\" is a nice instrumental that, of all the tracks here, points to \\"On an Island\\" (Gilmour even quotes it during a solo). \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" is possibly the other bright spot here, although very 80s (not a kind decade for PF). Others seem to really like \\"Near the End\\" a lot, although that song always seemed to me to be underdeveloped and produced all wrong on this album. <br /> <br />Generally, I've found that this album has not aged well at all, while Gilmour's first self-titled release seems much better today than it ever did. Gilmour's first album and his most recent one are down to earth, unforced, and genuine, unlike \\"About Face\\" or the two post-Waters PF releases, which attempted to make the case that Gilmour *IS* Pink. The irony is that he most sounds like PF when he's being authentic and natural. <br /> <br />If you're a PF fan and have never owned this, you'll want it for the tracks I've mentioned. But the real gems are his first album, and \\"On an Island.\\"
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. It's so much better then \\"A Girl Like Me\\" (which I loved) as I love EVERY single track on this one whereas AGLM had a lot of fillers which I always skip. I can listen to \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" right through without skipping one track.<br /><br />The production of this album, the lyrics, even Rihanna's vocals have improved and are all top notch. I instantly loved the album on the first listen.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the outstanding track on the CD to me is \\"Question Existing.\\" This song is absolutely stunning - it has the most awesome lyrics with Rihanna doing a meaningful spoken segment in the middle - \\"I think I'm pretty normal, I laugh, I get mad, I hurt, I think I suck sometimes.\\" This song has a sexy feel and isn't really a ballad, it's more of a midtempo track. Excellent.<br /><br />\\"Sell Me Candy\\" is another favourite of mine. This song is only 2 and a half minutes long but fits a lot in. The lyrics are really random but the song is extremely catchy. The feel of this one is very interesting, I can't put my finger on the genre.<br /><br />\\"Breakin Dishes\\" is a funky little number with definite \\"bad girl\\" lyrics and a very catchy beat. The fast paced nature of the song is just awesome, and it's great to hear an attitude filled Rihanna. I love the bit where she sings about \\"blowin this house down.\\"<br /><br />\\"Lemme Get That\\" is yet another favourite - this song took a couple of listens to grow on me, but all of a sudden it just hit me to how great this song truly is. It's sooooooooooo catchy! The song is about spending her man's money instead of her own and the reggae beat of this track is just infectious (so are the \\"uh uh uh\\"'s at the end). If you don't like this song at first, keep listening, you'll love it before long.<br /><br />\\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is the album's title track and it lives up to the hype. This midtempo track is incredibly cool with great lyrics about being a bad girl. I absolutely love the guitar on thistrack, and the chorus is really catchy.<br /><br />\\"Umbrella\\" was the album's lead single and without a doubt it's Rihanna's best single to date. I loved this instantly, it's just so catchy. I love the \\"ella ella eh eh eh\\" bit in the chorus, it's fun to sing along. I adore the weather inspired lyrics and even Jay Z's rap can't ruin this song.<br /><br />\\"Hate That I Love You\\" is featuring Ne-Yo and is a sweet little track about being so in love with somebody that you hate it. Rihanna and Ne-Yo's voices blend extremely well together, they sound fabulous. This song is quite catchy for a ballad and is worth repeated listenings.<br /><br />\\"Rehab\\" is the album's longest track and a pseudo-ballad. It's ballad by nature but still has a great beat and great opening music. The song is very cool, with a catchy chorus. The length doesn't bother me, the song is over before you know it.<br /><br />\\"Push Up On Me\\" is the album's song about sex, and it seriously works. This is another track that took me awhile to get into, but now I love it. This song has a slight reggae beat but is still pop. Rihanna touches on the subject of sex tastefully and gets a very cool song out of it.<br /><br />\\"Don't Stop The Music\\" reminds me of a track that would have been on Rihanna's last album, it's got the same kind of feel as \\"SOS,\\" but not as good. There's no denying this song is EXTREMELY catchy, I had it in my head for hours at one point. It's fun to sing along to, but isn't one of my favourites.<br /><br />\\"Shut Up & Drive\\" is the next single off this CD, and I honestly believe a better song could have been chosen. It's not that this song isn't good, because it is, it's just I like the rest of the album better. But this song is kind of reminiscent of \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" from the last album in that they're both rocky. This song is very catchy and has cute lyrics about driving.<br /><br />\\"Say It\\" is the album's weakest track, which is saying a lot considering the calibre of the tracks. I don't know what it is, but this song doesn't stand out to me. It's the most RnBish song on the album and sounds like a song that should have been on Rihanna's first album, not her third. The chorus is cute and catchy though, and that saves the track from being totally bad.<br /><br />Top 5 tracks:<br /><br />01. Question Existing<br /><br />02. Lemme Get That<br /><br />03. Sell Me Candy<br /><br />04. Breakin' Dishes<br /><br />05. Good Girl Gone Bad<br /><br />(06. Umbrella)<br /><br />Overall, this album doesn't have any truly bad tracks (Say It is my least favourite but it's still pretty good), nearly every single track is a gem. This album is a definite winner, and it should be a hit. Well done Rihanna, you just keep getting better!
B00005MNP7|5.0|I just bought this album today. I love Blondie but wasn't quite familiar with this album as a whole. What was I thinking? This one sounds way more mature than Parallel Lines. Production-wise it's pretty amazing. It's got some agressive tracks like Eat to the Beat (sounds truly punkish) and some haunting ones like Sheyla (awesome song). A lot of the songs were big singles, but even those that were not are outstanding. I don't feel that's the case with Parallel Lines (Fade Away and Radiate is the only one i feel should've been a single). So, if you like that record you will be blown away by this one.
B000002TPS|4.0|Youthanasi is an album of very consistent metal. Again produced by Mustaine and Max Norman it trundles alonb at a mixture of speeds and once more addresses a range of issues. Such intelligent and trend ignoring music not only shows the bands muse not waning but also contines the bands quality period as this album is assuredly better than anything pre Rust.. However it is also most assurdly not in the same masterclass as Rust and Countdown.<br /><br />My personal favourite tunes here would include lead cut Reckoning Day and Train of Consequences for having plenty of the fire musically that we've come to expect plus the intellectual aspect as well. Elysian Fields and The Killing Road both show the band at their most melodic, riding riffs that complement the rhythm section. Other tunes that pass the test (IMHO) would be Addicted to Chaos and Blood of Heroes, the former a particularly brooding slow burner of a metal number but perhaps not to everyones tastes.<br /><br />More middling metal in terms of quality is A Tout Le Monde which for all the fanfare at the time doesn't really work. Nor does the title track. Both are salveable for Megadeth diehards as something a touch different in particular the former. And the great playing on this CD (with restraint added to the formula) and the fact the booklet contains full lyrics to the shebang is also nice.<br /><br />Fairly rubbish tunes are on this album alas, these basically being the final three tracks. Album closer Victory is at least in posession of an idea which is to make extensive use of previous Megadeth song titles to form much of the lyrics. Also to be noted is it's defiant yet uplifting tone which doesn't happen that often on Megadeth albums.<br /><br />This is a good album of sturdy metal not without flaws. The production and interesting players not to mention the bands history all work towards making this a four star album despite some dodgy tracks. Megadeth fans probably already own this - newcomers should pick up Rust in Pieces and Countdown to Extinction first and then move onwards to this.<br /><br />By the way early editions sometimes had a bonus disc of 6 live tunes - great extra value if you can track it down.uld pick up Rust in Pieces and Countdown to Extinction first and then move onwards to this. <br /> <br />By the way early editions sometimes had a bonus disc of 6 live tunes - great extra value if you can track it down.
B000068R1X|4.0|Bark at the Moon holds a sentimental value to me. It was one of the first albums I had listened to growing up and where my love for music started. I thank my brother for playing this LP for me that day and turning me on to Ozzy Osbourne and his music at 10 years old. <br /> <br />Now I look back at Bark at the Moon 24 years later and my feelings haven't changed much. I still think this is a great record despite all of the hardships Ozzy was suffering through at the time it was being made - dealing with the loss of Randy Rhoads, his issues with drink/drugs, the battles with his record company coupled with the Alamo incident and the bat/dove head fiascos just to name a few. The album is probably one of Ozzy's darkest and the most melancholy album he has made. You can even hear it in his voice on some of the songs.  <br /> <br />This review is only for the 1983 8-song CD on CBS that I currently and proudly own.  I have heard the two bonus tracks that are on the 2002 version but not the rest of this album remaster (or remix as some have labeled it). The band who plays on this album are: Jake E. Lee - guitars, Bob Daisley - bass, Don Airey - keyboards, and Tommy Aldridge - drums. I'll review these tunes along with the rest of the Bark at the Moon LP (from 1 to 10): <br /> <br />1. Bark at the Moon: The first single and the most popular song from the album and has become a classic not only on classic rock radio but is still played at Ozzy's concerts to this day. The video was awesome seeing Ozzy as a werewolf when the moon came out. The most up-tempo song on Bark... I love the vocal effects in Ozzy's voice and Jake E. Lee's riffs and solos are just stellar. I love it. An absolute 10. <br /> <br />2. You're No Different: One of two ballads on the album. Very creepy bass line by Bob and keyboards by Don. This is a song about people who talk down about someone to make themselves feel big but in reality they really are no different and have flaws within them like everyone else. Really mellow number. Might be interesting to hear the 2002 version of this song because I read where someone said it's much longer and doesn't fade out like my version does. I like it. A lot. A 9. <br /> <br />3. Now You See It (Now You Don't): A mid-tempo rocker with some weird synthesizers thrown in by Don. What is with Ozzy's grunting and warbling towards the end? Must've been a bad day at the studio. My least favorite song on the album but it's tolerable. I give it a five. <br /> <br />4. Rock 'N' Roll Rebel: This one is Ozzy's revenge song against the reporters, church groups and parents who thought Ozzy at the time was a bad influence for kids and had Satanic overtones in his music. No matter what is said or printed, Ozzy stands his ground and keeps making the music that he likes. A nice number. Jake is the highlight here with his solos. I rate it an 8. <br /> <br />5. Centre of Eternity: Ahh...the bell tolling with the \\"monk chant\\" in the beginning and then just takes off. This must be the fastest song for Ozzy to fit all of the words in the verses, that is. A good song. The beginning part is cool but that's it. To me, an average rocker. 6. <br /> <br />6. So Tired: The second ballad and the 2nd single from Bark at the Moon and probably the most mellow song Ozzy has ever done. There's hardly any guitars at all in this but I still enjoy this song. Don Airey does a wonderful job with the keyboards and piano on this tune. I mentioned earlier about Ozzy on this album singing with a lot of heartache and anguish in his voice and especially in this song it shows. Still a great number for Ozzy. Nine points. <br /> <br />7. Slow Down: As the title suggests, a number about people who are always on the go, multi-tasking, etc. and need to just simply slow down their workload and relax. A nice mid-tempo rocker. I like the keyboard part at the end before the fade out. 7/10. <br /> <br />8. Waiting for Darkness: In my eyes, this song is one of the true highlights on Bark at the Moon besides the title track. What a way to close the album out. Don's 16th note keyboards plus Jake's guitars to provide the off beat rhythm Tommy lays down. LOVE THE ENDING. This should've been a hit too. Ozzy shines on this track. A 10. <br /> <br />Here are the 2002 bonus tracks that I have heard from an import CD I have called the Secret Songs: <br /> <br />Spiders: Off-beat drums coupled with Bob's trippy bass line to go with a dark guitar sound by Jake. Very weird song by Ozzy but it's a hit to me: 10/10. <br /> <br />One Up the B-Side: Average song, nothing special. Filler. Four out of ten. <br /> <br />Although Bark at the Moon is not well received by many of Ozzy's fans due to the overwhelming keyboards/synths that flood this album, I still think it's worth the money to pick up. As I stated before, I don't know how the 2002 version is so I can't really comment on it. If you don't want the 2002 remaster and are looking for the original 1983 release like I have or the 1995 remaster (includes Spiders only) you should still be able to find them on Amazon (or eBay) cheap even though these versions are now out of print.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: If you are expecting the album to be like Blizzard or Diary, look elsewhere. But if you are a fan of Ozzy's post-Randy Rhoads work and like keyboards meshed in with metal, you won't be displeased. Bark at the Moon is still a CD that holds its own despite the dark overtones that to me reflect everything Ozzy was going through at the time of the album's writing and recording process. A sentimental release I still treasure in my collection to this day. Thank you Ozzy. This has been a 4 star review.
B000002V0Q|5.0|In a world where many bands trundle away for years without ever having an utter masterpiece (Gamma Ray, Primal Fear, Exodus etc etc etc) Mustaines machine produced two such albums back to back. After Rust in Peace blew most of the competition out of the water the band unleashed this. Once again Megadeth have steered clear of hysterical thrash to construct metal of the most pure alloy. Countdown is a batch of songs that are different to the tunes on Rust.. - which makes it's quality even more of an achievement and a track by track synopsis would be;<br /><br />1- Skin of My Teeth:- A blasting opening tune of metallic fury with aggression, written from the point of view of someone quite obviously unhinged with a bit of gore thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />2- Symphony of Destruction:- A slow burn metal number, not a personal ode such as the first track was. In fact it addresses a more general and darker concept applicable to corporate as well as government organisations.<br /><br />3- Architecture of Aggression:- A direct follow on from the previous track in terms of being a cynical look at power and it's corrupting influence. High brow concept with killer execution.<br /><br />4- Foreclosure of a Dream:- Apparently inspired by Dave Ellefsons parents having the band foreclose on their property, this is mentally very heavy stuff. Musically the chorus rides a tasty groovy in direct juxtaposition to what the song is about.<br /><br />5- Sweating Bullets:- On this tune Megadeth have continued the slower structures prevalent on much of this album. It explains the subject of mental illness and the protagonist is a slightly nastier type of person than the narrator of Anthrax' Madhouse tune. Not a tune for the mentally feint of heart.<br /><br />6- This Was My Life:- Yet more mental disintegration though you don't necessarily want it to stop. Introspection here from the point of view of a killer but whereas in '85 Mustaine probably would of spiced it up with some gore or just brutality here he throws in the angle of the killers crime being the result of passion which adds a human dimension to proceedings.<br /><br />7- Countdown to Extinction:- The title track to the album addresses hunting, extinction and conservation themes and rails against senseless killing. Nuff said.<br /><br />8- High Speed Dirt:- A less intellectual tune here, this track is in posession of perhaps the most syncrhomeshed guitar work on the album and is a straight ahead metal stomper. Which by this stage of proceedings is a welcome relief.<br /><br />9- Psychotron:- More blazing metal here as the band blast through a semi sci-fi number with, once again, mental illness undertones. A song with a clipped musicaly style that speeds along to it's conclusion.<br /><br />10- Captive Honor:- A look at imprisonment and unlike the idiotic gangsta rap genre here Megadeth look down at both the criminal and the dehumanising gaol experience with no sympathy for either party.<br /><br />11- Ashes in Your Mouth:- Probably the least impressive tune on the album, as the title implies it's an anti-war diatribe.<br /><br />All up this Mustaine + Max Norman produced album isa strong challenger for best Megadeth album, one of 92's best hard albums and pretty much universally regarded as a metal classic. And for good reason.e throws in the angle of the killers crime being the result of passion which adds a human dimension to proceedings. <br />7- Countdown to Extinction:- The title track to the album addresses hunting, extinction and conservation themes and rails against senseless killing.

B000N6U0E2|4.0|The Pursuit of Happyness, set in San Francisco in 1981, is based on the one-year struggle of Chris Gardner, a self made millionaire, had with being homeless and constantly trying to find a shelter for his son and himself while working an internship at Dean Witter. This movie is based on the autobiography of Chris Gardner. His book illustrated his abusive childhood and growing up in an atmosphere lacking love and never seeing his father. Gardner pledged to become a father of love and care for his children. After encountering many hardships, Gardner finally succeeded in the business world. But as a docudrama, this movie oversimplifies the complex issues of race and never explained why such a genuine man could suffer so much, why so many blacks were wandering aimlessly seeking for a shelter and portraying black wives as bitter and heartless women. <br /> <br />Will smith stars as Chris Gardner, and Jaden Smith (Will Smith's son) is Chris Gardner's son. Will smith does a flawless performance in showing one man's reach for the impossible dream. He becomes Chris Gardner and suffered the hardships. It seems as though this movie is set in the attempt of preparing Will Smith for yet another Oscar Nomination with his preparations for the movie such as growing out a beard and bringing in his own son. His performance with his son Jaden sparked the real fatherhood and the love a man has for his own son. In the scenes of suffering, one can see in the eyes of Will Smith, his fatherly love, rather than trying to find emotion with a professional child actor. Especially in the scene when smith screams at his son for wanting Captain America back. The mix of frustration, coldness and love showed through his eyes and pierced the hearts of the audience. Thandie Newton stars as Chris Gardner's wife Linda, who shows the bitterness and craziness a woman working double shifts as a hotel struggling to live with her own husband. <br /> <br />An interesting character also appears at the end ofthe movie as Christopher ells his knock knock jokes. The real Chris Gardner appears and nods at Smith. This is a successful crossover of reality and the persona of Gardner because it blends together the real and the fictional. <br /> <br />But it seem as though this film is produced for Will Smith rather than produced being an accurate docudrama and making the audience feel the motions of a guy trying to pursue happiness despite his harsh environment. Although in Chris Gardner's autobiography he actually encounters countless hardships and finally succeeds, when put into a film it feels as though it may be a bit too cliché for a man to run into worse and worse situations, overcoming them and finally succeeding in becoming a self-made millionaire. <br /> <br />Most of the movie, we see Smith chasing hippies and old people over a Density Bone Scanner, and by the end of the movie, it seems a though these are the scenes we remember and less of the hardships he encounters. More emphasis should have been put into creating the realistic atmosphere where Gardner becomes devastated by his circumstances and his frustrations. One of the only times we encounter and feel his uneasiness is when he is in the phone booth calling his wife and she tells him she's leaving. Without much explanation provided to allow the audience to further connect with him, Gardner becomes just another black man suffering on the streets with the countless others and luckily brought on screen to show the world. <br /> <br />Most of the debate though, lies in the oversimplification on the issues of racism and poverty of blacks. In the film when Gardner and his son are running in Glide Church, blacks were portrayed as aimlessly circling the streets and waited for a place to go. This film doesn't provide an explanation as to why they are. Blacks in San Francisco were constantly discriminated against in the 1970s, making lives extremely cruel for them. It was difficult for them to find decent work besides domestic labor and there was a major influx of African Americans into San Francisco to find jobs in the wartime industry. <br /> <br />It seems as though this movie undermines the situation when showing Gardner's successful ob interview without a suit or tie, covered in paint and previously spending a night in jail. Although the aimlessly wandering blacks were there partially to portray the reality, the audiences have no connection or clue as to what the situation in the 1970s was like. The movie is made as though 1970s was a prosperous and integrating time. But in reality, 1970s was plagued by stagflation, which is high inflation and high unemployment rates. But if the audience did not know their history, blacks may just seem like a bunch of homeless people wandering around the streets. Perhaps showing short scenes of other blacks struggling to find jobs and being rejected would've made this a better docudrama. <br /> <br />Gardner's story is supported to be one that inspires youngsters to never give up and stay strong. But in reality, the series of events that happened within the two hours of the movie actually happened within a relative number of years. This two hour packed portrayal of Gardner's life distorted Chris Gardner's life and makes it an inaccurate account of Chris Gardner's life. Gardner became a multi-millionaire who is an influential speaker and who continues to help people with his own power. The director seems to have focused too much on piecing together a well-rounded character that he forgot to put in the edges to Chris Gardner such as his hobbies and what he plays with his son so that we, the audience, can connect to. <br /> <br />This movie is of a black man's simple life and a struggle to reach for the impossible. There were some times when we could feel the love between Gardner and his son, but by the end of the movie, one already feels too tired from the chasing of the Density Bone Scanner and anger from the distorted life of Chris Gardner that we don't become inspired by the actual story of a man trying to pursue happiness. <br />
B00004VXF2|3.0|First time was White Light/White Heat...next was   <br />quitting the velvets. <br /> <br />And then there came Metal Machine Music. <br /> <br />I've listened to parts of this record a number of times and have always felt something different each time. However I believe like most \\"art\\", it was meant to affect different people in different ways. And it might never affect you the same way twice. Think Nine Inch Nails meets John Cage meets MC5 meets LaMont Young. And I don't mean just bits of those artists separately and the influences thereof, but rather all of them playing simultaneously at extreme ear shattering volume. The affect of listening to this on headphones is enough to inflict psychotic reaction. It is NOT music to do housework to. Unless that housework involves demolition.  <br /> <br />Having said that, I also believe that MMM was recorded for 1 specific reason. Lou was trying to \\"clear the air\\" of all the quote, unquote \\"sally can't dance, your rock 'n'roll animal\\". Which I think means all the fans of those records and others like them. He was casting those fans aside much the same way that Little Richard threw his jewels in the river or Brian Wilson stopped recording and writing music at the height of his popularity. All probably felt a certain amount of pressure, both from record companies as well as the fans to keep churning out the same product over and over with new and different wrapping.  <br />Many times that gets to be the disillusionment of rock stars. The need to sell \\"product\\" as opposed to creating music that means something and has relevance to themselves and their fans. The rock music world rises, falls and changes much too quickly for most stars to retain their shine and fans become impatient for their favorite star to produce the next music masterpiece that resembles and continues the original greatness that they achieved early in their career.  <br /> <br />Most groups or even solo artists don't make it past 2 or 3 records because thefanbase moves on to newer, shinier versions. So what Lou did was to circumvent the eventual fanbase collapse and took an axe to his own career by releasing quite possibly the most unlistenable record ever produced. And just to make sure the destruction was complete he recorded 4 sides of it and put a cover on that made it seem like this might be a live recording to entice those leftover Rock'n'roll Animal fans. Lou knew that the shine on his star was quickly becoming faded and felt he still had much more creativity to sell, so he destroyed himself publicly, and then quickly re-invented himself with a new record label and new, self-controlled image. At the same time he was recording and releasing MMM he was planning a major career move to take control of the production and release of his music, instead of leaving it to the whims of the record company and the producers that were assigned to him, as happened early in his career.  <br />I, for one, preferred Lou Reed music with a capable producer such as Bob Ezrin or David Bowie that knew what Lou Reed music should sound like, better than Lou knew himself. But alas, Lou thought he knew better so we have a dozen or so records of Lou's music post-MMM that sounds and feels like someone that can write great songs but doesn't necessarily comprehend how they should sound.  <br /> <br />Be that as it may, I would recommend this record only to those brave souls who enjoy the sound of the death and subsequent re-birth of a rock star. It is most assuredly not a pretty sound, and more than likely harkens to Lou Reed's personal recollections of horrors of eletro-shock thereapy which he, himself endured as a young man at the insistence of his parents, mixed in with drug abuse, alcoholism and all the \\"friends\\" and nightmares he formed throughout his life at that time.  <br /> <br />Clearing the air sometimes requires total annihilation and Lou Reed certainly achieved that with this record. You have now been forewarned. Proceed at your own risk, because there's a wasteland here with no happy ending.  <br /> <br />editor's note ( this is a continuation of a previous review by the same reviewer under a different name. And should not be considered plagiarism).
0060523808|4.0|Throughout this book Gerstner discusses the changes IBM made and how he helped turned the company around. I have no doubt that he was a large part of the dynamic shift at IBM to again make it the successful, global company that it is today, but I felt that I went through the book without completely understanding what those changes were. There was a lot of discussion of how IBM was operated and managed when Gerstner took control of the company in 1993 as it was falling apart before the public's eyes, and there was a lot of explanation of how IBM was successful and reborn when he stepped down from the CEO position in 2002. But there was little substance in between. I am not sure if that is because the day-to-day steps taken throughout the mid and late 1990s are too mundane for the average business reader, of if the details were just left out. Gerstner does share some insight into leadership skills and his management style, but IBM as is left in the shadows. All in all, this is not a bad book, but be aware that the reader is left wondering exactly how IBM regained its dominant position in the marketplace.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|The idea to write a darker and experimental album like Systematic Chaos is a great follow up to Dream Theater's last album Octavarium, which was more subdued and conservative. The haunting and crushing melodies are provocative and interesting. Excluding \\"Constant Motion\\" and \\"Prophets of War\\" there is a very cohesive feel and theme among the songs on this album. Damnation, horror, regret and demonic fantasy are among the themes throughout. It would have been much better if the artwork of the album reflected these main themes. Ants among an urban jungle of highway overpasses doesn't seem to fit. The title of the album doesn't seem to fit very well either. If only they had a more cohesive presentaion by excluding songs that did not fit and replacing them with a couple more horror filled fantasy songs, while gelling the musical themes with the artwork and title of the album I would have given it 5 stars. Even with these shortcoming this album is another great addition.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Never been a huge Bond guy, even though I've seen most of them at one time or another. The Connery films were always the best to me. However, this movie is really something special.  It's a great reboot for the franchise, much like Batman Begins was.  Being a Bond film, it's never going to be realistic by any stretch, but this one forgoes all the crazy gadgets (cloaking devices, windsurfing on glacial meltwater, etc.) for current technology.  Most importantly, the new Bond, Daniel Craig, is great.  This guy is channeling Steve McQueen.  Imagine Steve McQueen as Bond.  It's even got a Cincinnati Kid sequence for a centerpiece. Cool.
B00005JKC3|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie. I love the Hulk and after the success of X-Men and Spiderman (two excellent comic book movies) I was begining to think Marvel wouldn't let them put out a bad movie. Well, they did. It drags, the plot is incoherent, it just plain sucks. It may be the perfect cure for insomnia...
B0002O0CM0|5.0|Great albums for their time and truly amazing that The Doors could produce two quality albums without legendery Jim Morrision who died a year prior. Robby & Ray can sing. WOW. MY doors collection is complete.
B00002DEGZ|2.0|First of all the playing by all parties is impeccable.  Nothing else to say about that. My only complaint, and it's a big one, is that the volume/presence of the fortepiano is WAY TOO WEAK compared to the orchestra. It is virtually impossible to listen to this in the car for when the orchestra is at a comfortable volume the fortepiano is all but muted, and if you want to hear the fortepiano then the orchestra blows the speakers out. One may argue that one should listen to these with great attention with a real stereo system, but given that that isn't always possible (I drive 2-3 hours a day, and that's when I have a chance to feed my melomania) I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the sound mix of these otherwise technically superb CDs, especially given that it wasn't cheap. :)
1892005034|4.0|A friend recommended Nonviolent Communication to me, after seeing how much I enjoyed Crucial Conversations. I was at first skeptical, but wound up being completely won over by Marshal Rosenberg's theories. Crucial Conversations is a cookbook of communication techniques that usually work... Whereas Nonviolent Communication goes much deeper into the fundamentals of human nature -- needs, desires, observations, judgment, empathy -- and helps you understand why these techniques work.<br /><br />I'd recommend seeing Rosenberg in person, and using this book as a reference. Despite a legion of worshipers, he's incredibly pragmatic and down-to-earth. In contrast, this book feels a bit new-agey. Some of the sample dialog is a bit contrived, and it could use a better quick-reference. However, his whimsical style certainly helps you remember what's important.<br /><br />The real-life stories and dialogs were amazing! He can communicate effectively with a couple having marriage problems, psychopathic killers, gangs, warlords, or even someone in a near catatonic state. Empathy is the key: once somebody feels that you understand them, and that you are trying to feel what they feel, then they will be more more likely to speak honestly with you to resolve conflict. Empathy trumps psychology every time. However, it also requires you to suspend all judgment that the other person is a monster -- merely another human being trying to fulfill their needs in the only way they know how.<br /><br />The rules behind nonviolent communication are simple, and believable, but the application is extremely difficult. Our brains are wired for survival, not dialog. If I were speaking to a psychopath, the last thing on my mind would be his needs! However, Marshall gives several examples on how empathy is the most effective weapon when you want to defuse a dangerous situation.<br /><br />Its instinctive to make snap judgments when we feel threatened. It takes a lot of courage and practice to do what Marshall does... I can only hope to be half as good as him.o what Marshall does... I can only hope to be half as good as him.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|I received an advance copy of the disc a few weeks ago, so I've had time to really listen to the album and let it settle in.  I'm not going to analyze every song because that is going to be done to death by everyone else.   <br /> <br />I was not a huge fan of Train of Thought and Octavarium.  I thought both albums had moments of brilliance, but was marred by sub-par lyrics and rehashed themes.  I am happy to say that this album sees DT back getting back in form.  While not quite equal to the lyrical brilliance of Voices, Change of Seasons, Learning to Live, etc, it's a step in the right direction.  Prophets of War is still a little preachy, but not nearly as annoying as the \\"Who would do this to our people\\" chorus in Sacrificed Sons.  Also, some of the songs take on a more mythological element....not usually into that, but I respect them for exploring new themes and appreciate that they are more along the lines of Rush (2112, Cygnus, etc) as opposed to the cheesiness of Symphony X or Dragon Force) <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fantastic album and is worth the purchase for Repentance alone (my favorite DT song since Space Dye Vest!)
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|This is Rihanna's best album ever. I thought this CD wasn't going to be good at all but I can say its awesome. It's better then Music Of The Sun & A Girl Like Me & I liked both of thoses albums. Rihanna is a hit with her hot sexy image and music towards teens and adult. I like all the songs on the cd. I really like Letme Get That it feels like Let Me On Music Of The Sun. Rehab is another song I like alot it talks alot about problems that cause relationships to crash and sometimes one of the people in the relationship has to go to rehab to get everything out of their heads. love that song. Umbrella love that #1 hit it's so true of if your close to a friend or your girl or boy friend. you can always relay on them to be there. Like the Jay-Z  Version and I like the Lil Mama (Remix). Shut up and drive is a great song to when you first hear it you might say wow its weird like umbrella but when you hear it again your going to like it alot. Hate That I Love You is a song featuring Ne-Yo its a good love song just saying that she love him so much that they wish their never met good song. Please Don't Stop The Music should be a hit like SOS it has the dance type of music. Existing Question is a really good slow song. Rihanna just is wondering who she can trust with her life and people she can't. Sell Me Candy is pretty good too its a little faster song. Just remember Rihanna's new image means its going to be new music. It's very different when you first hear it but when you listen to it again the second time around. Your going to love the album.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|With Dream Theater, you never know exactly what to expect going into a new CD as each one of their albums has been different than any previous. Going into Systematic Chaos, I was ready for anything, but hoping for more heavy stuff than their previous release Octavarium. This CD does not dissapoint hard core DT fans. Songs like Constant Motion and The Dark Eternal Night show a much darker side of Dream Theater than anything they've done in their 21 year history. The album is not with out its ballads as Repentence, which is the 4th in their ongoing saga about the 12 steps to recovery, is a very Pink Floyd-esque, and very dark ballad. It's good to know that some bands can still deliver the goods after more than 20 years of making music together. This brings us to the DVD. The making of is incredibly insightfull and gives us a glimps of what goes into making a Dream Theater album. I rated this 5 stars because that's the highest it would go, but it deserves 11.
B000MR9D5E|1.0|Though this series is great, I am returning it for the second time because the 2nd disk has issues with freezing and skipping.  I thought maybe it was our player, but I have tried with other players with the same results.  Very, very annoying.
1401307787|5.0|So you're a human... You want to learn to be more at peace, have less stress in your life, be more alive, enjoy life more, be more loving to the wife or kids... etc....<br /><br />This is the book to read.<br /><br />Even if you don't want to sit and meditate every day or every other day you should read this book. It shows how you can \\"meditate\\" while doing every day tasks like washing dishes or cleaning the house or just walking to the bathroom, etc...<br /><br />And why is this important? Because it helps you get in touch with the Now moment, to live fully in the Present. And that is what this book is about, and what will make your life better.<br /><br />This book is great! I don't know what happened between this and his book \\"Coming To Our Senses\\", but the other book is very wordy, very incohesive, and generally not that good. THIS book, however, is a gem, and I truly wish I could get all my friends and family members to at least read it.<br /><br />But they will not, and I suppose that is only fitting, as one has to come to something like this on one's own. You are reading this review. That means you are ready. You won't find a better book on the hows and whys of meditation and mindfulness. And you won't find a better way to reduce stress and come alive and be more at peace within yourself and in the world.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I love this cd.  Especially Forsaken.  Great song!!  Is it just me, or does the intro to Repentance sound like Forty Six & 2 by Tool?

0743298020|4.0|Some elements of this book felt rather V.C. Andrews to me because they were so lurid.  However, it was a very interesting tale within a tale and the characters are quite intriguing.  The tone is very gothic and that made the novel seem a bit strange at times as the modern language was a bit jarring in contrast with the tone.  The resolution, though, was very satisfying and the novel made for quite a page-turner.

1400063515|4.0|Here is a book that tweaks the nose of all who have come to believe that if something has happened consistently in the past that it will continue to happen consistently in the future, in ways that are predictable and explainable.<br /><br />The author, who has also written the acclaimed, Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets, says that is not necessarily so. And in this book, he shows many occasions and gives some explanations of why that is not necessarily so. In fact, Taleb says, unexpected, unanticipated, surprising things can and do happen. They take us beyond the conclusions and anticipations we formulate for ourselves, be it in the world of economics or in life in general. Taleb calls these unexpected events black swans.<br /><br />Taleb tells the reader that black swans can happen. Some totally unexpected event can happen and change all our plans, send us scrambling for new solutions, theories, arguments and even new ways to describe what has been heretofore unknown. He says this happens to the ordinary person and to the great thinkers--or most of them.<br /><br />As he says, \\"Go through the following exercise. Look into your own existence. Count the significant events, the technological changes, and the inventions that have taken place in our environment since you were born and compare them to what was expected before their advent. How many of them came on a schedule? Look into your own personal life, to your choice of profession, say, or meeting your mate, your exile from your country of origin, the betrayals you faced, your sudden enrichment or impoverishment. How often did these things occur according to plan?\\" (xix)<br /><br />Taleb says that black swans can have disastrous effect upon people--this is the idea that surprises are usually bad. He does admit that on a less frequent basis black swans can bring about positive consequences.<br /><br />Taleb says that there is no way to predict when black swans will happen. Nor can we say if black swans will happen. Also, Taleb maintains that after a black swan occurs, there is no way for us to know why they happened.<br /><br />Perhaps the best idea behind Taleb's hypothesis is that there are limits to what we can conclude by what we can observe and what we can repeat by experimentation. Perhaps the most challenging thing about his book is that such not-yet-observed and non-provable events do happen. It is a challenge for those who have been trained in the sciences, where observation and repetition are the ground of scientific effort, that is: methodical thinking directed toward finding regulative connections between our sensual experiences.<br /><br />The book suggests that we should think smarter than we do.

B00062ZE58|5.0|I've heard only a few songs from Within Temptation and had avoided them for years after. They didn't gain much attention from me because I wasn't impressed by what I heard (I was expecting a bombastic first impression). I was wrong to do so because I took a listen to them again not too long ago by watching the video for \\"Memories\\" and I became highly interested in them. I downloaded \\"Jillian\\" and after hearing an awesome intro, I was enraptured completely. I ordered this cd without hearing the rest of the tracks. I rarely do such a thing. \\"Pale\\" and \\"Memories\\" are gems. <br /> <br />This album has a high range of hauntingly imaginative atmosphere that few bands, Leaves' Eyes in particular, can produce. While having a solid theme to this album, W.T. put various emotions and atmospheres into each song. This is a good trait because it keeps us interested for a long time and usually has the listener repeating the tracks. Why didn't I see this sooner? I am always eager to hear different bands and different material. <br /> <br />This will go into my ever growing music collection. <br />I recommend Leaves' Eyes because, they too, are able to grow on to the listener, while keeping them in a prolonged trance. I regret the fact that I have avoided this band. Might I also mention that Sharon actually does have a wonderful voice. I have another lady to grace my tons of Anneke Van Giersbergen, Liv Kristine, and Cristina Scabbia vocal contributions.
B000BT97AO|1.0|This movie was flat and had been done before in any number of mediums.  Its poor production values and superficalness made it the kind of film that was far too easy to just turn off and not bother coming back.<br /><br />The conflict between the daughter and her family was interesting but the rest of the movie was so predictable and so riddled with archetypal characters that it was ultimately an unfulfilling watch.
0618551050|5.0|Lee Smolin perceives 5 big problems in today's physics: quantum gravity, the foundations of quantum mechanics, the unification of particles and laws, the values of the free constants and dark matter and dark energy. <br />Of those 5 problems string theory proposes a solution for only one of them: the unification of particles and laws. However, the theory cannot be tested with our current technology. For the author it is a dead end, because a theory which is not subject to experiment can never fail, but can never succeed either. Into the bargain, string theory is background-dependent and not background independent like Einstein's general theory of relativity, where the geometry of space is not part of the laws of nature. <br />Lee Smolin launches a frontal attack on the dictatorship of string theorists in universities, because they are grabbing nearly all funds for fundamental research and are making a laughing stock of its opponents. <br /> <br />He proposes 3 basic ideas for a successful approach of quantum gravity: space is emergent, everything in the universe is discrete and causality is fundamental for its description. <br />A far better theory than superstrings is loop (formed by field lines) quantum gravity, which is background-independent. The theory could mean that the universe existed before the Big Bang. But, its main problem is to find a way to unfreeze time (to represent time without turning it into space). <br /> <br />Lee Smolin's book is a goldmine for those wanting to know more about the current state of physics. <br />Making us more humble, he tells us that we only know 4 % of the universe, because 26 % of it is dark matter and 70 % dark energy. <br />He explains clearly the gauge theory (all properties of a force can be determined by symmetries)  or the importance of spontaneous symmetry breaking, proving that the properties of the elementary particles depend in part on history and environment. <br /> <br />This book is a must read for all those interested in the world we live in. <br />
B00003CXI1|4.0|Now here's something you don't see every day - a movie that is faithful to the book.<br /><br />11 year old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is an orphan living with his uncle and aunt.  They treated him barely better then a servant.<br /><br />All that changes one day when he finds out that he's a wizard.  Suddenly, he's introduced to a world that he doesn't know yet where he's famous.  Before it all really sinks in, he's off to Hogwarts for his first year of schooling in the art of magic.<br /><br />There, he makes friends with Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).  But he also makes enemies in the form of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), a snobbish student.  He evens seems to have attracted the negative attention of one of the teachers.<br /><br />But under all the fun, a serious danger lurks.  And Harry is stumbling upon the pieces.  Will he figure it out?  What can an inexperienced wizard do against overwhelming powers?<br /><br />This movie was my introduction to Harry's world.  Now I'm going back and watching it again after having read the books.  I was pleased to see just how faithful it really was to the story.  It tried to stay as true as it could to the book.  The set, costumes, and special effects all worked well to bring the world of the books to vivid life.<br /><br />But that faithfulness is also the movie's downfall.  Outside of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, none of the characters get much in the way of development.  Additionally, the story takes a while to really get going.  This is a flaw with the book as well, so I can't blame this only on the movie.<br /><br />Even with those complaints aside, it's wonderful to see this imaginative series brought to such vivid and accurate life.  Fans of the books will be pleased.
0689861133|5.0|My daughter received this book when she was just a few months old. She is now almost 2, and has the book memorized. She can recite it from memory! She loves this book and we read it almost every day. She likes to point to the animals at the end while I make the noise they make. this was the very first book she could read on her own. we just adore it!
0316168815|4.0|I hardly ever read books when they are first released. I always seem to be a few years behind, for whatever reason. Sometimes this works to my advantage, as it allows me to avoid a degree of hype that surrounds certain books. I do remember seeing the blue cover of The Lovely Bones on shelves in every bookstore when it was released a few years ago and seeing mentions on best-sellers lists. But I didn't take much interest in it because, sometimes, when a book/movie/album gets so many rave reviews, I'll expect it to blow me through the roof and will end up disappointed when it's only mildly entertaining or moving (see: The Time Traveler's Wife). <br /> <br />I prefer to go in with low expectations and let myself be surprised with greatness. Not that I'm a bitter person or anything. Not at all. Ok, I'm working on it. <br /> <br />Anyway, I was visiting my tiny local library for the first time, searching for a book to check out, when I saw the blue spine peaking out from the shelf. Since I had already read the few classics they had in stock, and don't really go for Harlequin romance, I took Alice Sebold home with me. Much to my surprise, I finished the book in a day's time.  <br /> <br />It wasn't so much Sebold's writing style, which is good but not spectacular, or even the tinges of mystery in the plot that captivated me. It was the raw human emotion that she so perfectly conveyed through each character. The characters felt real--both their positive qualities and their shortcomings. The pain, confusion, regret, and maybe even hope that they each felt in their own ways really impacted me.  <br /> <br />The Lovely Bones is the story of a young girl who is raped and murdered in her neighborhood. She speaks to the reader from her version of heaven (it can be different for each person), and looks over her family as they unravel after the tragic event. Perhaps it had something to do with my already delicate state (I was home sick while reading) but the book managed to make me cry. More than once. I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that, and the book snob in me would prefer to believe I am \\"above\\" sentimental plot devices, but to be honest--the book is just really sad. <br /> <br />I also liked the subtle message of hope that carries through the novel, without reading like a \\"Chicken Soup\\" book. The ending isn't the overly hokey \\"I will survive\\" type, and still has a shade of melancholy, but seems to say that even through utter grief and personal devastation, life goes on.
0312305060|5.0|I loved the movie The Hours, so when I learned that it was also a novel I purchased it immediately, I am so thankful that I did. The movie was good but the novel allowed me to enter the lives of these women without the limitations of the big screen.  I have since passed this book onto my girlfriends and even my mother, all who have loved it as well.
0385491026|5.0|Simply put, I worship this book.  <br />  <br />Cat's Eye follows the controversial painter Elaine as she reflects upon her childhood and younger years when she returns to Toronto (the city of her youth) for a retrospective of her works. Her reflections stir up memories of friendship, longing, betrayal, love, hate, and pain. Especially haunting are her memories of Cordelia, a childhood friend with whom she had a complex relationship. It is a truly brilliant story, so completely well-written and beautiful that I just wanted to read certain sentences over and over again. Her story also rouses intense emotions in the reader, as we can all unearth memories of childhood friendships gone awry, awkward teenage years, and failed love.  <br /> <br />Elaine finds she needs to mourn her past in order to get through the present. Her past is so achingly realistic and personal, that you can't help but empathize and contemplate your own personal grief. That's not to say the book is fully depressing; instead, I would say that it is haunting. There are certain things to which I can relate at this exact moment in my life, which may have caused the book to have a bigger impact on me than it might for others. Regardless, I think this is another brilliant masterpiece by Atwood and would recommend it to both Atwood fans, and those new to her writing.
B00004R99F|5.0|I used to watch this on VHS with my sisters when we were younger. We watched it in the theaters and then forced our parents to buy us our own copy, which we watched all the time. I purchased this DVD last year and I STILL love it 12 years after its initial release. <br /> <br />I definitely thought this movie was funnier when I was a kid, but even now I think it's just as enjoyable as it was then. I love the songs-- we used to sing along when we were younger. I even bought the soundtrack!  <br /> <br />And I have to admit, I think that this is one of Disney's best animated features. Better than The Emperor's New Groove (which I also loved), and even any of their computer animated offerings, including The Incredibles and definitely better than the awful Cars.
1400079276|5.0|John Updike has called this book a \\"metaphysical mind-bender,\\" and I think that pretty much sums it up. The chapters alternate between the seemingly unrelated stories of Kafka Tamura (and his alter-ego, Crow), a 15-year-old boy who runs away from home to find his mother and sister; and Satoru Nakata, an older man who lost the use of much of his mental faculties during an incident as a boy (a story in itself!), but gained the ability to speak with cats. In my opinion, any novel that features speaking cats (each with their own personalities) automatically gets points. <br /> <br />Soon it becomes clear that the two plots are interrelated, in a fantastically surreal, and sometimes confusing, plot. Music, sexuality, Oedipus, fate, self-sufficiency, friendship, and nature all play supporting roles to Kafka and Nakata's leads. It's definitely a fun, sometimes challenging read that requires you to piece together riddles without solutions and take your imagination to a different plane. <br /> <br />It would be hard to try to summarize the plot or meaning behind the book, because I have a feeling that it could be interpreted in many different ways. No matter what you take away from this book, you will undoubtedly enjoy the rich characters and elegant writing, as well as the truly fascinating idea that the planes of existence aren't as separate as you may think.  <br /> <br />If you are on the lookout for a beautifully-written novel that will requires you to stretch your imagination to the limit, I say look no further.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I heard great things about this movie. Even people who said he took liberties with the facts said that it was extremely well done, so I decided I would see it. I even decided that I was going to be open minded when I watched it. Despite everything I know about Gore, I really did try to be open minded. It was NOT great.<br /><br />Instead of being called An Inconvenient Truth (can you get more pretentious?), it should have been called The Al Gore Show. That's really what it was! The ENTIRE movie is Al Gore giving a lecture about global warming, or as he likes to call it, \\"The Global Climate Crisis\\" (I was wrong, it just got more pretentious). He just stands there droning on and on and on about how if he isn't elected as president of the world, we and our pets will all die when the world blows up. He DOES offer a very convincing argument for global warming and does a VERY good job destroying all of the arguments against it, and even against his specific ideas on global warming (i.e. it is caused by human industry). However, in order to prove this point, he just stands there showing charts and statistics (all of which are unsubstantiated) and never even bothers to quote, let alone actually bring on stage a real scientist who knows anything about global warming. Al Gore is the only one who talks in the whole movie! He doesn't even say where he is getting all of these charts and statistics he is using! He could have (and probably did) get all of his charts from different sources, picking and choosing which data best fit what he wanted to prove! BUT... That was the GOOD part of the movie!<br /><br />Parts of the movie that do not consist of Al Gore giving a lecture are of Al Gore driving around in a car and talking about his LIFE! That's right AL GORE'S LIFE! How narcissistic is this guy!? He talks bout how he worked on a tobacco farm. He talks about the death of his son. He talks about the death of his sister. How do these things relate to global warming? How are they relevant to anything? Only the supreme being, Mr. Gore can tell us! But WAIT! It gets WORSE! In one part of the movie he even talks about the election (yes, the 2000 presidential election in which he whined about recounts and the people in Florida that MEANT to vote for him). He talks about how even though he actually won, he isn't bitter about it. He understands that he has to move on with his life. What an understanding guy!*says sarcastically* One positive thing that I did notice is that Al Gore does seem much more.... how should I say it.... HUMAN than he did when he was vice president/presidential candidate. He is no longer the lifeless block of wood with no muscles in his face. He actually smiles sometimes and even *gasp* makes jokes (not very funny ones, but still, kudos for trying). He also looks much larger than he did 6 years ago, but it is my theory that he hasn't gained weight, he's just refusing to exhale so as to reduce his CO2 emissions.<br /><br />Here is the inconvenient truth Mr. Gore, I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching your movie! I am ashamed that I finished the whole thing! Even if Al Gore is right about this whole global warming conspiracy, the movie is NOT well done. It is basically just a propaganda film made to convince you of some huge problem so that Gore can catapult himself into office. But here's the kicker... IT JUST MIGHT WORK!!!ng? Only the supreme being, Mr. Gore can tell us! But WAIT! It gets WORSE!

B000N6TX1I|5.0|Children of Men gives us yet another brilliant cinematic dystopian experience in the tradition of great films like A Clockwork Orange, Logan's Run, The Terminator, 1984 and Bladerunner.  It makes a web of appropriate, contemporary and significant social insights, while at the same time it gives us hopeful storytelling about the fall and possible triumph of humankind.<br /><br />The story is set in the year 2027, which is closer than one may think and seems to follow a time period of immense global change.  Make no mistake about it, in order for things to end up the way they do in the year 2027 here in Children of Men, we will have to endure some really horrendous ordeals in pretty much the next two or three years.  This includes a flu pandemic, some kind of nuclear conflict, large scale societal and cultural breakdown, terrorism, the collapse of all governments outside of England and of course, the most significant feature, the complete infertility of all female humans on Earth since the year 2009.  Despair is all that exists in this world but despair is not what this story is about.  Children of Men is a story about hope.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n directs; one of my personal favorite filmmakers for Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n.  The story is inspired by P.D. James' novel of the same name.  Cuar&oacute;n's take is actually quite consistent with Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n in that it is a road movie about the primary character's self-discovery and makes some really insightful social commentary.  The movie opens by informing us of the unexpected death of \\"baby Diego\\", the youngest human being on Earth.  We then follow Theo Faron (Clive Owen) who is an unlikely hero in complete despair.  He is a flawed drunk who smokes and when asked about his smoking he replies \\"it's not working\\", implying that he just doesn't care to live.  Then again, in this setting, who really does?  The human race will be extinct in less than 100 years.  Children of Men could've benefited from less detailed advertising as I almost wished I didn't know that Theo's transformation from despair to hope would be because of an African refugee Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), who is the first pregnant woman on Earth in 18 years.  That isn't to say the film did not surprise me time and time again.  It certainly did.  I didn't know much about Children of Men going into it and I think knowing less is better for the audience here more so than many films, so I will spoil no more than I have already.<br /><br />There are two things that make this movie amazing, beyond the fundamental strengths of it's story and overall direction.  The first point I'd like to mention is with regards to the performances.  Each actor melts into their roles brilliantly.  Obviously we expect this from Julianne Moore and Michael Caine but we get some great performances from the newcomers as well.  Even the small supporting roles are great.  But most of all, Clive Owen has truly arrived here.  He actually helped write for his own character and his passion for the role really shows.  I'm actually surprised he wasn't considered for an Oscar.  It's often easy to say that the character's writing itself is what pulls forth a great performance from the actor, but the fact that Clive assisted in writing the character into the screenplay, and then blew me away with his performance is remarkable to say the least.  The other big strength for me is the modern political flavor.  The film functions as a loose deliberation of sorts on our current global political climate, and it offers us some potentially dire consequences.  It's elaborate to decipher where Cuar&oacute;n's convictions lie, but it's certainly worth joining in on his insights regardless of where you, the viewer, stand.<br /><br />Keep in mind, Cuar&oacute;n does not care to offer us a back story like most movies do and the casual viewer may be frustrated with some key questions.  It's not a typical action film narrative and the audience is expected to draw some of their own conclusions or even accept that we just don't have the answers at all.  Of course that mirrors real life and for me it's challenging questions that make a movie great.we just don't have the answers at all.  Of course that mirrors real life and for me it's challenging questions that make a movie great.

6303855466|3.0|In 1917 English cartographer Reginald Anson (Hugh Grant) comes to South Wales to measure the famous border mountain Ffynnon Carw for His Majesty's Royal Map. There is one criteria for a mountain to be labeled such: it must exceed a height of 1000 feet; if below that it is considered a hill. The mountain is the pride of all Welshman as it has protected them from all invaders throughout the centuries thereby preserving \\"ancient Britain.\\" When the measurement comes in at 984 feet the Welshmen become totally unhinged. Their pride has been challenged, their very core has been shaken and they set out on a plan to add twenty additional feet to pass the Royal test!  <br /> <br />Ivor Mongor had written a delightful short story by the same laboriously long title. The result has been Christopher Mongor stretching that simple story into a 100 minute screenplay that feels every bit stretched as the hill was in order to meet a criteria to film a movie! Love interests and subplots about the Great War have been added in order to fill out the time, but the result is a movie, that though very charming and clever, should have remained a \\"hill\\" instead of making it a \\"mountain.\\" The conclusion of the story is inevitable, but getting there is as tedious as every bucket of dirt that the townspeople lug up Ffynnon Carw. Even Stephen Endelman's delightful musical themes lose their Celtic charm and effect as they are heard and reheard time and again as if he too was \\"stretching!\\" <br /> <br />Visually, the film is quite appealing as we are allowed to focus time and again on the majestic countryside of Wales. The colours and textures used are extremely vivid and pleasing to the senses; but one grows impatient with all of the \\"filler\\" material that drags out what was originally a very precise and well crafted little gem of a story.Lop off twenty minutes, get rid of nonessential characters and tell the original story and perhaps this film would ultimately \\"rise\\" to the occasion!  <br />

B000MQC9H4|1.0|For starters- let me say that I am a shallow movie-goer.  I love chick flicks and comedy. I didn't even chuckle once during this movie! I was bummed I missed out in seeing this movie in theatres- now I am grateful that I didn't waste the $20... What went wrong? The movie was 2 slow hours, painfully predictable, cheesy acting (ok, Jack Black and the old guy were a bit charming), boring plot- it took 20 minutes to even start the movie. Ok so the 2 gals switch homes to mend their poor broken hearts (the men they were in love with were cheating... what a new concept!) The two men they fall in love with while on vacation have their own bagage (one is dating someone else who ends up cheating and the other has 2 daughters) Then the girls have to decide - do they stay or move back home without their new loves? Are you kidding me? <br /> <br />Cameron Diaz can't cry but then sheds a tear at the end of the movie when she realizes she's in love... she does a cheezy dance scene, Kate Winslet does a cheezy dance scene with the pillow as a guitar... C'Mon!  <br /> <br />Trust me, this movie isn't worth being classified as a chick flick.
B00006JQU1|5.0|Whilst there's no definitive solo violin Bach recording - and there never will be - RP is an absolute must have to anyone wishing to explore the mystics of Bach. <br /> <br />So frequent are the timbre adjustments within each phrase, in every solo - I can't help but wonder how long Rachel pondered how she wanted these recordings to sound - was it years or decades. <br /> <br />Whilst it is true that the baroque violin (equiped with gut strings) provides an unexpected resonance - within a minute, i'd forgotten the different violin sound - and was mesmorised by how easy Rachel makes these solos sound. a beautiful interpretation that one no classical music lover should go without.
B000002GQH|5.0|This album truly is an absolute work of art. Others here have offered up fantastic reviews of this album, so I am only going to briefly comment on the songs that struck a particularly strong chord with me, whether good or bad.     I can honestly say that out of the thirteen tracks, there is only one that I really don't care for: 'Dear Diary'. Who knows, maybe I might learn to love this  song someday, and if I do change my mind, then I will most definitely alter my negative review. But right at this moment, it's the one and only song that keeps this album from being a perfect 10 in my book. Usually- and with good reason- I am such a fan of  Ray Thomas' work, but this song does absolutely nothing to present this man's awesome vocal abilities in a favorable light. Perhaps if he had sang it differently, ie in his normal vocal tone, it would most assuredly have been a  great song.  The tune, melody, and lyrics are quite good actually. It's the \\"way\\" that Ray sings it that turns me off- sorry Ray. (I still love and miss you, dear sir). Ray does redeem himself very well on 'Lazy Day', a sweet little ode to the peaceful times to be had on an English Sunday afternoon. It's not an intricate  or deep song by any means but it has its merits.    Now on to the awesome Mr. Hayward's ballads: Justin's 'Lovely to See You' is a concert staple/favorite for a very good reason: it's a truly lovely, understated song that just makes you plain feel good!  'Never Comes the Day' is one of my favorite Justin penned/lead vocal songs. I had heard it often described as being slightly weird, the lyrics \\"but you WILL love me tonight\\" in particular. Perhaps I'm a little slow but I just don't get that feeling from this song. To me, this song is about a man in love who is honest enough to admit that there's \\"stuff\\" hidden inside of him that isn't pretty, may be hard to love, and perhaps should be kept hidden. This could be speaking of any of us, myself included. Another reason for me to admire this song: John's background vocals. Any time (on the same song) that he can sing that fab falsetto AND he and Justin can sing harmony is an oh-so-good time to be had by my eager ears. In rounding out Hayward's songs, I have only one word to adequately describe \\"Are You Sitting\\" (co-written by Ray) MAGICAL!!    What to say about my dear John's two songs: 'Send Me No Wine' is a great, catchy tune, albeit a MUCH too short one(why oh why John?) This one has a decidely country feel, flavor, and sound to it. This little gem could have come straight out of Nashville in the late 1960's and been right at home here in the Southern United States. This is truly something so very different from anything I've ever heard from him, though he still rocks it out as well. I believe John's songwriting muse short-changed him on this album, as his next great offering 'To Share My Love' is a much too brief song as well. \\"Makes me feel good\\" is how Lodge starts this ditty and it does make me feel quite good indeed to hear it, even though Pinder leads most of the vocals on this one. It;s still a good little song but I wanted to hear more. John's rocking bassline is excellent as is Graeme's accompanying drum beat. Love ya Lodgie!    Rounding out my favorites on OTTOAD: Mike Pinder's 'Have You Heard/ The Voyage'(I consider the two to be one song). I will freely admit that I am not a huge Pinder fan, but I HAVE to give the man his much-deserved props. This is, bar none, his best song EVER and it is an absolute pleasure for me to listen to it. The man has a way with words, not to mention his unsurpassed skills on every keyboard instrument known to mankind. He will forever be the Mellotron king. His voice ain't altogether half bad either. What I appreciate the most about this song is that fact that ALL of the Moodies awesome skills and talents as musicians are on pristine display here. I have only seen one \\"live\\"  (it was a video, sadly) performance  of HYH/TV and it quite frankly blew me away, justin seeing how passionately and ferevently the guys played their respective instruments. Oh man, what I wouldn't give to have seen this live \\"back in the day\\". If God would grant me the opportunity to go back in time to see only ONE vintage Moodies performance, it would be this song! Graeme Edge's often overlooked drum work is an absolute marvel to see and hear. Ray's flute solos have never been played with such understated zeal. Pinder is so very passionate on the piano and organ, or is it just the Mellotron? Regardless, the man has never sounded better. John's very dirty, low-down, funky, hard-driving (did I use enough adjectives?) bass work is just stellar, especially when played in unison with Edge's drum- truly a treat for the senses! The guys make me tired just watching them play, at what is at times, a frenetic pace. Can you tell that I dearly love this song?!    In closing I'd like to say that this is an album that the Moody Blues can and should be VERY proud of. It is truly a masterpiece created by the minds, hands and voices of five incredible men who are all living legends and supremely talented at their craft. If you don't already have it, get it- TODAY!
B000002GQG|5.0|I am not going to offer up a review of the entire album. There are MANY talented folks here who have done a much better job of it than I ever could hope to, so what's the point? I'd just like to offer up my 2 cents on my favorite songs from this great Moody Blues work.    First off is John Lodge's classic, feel-good rocker 'Ride My See-Saw'. (This tune and 'I'm Just a Singer' frequently trade places as my favorite Moodies song). I might as well admit it right now: I am a HUGE John Lodge fan and he is my fave Moody. That will become glaringly apparent if you read any more of my Moody Blues product reviews. Am I the least bit biased towards this living legend? Not at all! While I am not totally sure of the exact meaning of the lyrics, on the surface RMSS seems to be rife with double entendres and sexual innuendo, at least that's what I've read many times.  But knowing  of JL's  deep religious beliefs, I strongly guess that that's not the case at all. This song is just plain fun to listen and sing along to. John and Justin's great guitar work ain't none too shabbily showcased either. RMSS is John Lodge at his rocking best.    I am also a big fan of Ray Thomas' often overlooked (and in my opinon) under-used talents. His ode to 'Dr. Livingstone' is a cheery, cute song that I could listen to all day long while having a goofy smile on my face.  Ray's next offering, 'Legend of a Mind' is a legend of a song, and perfectly shows off this man's awesome vocal skills, not to mention the fact that he can blow the living tar out of a flute. This song has the best series of build-ups (for lack of a better word) and crescendos of any song I have ever heard. (You'll have to over-look the fact that I am not at all musical nor versed in music lingo, so that's the best description I could give. I hope most will understand what I'm talking about). I can literally listen to this song over and over w/o growing tired of it. The subject matter of this song doesn't matter to me one iota. Themelody, the beat, the musicianship, and John's fabulous high note harmonies all combine to make this song a pure delight to my ears.     Next on my list is Lodge's 'House of Four Doors'. I'll spare you the details of how great I think this song is. I'll briefly just state that HOFD is hauntingly eerie and beautiful all at the same time. Maybe- just maybe- I could have done w/o 'some' of the sound effects of the creaking door, but hey John didn't ask me for my opinion before including them. It really doesn't affect my overall opinion of this great song. Yes, it's a John Lodge tune, and yes I darn well love it.    I am ending my little synopsis with two songs from the sublime Justin Hayward.(BTW, I like him, too. He's my 2nd fave Moody). Firstly is 'Voices in the Sky'. I have to admit that it took me a while to really love and appreciate this one (I don't exactly know why) but it is a truly lovely song.  This song DOES make me wonder what the birds could say to me if they only could. As usual, Justin does a superb vocal and the song fits him and this album really well. But.... my favorite Hayward tune on this record is by far 'The Actor'. In fact, it's one of my all-time favorite songs of his.  Both the lyrics and the sound of this song are as timeless today as when JH penned it many years ago. Something in this song really strikes a chord in me. Perhaps it's the fact that we all tend to put on a good front for the world and get caught up in playing our little roles? I heard Justin sing this song live recently and I have to say the man's voice sounds just as good as it did way back when. He truly is a gifted singer, guitarist and performer.    Well, I guess I'm just about through telling y'all (I'm from the South, after all) about my favorite songs from ISOTLC. I hope this \\"review\\" makes someone want to go and listen to these songs (or the entire album) anew- or better yet- hear them for the very first time.  Either way, I do hope you enjoy!
B000002GQE|5.0|Days of Future Passed, the first effort of the 'Phase 2 Moody Blues', is one of those landmark albums that should be in everyone's music library, Moody Blues fan or not. Having hardly no exposure at all to the world of classical/orchestral-type music, I have to admit I haven't much of an ear for it. Frankly, my musical tastes just aren't that highbrow, so I realize I'm not able to fully appreciate this album. That is my biggest obstacle in truly embracing the whole of 'Days' for the masterpiece that it is. Oh, I dearly love the Moodies songs, but the rest, well let's just say I'm getting there. The more I hear it, the more I like the orchestral parts, what I as a simple country girl have always called Beethoven/rich people music. At this point in my musical self-education, I have to heartily give DOFP my big ol' stamp of approval. In reviewing, I will briefly(or not so) give my thoughts on each song along with a yay or nay vote.  1 'The Day Begins'- NO. Haven't fully acquired a taste for poetry or chamber music- yet. Sorry Graeme.  2 'Dawn is a Feeling'- YES. Mike Pinder's opener is just lovely and well-sung by Justin Hayward but Mike's voice wasn't in top form for his part, which fortunately was brief. Pinder has said that his reference to the \\"smell of grass\\" wasn't about pot, but looking back he realized it fit well with the times.  2 'Another Morning'- YES. Another Ray Thomas number. It had to grow on me, as I normally don't care for \\"kiddie\\" songs. He does such an outstanding job  vocally that I had to like it.  3 'Peak Hour'- YES. John Lodge rocks me with this great song. It's the overlooked gem on 'Days'. I had read that it was the Moodies loudest number played live for many years. Wish I could have been there to experience it. Great lyrics- if I could just find the originals. I've seen about 5 versions of it online! Lodgie and mates sing it superbly and slap play the fool out of it.  4 'Tuesday Afternoon'- YES. What can I say about this classic that hasn't already  been said before? I think it's THE best Hayward number on DOFP. Justin singing this song is a little slice of heaven in my headphones.  5 'Evening Time to Get Away'- YES. Oh yes, yes, yes. Hearing John's lovely voice- especially his falsetto- at it's best is enough for this gal. \\"Working, living it brings. Only way to have those things. Toiling has bought too many tears\\". Lodge simply nailed it on this timeless ode to the working class.  6 'The Sunset'- YES. Good song- only wish Pinder would've had a longer part to sing this time. He sounded great.  7 'Twilight Time'- YES. Ray redeems himself VERY well here. His subtle vocal literally carresses the lyrics- and my ears.  8 'Nights In White Satin'- YES. Brilliant song and THE ONE Hayward will forever be known for. Though I love it, it's not my fave of his. This song manages to be both beautiful and haunting all at once. Lodge's almost eerie-sounding, wailing chorus parts never fail to get me. WOW.  9 'Late Lament'. NO. Another poem by Graeme Edge. My sincere apologies Edgie. It's not you, really. It's me. You're a fantastic drummer to be sure!    'Days Of Future Passed' will forever be known as THE record that launched The Moody Blues onto the world stage. It did so for a very good reason: it's a ground-breaking, magnificent recording, created by the minds, hands and voices of five talented young men simply doing what they love- making great music.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I will not expound upon the really incredible video captures here. <br /> <br />However, as another noted, there is a real sameness to the structure:  Food and procreation, ad naseum.  If I heard 'world's biggest..largest...etc' less than 60 times in this series, I would be astonished.  The narration is rather dull (not in performance but in the script).  The musical contribution is variable and sometimes pointless. <br /> <br />One cannot but wonder in awe at the dedication that produced this, however.
B000MV9026|2.0|This was an ok movie.  I liked the use of the music but the plot was boring and the animation was not innovative.  I feel that they could have done a much better job given all the talent out there.
B000FDEU12|5.0|Well worth it. I've been playing it non-stop for a month and bought the rest of his CDs.
B000001FO4|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ALBUM THIS GROUP EVER MADE. WHAT I LIKE MOST IS THE VERSATILITY OF THIS RECORD.IT COMBINES HARD ROCK AND BLUES TO CREATE A DIFFERENT SOUND FROM THE PREVIOUS RECORD. \\"GYPSY ROAD\\" AND \\"THE LAST MILE\\" ROCK, BUT THE BALLAD \\"DONT KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TILL ITS GONE\\" IS THE STAND OUT TRACK. \\"COMING HOME\\" IS ALSO VERY TOUCHING.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM.
1594481938|3.0|This book, despite its continuous insight (a Hornby trademark, but [[ASIN:1573229326 How to Be Good]] does it far better) seems to be much more of an exercise than it is a book. It consists almost entirely of talking heads, with little in the way of place or time. The writing is engaging enough that the reader doesn't really question whether or not s/he is interested in the characters, and I'm not sure whether that's a flaw or a strength. Hornby's entirely too pleased with all the terrific metaphors he can come up with, so that gets a little tiresome--there's a meaningful metaphor about once every three pages, and while they're all wonderful, enough is enough after a while. Also, for a book that's arguably entirely characterization, one of the characters isn't fully realized and another keeps changing.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this was a book that needed another few months of editing before it saw the light of day, or scrapped in favor of other work that wasn't so obviously a *project.* Hornby's writing is excellent, with a couple of notable exceptions--one dialogue scene was atrocious, noticeably so--so I have few quarrels there. Still and all, good reading, and not at all a waste of time.
076531178X|5.0|\\"Mistborn\\" is the first book by Brandon Snaderson that I've read. I was looking for something new and refreshing in fantasy realm and picked this book, based on one of Amazon's lists. I was not disappointed.  <br />Many revieweres already discussed pro's and cons of this book. For me, it was a great and fast-paced read. The world of Sanderson's imagination is unique, mainly because of unique magic system - and (sort of) religion based on it. <br /> <br />The characters are real - at least those of them, where author got into trouble to describe them. Also, they stay with you long after you finish the book.  <br />I did like the fact that the action was going on the differenet levels of society - serfs (skaa), thieves, lords, merchants... It's too often that all the things in the fantasy book happen only \\"somewhere in the upper society\\", and the rest of nation patiently waits for the results... <br />Another big \\"pro\\" of this book for me  - it is perfect as a stand-alone novel, and the reader is not left in the middle of nowhere, waiting for another volume to continue with the story. This will not prevent me, though, from watching Brandon Snaderson and waiting (:-) for the next book in the series.
B00000JGHM|5.0|You can't expect anything less than a quality movie with 2 incredible actors such as DeNiro and Pacino.  Awesome to see them battle against each other.  My favorite part is when they sit down to chat and you'll see why.  Long movie, so you better have time to watch it.  For as long of a movie as it is, there were some ends left untied.  Either way worth the watch.
B000002GQL|4.0|This album is not my favorite MB offering, but there are four incredible songs on it that I dearly love, one being my \\"sometime\\" favorite MB tune. I'm only going to mention these songs in my little piece here. I titled my review as I did because of the perfect display of Justin's and John's strengths on this album, Justin being the soulful balladeer and John the ultimate rocker. These two great men are just \\"all that\\" in my book, so I gotta give 'em their due.<br /><br />Justin Hayward's 'New Horizons', partially inspired by his late father, is a stunning song in every way. Both the arrangement and the music are wonderful, with the strings and Justin's guitar sounding almost mournful at times. Hayward's voice has such a sad and deep note to it as well and he uses it masterfully. His wide vocal range is spotlighted here, along with John's perfect use of subtle and understated harmonies. This song just grabs you by the heart and never lets up, but at the same time it's so beautifully done that you have to enjoy it as well. \\"Horizons\\" is just simply Justin Hayward doing what he was born to do.<br /><br />Ray Thomas' 'For My Lady', written for the woman he was then married to, is this man at his awesome best. His rich baritone voice, with all its layered nuances has never sounded better, and it soared on the higher registers. The music and lyrics, which are both outstanding, complement each other so well. What more can I say except this is a beautiful song and Ray sings it to perfection. As an aside, I am so very glad he sang it at the 'Red Rocks' concert a few years back for all the world to discover and enjoy.<br /><br />John Lodge once again manages to both playfully rock me and deeply touch my heart with his two songs on this album. A lot of fans and critics consider Lodge's  beautiful 'Isn't Life Strange' to be his best song. It is a favorite of mine, as well. To all those who say John is neither a great singer or writer, I dare you to conclude that after giving this song a really good listening to, preferably two or three. John has never written so poignantly and eloquently as on this song. He writes: \\"Isn't life strange? A turn of the page. A book without light unless with love we write\\". WOW! is all I can say. John's airy, ethereal voice- not to mention his fabulous falsetto- have never sounded better or stronger. Justin's co-lead and harmonies once again show how terrific these two men sound together. The orchestral arrangements are wonderfully done without overwhelming the song, only adding to its magnificence.<br /><br />I'm saving the best for last: John's  'I'm Just a Singer In a Rock n Roll Band'. This song frequently trade places with 'Ride my Seesaw' as my absolute favorite Moody Blues song. 'I'm Just a Singer' is THE consummate rock song and John Lodge is so very much in his element on this great song. My gosh but the man can rock it out like no one else. John wrote this song in response to the legions of \\"spaced out\\" fans who worshipped the Moodies as their messiahs. Thank God for those misguided fans or I wouldn't have this great song to enjoy- lol! Not only is the song plain fun to listen to, its lyrics actually have a deep meaning. This song is a winner in every way possible. All the Moodies give stellar performances vocally and instrumentally. The rhythm, beat and tempo of this song are outstanding, carried along by the masterful hands of Graeme Edge on percussion (his best performance, IMO) and John on his  funky Fender bass. Mike Pinder's keyboards/ Mellotron work is absolutely incredible, and Justin's blazing guitar solo blisters the ears. I love to listen to this song cranked up full throttle while wearing headphones. I hit 'repeat' and off I go rocking for an hour or more on just this one song alone. (No, I never get tired of it- not yet anyway) I'm sure I have sustained major ear damage but the sheer joy this song brings me is well worth it. If I still smoked cigs, I'd have to light one up after experiencing the genuine pleasure this song gives me- it's that good! To all the fans who got to see this song performed live pre-hiatus, I am so very green right now. To me, this phenomenal song is the Moody Blues at their ultimate best.<br /><br />Well dear folks, that's my take on 'Seventh Sojourn', four songs of it anyway. Take a listen to it...... and enjoy. As for John Lodge and The Moody Blues, I have to say that they are MUCH more than \\"just singers in a rock n roll band\\" to us fans.  They are a fantastic group of talented men who bring so much needed joy and pleasure to a hurting world. Thank you!
1594489505|5.0|Ok let me start by saying that I loved the book and I highly recommend that you read it if you already haven't. It was a powerful and moving story that is written with enough detail to make you truly embody the characters. I was sad to see it end, but it satisfies your curiosity for how the story would unfold beyond his final words. While I appreciate the feminist sentiment in previous reviews I read, I don't think that set in with me... I felt the hardships were equally endured by both sexes. On a final note, while I applaud the authors' writing ability and imagination, I cant help but crave a different  back drop for his next book. I feel a third novel written in the same setting might create a comfort bubble for the author and fail to show us his full potential.
B000002GQK|5.0|I had read all the reviews describing this album as being slightly dark, so I was  a bit unsure as to how I would like it. I needn't have worried: my beloved boys didn't let me down, not at all. With the exception of one track (that will remain nameless) EGBDF is the incomparable Moody Blues at the apex of their power, talent and creativity. I'll briefly touch on the four songs that REALLY blew me away, though there are several other really great tunes. At this point in my musical journey, I have to say this is probably my favorite of the \\"core 7\\"  MB albums.    I'm going to start off with a veritable Justin Hayward gushfest here: 'The Story in your Eyes'. Oh my word, what a pure delight this song is. Yes folks, Mr Hayward knows how to rock it out! What- and how many- adjectives can I use to adequately describe it? BRILLIANT, MASTERFUL, AWESOME, BEAUTIFUL, SMART, come to mind. This song is simply a showcase for Hayward's phenomenal talents as a singer, songwriter and guitar maestro. \\"And the sound we make together is the music to the story in your eyes\\". Pray tell, who else writes intelligent yet beautiful lyrics like this? NOBODY!! The music, beat and tempo are great as well, carried along by Graeme Edge's terrific percussion work and John Lodge's oh so hard-driving bass. Mike Pinder just flat out tore up the keys on this one. Heck, they ALL shine on this gem!! If I have one MINOR complaint, it's that this song is nowhere near long enough- give me just two more minutes of it, PLEASE!    The hard-rocking 'After You Came', superbly written by Graeme Edge, was a VERY pleasant surprise. It should have been named 'Another Way To Fall', because of the catchy chorus: \\"I've reached the top of my wall. I've found out another way to fall\\".  I love the overall sound of this lively ditty  and the musicianship is blazing hot. The way the guys all trade lead vocals is simply fantastic. I was almost squealing with girlish delight to hear John's lovely vocals totally dominating inseveral places- way to go Lodgie! This song is tailor-made for his voice. But all the Moodies flat sang- and played- their hearts out on this one. Way to write a song Graeme!    On to the two offerings from the fab Mr John Lodge. First off: 'One More Time To Live'. This one took me a few listens to \\"get\\" it, as it's just too much to take in all at once and fully comprehend it. At first I didn't quite see how the chorus of very loudly spoken words fit in, but now I realize that it works beautifully with the heavy subject matter. This might be John's deepest, darkest song. This powerful tune, written well over 30 years ago, is so relevant to today's troubled world that John could have put it to paper yesterday. You've outdone yourself John and you should be darned proud of this song!  I've deliberately saved John's other number, 'Emily's Song', until last. This song hits very close to home with me and at times, frankly leaves me an emotional wreck.  You see, I had no relationship with my biological father. Since my earliest childhood memories, I have wanted and dreamed about having a kind, loving man such as John Lodge for my Dad. To have your daddy love you enough to write and sing about his little girl is too precious and painful for me to put into words. I just hope and pray that Emily Lodge knows how truly blessed she is to have such a father, and that she returns that love to him. John, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for sharing all your beautiful words with the world. You truly are a very special human being.    In closing, I'd just like to say that this album is a must-have for anyone who appreciates classic/progressive rock at its finest, created by the most amazing band to ever bless this Earth with their music.
B00004YX39|3.0|After Aja, the Dan's first real venture into the realms of smooth, another album followed with even less intricate song structures and rhythms (aside from \\"Babylon Sisters\\"). However, the simplicity is very deliberate, accomplished masterfully, and is somewhat called for.  <br /> <br />This album is, of course, perfectly produced and still has the same complex Steely Dan melodies and harmonies along with the catchy numbers that they pull out so flawlessly like they do on all of their albums. The A+ quality musicians on this album include guitarists Steve Khan, Mark Knopfler and Larry Carlton, drummers Steve Gadd, Jeff Porcaro and Bernard Purdie, bassists Anthony Jackson and Chuck Rainey, and horn players Michael and Randy Brecker along with Tom Scott and many others (including the one and only Michael McDonald). I was definitely surprised that with this all star line up, why the album was so simple and smooth, and honestly, it put me off a little, but I listened a few more times and if you like Steely Dan as much as I do, you begin to appreciate the smooth, more poppy grooves, because these guys play this stuff soooo well.  <br /> <br />There is not much more to say but this: <br /> <br />Gaucho is not a necessary Steely Dan album unless you want to complete your collection. However, I do not regret the purchase at all because the songs on here are still really good, they just aren't the best or most thought out Steely Dan tunes. It's an album to appreciate for the smoothness and awesome musicians pulling off the pure smooth.
B000002GQJ|3.0|I hesitate to even write this because I know I am going to feel guilty for speaking ill of my beloved Moodies. In posting, it will be evident that I am not so biased in my love for Hayward and Lodge that I can't give a critical assessment, contrary to what some of my other glowing reviews might lead one to believe. I did give AQOB 3 out of 5 stars so I didn't think it was ALL bad: my all-time favorite Justin Hayward song (written/sung by him for the MB'S) is on this CD.<br /><br />The Hayward-penned 'Question' is reason enough to own this album. This is the BEST of his Moodies songs, bar none. It should be the one Justin is remembered and lauded for, not NIWS. This brilliant song is superior to 'Nights' in every way possible- arrangement, melody, tempo, lyrics- not to mention the way JH absolutely sings the living daylights out of it. The fact that the song was an \\"accident\\" just shows the depths of this man's awesome talents. He tells the story of how he needed a song at the last minute for a recording session and didn't have one ready. He did have 2 songs that were both unfinished AND in the same key. He decided to just go to the studio and fake it, as he put it. The result is just pure brilliance!  Unfortunately nothing else Justin contributed to on this album appealed to me at all, save his great backing and harmony vocals on Lodge's 'Tortoise and the Hare'.<br /><br />Speaking of my dear Lodgie and 'Tortoise': this is a rocking, fun, little song that for some reason has been sadly over-looked. I love the unique way JL re-tells the classic story. The words, music, beat and tempo are great, not to mention the great harmonies from J&J. John's other offering, 'Minstrel's Song' has taken me some time to warm to it, though I don't quite know why. Perhaps this song is a reflection of how John sees himself: as a simple minstrel traveling around singing his songs for the people. Both Graeme's percussion work and Justin's guitar riffs are outstanding on this song, and John's voice is so strong and pure. I have to say though, that I am liking 'Minstrel' better and better every time I hear it. Maybe it's one of those songs you have to listen to several times to fully appreciate how good it actually is.<br /><br />Ray Thomas' 'And the Tide Rushes In' is a breathtakingly beautiful song and Ray sings it to utter perfection.<br /><br />Apart from the one song from Justin, one from Ray, and the two from John, this album really just didn't \\"do it\\" for me, sorry. Nevertheless, it's still infinitely better than 99% of the drivel that's passed off as music today.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|wonderful dvd and a great classic to have on hand for the young and young at heart
B000GTJT0W|5.0|I just recently purchased an HD-DVD player and have been looking for film titles that really show off the HD picture. This film has one of the best transfers I have seen. Beautiful picture. Details really pop. <br /> <br />Cast is alot of fun. Matthew McConaughy was great, Steve Zahn really nailed the slightly goofy but very smart sidekick role. I thought this was a great film for Penelope Cruz as it got her more exposure to the general movie going public than the art house films do. She is really talented and of course a great looking lady.
B000FQ4M58|1.0|hated this cd - i am a long time meatloaf fan but he should have retired after bat II- he cant do the gig anymore very sorry
B0002J4ZWS|2.0|Order was received sooner than expected ... in excellent condition.  Was very pleased.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|Systematic Chaos is a pretty typical Dream Theater CD. There are some tracks that are brilliant and inspired. There are (like on almost evert one of their discs) a couple of tracks that are laughable and a little embarassing. The rest are listenable and fine, but forgettable. The good stuff is great...the rest is not. Its been that way for a lot of years now.<br /><br />You do have to give them credit, though. They set the standard impossibly high. Most bands would give a right arm to be anywhere near as good as DT's worst songs (and there have been some stinkers). Even the bad stuff is played so perfectly and skilfully, you can't hate it...even if you want to.<br /><br />I happily buy DT's albums...always have, always will...expecting to cherry pick a few choice tracks (and they are oh so choice) and leave the rest. Frankly to expect anything else is to fool yourself. As with DT's entire catalog, I wholly recommend this disc. The great tracks (like tracks 2, 5, and 6) are worth the price themselves. I suggest skipping track 4...it'll make ya cringe.
0618680004|5.0|This is, quite possibly, the greatest book I have ever read. <br /> <br />It highlights religion for all its absurdity, and lays bare the most prevalent force of evil to ever be inflicted upon this world - the viral force we call \\"belief\\". <br /> <br />Religion is a mind cancer, and every statement Dawkins' crafts is a blow against it. His holistic framework for combating what essentially boils down to mental delusion, is founded on evidence, theory and scientific testing conducted by some of the greatest present-day and historical figures of science and philosophy. <br /> <br />The intelligent caliber of this circle, of which indeed - Dawkins' is a member - represents the most influential cross-examining body against unfounded religious activism. Of course, this doesn't sway religion, and that's entirely the point of Dawkins' book... that despite the evidence, the absurdity, the illogicality, infinite counter-evidence and the lack of any reaction of external deity to either religious of scientific testing, the vast majority of the world continue to believe in a mystical sky-pixie who dabbles in the lives of ordinary people, die for him, kill for him - irrespective of there being absolutely zero proof of his existence. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have berated the content of this book on the context of arrogance or bullying. Put it into perspective. The enemy of logic is happy to execute, behead or blow themselves (and other people) up for their beliefs. They burn buildings, destroy lives, persecute, and bully with a physical force and harsh cruelty that would make you squint and squirm merely reading a written depiction of it. <br /> <br />As Dawkins' is quick to point out, the weapon of atheism is limited to words alone. No-one has ever killed for non-belief. If his intelligent and self-confident manner offends you, try walking into a church in Middle America and proclaiming that God is a delusion and that the people are all idiots for garnering a belief tantamount to a flying pig. <br /> <br />You'll quickly see what real arrogance and bullying is. <br /> <br />This book reflects the harsh reality of our world, and explains why it came to be. Unfortunately, I believe the only people who will really get anything out of it, are those with an open enough mind to accept evidence on its merit. Religious fanatics - the people this book SHOULD be targeting - are too far gone to care for a counter-argument to their cause, even when it does lay bare the ridiculous nature of their belief. <br /> <br />My only hope is that one day, the brain will evolve to the point of canceling out the absurdity of unfounded belief. Until then, there are enough modern-day Leonardo's and visionaries representing pockets of society that do respect reality in its raw, honest form to make this world a place that's still worth living in. <br /> <br />In reading this book, you have a right to lose faith in large sectors of humanity. But rest assured, there are still people with threads of sanity sharing this turf along with you. That is, in my mind, a great comfort.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|After recently attending a concert of Loreena McKennitt promoting this album, I purchased this.  It's not the same as being there, but pretty darned close. :) <br /> <br />The music on Ancient Muse is a trip down Silk Road and sampling of music found there.  How can one truly describe the rhythm and beats of the music?  You can't.  But if you are a fan of Loreena's previous works, you will like this one as well.
B00005JPAO|4.0|\\"The Queen\\" was very interesting to watch, Helen Mirrren was the perfect person to portray the queen of England. The movie was very good, i nformative,and really kept my attention.
0823016714|3.0|\\"Facial expressions\\" is worth getting if you are looking for how the human face can squash and stretch, and how far you as an artist can push that, while still making the face \\"realistic.\\" I belive many novice artists would be surprised. I was also pleased to see the age range of the subjects photographed. However, this book is not very good if you are seriously studying facial expressions. As another reviewer has said, the expressions in the book are cartoony and over acted. Again, this would be fine if what you are studying is how the features of the face interact, but if you are say, a comic book or storyboard artist who wants to work on acting and drawing a good, meaningful facial expression, this book isn't for you. Also, the drawings inspired by the expressions are pretty useless; honestly, they are in most photo reference books of this type.
B000NVIGC0|3.0|but this Wilco record was a disappointment for me. I mean it's not that bad but it doesn't have the magic of Being There, Summerteeth or YHF or even AGIB. <br /> <br />In my opinion the most beautiful music written buy Jeff Tweedy and Co. is to be found on the two collaboration records with Billy Bragg, Mermaid Avenue I. & II. <br /> <br />I've been listening to Sky Blue Sky for weeks now but it just hasn't got that certain something I had hoped I'd find. There are 3-4 songs that I like quite a lot but the MAGIC is not there. At least for me. <br /> <br />As I have all the other Wilco albums I put this one into my collection but for someone who's interested in the band this is not the one to go with. I'd rather suggest Being There or Summerteeth, maybe the two Mermaid Avenue records.
1401302378|5.0|Mr. Anderson's book is well thought-out and articulate. His research is impeccable. Employing solid statistics and numerous examples, he explains the current direction of our overall economy. It's very insightful and encouraging for forward thinking entrepenuers and consumers alike. NOTE: There are places where the information is rather monotonous - it's not all fun and games - but, all-in-all, this is a very interesting read.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Ryan Adams seems to produce two types of albums. Either you get the dark, misunderstood soul who showed-up on Love Is Hell or the melodic pop smith who showed up on Gold. Since then each record I have by Adams has danced between those two worlds with mixed results, 29 for example seemed like a rushed, unfocused effort, Rock N Roll kept things blasting but was clearly not in Adams normal wheelhouse of style.<br /><br />On Cold Roses, Adams and his backing band The Cardinals stretch out comfortably in his varied styles in one of the most engaging efforts of Adams career. This album is neither too up to seem unrealistic of whom Adams is as an artist nor too down to be off-putting with melancholy laced diatribes. Instead the heartfelt, lovesick soul who has shown up before is now easy to listen to as Adams allows the Cardinals to create a lovely and rich alt-country backdrop throughout Cold Roses, which allows Adams to not veer off the path into self-indulgent territory.<br /><br />Cold Roses presents 18 mostly realized efforts. Songs like Let It Ride best showcase this as richly played guitar hooks blast the song off in the right direction while Adams rides the energy into interesting places. Dance All Night is another example, with the lyrics dancing between happy and sad creating a wonderfully melodic slice of life tune that does not seem cheesy, all of a sudden the Bob Dylan comparisons that were applied to Adams can now morph into Neil Young comparisons.<br /><br />Throughout Cold Roses Adams seems to be in a comfort zone that makes the record feel more complete, like a vision has been met. Each side of the record creates two different feels, but yet still remain a believable package. Sweet Illusion on the first side seems to best capture the sparseness Adams was looking to achieve, while If I Am Stranger is an example of the warmth on the second album.<br /><br />With the huge number of Ryan Adams records out there one might wonder what one is the best showcase of his talent. Considering his back and forth prolific personality, Cold Roses seems like the best bet to explore as it best showcases all sides of Adams as a performer without veering into sub-standard territory. On Cold Roses, both the dark soul and merry popster appears, but with the help of The Cardinals, Adams allows both sides of himself to shine.showcase of his talent.

B000PFUAO6|5.0|I didn't listen to much earlier Dream Theater until recently.  I've listened to almost all of their albums to date now and I have to say I really really think Systematic Chaos is great.  Powerful, catchy, & creative.  I don't see how you can say this is not great release by them.  Like one reviewer noted any good band shouldn't always stay the same.  I'm glad they don't.<br /><br />Peace.
B000PGTPE6|5.0|If you loved The Seeger Sessions, you will love this, too.  It definitely captures the amazing energy of the tour.  The most exciting part for me are the new arrangements for two of my all time favorite songs, \\"Atlantic City\\" and \\"Open All Night\\". They blew my mind when I saw him perform them at the show and they still blow my mind in the privacy of my home a year later.  The revamped \\"Further On (Up The Road) and especially \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" are simply lovely.      But of course, what really matters here are the folk and gospel songs from The Seeger Sessions.  I am an unabashed devotee to this music. I don't care how old they are or if I did learn some of them in grade school music class, these songs are just as exciting, clever, touching, relevant and memorable as anything Springsteen ever wrote.  As much as I love Springsteen's entire catalog (I am a full-fledged addict), I have to admit I don't think I have ever listened to one of his album's more than I have listened to The Seeger Sessions. I have been listening to it practically non-stop for a year and I still have as much enthusiasm for it as I did when I first put it in the stereo.  I was worried that I wouldn't really care much for this CD, but the songs that appear on \\"Live In Dublin\\" are tweaked just enough to keep it interesting and there is just the right amount of the audience sing-a-longs to give the live experience vibe but to keep from being annoying.  For me, the highlights include, but are not limited to: \\"Jesse James\\", \\"My Oklahoma Home\\" and the big bang which comes on the second disc during \\"When The Saints Go Marching In\\", \\"This Little Light Of Mine\\" and \\"American Land\\".  And it's simply a matter of fact that \\"How Can A Poor Man Stand Such Times And Live\\" is one of the greatest songs that Springsteen has ever performed.    The DVD looks wonderful and the show itself is a great representation of what I experienced when I saw the tour here in the states.  Watching Springsteen armed with an acoustic guitar that he wields like a shotgun is always going to be worth your time---the energy he delivers doesn't change just because his band does. (For those of you who need him strapped to his Telecaster along side The Big Man and Little Steven, I beg you to get over it!)    Any complaints?  I wish \\"Live In Dublin\\" could have included a performance of \\"Long Black Veil\\".  I wish it was four discs instead of three.      Sadly, there now seems to be two kinds of Springsteen fans:  Those who accept and adore Springsteen as a folk troubadour and those who can only handle him as the Almighty Leader of The E Street Band.  For all those who fall in the latter category, I pity you.  To close yourself of from the pure and total joy that these songs can stir is nothing short of tragic.  Your soul must be calloused; your heart must be made of lead.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|My oldest was a Linkin Park fan in the _Meteora_ days, so of course when it came time for the new disc, I checked it out before passing it on to him.  I had some hopes for this album, since I'd heard all the hoopla about hooking up with Rubin and re-examining their method and all that jazz.  For as much as I liked some classic Linkin Park songs, I could see them all too easily headed down a road to being the New Kids on the Block of alt-rap-metal rock, which would all too soon make them as laughable as Fred Durst and Limpest Bizkit.<br /><br />But, once again, in the world of big labels and big album sales, reinvention doesn't really mean that much except, in this case, to do more slow songs and ditch the Bizkit-scratching.  There is really not a lot of new vision here--songs of anger and betrayal by unnamed forces and a whole realm of vague emotions that will no doubt inspire poor, meaningless teenage poetry for months.  The dismal reinvention was such a disappointment that I leaned towards the songs that smacked of goold ol' Linkin, sings like \\"Given Up\\" and \\"What I've Done.\\"  In fact, my rating comes from pure mathematical function--since I only liked 5 out of 12 tracks, my rating also fell under the midpoint.<br /><br />But I just can't keep from staring at the bushy guitarist in the band photos--is this just a negative image of Metallica suddenly appearing with high and tight do's, or is there maybe just the slightest wee chance that these guys do really want to shed their metal-N'Sync background and do something truly original?<br /><br />I don't know.  Maybe something like that might be in the cards down the road--just not here.
0893860220|5.0|For those interested in clarity of writing about the evolution of consciousness, this is the best I've read in the 35 years of my vedic practice.
0765348276|3.0|I have decidedly mixed feelings about John Scalzi's \\"Old Man's War.\\" On the one hand, this is a well-written, fast-paced and enjoyable book. I cannot escape, however, the feeling of deja vu as I rifle through pages and pages of humans battling aliens and devising new strategies to deal with superior alien technologies or physical abilities. To paraphrase a character in a similar military SF story, it sure looks like another bug hunt to me. <br /> <br />Scalzi acknowledges Heinlein, so he knows full well that \\"Old Man's War\\" draws obvious comparisons to \\"Starship Troopers.\\" It presents enough interesting twists to differentiate itself on the surface, but underneath, it's the same military archetype that exists across genres: Recruit joins military, trains, makes friends, becomes a hero, etc. <br /> <br />I kept waiting for this story to distinguish itself, to push beyond the battle motif, but it never quite does that. The wars appear to exist in the story simply for the sake of giving the main character, John Perry, something to do as a not-quite-octogenarian soldier. The military struggles are but a contrivance. The hostile universe explanation offered by one of the characters in the book isn't entirely satisfying. It amounts to the same as saying, \\"Well, it's a big bad universe full of bad people.\\" While I can accept that on the surface as an excuse for enjoying a good action story, it leaves me wanting a bit more. <br /> <br />One engaging moment in the book with potential for someting deeper occurs when Perry voices insights about the motives of a particular alien race and suggests that the Colonial Defense Forces (CDF) doesn't fully understand its enemies. I expected this idea to become a kind of theme in the book, but it's never explored further. The reader is left only with a vested interest in John Perry and his development into a soldier whose wisdom allows him to distinguish himself, to gain rank, and, ultimately, to survive. What drives the final portion of the book and makes the story engaging is Perry's burgeoning relationship with a fellow soldier with whom Perry has a very special connection. Naturally, the relationship is a complicated one and is not entirely resolved by the end of the book, which leaves the door conveniently open for the sequel. <br /> <br />On the whole, this is an engaging page turner with a solid, well-realized and likable main character. If you're looking for a story with greater depth in terms of exploring humankind's place in a big and hostile universe, you'll want to look elsewhere. If an action-packed, military romp in space that could very well serve as a sequel to \\"Starship Troopers\\" is your cup of tea, \\"Old Man's War\\" more than delivers. I may tune in for the sequel to see how Perry's relationship works out because that's the aspect of the book I find most engaging.
B000PFUAO6|2.0|I have been a Dream Theater fan since Images and Words. I have bought every CD and DVD, saw them live (great live band) and even bought James Labrie's solo stuff. However, I am ready to tap out on this band.  Since Train of Thought (not a bad effort, just very mediocre after Scenes and Six Degrees), Dream Theater's studio efforts have just been plain weak.  Octavarium was a cd that was dull including the title song's twenty plus minutes of epic meandering to nowhere.  I ended up selling it back to my local used CD store.  So I was hesitant about buying Systematic Chaos, but after checking out the fans' sites and reading the early positive reviews on this new CD, I took the plunge. After the last two days of listening to Systematic Chaos, I finally pinned down what is missing from the band's last three studio efforts including Chaos....the songs lack soul and heft compared to their earlier efforts.  Compare this CD's songs to earlier efforts such as \\"Voices\\", \\"Learning to Live\\", \\"Lines in the Sand\\",  \\"A Change of Seasons\\", \\"Hollow Years\\" etc. and you can tell this band's latest efforts have hit the creative and musical wall.  The song structures are tiresome, the lyrics are now getting downright embarrassing and the \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" music noodling and time changes in most of these songs now have no purpose, direction and cohesion.  Memo to the band: we know you can play music that most bands in the world can't touch, but sometimes tight, simple song structures with better lyrical content go a long way especially after 15 years of torching your instruments with your musical ability song in and song out.   <br /> <br />Dream Theater's music structure and musical bridges that lead to nowhere have gotten old and mechanical over time especially when it adds nothing to the direction of the song and the lyrics can't carry a tune. I don't know, maybe my tastes for this type of musical effort is waning. However, I truly believe after many years of creating CD after CD, playing world tour after world tour, and the many side projects the band's members have done on their own time, all of their hard work has finally caught up with the band.  Dream Theater's creative tank is empty.  Many great bands have recovered after time off from the business (U2 after the dreadful Zooropa era), but some bands never recover.  It is time for this band to take an extended break and recharge their creative juices.  <br /> <br />In the IPod era where consumers can pick and choose songs to download without shelling out cash for the entire album, Dream Theater cannot afford to put only one or two good efforts on a CD.  From now on, I will only download what I think is worthwhile from this band. For Systematic Chaos, I would have downloaded \\"Forsaken\\" (a marginal call), \\"Prophets of War\\" and \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\".  I had the highest hopes for \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\", but frankly the song falls flat at the end. You are looking for soaring, moving music to tie the whole effort together and you get a clanking non-emotive ending instead.  \\"Constant Motion\\" and \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" are absolutely worthless gumbo of musical goo wrapped in Metallica and Slipknot flavors and those songs would have never made it to any of the band's earlier efforts before 2002.  \\"Repentance\\" has promise, but after John's decent solo, the song limps to the end with the musical melody being repeated over and over while voices talk and talk the last two minutes of the song leaving the listener frustrated.  To me, at this point, the golden era of the band's studio efforts ended with the release of Six Degrees....
B000C65Z1G|3.0|I was slightly disappointed in this film. It had been recommended to me by a couple different people, and I had been led to believe it was a true story about real African history. <br /> <br />It's not exactly a true story, but the plot does revolve around drug companies using untested drugs on African countries. Which is a real issue. So I guess it's close enough. <br /> <br />The big problem for me is that the film uses that issue to create a sort of suspense thriller. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I have to admit that this film (and the internet researching I did following it) did increase my awareness of the unsavory practices of pharmaceutical companies in the 3rd world, but I did feel that the movie was simply using it as a background to make their suspense story and sappy love story more compelling. And on top of that, it wasn't all that great of a suspense movie.

B000E97X66|5.0|The only criticism I can imagine someone offering about this tremendous live album would be that at times Bruce pushes the limits of the theatrical, and listeners not otherwise familiar with his work might detect overconfidence where there is really only raw, beautiful desperation.  But back when Bruce and the E Street band performed this show, they were really something special.  They really wanted it.  Every syllable and note here is deeply felt, and if there is an occasional misstep, it would take an extremely ungenerous listener to hold it against such talented performers leaving it all out on the stage.   <br /> <br />Several of the tracks on this album are strictly superior to their studio counterparts, including \\"It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City\\"; the mind-blowing, virtuosic version of \\"Kitty's Back,\\" which for me is the finest blurring of real rock and roll, jazz, and funk I've ever heard; and even \\"Rosalita,\\" which seemed untouchable in its studio form, is taken to another level here.  This is Bruce's best music on these tracks, and his band is in top form. <br /> <br />For any early Bruce devotee, this album is a must.  If only Bruce, or any one else, still laid it down like this today.

B000P0J02E|4.0|Hans Zimmer has done a magnificent job of blending the various themes from the last two soundtracks into some new ones created for this one.  And the best difference between this one and the last two is that, with the exception of two tracks (\\"Up Is Down\\" and \\"I See Dead People In Boats\\") it is chronologically arranged to coincide with the movie.  My only wish is that they had included more than just a single verse/chorus of the pirate anthem \\"Hoist The Colours\\" being sung by the boy and chorus.  That, and the new theme for Elizabeth and Will \\"One Day\\" are haunting and beautiful.  And the \\"Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\\" echoes to be found in \\"Parlay\\" are very humorous, given the nature of that scene in the movie. (Something I hadn't originally noticed when I was so intent on following the storyline.) I'm finding the purchase well worth the investment.

B000001EKX|5.0|When Kiss released \\"Hotter Than Hell\\", they were still trying to discover their niche. Their make-up had changed, and they experimented with a Japanese kabuki style for their sophomore album. That being said, \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" may have a different feel to it than some other Kiss albums. Their first album was great and opened the gateways for Kiss. This album, quite heavier than their debut, has some different vibes to it, here and there. However, with that being said, I think this is definitely a great album. While it still contains that blues influence of their debut, it seems to have prefigured the grunge-rock of the '90s, but is still an interesting gem even if you don't care for the grunge sound.<br /><br />One thing you should know is that this album may be a little harder to find. I got mine offline, so maybe that's the way you should get it. However, if you're ever in the music store and see this, pick it up! My usual, track-for-track review following will help strengthen my reason to believe that every Kiss fan should own this.<br /><br />\\"Got To Choose\\": Great riff with a cool groove and the Kiss-styled blues influence. Actually, even though this is the opener, this is the longest song on the album, and at only 3:54! Really good way to start off the album.<br /><br />\\"Parasite\\": Love that riff! Peter Criss puts in some wicked drumming, Gene's vocal performance is high-quality, and Ace's stunning guitar soloing will leave you wanting more! Absolute rocker!<br /><br />\\"Goin' Blind\\": A redo from Gene and Paul's Wicked Lester days. A haunting ballad-style song that I tend to think of as a \\"half-ballad\\". It has the feel of one, but is a bit more potent than your typical ballad. I always get such a strange image when I hear Gene sing, \\"But you're sixteen and I'm ninety-three\\".<br /><br />\\"Hotter Than Hell\\": Another nice riff-rocker, and actually, this is a song about rejection that I don't mind hearing! Love the transition riff, it adds the heaviness to this one, and Ace's slow-motion blazing solo does, as well.<br /><br />\\"Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll\\": At only 2:14, one would never think that so much incredible guitar work could be displayed in this anthem. An underrated, if short, Kiss gem that should definitely be enjoyed by your ears.<br /><br />\\"All The Way\\": This is one of those songs that contains lyrics that aren't really too serious. I mean, hearing Gene sing things like, \\"You keep talking to your mother and father/ One of these days you're gonna push me all the way!\\", or however the lyric goes, shows that while Kiss can be heavy, they aren't neccessarily stiff or dark.<br /><br />\\"Watchin' You\\": What a song! We got ourselves a sexy, heavy riff and some interesting lyrics, not to mention more of Ace's great guitar soloing. I love how at the end, they slightly change the lyric and sing, \\"Everybody else is here, watchin' us!\\".<br /><br />\\"Mainline\\": The second-longest song on the album, at just a few seconds shorter than \\"Got To Choose\\". I got a kick outta hearin' Gene sing \\"I'm needin' some lovin'/ I'm hot like an oven/ It's so true\\". Actually, this song works well, in contrast to the darker shades of the lyrics in \\"Watchin' You\\".<br /><br />\\"Coming Home\\": A melodic anthem with a catchy guitar riff, however, surprisingly, I don't recall a solo in this one! *gasp* Aw well, this two and a half minute rocker is still great.<br /><br />\\"Strange Ways\\": A super-heavy riff rocker that's a really good way to end the album. Peter Criss's voice is perfect for the song, I just how soulful he sings the lyrics, especially when he sings, \\"So you can realize/ That I can set you free!\\". And Ace Frehley provides an outstandingly superb Jimi Hendrix-esque guitar solo. Such an awesome song with that F-minor groove!<br /><br />Overall: While this may be different from other Kiss album, like others, it has its pros and cons, but is a great addition to any Kiss fan's collection. As I stated before, this is a rare find in store, but if youfind it, you should definitely get it (or here on Amazon, that works well, too, obviously!). I hope you enjoy it like I did, rock on, and peace!zon, that works well, too, obviously!). I hope you enjoy it like I did, rock on, and peace!
B00005JKGO|3.0|I watched this classic, but weird film from Federico Fellini, who is noteworthy for his twisted, distorted films I felt it was dull and in line with the rest of his films.<br /><br />Until happy little Nico (of the Velvet Underground)sparked up onto the screen with the happiness and youth of a sparrow. She is grand in her role. She's in the prime of her beauty and she just fits in with the whole nonsense of the film.<br /><br />Fellini cast her immediately although most of the footage was already shot, not about to bypass getting this young and giggling beauty into a piece of his puzzle.

B000068TPN|5.0|We Were Soldiers is about a Lieutenant Colonel Harold Moore(played by Mel Gibson), commanding officer of one of the infantry battalions, the 1st of the 7th, of the 1st Calvary Division, during a fight in the Fall of 1965,since the book was written by Colonel Moore, now Lieutenant General (retired).  Colonel Moore comes off looking pretty good.  Maybe he was, maybe that's why he made Lieutenant General.<br /><br />All I can say is Hollywood sure loves napalm (it isn't anywhere near as effective as shown in the movie; the Air Force must have paid to have the movie made.  All I can say is that I never had a Phantom stay on station longer than ten minutes and you had to cease firing all artillery and mortars before they'd come in.  All for one or two 500 pound bombs.  Just not worth it.<br /><br />Artillery on the other hand could crank out 60 105mm rounds per minute sustained fire with a battery of six howitzers. . That's with just with the direct support 105mm howitzers in direct support of the infantry battalion, not counting any 155mm or eight inchers.<br /><br />This movie is primarily about the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley.  As far as I could tell it was fairly realistic, except that:<br /><br />I never saw the first tracer round fired and no one showed an illumination fire mission.  Useful when you're fighting at night.  They did show the infantry firing their 81mm mortars and their four deuces.  I used these primarily for illumination fire mission, of course I was in Viet Nam somewhat later, in 1969 and 1970, and had some twenty batteries of artillery that could shoot for me.<br /><br />As an artillery officer I'm appalled at how poorly they used their artillery fire support.  I would have relieved my forward observer if that had been mine.  Maybe artillery needs to hire a better PR firm.<br /><br />All-in-all an entertaining movie.<br /><br />The movie is rated R for a reason.  A lot of blood and guts.<br /><br />Gunner  June, 2007
B000N6TX1I|4.0|This movie starts slow. I cant deny that. I think the writer knew what he wanted for the middle and the end but wasnt sure how to get there. But if you can sit through the first half an hour or so with an open mind and a slightly puzzled look this becomes one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in ages. The war scenes are some of the most impressive I've ever seen. Something like you'd imagine from the holocaust. And then if you grasp the dozens of messages that the movie sends, Hope, the potential cruelty of man, the strenght of man, the miracle of life. It's really very beautiful.

B000OW77UU|4.0|I am a big fan of Will Smith and this movie is in  a different genre than the other films I have seen him in.  It was a really good movie and it kept my attention.  It really shows just how difficult it is when you are a single parent trying to make it financially, emotionally, and spiritually.  Although he slept many nights in a homeless shelter, or one night in a bathroom at the subway station...he continued to be a good role model for his son.  The part that made me cry is when it showed him donating blood to get $20.   <br /> <br />I would have really liked to have seen some parts of him as a successful man but the movie ended too soon. Once again, Will Smith done a great job and in my opinion he is better than the movie.  But...I will recommend it to anyone that likes drama.

B000PFUAO6|1.0|First let me say I am not a strictly \\"old school DT fan\\". I loved the first disc of 6DOIT and thought Octavarium was a flawed but good album heading in the right direction.    I purchased Systematic Chaos with low expectations and they were not met. TOT was my least favorite album... but it was cohesive. Octavarium seemed to signal a return to song writing in favor of pointless soloing and featured a great track in Octavarium. However, Systematic Chaos has managed to combine a horrific lyrical effort with stale production and meandering guitar/keyboard solo's to the point of exhaustion. Add the frequent use of vocal harmonies already featured on past albums and recycled lyrics, both in content and theme, and you get Systematic Chaos.    The band desperately needs to bring in an outside producer to spark creativity and provide balance. By balance I am referring to harnessing the ego-maniacal and dull soloing efforts of Petrucci and Rudess. Both are exemplary players but their self-indulgent call and response expositions have become tedious. The solo's no longer provide depth and emotional punch. When the band had Moore and Sherinian they provided balance (along with Myung) to the over the top efforts of Petrucci and Portnoy. Now with Rudess, the band is 75% ego-maniacal soloist with 1 man holding down the fort, John Myung. Not that it really matters at this point as Myung is virtually mixed out by Petrucci and Portnoy on SC. As for the vocals... if the band is going to continue in a generic metal direction James Labrie is not going to work. He voice isn't ballsy enough to compliment the music and his ability to create unique vocal lines has greatly diminished. Credit this to songwriting that has become repetitive and predictable and a lack of writing before hitting the studio.    [note to  band] Adding keyboards to generic metal with long songs does not make you progressive. Nor does including a multi-part \\"epic\\" [end note]    I can't decide if the band simply doesn't care any more and is doing it for the money or if they truly think this is \\"good\\" music. Petrucci needs to take \\"...And Justice for All\\" out of his CD player, take some time off with his band mates, (i.e., no side projects) and let the well of creativity replenish. Then sit down and write good songs BEFORE going in the studio.  I will buy their next album because I love the band but if it is somehow worse than SC I am turning in my DT ultra dork fan club pass. This is one man's opinion but an opinion that seems to be shared by quite a few other DT fans. This album is embarrassing for DT.    edit: My 1 star rating for this album is based on my expectations for one of my favorite bands, not as a comparison against other music in the genre or otherwise.

The result will be disasterous. Blink should not be a substitute of years of experiences and hard work.
0596527055|5.0|While taking on the role of myth-buster; Scott provides insights into how innovations really happen and more important how they gain adoption. Like his first book, [[ASIN:0596007868 The Art of Project Management (Theory in Practice (O'Reilly))]], Scott's witty style makes the book easy and enjoyable to read.   There's much in the book that makes you rethink and question the common views of innovation.  While each chapter presents good insights, I especially liked chapter 9 \\"Problems and Solutions.\\"  Scott does a great job pointing that the real key is correctly defining and framing the problem. <br />  <br />Some relevant quotes: <br /> <br />Problem solving is not nearly as important as problem finding. <br /> <br />Problem finding--problem solving's shy, freckled, but confident cousin--is the craft of defining challenges so they are easier to solve. <br /> <br />Discovering problems actually requires just as much creativity as discovering solutions. There are many ways to look at any problem, and realizing a problem is often the first step toward a creative solution. <br />  <br />I highly recommend this book. It's a short easy to read book; one that will keep you entertained during a cross-country flight. <br />
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Some operas live charmed lives both on DVD and CD.  This is one of them. We have the Met/Pavarotti-Battle DVD and the Scotto-Bergonzi DVD.  We also have several great casts on just CD and almost everyone of them presents an accurate presentation of what the composer asks for.  This is not as easy as it sounds.  Many Traviatas fall short of our expectations; just to name one opera that gets over recorded and not always well.  Now let me be honest and say I don't always enjoy or get into much comic opera; Don Giovanni being an exception. It's really a comedy, tragedy and old fashioned morality play all rolled into one.  Absurd plots and many farces just don't cut it with me.  I took a risk on this DVD just to see and hear Netrebko and Villazon.  I am not disappointed!  This entire cast and production do Donizetti and this opera full justice.  Netrebko is enchanting.  Villazon is unique and special.  He's almost Groucho Marx with a great voice.  His entire face and body is an actor's dream come true and he can sing while being so physically flexible.  His voice strikes my ear as having a little bit of Domingo and DiStefano in it.  The aria \\"Una Furtiva Lagrima\\" has to be encored and is even slightly better the second time.  After all his comic posturing his straight forward singing here is just a perfect contrast to all that came before.  This DVD should be added to the Battle/Pavarotti and Scotto/Bergonzi if you already own them.  Like I said I'm not the biggest fan of comic opera; yet, this production completely won me over.  This is an enchanting evening for eye and ear with some glorious melodies by Donizetti.  ENJOY!!!
1400063515|3.0|First of all, I agree with the general point of the book. Taleb is right, no doubt about it. The bell curve is inadequate to describe most real world situations, even (or perhaps especially) those to which it is most commonly applied. <br /> <br />There are plenty of reviews here that will describe everything that is right about the book -- and there is a great deal. However, I lost patience early and had a hard time makingmy way through the book. Here's the primary reason why: <br /> <br />It's not well-written.  <br /> <br />Now, at first, I did not notice that, because the writing is fluent and of an appropriate level of complexity to be compatible with the ideas being discussed. The problem is something more structural. I'll give only one example. <br /> <br />The author refers over and over again to \\"black swans\\" but if you don't read the preface, he never gives a definition of this term. Moreover, even there, he gives only a cursory reference to it. When I read the preface, I figured that the impossibly light treatment of his core metaphor was acceptable because he would undoubtedly define it or explore it in somewhat more depth in the body of the book. No such luck. <br /> <br />If you are a person who skips over prefaces, this book would leae you confused as to what his central metaphor is. Moreover, it's an extremely powerful metaphor. It deserves more than two sentences to describe it.  <br /> <br />Near as I can tell, the author's anger got in the way of structuring this book more robustly. He had an enormous amount of important stuff to say, and he couldn't wait to say it, even though the notion of a black swan is both arresting and useful. So he skipped grounding that image in the reader's mind, and made the reader work too hard. <br /> <br />This is one example of ways in which the book's structure interfered in the clean presentation of his very powerful ideas. There's too much repetition, too much anger, too many digressions that look like they should matter but whose relevance is left unclarified. <br /> <br />I still think everyone should read the book. I just wish that was tantamout to a recommendation to work harder than everyone should have to work, just to follow the arguments the author makes.

B000026FOA|5.0|With this ten dollar CD purchase, I replaced the import vinyl version I purchased back in the 70s for basically the same amount of dough. \\"Five Leaves Left\\" is probably one of the best debut albums anyone's ever produced (there's a list I need to make), and nearly four decades after it was released it sounds amazingly fresh. \\"Cello Song,\\" \\"When the Day is Done,\\" \\"Man in a Shed,\\"...I could rave about individual songs but the truth is there's not a clunker in the bunch.  <br />A lot of CD collections have been compiled of Drake's music, with added outtakes, demos and such. I think the best way to listen to \\"Five Leaves Left\\" and \\"Bryter Layter\\" are to listen to the songs in the order that they were originally presented. A lot of musicians cite Drake as an influence, but his vocal phrasing, poetic lyrics and odd guitar tunings make his music like no other I've ever heard. Some find his music depressing, I find it like a rainy Sunday afternoon...melancholy but much needed for growth.

B00000K19E|4.0|If one could rate a movie's greatness by how many other copy it, then the Matrix has to be one of the greatest movies of all time.  This movie was the first US film to use \\"bullet time\\" whereby entire action scenes are filmed in slow motion slow enough to see bullets move across the air.  This is also the first movie to copy martial arts fighting scenes from Chinese films, and incorporate them into an American film in totality, including freeze frame shots, 360 pans, and really high jump kicks.  Combined with the great storyline, dialogue and casting, this movie became a trendsetter.  Other movies like LOTR, Shrek, and even Animal Channel specials have copied this style of action films.  <br /> <br />The storyline itself is incredible, probably the best plot of any movie released in 1999.  But it is not wholly original.  Earlier in the decade the sci-fi movie Dark City was released, and back-to-back viewings of both movies reveal many similarities in the story, setting and even cinematography.    <br /> <br />The casting was great.  This is by far the best movie for Keanu Reeves.  This movie was also groundbreaking in having a black actor and black actress in key protagonist roles; these being Morpheus and the Oracle.  The casting of Carrie-Ann Moss was also great.  A younger woman would not have lent the emotional weight as Ms. Moss.  The use of a sexier woman might have reminded fans more of the Pamela Anderson bomb, Barbed Wire.  Carrie-Ann Moss was the perfect actress to play Trinity; athletic but not buff, attractive but not bombshell, mature but not old.  Interestingly, the movie's basis on science and computers has kicked of a fashion trend in US cities with large populations of young East Asian women in the high tech fields such as Seattle or San Francisco.  Walking through these downtowns one can notice the large number of hot Asian chics dressed in black in the style of Trinity. <br /> <br />This DVD is fairly simple; the same movie as in theaters, some special features but no extended scenes.  The movie is a great watch, but since it shows so often on TV, I would not recommend buying this DVD.
B000002O1Q|5.0|I loved this movie back when it came out and I still do.  Great music for those of us growing up in the 80's.  Would recommend this to anyone wanting to reminisce.  Diane Lane, Michael Pare, and Willem Dafoe are great.  Hope you enjoy as much as I did.
B000PGTPE6|5.0|I can't find enough superlatives to describe this album.  Of course the SEEGER SESSIONS were great, but the live context adds so much to the songs.  Pete Seeger always believed that they should be sung in unison by a crowd, and the Dublin audience doesn't disappoint.  It sounds like the biggest backporch picking session in the universe, an overwhelming stretch of humanity bridging the folk/jazz/gospel traditions of Ireland, the British Isles, Appalachia, the French islands and New Orleans.  Bruce is truly bringing it all back home with this recording.  Ten stars!
1416524800|3.0|If you pick up \\"Deception Point\\" expecting to find another installment of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", you're likely to be disappointed.  However, if you just want a good non-stop read, with action, intrigue, \\"science stuff\\", and derring-do, you'll find all in abundance.  Think Clive Cussler rather than Tom Clancy--if you stop to think too much about some of the situations and some of the \\"science\\", you'll miss out on a fair amount of the fun.  Just go along for the ride and enjoy it.<br /><br />By strange coincidence, this book is just the right length to get you through the wait in an airport, a domestic flight, and leave just enough for a relaxing afternoon read as you catch up with your jet lag.  A useful length, and just the tale to lose oneself in while \\"in transit\\".

0385522401|4.0|Ian McEwan's \\"On Chesil Beach\\" is a slight but poignant short novel about a wedding night gone awry.  The year is 1962, and Edward Mayhew is looking forward to his honeymoon.  His bride, Florence Ponting, loves her husband, but the idea of a close physical encounter with him makes her ill.  Edward is a historian and Florence is a gifted violinist, but their intellects are of no use at a time like this.  They are both sexually inexperienced and neither one knows how to communicate honestly with the other.<br /><br />McEwan sets his story against the backdrop of a world on the brink of great change.  The next decade will bring about a transformation that will liberate many of the repressed individuals who grew up in the stifling fifties.  However, the late sixties and seventies are in the future, and although Edward and Florence consider themselves to be adults, they are actually as naive and inarticulate as small children.  There is sardonic humor in Florence's dread at the idea of succumbing to her husband:  \\"There was nothing she could do, beyond fainting, and she was hopeless at acting.\\"  For his part, Edward \\"loved her, but he wanted to shake her awake.\\"<br /><br />\\"On Chesil Beach\\" is a slice-of-life narrative about a particular couple living in a specific time and place who are acting at cross-purposes.  McEwan describes each scene with exquisite detail, and he deftly plumbs his characters' feelings of joy, despair, panic, and anger.  The author is not making a grand statement; he does not indulge in melodrama to make his point.  He is simply exploring how two people who care deeply for one another can be out of sync in ways that will alter the direction of their lives forever.
073930870X|1.0|This review only pertains to the audio book.  While I think GRRM is the greatest writer of the genre (including Tolkien), the choice of Roy Dotrice to read the work is poor.  First of all, he's too old and his vocal register ranges from scratchy to drooling.  His voicing for the younger protagonists are completely unbelievable--Robb sounds like he's 40 and a connoisseur of scotch and cigarettes, and don't get me started on Bran, Arya, or Jon.  Furthermore, Dotrice portrays everyone except Tyrion, Cersei, and the major characters in a Cockney accent that contradicts the emotional intricacies of Gendry, especially, but also Davos, Yoren, Old Nan, and both Cleganes.  I'm sorry, but the Mountain and the Hound spoken like drunken gutter dwellers from Liverpool undercuts the dread that their characters are meant to convey.  It takes the poignancy of the Onion Knight and reduces him to a level of parody that would be hard to believe Martin intended. I know he was supposed to be a smuggler and all, but please.  Probably most disappointing in the recording is Dotrice's voicing of Varys.  Rather than portraying the eunuch with the web-like langour yet intricacy of tone his character demands, Dotrice reads him in the manner of a deep-voiced, drunken stooge--the listener can almost see the drool dripping from his lips as he sloshes oh so slowly through Varys' dialogue, rendering the arguably most intelligent character in the saga (with the possible exception of Tyrion) as a self-righteous booze hound.  These atrocities are probably why Martin's publisher bailed on Dotrice after Storm of Swords in favor of John Lee, whose vocal range, characterization, and tessitura is far more suited for the majesty of Martin's work.  Here's hoping for a new production of Clash of Kings--one that treats the story with as much care as Martin took in the writing of it.

B000MNOX7Q|4.0|Very much enjoyed the film!  The Blu-ray disc was HD perfection.  Acting, direction, camera work, and all other crafts were very good.  The \\"switch\\" at the end can be easily perceived by the middle of the story, but it did not lessen the enjoyment. A good night seeing a film at the theater -- the big screen one in my own home that is, sans noisy, rude people, no outrageous priced snacks, no out of focus projection, no soundtrack cranked up to ear drum-breaking level, and no sub-zero air-conditioning.  Ah, the way movies should be seen!  Identity = good, but rent, don't buy.
B000IJ79V6|5.0|Usually only the first movie in a series of movies with the same title is the best, but thhis is not the case with superman 2.

B00008EPMD|4.0|This 1973 release by Emerson, Lake and Palmer showcases the genius and vision of a post-apocolyptic world leading with technological enslavement of humankind. We take a visceral ride into the underbelly of a dark, dreary world as if a carney beckoned us to enter a freak show we were unable to resist.  Once inside, there is no turning back... We fasten our seatbelts tightly and hold on for the ride.  \\"Jerusalem\\" prepares us for the journey as we whirl through \\"Toccata\\" and the crystalized flesh of a long-dead love with \\"Still... You Turn Me On\\".  This album showcases the musical versatility of ELP as we switch from classical, to rock to ragtime to what was then a new genre led by a moog synthesizer in \\"Karn Evil 9\\".  What a delicious ride with such forbidden fruit!  Thirty-four years after the original release, this music is still as vital and fresh and compelling as during the original release.  Are ELP seers?  How did they foretell the grip that technology would have on everyone?  Listen carefully and we may receive the answer.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This is a thinking mans' rock album.  Rush has put together an album based on the idea of faith and religion, and although somewhat skewed to the agnostic's point of view, is still a provacative, thought-provoking and well crafted piece of music.  Strongly recommended for all Rush fans.  The band has changed over time, but they have shown growth, and not atrophy, and consistency that is to be admired.  Way to go!

009926689X|1.0|I thought perhaps it was just me, but I can see from other reviews that many people agree: this book is disturbing.  It portrays a stalking, dysfunctional relationship, and frankly, it kind of makes my skin crawl.  Perhaps the people who think it is poignant or sweet are not paying very close attention when they read it.  With so many other wonderful books out there that express the mother/child relationship, the cycle of life and death, and the idea of unconditional love, I cannot understand why anyone would purchase this or even borrow it from the library.
1563899426|4.0|First off, I need to come right out and say this book was an absolute surprise. I had heard about the series but no one told me it was in comic book form. I was a little stunned at first,but by the middle of the book I was totally enthralled. The story line is priceless. The author uses every fairytale, fable and obscure nursery rhyme character there is and makes The Young & The Restless look like Leave It To Beaver. I am not going to tell you the plot because it wouldnt do any justice to whats really going on. I have read the other reviews and I still wasnt prepared for it. I've only read the first two books and I cant wait to get the rest of the series. enjoy!

B000PFUAO6|5.0|Dream Theater's ninth album Systematic Chaos is something that I have been looking forward to a long time now, ever since the disappointment of Octavarium.  Before listening to the album, I had mixed expectations.  On one hand, 2005's Octavarium was a significant letdown and easily the band's worst release.  Conversely, this is after all, a Dream Theater album so I had reason to be hopeful.  After having listened to it several times, I have to say that the album surpassed even my highest expectation. <br /> <br />Systematic Chaos is every bit as heavy as the undeservedly criticized Train Of Thought, and that creative spark from the SFAM days is back, making for a great combination.  Overall the album is very strong instrumentally and its only real flaw is that it isn't very strong lyrically. <br /> <br />In The Presence of Enemies Pt. 1 is the fantastic opening song.  The first 5 minutes consist of an impressive instrumental display by the most talented band in contemporary music, and it sets the tone for what promises to be a great album.  The rest of the song carries that energy into the next song, the energetic \\"ballad\\" Forsaken.  Unlike Octavarium, which was opened by the powerful and heavy \\"The Root Of All Evil,\\" there is no letdown after this album's great opener.  9:00 <br /> <br />Left and right I keep hearing people refer to Forsaken as a ballad, and I don't really consider it to be one.  The album is laced with catchy yet aggressive riffs and some beautiful singing by Labrie, who sounds great on the entire album.  Forsaken has restored my faith in Dream Theater's ability to write softer songs after the embarrassing \\"I Walk Beside You\\" and just plain boring \\"Vacant\\" from Octavarium and Train Of Thought.  Although not quite as good as \\"Another Day\\" or \\"Innocence Faded,\\" the song is still very good and well deserving of a place on the album.  5:35 <br /> <br />Constant Motion is the band's first single from Systematic Chaos.  Although the debate as to whetherthis is a tribute to or rip off of Metallica is going to be ignored by my part, all I can say is that Metallica wishes they could play at the level Dream Theater sleeps at.  Petrucci's heavy, driving riffing mixes well with Labrie and Portnoy's alternating vocals.  I have always liked when Portnoy sings, as it adds another dimension to whatever song he sings in.  6:55 <br /> <br />The Dark Eternal Night is completely unlike anything Dream Theater has ever done.  This is the least impressive song on the album, yet it does have its merits.  The combination of Labrie and Portnoy using distorted vocals is something new, but the song is just too slow and choppy.  It does have an instrumental bridge which redeems the rest of the song.  Both positives and negatives taken into consideration, it is better than half of the songs on Octavarium.  8:53 <br /> <br />Next is Repentence, which continues Mike Portnoy's multi-album AA project (steps eight and nine).  The first half of the song is a very haunting serenade by Labrie followed by a nice solo by Petrucci.  The second half was a bit of a bore, where there are spoken apologies from many different personalities such as Mikael Akerfeldt, Daniel Gildenlow and most surprisingly former Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho.  The song's first half was great but the second half felt like it carried on way too long.  Still a worthwhile track though, and a radical departure from its shredfest predecessors in Portnoy's AA odyssey.  10:43 <br /> <br />Next is the often spoke of Prophets of War, which has a very upbeat, almost techno-like opening beat.  The song has a decent ambience but its lyrics are preachy and with the exception of \\"Sacrificed Sons,\\" Dream Theater is not very good at writing politically based lyrics.  Another weak point of the album.  6:00 <br /> <br />The last two songs of the album are about as good as any back to back pair of Dream Theater songs written.  The Ministry of Dark Souls clocks in at just under fifteen minutes and does not disappoint.  The song has surprisingly poignant lyrics.  It is very slow and melodic until slightly after halfway in, where it increases in tempo setting up *shocker* another instrumental bridge, a final chorus, and then finally an instrumental outro leading perfectly into the album's spectactular finale...  14:57 <br /> <br />In The Presence of Enemies Pt. 2 is an absolutely breathtaking closer, this coming from the band who can't seem to screw up an album finale.  The song starts off very slowly and builds up using a great melodic chorus, although the lyrics are silly (Dark Master I will die for you, quite ridiculous for a prog-metal band), its kind of weird to hear Dream Theater write Power Metal-esque lyrics.  However, In The Presence of Enemies continues to build to its peak which carries it for a surprisingly long time without letting down in energy.  The end of the song is capped by a stunning instrumental fireworks display by John Petrucci, Jordan Rudess and Mike Portnoy, reminiscent of Train of Thought's endless displays of pyrotechnics.  16:38 <br /> <br />All in all, Systematic Chaos was a powerful listen and a worthy addition to the impressive Dream Theater catalog.  After reading some of these other reviews floating around on the internet, I feel the need to address two points: <br /> <br />1) Systematic Chaos is far from being Dream Theater's best album.  It is arguably their darkest work and is easily their best since Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence, which was fantastic in its uber-proginess. <br /> <br />2) Symphony X will never be justifiably compared to Dream Theater.  They are good, but not great. <br /> <br />Systematic Chaos does everything right that Train of Thought and Octavarium could not.  After the disappointment of Octavarium, Systematic Chaos has blown away my highest expectations.  I must say I can't wait for #10 from Dream Theater, after I get my money's worth from #9! <br /> <br />As perfect as an album can be without being Scenes From A Memory.

0380725398|4.0|Jamaica Inn is an amazing book which captivates readers with amazing literary merit. Daphne Du Maurier chooses her words carefully, and it is apparent in her writing of Jamaica Inn. Through her descriptions and personification of the English land to the careful sketch of Aunt Patience, her use of language is complete and gives a tone of mystery to the novel. \\"Sometimes the hills were purple, inkstained, and mottled, and then a feeble ray of sun would come from a wisp of cloud, and one hill would be golden brown while his neighbor still languished in the dark.\\"(26). In this quotation, Du Maurier illustrates the intense, dark, yet forbearing terrain of the moors of England near the dreaded Jamaica Inn. Seeping as it seems, the overtone is dark and mysterious. As with the landscapes, Du Maurier takes careful time drawing up the characters of the book, \\"This was the old Aunt Patience, with nervous hands and twitching mouth, which glanced over her shoulder as she talked. It was pitiable to see her, and Mary caught something of her agitation\\" (100). Such attention is paid to the crucial points of character through the simple yet foreboding descriptions. Her tone throughout the book is clear, and sets a stage for the overall plot and ending. A certain amount of mystery is played in every page and keeps the reader enthralled. \\"But this sudden coming to grace, this quick and exquisite  moving of his hands, was a swift and rather sinister revelation, sinister because it was unexpected and not true to type\\"(17). This message and tone of mystery, deceit keeps the reader on their toes and is magnified in each sentence that flows on each page.  Jamaica Inn is a truly captivating novel and is one to read over and over again.

B000FVNX2Q|4.0|If you are taking courses from The American College they only include the keystrokes for the HP 10BII in the books, so you have to figure out how to do everything on your own.  The 12C has some powerful features not available on the 10BII, but unless you are kind of a 'techie' I would go with the 10BII and save the money.

0757302661|5.0|This is a wonderful book that shows Hypnotists/Hypnotherapists/Hypno-birthing Coaches how and why to use Hypnosis in the birthing process, in  very specific ways; this is a highly instructive book.  Marie provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on using Hypnosis in the form of Hypnobirthing.  This new edition of her book goes a step beyond the previous one, which was also excellent.<br /><br />Since Hypnotherapy is still in its functional infancy as far as its use in traditional medical applications such as childbirth, Marie does a service, not just to prospective mothers, but to the field of Hypnotherapy as well, by demonstrating how well Hypnosis works in the form of Hypnobirthing. While promoting the use of Hypnosis in more traditional medical environments and providing solid instruction as well, Marie has helped to transform a potentially painful, frightening process into a beautiful, transcendent experience for women everywhere.<br /><br />Hats off to Marie for writing a such a comprehensive book on the use of Hypnosis in childbirth !<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

B00005B1W5|5.0|Tribute is one of the Best Concerts Ever. Yanni is the best musician ever and his Tribute album is GOLD. Some of the best pieces of music that Yanni has created are in this album. Performing this great music in front of the Magical Taj Mahal and Forbidden City makes it an unforgetable EVENT
1594200106|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It did take me a few chapters to get into it, but after that I could not put it down. What I most want to mention however, is how impressed i was with the translation. I have read many translated works, and something about the language always feels a bit off. This book's language and writing was stunning, which I have never encountered in a translated work.
0920668372|1.0|I, or rather my husband, recieved this book from his mother to read to our new baby daughter.  She told him that this was her favorite book to read to him growing up.  I read this book and found it to be very disturbing.  The mother creeping into the house and crawling through the window and across the floor to rock her grown son in his sleep.  He obviously has a wife because he then has a daughter.  How would his wife feel about this??  This is not a good story to read to your child.  I would find it very unnerving if my mom wanted to read this to me.  It is great to love your child unconditionally but not to stalk them!!
0375831002|5.0|I randomly found this book and began reading and was hooked within ten pages.  I found it to be a startingly fresh view of World War II and the horrible predicament many good people found themselves in.  What a great read!!  Very clever choice of death as narrator---it adds so much depth to an already excellent book.  I would recommend it to everyone I know.  It is a shame that many will skip over this book due to its young adult classification---a great read.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This recording should have been issued back in the '70s. It is Neil at his finest playing a great selection of material. The DVD is also remarkable in capturing his stage presence as a solo artist.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I guess to be fair, I will give it a couple more spins. It just reminds me of a Fort Minor project, than a Linkin Park project. I recall a couple of tracks on here that were more in the style of Linkin Park.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series renewed my sense of wonder at simply being a member of this planet. There are a myriad visual and auditory wonders to be experienced. All the scenes are coherent and beautifully narrated by Mr. Attenborough. I strongly recommend it for people who have had the opportunity to travel. It doesn't quite serve as a substitute, but comes pretty damn close!
0800141601|4.0|I bought this movie for my 14-year-old son and he absolutely loved it.  He watches it all the time.  The action is wonderful.
B000FVQLRA|1.0|It's been a year since I seen the pianist, The movie has an overall good storyline but the slow paced scenes are \\"yawn worthy\\" if you like movies that have long and slow dialog than you'll truly love this film.
B00005JPD0|5.0|As I say in my title -- even if you saw the movie, get the DVD. The amazing special and visual effects are explained in detail in the DVD special features. It's worth the price just to learn about the Time Window -- trust me. Didn't see the movie or forget what it's about (that seems impossible to do), it's a police procedural drama updated with a time-travel twist that is plausible (maybe not totally believable) but if you suspend disbelief, the special and visual effects reward you for doing so. Denzel Washington is as charismatic as ever as the lead His co-star Val Kilmer actually plays a decent second fiddle in this film. Maybe that's where he belonged originally as a character actor not a lead...which I always found him a bit miscast in the past. Paula Patton plays the romantic love interest who tells us more with action than words thanks to direction by Tony Scott. Scott doesn't disappoint -- therea re car chases and major fireworks when a River ferry is blown to bits. But it's the twist and turns of the script that complement the visual and special effects. Plus the Time Window that brings a very 21st Century feel to this movie. The backdrop of a rebuilt New Orleans adds drama and a bit of romantic mystery to this chase tale. Chasing time, chasing bad guys, chasing bombs...chasing life! Basically Denzel's character Doug Carlin is swept into a federal investigation of a major disaster...filmed after 9/11 -- it's surpring to see the secondary footage/interviews about other 'disasters' the screenwriters considered. Doug meets Paula's character Claire first time in the morgue...or does he...this is where the TIME WINDOW changes it all...I'm a SCI FI fan -- but believe me most of this plays like Science Fact -- and that's what Tony Scott wanted and he got it. Denzel's believabiilty and his healthy skepticism adds to the drama. ENJOY
B000O76TA4|2.0|THIS MOVIE IS NOT IN DTS!!UNFORTUNATELY THIS DISC WAS NOT PROPERLY REVIWED BY AMAZON,IMDB,ETC.THIS IS THE SAME SET AS THE EARLIER TWO DISC SET.I'M MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.I HAD TO OPEN IT TO FIND THIS OUT AND WON'T BE ABLE TO RETURN IT.THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME AND DESERVES TO BE DONE CORRECTLY WITH DTS SOUND.BUYERS BEWARE.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|this album does indeed bridge the gap between octovarium and train of thought. what everyone has got to remember is, even though \\"Images\\" was phenomenal, its not 1992 anymore. the scene has changed and so has the music. Poison isnt just \\"unskinny bop\\" now is it? anyway, this album has alot of great time changes and melodies. forsaken is the end all for me! <br />if jordan left, the only possible replacements would be kevin moore(again) or rick wakeman(from yes).
B000LPS3B2|5.0|What a film. It begins with the accidental running over of a girl and the subsequent decision to run. Bad move. The passenger in the car, a photographer, now finds things going bad at every turn. His pictures don't develop properly; his friends commit suicide and, worse, he finds himself plagued by the spirit of the girl his girlfriend hit.  Crisp direction, convincing leads and excellent special effects make this a winner, not to mention enough jolts to keep you awake for a week. The ending is particularly sobering.   Don't miss this one.
0307237699|4.0|Obama's first book [[ASIN:1400082773 Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance]] was written before he went into politics, and reads like a biography - although he brings up certain societal concerns, it is about his journey to discover himself as someone of mixed heritage that grew up without the presence of his father. \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is written after his unlikely ascension to the national stage as a U.S. Senator and speaker at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. It is not nearly as biographical as his first book, with each chapter focused on a certain aspect of our nation (\\"Republicans and Democrats\\" about partisanship, \\"The World Beyond Our Borders\\" about foreign policy, etc.). It is basically a conversation with Obama about these issues, as he explains his views of what the problems are and some ideas about how they may be approached. Although they are not the focus, personal anecdotes are used throughout the text, and very few portions of the book read like something that could have been generically written by anyone with some knowledge of the issues - Obama's voice and the personal importance of these issues to him easily comes off the page. <br /> <br />In a section of the book in which he explains a conversation he had with Senator Byrd, Obama writes: \\"He told me I would do well in the Senate but that I shouldn't be in too much of a rush - so many senators today became fixated on the White House, not understanding that in the constitutional design it was the Senate that was supreme, the heart and soul of the Republic.\\" When this book was written, thoughts of Presidential candidacy in 2008 couldn't have been absent from the Senator's mind, and although the book's purpose isn't to make the case for Obama as President, it's hard to read it without sincerely believing he would be a great man for the job. I'd strongly recommend this book for anyone that wants to learn more about why Obama might (or, if you decide so, might not) make a good President, HOWEVER there are several portions of the book that are excellent regardless of your views on the man - the chapter on \\"Politics\\" (which explores the process by which and the reasons well-intentioned politicians might become unscrupulous), \\"Faith\\" (which discusses the reconciling of this issues and today's politics), and \\"Our Constitution\\" in particular.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never did watch this when it was on TV.  I only borrowed the DVDs after renting the movie Serenity and realized it was preluded by the TV show. <br /> <br />What an amazing show.  I loved the characters, the storyline and found the movie Serenity more enjoyable after watching the series.  This is a must get to anyone's collection who enjoys SCI FI.   <br /> <br />The show was well written and a trailblazer for other TV shows to follow: The standard cliches you might think you can anticipate from a character are suddenly pulled out from under you to a completely unpredictable comment, adding depth to the character and adding to the enjoyment.  The camara work and special effects are really amazing.  The off-angles and intentional use of the sometimes \\"unsteady\\" camera add to the effect of being there. <br /> <br />---***  THE BOTTOM LINE ***--- <br />One of the Greatest TV shows to be cancelled unnecessarily. <br />One of the Greatest Sci Fi TV shows ever. <br />You MUST add this to your collection if you enjoy anything Sci Fi <br /> <br />There's no need to describe the show.  If you haven't seen it, just get it - you will not be disappointed.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  For those who aren't familiar with \\"Firefly\\" TV series this is based on (one of the best Sci Fi series, by the way) don't worry.  This movie stands on its own if you have never even heard of \\"Firefly\\" (which I had not when I first got this movie.  I only learned of the series after). <br /> <br />Lots of satisfying action, comic relief and good acting.  One of my favorite movies to watch over and over. <br /> <br />---*** THE BOTTOM LINE ***--- <br />1. You DONT need to have seen or even to know the \\"Firefly\\" TV series to enjoy and understand this film.  But I bet you will want to after seeing this film. <br />2.  If you buy only movies you want to watch over and over again, then this is a definite keeper.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|I was a little apprehensive upon hearing a couple of the songs plus comments that it might be a shred fest again like TOT.  Upon listening I was surprised that it's not.  It does have its moments of shredding from Petrucci, Portnoy, and Rudess but not as excessively as I thought.  Overall I gave this 4 stars and not 5 only because I don't think it stands out as their best.  The one thing that really annoys me is Rudess and his keyboard (please, change it up).  On the song 'Forsaken' it's just downright annoying, at least for me.  Those times when he throws in his little twang throughout the song is redundant throughout all the cd's he's been on with Dream Theater.  Enough already.  I wonder what direction the guys would have taken if Moore hadn 't left the band.  I see alot of similarities also to Scenes, especially keyboard wise and like I said, it becomes redundant.  Favorite track so far would be 'Forsaken' even with the annoying keyboard effect.  'Repentance' would be another stand-out continuing the 12 step program of Portnoy's.  As one reviewer said you can see how they are starting to put this together where I've also stated before to be on the look-out for this concept song to come as a cd all on its own.  So, whether Portnoy will finish it up on the next cd or two or just complete it and release it on its own;  we'll just have to wait and see.  I really can't say a whole lot in the negative here because it is a solid release and way better then what's on the mainstream today.  Good for us on what the mainstream is missing out on.  And for all those radio stations like WMMR of Philadelphia that claim they have it going on with new music, shame on them for not playing all the great bands that are currently out there in the progressive scene that just blow away anything that they are currently playing.  If you're not familiar with Dream Theater you might want to start with 'Images and Words' or 'Awake' to get your appetite wet before moving on to their other cd's.  And for all those fans out there who keep denouncing LaBrie as not right for the band and no longer a credible singer, please, move onto some other group to trash.  Your opinions just don't matter in that regard.  Even though sometimes I don't agree with some of the musical style of a cd, either LaBrie or Dream Theater, he is still a great fit for the band.  They would never have gotten this far if he hadn't of signed on after their first cd.  Enjoy!d's.

B000NQR7LQ|5.0|For those who already know and have this album don't hesitate to buy this new version on hybrid SACD.  Even on a regular CD player the sound is amazing much more details and clarity. Also the DVD bonus are very good and interesting. Ray Shulman (from Gentle Giant) made all the DVD authoring, it's great to see his name along the credit with this long time contemporary band.  Probably with A Trick of the Tail, and Selling England by the Pound their finest musically effort.  You will apreciate this piece of art. Go for this version even if it's more expensive then the regular.  Hybrid SACD are superior then CD, again even on regular player.

B00005QIPH|5.0|When this album came out in the Fall of 2001, it hit my friends and I like a sledgehammer. We found ourselves endlessly trying to come up with analogies to describe the sound, and we could never quite do it. All of my friends, who had tastes ranging from punk to indie rock to radio pop, loved this record. The songs were simply that memorable and that good. Unfortunately, the Strokes were largely dismissed as an image band or a hipster band. Even worse, their follow-up albums honestly weren't as good. Still, this thing still puts a smile on my face every time. I rank it as high as any classic album ever made.
B0000634EV|2.0|I expected more as the singer is from one of the heaviest bands ever known.  Decentish, but I wasn't very pleased.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|From the very first drum beat and guitar crunch on the first song Hour 1 to the very last vocal on the las song, Humanity, the Scorpions bring the house down with an incredible album.<br /><br />This isn't just a good disc, it is a must.  Many others have broken down the the concept of the album, so I'll just back up the consensus that this album is a must own for any rocker.<br /><br />The production is crisp and clear and just superb.  Guitar solos are sizzling and the flow of the album is great.<br /><br />I honestly can't say enough good things about Humanity - Hour 1!

B000005GUL|5.0|OK, folks. I will herewith give you a piece of very great information to give your opera collection a \\"step up\\"!<br /><br />Already read other opinions and reviews of \\"Der Freischutz\\"?<br /><br />Well, FORGET Eric and Carlos Kleiber, Davis, Furtwangler, Heger, Sawallisch.....hold on to Kubelik, and definately rush out and grab a copy of this fabulous recording with Keilberth at the helm! Wow! First Place is not an option for this recording...it's an inevitable necessity!<br /><br />All soloists in this effort shine like the stars. Particularly the lovely (as always) Elisabeth Grummer...my God this lady was wonderful, and is, I am sure, greatly missed by all the great German opera houses today. Hermann Prey...truly one of the greatest German singers of the recent past. Is there anything that this man could not sing and truly make it his own!? Gottlob Frick...just look at his output in the realm of \\"German\\" operatic recordings! Truly the man stands at the top of the pile, approached perhaps most closely by George London. Joseph Keilberth...what was it that this man had! And how wonderful that he is having a golden rebirth with the release of his truly stupendous \\"Ring\\" this past year, and the re-issue of so many of his truly benchmark recordings! Let's not kid ourselves, this man ranked up there with Knappertsbusch.<br /><br />As in so many cases, we owe EMI many thanks for the foresight to preserve these artists' efforts for us to enjoy forever. There are MANY good recordings of \\"Der Freischutz\\", and a FEW great recordings of it, and ONE top-notch (Kubelik) recording of the work. Then, there is this recording...the SUPREME testament to Carl Maria von Weber's great masterpiece!<br /><br />As I said in the title of this review, this is the MAGIC recording of this wonderful work, concerning magic bullets, and redemption, the First great example of German national opera.......carried on later, of course, by the supreme master, Richard Wagner.<br /><br />Pick up this recording, and allow it's supreme greatness to wash over you, and delight your heart with the lovely efforts of all the participants...a benchmark, desert island disc. Do Enjoy! ~operabruinover you, and delight your heart with the lovely efforts of all the participants...a benchmark, desert island disc. Do Enjoy! ~operabruin

1400049628|4.0|Got this for my brother-in-Law for his B-day. He said that he has already been stockpiling many of the supplies listed in this book.  <br /> <br />I've glanced at the book some and my feeling is if you're gonna fight off Zombie hordes, come up with some kind of catapolt or device for moving alot of mass a one time. This would be used for the hostages that one must take and tie up to apease the Zombies and keep them from eating you or those you would be charged to protect. Of course if news breaks of a Zombie group moving around in the area you live in, rustle up all those folks that you never really liked and use them for ... well, just use them for something that betters your own situation.
B000OZ2CZW|2.0|She Is Beautiful and Talented however this album in my opinion does not showcase her true ability. It almost changed her whole image and sound. I expected more and would think with producers like she has they would have made this more appealing.
B00000AFDW|5.0|I love this record!!! And it's of course steeped in controversy just like Dynasty and Destroyer due to ghost players taking Ace and Peter's roles. But, oh well. Every single song is  a winner. The only shame is that the song \\"It's My Life\\" from the box set didn't make the album. That is one heckuva good song. But from the title track to all of Gene's offerings this album rocks! And sonically it's everything it should be. I think \\"I Pledge Allegiance...\\" is one of Paul's greatest songs ever! And I think \\"Within\\" is one of Gene's best. \\"Raise Your Glasses\\" is such agreat song, great melody. \\"Into the Void\\" is classic Ace. \\"In Your Face\\" is a cool unreleased Ace song written by Gene which just kicks you in the butt. Okay maybe \\"You Wanted the Best\\" is a bit corny, but I feel it works in the context of things here and I love Ace's solo on that one. I only wish that Peter's \\"I Finally Found My Way\\" could have been a hit. It deserved to be. Ezrin and Paul did a great job on the writing of that and Peter sings the crap out of it. It's really a great song. If this was to be, and I think that it was, the last Kiss album, then they really ended on a strong note. This album is like Destroyer meets Creatures meets Revenge. I love it. It's their highest debut at #3, and it sold well (Gold)despite little radio play except for \\"Psycho Circus\\". The tour was awesome, and I just miss the excitment of the whole deal. It was really great!
B000BBOUU4|4.0|I was surprised to discover that except for the Dicken's Christmas Carol ending,  this movie is actually a traditional horror flick with training wheels for elementary school kids. Johnny Depp does a delightfully maladjusted mad scientist act, supported by an entire tribe of eager Igors. As in any Spam in a Cabin flick - the victims are picked off, one by one. A special acknowledgement should go to the person or persons who did the amazing hand knit blankets, scarves and sweaters featured in the scenes with the grandparents. If you enjoyed the art direction in this one, you might enjoy the 5,000 Fingers of Professor T.
B000001EXR|4.0|I really like this album. The problem is maybe it's too good and too different from classic Kiss. Sound familiar? Yes, just like The Elder. The music isn't bad, just very different for Kiss. And this time, it's very very heavy and it does sound derivitive of Alice in Chains or Soundgarden. My favorite is Paul's \\"Jungle\\". And that one received a lot of airplay at least on stations where I lived in PA. Most of Gene's songs are quite good. \\"Hate\\" is like a faster \\"Unholy\\". But I like \\"Childhood's End\\"  - that sounds like a distant relative to \\"Goin Blind\\". \\"Rain\\" and \\"Master and Slave\\" are very cool hard rockin songs from Paul. Had the reunion not happened, I'm not sure how this album would have really been received. It's a shame it didn't come out in like 93 or 94 when it could have had a shot. But by 1997, everyone was Kiss Make-up crazy and this record got lost in the shuffle. But I give them kudos for trying something creative and really experimenting.
B000002UAU|5.0|Any decent music lover should have this album in his collection. It is known worldwide as the best rock album of ALL TIME. Pretty sure today's great artists like Coldplay, U2 and James Blunt got influence from this album in one way or another.     The album starts with the famous progressive sequence of Sgt. Peppers, With A Little Help From My Friends and Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. At the time, this alone was a huge innovation. Getting Better will surely hook you up with it entertaining riffs. According to me, She's Leaving Home is one of McCartney's greatest gem. A lot of people never noticed how great that song is with its harp intro and orchestral arrangement.     Unforgettable album from Sgt. Pepper's guitar intro to the awesome and unique ending of A Day In The Life. Moreover, the new reduced price makes it a perfect purchase.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|This DT album shows that they still alive!!  FORSAKEN ( 5 / 5 ) THE DARK ETERNAL NIGHT ( 5 / 5 ) IN PRESENCE OF ENEMIES I & II ( 5 / 5 ) the best song of this album. Who said that this CD doesn't have nothing new to offer..... what about PROPHETS OF WAR,  FORSAKEN and THE DARK ETERNAL NIGHT  \\"thumbs up\\" these songs are musical proofs that DT is capable to go in other directions with out loosing the essence like other bands. I can hardly wait for the next DT  albums, I'm pretty sure that they will give us a total new experience if they keep in the same track.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush is such a great band with 3 highly skilled musicians. Even the drummer (Neil Peart) is known worldwide as one of the best. This album is once more a proof of the great chemistry between Lee/Lifeson's music and Peart's lyrics.     Rush's work is a great masterpiece overall, but as far as I am concern, the mid and late eras are the band's bests, and this album keeps the pace.
B00005LANG|5.0|I watched a TV documentary the other night about the making of this album and it was a spellbinding hour and a half. Apparently, Bob had to flee Jamaica for the UK after an assassination attempt and ended up living in London for a year. It was during this year that this phenomenal album was recorded. I've owned it for over 20 years now - first on cassette, then on vinyl and finally on CD - and I had no clue that this was so.<br /><br />The album was released in 1977. It was the year of the Queen's Silver Jubilee but Britain was in a very bad place, the seeds of Thatcherism and the heartless 80s had already been sown and Punk ruled the airwaves. I lived a very sheltered life as a teenager and so it wasn't until 1979 when I went away to boarding school, that I finally get to hear the album in its entirety. It was a true revelation. I heard it on (what was then) a new invention my peers and I called a \\"hi-fi system\\" owned by an older student and I remember hearing the percussion on \\"Jamming\\" and being transfixed. No exaggeration; I was literally hypnotised.<br /><br />The album is faultless with pristine production by Bob and The Wailers. From the minute the first strains of \\"Natural Mystic\\" fade in, through the accusatory \\"Guiltiness\\", on to the revolutionary title track, the slow jams \\"Waiting In Vain\\" & \\"Turn Your Lights Down Low\\", on to the optimitic \\"Three Little Birds\\" and right to the end of \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\", there is not a single note out of place. Each song, a potential hit single, (7 of the 10 songs on the original album were actually hits here in the UK) has a vibrant, totally relevant message - especially for a black teenager living in 70s UK, and Bob's primary ethos of peace & love have stayed with me ever since. That being said, this is the album that began to open my young eyes to the oppression and injustice that already surrounded me. The idea that music wasn't simply for entertainment or escapism but could inspire thought, behaviour and attitude change as well as activism, was new and very appealing.<br /><br />And this was also the album that turned Bob from an international reggae star into a global prophet. Setting everything about Rastafarianism (respectfully) to one side, Bob the man and the music he made, the message he spread, have always educated and enthralled me in equal measure and always will. When I think about what are for me, consummately iconic, influential and superb recordings and I think about such albums as Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, John Coltane's A Love Supreme, Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life, Michael Jackson's Off the Wall, Pink Floyd's The Wall (Deluxe Packaging Digitally Remastered) and Radiohead's OK Computer, I also, immediately, think of Bob Marley's \\"Exodus\\". My life was definitely not the same after listening to it and now that I fully understand the story behind it, I hold the album in even higher esteem.<br /><br />Whether this is Marley's best piece of work or not is, I guess, a matter of personal opinion and will always be open to debate. What is beyond doubt, is that it is my favourite Bob Marley album and I am proud and honoured to make this my 200th review on amazon.com. I'm a bit of a purist so I prefer the version I have which does not have the two extra tracks (though I have both on 12\\" single) but they are definitely worth having. As such, this is the version to get. There'll no doubt be a '30th anniversary edition' knocking around before too long as well.attitude change as well as activism, was new and very appealing. <br /> <br />And this was also the album that turned Bob from an international reggae star into a global prophet.

When I think about what are for me, consummately iconic, influential and superb recordings and I think about such albums as Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, John Coltane's A Love Supreme, Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life, Michael Jackson's Off the Wall, Pink Floyd's The Wall (Deluxe Packaging Digitally Remastered) and Radiohead's OK Computer, I also, immediately, think of Bob Marley's \\"Exodus\\". My life was definitely not the same after listening to it and now that I fully understand the story behind it, I hold the album in even higher esteem. <br />  <br />Whether this is Marley's best piece of work or not is, I guess, a matter of personal opinion and will always be open to debate. What is beyond doubt, is that it is my favourite Bob Marley album and I am proud and honoured to make this my 200th review on amazon.com. I'm a bit of a purist so I prefer the version I have which does not have the two extra tracks (though I have both on 12\\" single) but they are definitely worth having. As such, this is the version to get. There'll no doubt be a '30th anniversary edition' knocking around before too long as well. <br />
B0000C9JFO|5.0|What to know why Europeans are, by and large, a happy and contented people?  <br /> <br />Watch this and find out. <br /> <br />Funny, poignant, sensitive, and interesting. You want to be one of these people before the film is half-way through. Each character is very different and they all (eight of them) are jammed together into one apartment in Barcelona. Yet, somehow, they collectively play to each other's strengths and become life-long friends in the process.
B000001GQP|3.0|A confusing review title, I'll grant that. And if it is the best, the why isn't it, and why only 3 stars? <br />For me, Eugen Jochum's rendition of Carmina Burana is easily the best one. Approved by Orff himself that was invited to assist the premiere. Unlike several other performances, this Carmina Burana was raw, even violent at times. All the energy that Orff had put into it, all the joy and jokes of the text where lived by the performers. There was no worry on softening the sound in order to look more \\"polite\\" or classical. It was raw, it was energic, it was Orff's intention live on stage. That's why it is said Orff was so pleased with it.  <br />However, some people criticized it. Said it was too violent, too unprofessional, too raw after all. That it was not a proper classical music interpretation. It lacked detail, politeness and \\"education\\". After all, it was just not \\"proper\\" to play classical music \\"like that\\". It is a stigma this performance has suffered for years, regardlessly of being the composer's approved one.  <br />When I got this new DG release something sounded different. The sound was perhaps cleaner, but surely something was wrong. And it was easy to find out what. The remastering altered the original, by softening it. It was now slightly slower, more polite, there is not so much violence in the voices sometimes, nor in some of the instruments. DG tried to please everybody with this re-release, including the critics of the original 1988 release, the one faithful to the original performance. <br />So, that explains the title, it is the best performance, but not the best edition, as it has been remastered, and, in my humble opinion, adulterated.  <br />For me, the best one overall: best performance and best edition is still the 1988 release of this same recording also by DG and available here at amazon called [[ASIN:B00000E414 Orff: Carmina Burana]].
B0007TKNII|5.0|After reading some indifferent reviews from several so-called qualified \\"critics\\", I kept my fingers crossed and hoped for the best because, frankly, I love the Andrew Lloyd Webber score that I had only heard on recordings. Never saw the stage version.<br /><br />I loved it!! And if you appreciate musicals of this caliber (it's operatic in concept), you'll find much to admire.<br /><br />Handsome Gerard Butler has been unfairly attacked for giving a poor vocal performance because he doesn't have the high tenor capabilities of Michael Crawford. Forget about it--he's in fine shape, physically and vocally and delivers a strong, sometimes tender and always masculine performance that is altogether in keeping with this concept of the story. He is strong in conveying the pain of the tortured creature he plays.<br /><br />Others are well cast too. Emmy Rossum has a clear, lyric soprano voice and is clearly up to the task of performing the demanding songs in a pleasing fashion while projecting youthful innocence and luminous beauty.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson is very effective as Raoul. His diction is impeccable, even in song. Unfortunately, the same cannot always be said of the other singers--many times the lack of clear enunciation leaves the lyrics inexplicable, which was true in the stage version too.<br /><br />Aside from minor flaws, the film is gorgeous to look at, brilliantly staged for maximum effect from the very opening shot of the Paris Opera Populaire in 1916 (photographed in black and white) until the final climactic scenes beneath the famed opera house. All of it is filmed in a continually moving and prowling camera movement that makes us feel that the phantom's prowling has become part of our viewing experience.<br /><br />It all has a dark, glittering style that is entirely in keeping with the atmosphere needed to make this kind of story ring true. Richly photographed and sensuous in its appeal, it will keep you absorbed throughout its entire running time. The full orchestra orchestrations of the 110 piece orchestra are an added bonus for the movie version, particularly when rendering the Phantom theme at full throttle.<br /><br />All I can say is, if you like the Webber score, you'll love what they've accomplished here, giving lush cinematic style to the prowling camera-work that seems to cover every corner of the mysterious stage settings.<br /><br />Minnie Driver provides effective comic relief as La Carlotta in her over-the-top performance, as do Ciarin Hinds and Simon Callow as the new opera owners. Settings, costumes and John Mathieson's stunning cinematography cannot be praised highly enough.<br /><br />Don't believe those negative reviews. No doubt this will be regarded as a masterpiece in years to come, when strict adherence to the stage version is no longer important and comparisons to Brightman and Crawford are relegated to the past. Furthermore, from what I've seen of Brightman's performance, her stylized approach to the role never would have worked on film.<br /><br />Visually, it's one of the most sumptuous productions of this story that you are ever likely to see.ing time.

0195067142|5.0|This was another book that was assigned by my college history professor.  This book was a very easy read and I was compelled to not put it down.  Unlike Sajer's book, this one was historically accurate and when the author could not remember a certain place or name, he said so in the book.  His accounts of the battles of Pelelieu and Okinawa are gruesome and gives the reader a sense of the feelings and fears of combat.  I am a combat veteran as well, and it stirred up feelings I had forgotten about.  This is an excellent book and it would make a great addition to any history or military book collection.
0140277447|5.0|The Rape of Nanking is an amazingly easy read considering the dark subject that it addresses. Chang did an outstanding job of compiling absolutely airtight, irrefutable information about the atrocities committed by the Japanese military in 1937, but this book is far more than simply an endless recitation of that evidence. When I first picked up this book I feared that it would simply be 200+ pages of stories about atrocities. But as Chang herself noted early in the book, doing so would simply be monotonous and would eventually numb the reader. Instead, she discusses several different and important aspects about the Rape of Nanking, beginning with an historical overview of the roots of imperial Japan and the culture that allowed an entire generation of young men to become cruel, inhumane butchers. She goes on to inform the reader about the conflict between Japan and China, and eventually of course relates specific facts about the savagery committed against so many hundreds of thousands of Chinese in Nanking. But the book does not stop there. Chang goes to great lengths to describe the heroic efforts of a handful of westerners who were able to save hundreds of thousands of Chinese from certain torture and death. She concludes by discussing the aftermath of the Rape of Nanking and how it remains an incredibly sensitive topic for so many people. This is an absolutely outstanding work of nonfiction that everyone should read. The reviewers here who have disparaged Chang and her effort to ensure that the world never forgets about the evil that occurred in Nanking should be ashamed of themselves. People like that only illustrate how important it is to keep the memory of Nanking alive and never surrender to those who would bury the truth because they are too cowardly to face it.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Saw the show on PBS and was enthralled.  Actually got to see the ladies in concert, positively fantastic! Prabably will have to order new CD's and DVD as will most likely wear them out.  Even my 8 year old enjoys them.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Having not seen the first three seasons when first released, I found this offering to be excellent viewing. These episodes first seen by me (up to)some seven years after their production, did not seem dated and were as compelling  to watch as the later epsidoes were when first shown on TV.  I am not usually a fan of American produced TV programmes, preferring British or Australian product.  However, in this case, my expectations have been exceeded and I suspect that this series will endure as \\"watchable\\" many times over in years to come.   Here in Australia, it has set a standard in that newspaper articles have recently described the political opposition party's leadership office \\"as just like in the West Wing, but they talk slower\\". With hindsight, would I make this purchase again? DEFINITELY.  I highly recommend it's viewing.  Additionaly (for Australia) the product is approx 25% cheaper thru Amazon.com than the local retail shop price.
B000FWHVKA|5.0|Silent Shout~ The Knife is a great album from one of the best electronic bands that I have heard in a very long time. The Knife is a very original band and they certainly go against the grain with their strange lyrics and odd look. This is so refreshing since it really works and does not feel phoney or forced. The book-let is a very strange one with an artsy cover that is quite strange and perplexing. I have no idea what they had in mind to convey with that thing. Highly recommended indeed and I easily give this album 5 out of 5 stars.
B00000J7J4|4.0|What do you think of when you hear the name Santana?  For me, my thoughts go to \\"Oye Como Va,\\" \\"Black Magic Woman,\\" and \\"Evil Ways.\\"  Carlos Santana has always been the epitome of cool, class and mad talent.  That hasn't dulled with time, and he definitely hasn't softened with time.  Carlos just has a deeper realized sazon (flavor), now.  \\"Well,\\" thought the producers of this album, \\"what better way to introduce Carlos Santana to the younger generation, than through blending his sound with a bunch of other artists that emerged in the last ten years or so?\\"  Very intriguing idea.  Does it work? On some cuts, it succeeds very well!  While, on other cuts, the music comes across as [slightly] engineered to appeal, but it doesn't really make the lasting impression I would have loved to feel.<br /><br />Some of the most well-known songs from this album include \\"Smooth\\" with Rob Thomas, \\"Maria, Maria,\\" with Wyclef Jean, and \\"Corazon Espinado,\\" with Mana.  For me, \\"Smooth\\" was great to hear, the first several times on the radio, but I think it was [a bit] played out.  Rob Thomas has strong vocals but they don't blend well with Santana.  Thomas sounds almost too \\"trendy,\\" here.  The beauty of Santana is that he is timeless and he could appear on any album, from probably any time, and his scorchingly hot guitar licks would still ignite your speakers, and that is probably why this musical coupling didn't work so well.  Whereas, \\"Maria, Maria\\" succeeds in sounding street and like Santana is channeling the hauntedness of the barrio with Wyclef's tight production (hip hop meets latin soul).  Great!  \\"Corazon Espinado\\" is right on the mark.  Mexican rock band Mana sounds wonderful with Santana, and their vocals and back-up compliment him beautifully.  If I was really going to analyze every track on this album, it would take all day for you to even get through this review!  So, I will stop right now and just say that SUPERNATURAL is [overall] a very compelling project, and when it's good, it's great.  If there are some songs you don't like, just skip them, because there really is something here for everyone.it's good, it's great.

B000MRAAJW|1.0|When I first got my hd-dvd player, this was one of the hd-dvd's I received. i was pretty impressed by the quality compared to it's dvd pq, but was not totally impressed. my brother picked this up though for his ps3 blu-ray player and kept going on on how clear the picture was, so i told him it was good but not that good. so i go over to his place and was AMAZED on how much clearer the picture was. keep in mind that we both have the same tv's on the same settings.  <br /> <br />all in all, this is a great show...but when it comes to quality seeing is believing, and seeing it on blu-ray made me regret buying it in hd-dvd format.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|Who knew that Paul Simon (of Simon & Garfunkel fame) had so much raw, untapped music inside?  Yes, Simon brought us great music in the 1960s as the Simon in the Garfunkel duo (\\"The Boxer,\\" \\"Sounds of Silence,\\" \\"Mrs. Robinson,\\" to name just a few of their hits), but it rare that we heard him so free.  Maybe we have the surroundings of the Brazilian rainforest to thank for liberating him.  RHYTHM OF THE SAINTS is probably one of the strongest albums I have heard by Paul Simon, and he has a great clean sound, along with the collaboration of tradional Brazilian musicians, who add in ago-go and numerous percussive instruments from their repertoire, into the mix.  Think of it as soul/jazz meets Indigenous funk.  Hard to imagine?  It was hard for me, too.  If you want a good example of this sound, listen to \\"The Obvious Child,\\" \\"She Moves On\\" (featuring Brazilian vocalist Milton Nascimento) and \\"Spirit Voices.\\"  Once this rhythm gets in your blood, it's hard to shake it out of your system.
B000P0J02E|5.0|First of all, I'm not the kind of person to go nuts about a movie soundtrack.  I'm a classical musician, and I'm pretty picky about movie music.  This score ranks way up there in the stratosphere. Truly memorable. Honestly, several of these tracks could stand alone as symphonic repertoire. I loved the movie, but the soundtrack is worth owning separately.  Even people that weren't as fond of the movie were impressed enough to buy the music anyway.

B00004VVNB|5.0|Film about population & resource control in a future post-war setting.<br /><br />Cool retro-futuristic sets; definitely 70's style fashion and decor. Great actors, they're all easy to identify with and are believable in their roles. I can put this movie on frequently and enjoy it every time; there aren't any lulls in the plot or \\"unnecessary fluff.\\" I haven't read the book, from what I hear the movie leaves out/changes details- But if you haven't read the book, you obviously aren't going to miss it and it's still very enjoyable. It makes you want to read the book afterward to hear more about the world of Logan's Run.<br /><br />I've heard this film compared to \\"The Island,\\" which I have also seen. I really think Island is more like \\"Coma\\" with Michael Douglas.<br /><br />Logan's Run is mainly about population/resource control out of necessity to maintain humanity, while \\"The Island\\" and \\"Coma\\" are about Money/Greed by showing how far people will go to live longer and what business'll do to make it possible for those that can afford it.<br /><br />In Island & Coma, the motivation for keeping the 'secluded world of clones' is not for survival as much as the chase for immortality and the resultant immoral lengths people take to attain it.<br /><br />Logan's Run is about the chase of truth and freedom, to escape from their isolated dome world to discover a deserted, isolated earth. Though they are killed at 30, it is humane in contrast to the mutilation of those in Coma/Island.

B000PFUAO6|2.0|As a DT-fan from the start, I think the new album disappoints. When you scan the intro's it's quite promesing, but in some tracks it evolves in an incomprhensible mess of sounds. Craftsmanship of the individual players is undoubted. But it takes more than that to make a unity. I adore most of their albums, but this one I dislike. Music is supposed to be a bearer of a message. Well, this message is too far hidden and the music just as vague. Sorry guys, please order \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" or \\"Octavarium\\" but not this one..... <br /> <br />I wish DT got back on writing real theme-albums, or at least songs with the deep and uplifting lyrics as they usually did. Do not try to copy Metallica, nor any other band... which in some instances can be heard on Systematic Chaos.  <br /> <br />Greetz from a disappointed Dutchman.
B000MQ54OO|5.0|This movie looks great in HD, and then again, what animated movie doesn't! Anyway, the disc is a good thing to get, b/c you can flip it over and you have the regular DVD underneath! So if you think you may upgrade to HD DVD sometime soon, this is a good disc to buy. The movie is cute as well!
0385733577|4.0|My son picked this up at the bookstore (the cover is quite fetching) and I, his mother, couldn't resist reading it.  He is a big Lightening Thief fan, so the possibility of more mythology was a big hit.  How funny that both books pick Mount Tamalpais in Marin as an area of god-like importance.  The book hooks you from the start with a suspenseful scene.  Later, I thought rough spots were a little too conveniently solved by a suddenly appearing power, so that you never felt they were actually in danger.    But I still enjoyed the book and look forward to the sequel.
0316018953|4.0|I've read all Mr. Connelly's Harry Bosch books, some even twice. I can see where The Overlook was originally serialized, but it doesn't detract from the book's flow.

B000001F29|5.0|This work is a jewel, a must have for collectors of either Mr. Anderson or Mr. Vangelis fans, or just fans of good 1980s music or progressive. This work dictated the pace of many other works that followed; including Donna Summer's version of State of Independence (I think the version here is much better though). The piece Friends of Mr. Cairo is just to good, a real creative work that only Jon and Vangelis could accomplish together
B00005JLFC|4.0|You may love her or hate but the truth should be admitted - Streisand is an extremely talented artist. \\"Yentl' is her baby of directing, producing, co-writing and starring as a girl who wants to study and become a rabbi and who has to disguise herself as a boy to be accepted in a college. Streisand had fought the studio for 15 years to get it made, and she put her heart into this. Barbra is a gifted director, and the film is beautifully shot. I liked her acting - I thought she was convincing and touching when her character started to fall in love with a fellow student (very appealing Mandy Patinkin, \\"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father: prepare to die\\" of \\"The Princess Bride\\") and had to hide her feelings. I also like her singing and I think that the songs belong to the film and can not be taken out of the context.

015603283X|3.0|I have enjoyed Perez-Reverte's [[ASIN:0156029820 The Nautical Chart]], [[ASIN:0156029812 The Seville Communion]], [[ASIN:0156029839 The Fencing Master]], and [[ASIN:0156029588 The Flanders Panel]], so it is clear that I like his somewhat obscure brand of thriller. I think, however, that he went too far in \\"The Club Dumas,\\" the ending of which left many important questions unanswered and this reader unsatisfied.    Maybe my lack of satisfaction with the conclusion was exacerbated by the quality of the story that preceded it.    Lucas Corso is brilliantly presented, with little snippets of characterization dropped here and there to eventually comprise a coherent pattern ... he talks fast, gets his hands dirty, has a prodigious memory,  appears fragile yet solid as a concrete block, has features that are sharp and precise, and alert eyes. He's ready to express an innocence dangerous for anyone who was taken in by it, seems slower and clumsier than he really is, looks vulnerable and defenseless, and is attractive to women.    Later, Corso is described as saying something casually, as if he had no opinion on the matter, slyly goading you to react, inducing you to give out more information than you had intended.     And still later (not until p.175), he is thin and hard like an emaciated wolf. A well-trained, patient wolf.      But there's a problem with all this. We are set to believe that Corso is dangerous both mentally and physically, someone who is not what others see him to be. This is excellent, but then Perez-Reverte does not have Corso act in a way consistent with these characteristics. Instead, he acts weak and unsure, and he's as often manipulated as he is the manipulator.     Now for the ending.    The story concludes with major unresolved issues, which are not even acknowledged as unresolved. Who is the green-eyed girl? Why does she follow Corso and help him? What happens to Varo Borja, who has committed murders but is not sought by the police? I found this enormously frustrating. Did I miss something?    Even more serious, Perez-Reverte has launched Corso into two unrelated stories, both of which are fascinating. I fully expected everything to come together into a single complex but coherent plot. But it never happens. I reached the concluding chapters with great anticipation that the loose threads would be integrated, and then felt great disappointment when they were not.    Perhaps I would be less frustrated if Perez-Reverte were not such a good storyteller. That also makes me wonder if it was me. Did I miss things I should have understood?    I read \\"The Club Dumas\\" differently than I read Perez-Reverte's other books. Having now published two novels --- [[ASIN:1595941622 A Good Conviction]], a NYC-based legal thriller which tells the story of a young man wrongly imprisoned in Sing Sing for a murder he did not commit by a Manhattan ADA who may have known he was innocent, and [[ASIN:0299187942 The Heretic (Library of American Fiction)]], a historical novel describing the persecution of a family of secret Jews by the Catholic Church on the eve of the Spanish Inquisition --- I have undertaken a self-education project to see if I can improve my skills as a novelist. \\"The Club Dumas\\" is one of the novels I have read as part of this effort.    If you'd like to see more of my comments about \\"The Club Dumas\\" and other novels, I invite you to my \\"Education of a Novelist\\" blog, which you can reach by searching the web for \\"weinstein education of a novelist\\".

B000GFLAI0|3.0|Upgraded from 1 star. The comments below were my first impression. The album actually grew on me.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Just heard about this album from a lady who loved it- she said, \\"He even sings.\\" The sticker on the wrapper said Rolling Stone called it a \\"Master Work.\\" Very exciting. Not.    I'm Dylan's biggest fan, and this sucks. I never thought I would write something negative about a man whose songs and singing I've defended my entire adult life. Not folk, not rock, not blues, but LOUNGE MUSIC (of all things). Drums and Cymbals. Words that go no where. The kind of beat you want to turn the bass down on. It's what you hear through the wall from an annoying neighbor. Find a pillow and bury your head under it.     How could Rolling Stone mis-lead us so? Useless.    Bob, play us a tune on the old guitar, with finger picking and hammer-on's. Where's your harmonica? And, what about being an American in Modern Times? Is God on our side?
B000002KDO|5.0|Black Sabbath are without a shadow of a doubt one of the greatest and most influentual heavy metal bands of all time, and they're also one of my all time favorite heavy metal bands as well. Man I just can't praise this band enough. 1971 was no doubt a big year for Sabbath. They released their second album \\"Paranoid\\" which was a true masterpiece and one of the greatest metal albums ever, and in the same year they released what is considered the band's heaviest, most influential, and best album of their career, \\"Master of Reality\\". This album gave birth to the doom/gloom, sludge, and stoner metal subgenres, and it's also cited as an influence by many stoner and sludge metal bands as well. This album would also be the third and final Black Sabbath album to be produced by Rodger Bain. The lyrical themes on \\"Master of Reality\\" included: drugs (mostly marijuana), solitude, war, and theology. Every song on here is just fantastic. Ozzy Osbourne's vocals are just awesome on here. Guitarist Tony Iommi does some of his most heaviest riffs on this album, and his solos are really cool too. This guy is truly one of metal's greatest and most legendary guitarists. Bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward's rhythm section is really solid, nice solid bass lines from Geezer and great drumwork courtesy of Bill as well.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Sweet Leaf\\" starts off with an echo of coughs, and then breaks with a slow heavy sludgy riff and hard heavy drums. That riff on the song is just extremely catchy, and a great solo by Tony is included as well. This is truly one of the best songs on here. Lyrically this song of course deals with you guessed it: marijuana. Track two \\"After Forever\\" features some really cool bass work from Geezer, some nice catchy riffs and another cool solo from Tony. Another one of my favorites. \\"Embryo\\" is a 28 second guitar interlude which leads into to track four \\"Children of the Grave\\" This is my favorite song on the entire album, and it features some more catchy and heavy riffs throughout, a groovy drum beat, and of course another great solo, killer bass, and great vocals by Ozzy. I've been learning the riffs to this song on my guitar recently. \\"Orchid\\" is antoher short, but nice instrumental with some nice accoustic chords. \\"Lord of This World\\" has a slow sinister drum beat, as well as some groovy bass lines, more heavy sludgy riffs, and cool solos from Tony. Track seven \\"Solitude\\" is a nice soft accoustic ballad with some nice singing vocals from Ozzy, nice slow bass from Geezer, and of course Tony plays a flute solo which I found tearjerking yet very cool. The lyrics on this song deal with yeah, you guessed it: solitude. The closing track \\"Into the Void\\" starts off with some slow heavy doom like riffs. During the 3 minutes mark, the songs breaks into a faster pace with faster riffs, hard hitting drums, but then shifts back to the slow heavy riffs at the 3:36 mark. Another cool guitar solo from Tony near the end is also included too.<br /><br />The song list and the ratings:<br /><br />1. Sweet Leaf (5:04) - 5/5<br /><br />2. After Forever (5:25) - 5/5<br /><br />3. Embryo (0:28) - 5/5<br /><br />4. Children of the Grave (5:17) - 5/5 My favorite song<br /><br />5. Orchid (1:31) - 5/5<br /><br />6.

Enjoy!!<br /><br />LONG LIVE BLACK SABBATH!!<br /><br />LONG LIVE HEAVY METAL!!e more catchy and heavy riffs throughout, a groovy drum beat, and of course another great solo, killer bass, and great vocals by Ozzy. I've been learning the riffs to this song on my guitar recently. \\"Orchid\\" is antoher short, but nice instrumental with some nice accoustic chords. \\"Lord of This World\\" has a slow sinister drum beat, as well as some groovy bass lines, more heavy sludgy riffs, and cool solos from Tony. Track seven \\"Solitude\\" is a nice soft accoustic ballad with some nice singing vocals from Ozzy, nice slow bass from Geezer, and of course Tony plays a flute solo which I found tearjerking yet very cool.

B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Rihanna went almsot completely rock, dance and pop on this album with tinges of dancehall. I guess she figured that since her tracks were always topping the dance and pop charts she'd just do that type of music. I'm not into those genres however I was thoroughly entertained by this album.  My favourite songs are: Umbrella (Featuring Jay-Z) , Breakin Dishes, Shut Up & Drive, Hate That I Love You (Featuring Ne-Yo), Rehab, Good Girl Gone Bad, and the 2 dancehall-tinged songs : Say It and Lemme Get That. That's 8 out of the 12 songs on the album. That's how good this album is.    1. Umbrella (Featuring Jay-Z)  - This one grew on me. At first I thought it was silly but now I sing along to it.  The tune fits her voice.  I love the beat and the catchy chorus.  It's a hit.    2. Push Up On Me - This one is a purely dance track and is good for working out.    3. Don't Stop The Music -  This one is also a purely dance track and is good for working out. It's like CNC Music Factory's Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now) track from 1990 mixed with a Michael Jackson sample.    4. Breakin Dishes - This is my jam. I love the rage and aggression. This one is more rock than the previous 2 and I love the beat. In this song she is talking about how she is going to fight her maybe cheating boyfriend and break dishes and burn his clothes - really crazy behaviour. This is a really cool track and great for the gym as well.    5.Shut Up and Drive  - This is her next single and this one is very rock. Another great jam to listen to while running on the treadmill. This one grew on me too.    6.Hate That I Love You (Featuring Ne-Yo)  - I love this duet.  This is a typical Ne-Yo sounding song in terms of the beat. This is one of the only R&B tracks on the album. It's sweet.    7.Say It - This one has the beat of that old Shabba Ranks dancehall track - Girl Flex - nice.....I am so glad she didn't drop her caribbean roots completely....    8. Sell Me Candy  - This one has a good beat too....can't classify into a genre - loving it though...nice futuristic sound.    9. Lemme Get That - This one has a dancehall beat too - yippee - good for a nice, slow wine.    10. Rehab - I LOVE THIS SONG - This one is about being in Rehab trying to get over a man (as opposed to substance abuse). Great beat and great chorus. I love the acoustic guitar in it.    11. Question Existing - This one is about self-examination and acceptance and fame and miscellaneous. It's a reflective track where she speaks and I am glad to hear her accent.    12. Good Girl Gone Bad - This has a nice folksy sound to it. I love the acoustic guitar in it. This is a great song about being neglected and mistreated by a man and as a result turning into a bad girl.    Five out of Five stars - Great Job Rihanna!!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Great examples of how nature interacts. Fantastic education tool that kids can enjoy
0743270754|4.0|Goodwin can write, and she can tell a story.  Indeed, her talents along those lines have justly made her famous and make this book a very enjoyable (and informative) read.  As a piece of history, I am no expert, but I have some skepticism about the book.  She has a certain take on Lincoln and on some of the character traits of his cabinet members, and every piece of evidence in the 700+ pages seems to be marshalled to support this perspective.  It reads like a well-written piece of advocacy--an excellent legal brief--yet history is rarely so uncomplicated.  When everything in the record is offered as supporting the thesis (both the facts and the adjectives) one naturally becomes a bit skeptical of the record presented. <br /> <br />    Having said that, I was both educated and impressed by the Lincoln she presented.  A man so secure in his own abilities and place in the world that he would not let the ambitions and insecurities of those around him prevent him from making maximal use of their talents and insights.  His extraordinary character in this regard is as inspirational in its way as the character of a Ghandi or a Dr. King is with regard to the power of their forbearance.  By documenting this trait, this book makes a valuable contribution, as well as a good read. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000IU3XTM|4.0|Damien has continued to keep me intrigued, with his intense singing and moving lyrics, I can't stop listening. This latest cd isnt as firey as the first, a bit sobering, but it still packs a punch. Especially like \\"The Animals were gone\\".
B000J3EEBY|4.0|The first cd I have purchased featuring Loreena McKennitt. She moves away from her roots with the album (as she tells us in the liner notes). There are some outstanding tracks but I was not overwhelmed with the whole package. Still, it is a very solid block of music and I credit her with a new vision
B000008M1P|5.0|The quality of the item purchased was wonderful.  It arrived in a timely manner and I have no complaints about Amazon and their services.  The music on the C.D. was excellent.  Amazingly my 15 year old daughter discovered the wonders of power rock \\"girl\\" style. A new generation has been born.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|If you want to hear some amazing song structures, melodies and all around great rock musicians Jon Theodore to Omar Gonzalez and even John Fruscante, get this album. Once you get through the few dead spots and few moments of senseless noise, this will be placed in your heavy rotation of favorite music. Cedric Bixler is one of the most amazing modern rock singers out there today.
B000MZHW40|4.0|Even though Leonardo DiCaprio proves here he yet again that, like Brad Pitt, he is much more than a pretty boy. He can actually act! <br /> <br />Insofar as playing and pulling off a mercenary, my choice would have been someone like Hugh Jackman, but Leo utilizes other aspects other than physical presense to pull this off. Our hats off to him! <br /> <br />Blood Diamond's director Edward Zwick did another fantastic job here. We loved his The Last Samurai, with Tom Cruise. Yet another fantastic thinking man's action flick. <br /> <br />Blood Diamond also has the unusual unsappy love story, which is a much more realistic way to approach such things. Beautiful cinemetography, savage tribes and warlords abound here, showing the mostly unknowledgeable viewing audience of such real-life happenings in the world today. Brilliantly done. <br /> <br />I was not expecting something so fresh and exciting in this film. Even my wife was spellbound, expecting a typical action movie. It is anything but! <br /> <br />Africa is shown here in all its beauty and savagery, both in its locales and people, whether white or black. With its superlative storytelling, strong performances, excellent action sequences, and differing locales of harsh living and lush beauty, Blood Diamond delivers on many levels.  <br /> <br />This movie alone has changed the diamond trade, moving alot of people from purchasing diamonds from just anywhere and from just anyone. It teaches people to ask the right questions, regarding just from how and where any said diamond is from. <br /> <br />That's just powerful movie making.
1582701709|1.0|Amidst all the hype, I purchased the book \\"The Secret\\".  It is simply a re-hash of what many others have written including Wayne Dyer(If you can see it, you can believe it) and what Kabbalah teaches.  I also found the writing to be just combination of what others said, and not particularly well written.  I suppose some people are finding this knowledge for the first time through this book, and so it is serving some purpose.  Personally, I was disappointed.
B000002LIX|5.0|This album is the soundtrack along with Jane's Nothing Shocking for my life when I was in highschool.  I think it is a work of pure genius.  The music has it all,jet fueled funk rock,love and sex everything.  My altime favorite song on this record is without a doubt Three Days and after that No Ones Leaving.  I can listen from start to finish but those songs are my favorites.  Also the lyrics are poetry, you must check out Perry's writing in the linar notes entitled \\"To The Mosquitoes\\".  This record has been the source of countless amounts of inspiration for writing song lyrics and writing music.  If your into Jane's you should read the book Whore's.  This album is the best,also check out their other albums.
0679746323|5.0|The method to get people to do what you desire and the mental & physical force is a valuable lesson that everyone should read and understand.  It gave me great insight on how a dicatator can continue.  It may be called brain washing but it is more.  Turning an entire village fearful thus changing the way people cope and how this can transpire  explains how someone like Mao could stay in power so long.
B000002IHU|5.0|The cassette was excellent, and now the C.D. lives on in my collection. <br />Amazon delivered as they promised. The product arrived quickly and in wonderful condition. <br />If you are looking to update your 80's collection Amazon is the place to do it. They really have wonderful deals on their 80's C.D.'s .
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Read quite a few reviews before purchasing this product, and was not disappointed. Even on my old 27\\" CRT the footage is still amazing, and just motivates me more to get that 37\\" LCD I've been eying. Spectacular series for the whole family !!
B0000039PW|5.0|Funny how most of the \\"This album sucks\\"/\\"Biggie sucks, 2pac is way better\\" are from Kids Reviews.  What a joke.  You can't get more classic than this album.  I did something that made me realize how priceless albums like \\"Ready To Die\\" and \\"Illmatic\\" are.  I stopped listening to them for almost a year, listened to all the current (c)rap that is out now and then listened to these and other classic hip hop albums straight through again and again.  All I could say is WOW.  The difference in talent is unreal.  It makes you TRULY miss artists like Big and Pac to the point where you actually get irritated by how wack so-called artists are now.  Nothing but pop-rap and studio gangsters.  How unfortunate.
0596007124|5.0|This is a fun way to learn a serious topic. I can't personally imagine a more entertaining method to write a book about a \\"mundane\\" topic such as design patterns. The book promises that the concepts and topics would 'reside' in the reader's brain long after the reader is done reading the book. That I found to be a true statement for myself. I am sure you will find that true too. <br /> <br />Remember that the authors expect you to known the fundamental concepts about OO design (UML) and Java (C# knowledge might be supplementary). But of course, you wouldn't be reading a book about design patterns without knowing the concepts before hand. Would you?
B000002UAU|4.0|In order to avoid simply repeating the accolades heaped upon Sgt. Pepper's, let me just say that they are well-deserved. Sgt. Pepper's certainly changed the direction of rock music, from popular music for youth to an art form for all time.<br /><br />But to say that its influence continues today is a stretch. Sgt. Pepper's is the apex of 60s psychedelia, nothing more, nothing less. Today it's a quaint look back to a different time and place. A brilliant masterpiece that is merely fun to listen to once in a while. It's music and production has long been imitated, deconstructed, and worshiped beyond its true influential reach. Through no fault of it's own, Sgt. Pepper's is incapable of withstanding the test of time.<br /><br />Do you need to hear Sgt. Papper's? Undoubtedly and repeatedly. If you have worn out your old vinyl and cut out the mustache and stuck it in your nose, do you need to now own the CD? Maybe not. You lived it and your only reason for owning the CD is pure nostalgia. If you have never owned Sgt. Pepper's in any form, you need to.
B000O174CM|5.0|If you like musicals, then you'll love this movie.  Jennifer Hudson definitely stole the show.
B000002IGP|5.0|It was a great album when I owned it as a cassette,now it is living on in my collection as a C.D. <br />Amazon delivered as they promised.  They C.D. arrived quickly and in excellent shape. I would use Amazon again and suggest its services to all looking to order online. Especially to those ordering to update their 80's collection. They have good deals on the C.D.'s when I ordered.
B0009UC81A|1.0|Like another reviewer, I found that the DVD freezes after about 1.5 hours.  The DVD is two-sided, with the theatrical version on one side and the extended director's cut on the other.  Both sieze up and just stop playing.  The scenes that are ruined are:  when Jake and Elwood meet that country band in the parking lot, the steam room scene with Steve Lawrence, and the run-up to the big fund-raising concert.  The disc is poor quality and very disappointing.  Unfortunately I did not save my Amazon receipt...
0385340559|5.0|I have read all of the Lee Child \\"Jack Reacher\\" series books and this one is the best.  I enjoyed the book from cover to cover.  Great read and I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B000NA2776|5.0|This recording has everything a great pop music recording needs. Catchy tunes, good lyrics, a fantastic vocal, and great music. I am totally surprised that the members of the former Queen didn't ask Mika to be the new vocalist, rather than Paul Rodgers. If you like pop music ( c'mon, you know you do), then this cd is well worth your time and money.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|Happy to say that Neon Bible is just as satisfying as Funeral.  In other words, this will be the album of the year for most discerning rock fans. <br />It is unusual for a new band to follow up on such an excellent debut without the old sophomore dip. <br />Neon Bible lacks some of the intense moments of Funeral but makes this up in consistency. <br />Everyone us right about the silly packaging: flimsy, indulgent and wasteful - nothing like being irritated before you manage to get to the disk.
B0009P42S2|2.0|I loved Akira, Appleseed,really most everything Studio Ghibli has ever done (Kiki, Nausicaa, Spirited, etc), Cowboy Bebop, Gundam, etc. <br /> <br />This one didn't grab me. The animation is every bit as good as you would expect, but the story is just weak. I was really excited when I realized this was being released, but just ended up being disappointed. Some people love it, so DEFINITELY watch before you buy!!!  <br /> <br />If you are new to Anime - this is not a good starting point and if you have already seen it and DID enjoy it there is a whole world of great movies waiting for you! Visually, my favorite is Appleseed (2004 - there are older un-enhanced anime series shows floating around). Storywise, pick up the Studio Ghibli movie pack. This contains Spirited Away and MANY more classics (I think mine has 12 movies and it cost me a whopping 15.00 on ebay plus shipping).
1582701709|4.0|I like the examples she gives of how The Secret's principles have worked in people's lives and the comments from well-known speakers, authors, etc. who have applied The Secret in their own lives.
6305075468|4.0|\\"Disgruntled\\" refers to a previous review and not Nosferatu.<br /><br />There are a number of different  \\"versions\\" of this movie distributed by different companies. I bought the Keno version, and the transfer and tint quality are excellent. However, I had previously seen the movie with a pipe organ arrangement and was dissapointed with the orchestral arrangements on the Keno DVD. Not that there is anything bad with the music, it's just that the pipe organ creates a creepier mood for me. I then bought the Image companies offering and am very pleased with the pipe organ soundtrack, though the DVD transfer is not quite as good as the Keno. I would have given 5 stars if the Keno video and the Image audio were on the same DVD. Oh, and the audio commentary is admirable in ponting out the symbolism and stlye of the film. great movie.
0446677450|3.0|I loved the book as it opened my eyes to the possibilities available and the  mindset needed to be a successful investor. However i am not sure i believe the stories of childhood and his accurate recollection of life lessons..sounds stressful for a young lad to cope with. Apart from that i loved it...
B000E5KJD4|4.0|Many reviewers have written about the specifics of this version of Phantom of the Opera.  I don't need to repeat their comments, but I largely agree with the two Spotlight Reviews.<br /><br />What I would like to emphasize in my review is my own experience.  In short, despite any shortcomings in casting, the movie achieves its result which is to move the human heart.<br /><br />This is a beautiful adaptation in terms of music, visual appeal, drama, etc.  There are some casting shortcomings as described in the spotlight reviews, but this is an extremely powerful interpretation.<br /><br />The HD quality visual adds to the whole experience as does the high quality sound.  At the price it is offered, this is certainly worth getting just for some of the musical scenes alone!<br /><br />While I can find shortcomings of various types if I break the movie down into parts, as a whole it had a powerful impact on me.  Whether you are a fan of the music, drama or visual elements... you won't be disappointed.
1400063515|1.0|\\"The Black Swan\\" was very disappointing for several reasons. It needed someone to edit it, it was too long and rambling. Taleb goes on and on and on. Please, give us a break. Early on I decided that I didn't like the book, but I finished it. Taleb comes across as a pompous, arrogant know it all. I could sum up \\"The Black Swan\\" this way; it is better to be lucky than good! A much better book on risk is \\"Against The Gods,The Remarkable Story of Risk\\".
1401308201|5.0|THIS IS DEFINITELY A BOOK FOR MUSICAL FANS. IT COVERS THE WRITING, BACK STORY, LYRICS, PLOT LINE, ETC. EVERYTHING YOU WANT OR NEED TO KNOW ABOUT \\"WICKED-THE MUSICAL\\" IS IN THIS BOOK! AMAZING!
B00005JKG9|5.0|This is one of few great Sales movies.  This movie ranks right up there with Wall Street and more recent Boiler Room.  This movie employs an entourage of big name actors.  This is a must see for any person in the Sales Industry.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Riveting, edge of the seat, white knuckle suspence. I found myself holding my breath! The ending was a big surprise for me. My husband figured it out, or so he says. Ü
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This is a very humerous yet touching romantic comedy, atleast for the 50+ crowd - maybe not for the younger generation.
0743243153|5.0|This book blew my mind.  The perfect balance of where psychology meets life.  It was unexpected, practical, deep, well-written & I've already purchased copies for several friends.  I think I expected to be inspired (and I was), but I didn't expect to get new insights on life to the depth that I received from reading this book.  I assumed it was a Christian book from the mention of spirituality in the sub-title, but was blown away by the approach it took on the spiritual dimension of living (turns out it wasn't Christian-based & would not be offensive even to an atheist, deist or non-practicing person).  Can't imagine a person who would be bothered by reading it & can only imagine how many people I wish would read it because it would benefit them.  Just read it - even if only out of curiosity - you WILL learn something.
B00005JPD0|4.0|It was a pretty good movie better than I thought it was going to be.
B00008YJH5|1.0|Surfer Rosa is what it would sound like if Mike Tyson, Helen Keller, Pauly Shore, and a random homeless guy picked up instruments for the first time and decided to record an album.  Was there a single actual musician in this band?  I have never in my life heard a band that was so utterly, apocalyptically devoid of actual talent.   <br /> <br />It doesn't matter how influential this band was or how popular they were (or are) in college frat houses.  Stupid music is stupid music, period, and The Pixies' attempts at writing 'music that's so bad that it's actually kind of good' failed miserably.  Unless of course you think lyrics like \\"This song is about a superhero named Tony!\\" are the stuff of brilliance.   <br /> <br />Silliness is not an art form.  This band was a crime against rock.
1594489505|5.0|After reading the book I realized that we have a duty to stay in Iraq and Afghanistan no  matter what the cost so people won't have to suffer under tyrants like the characters do in the book.  The sacrifices that are made now will, in the long run, benefit millions of people not yet born but if we cut and run, we will have failed them and be less than human.<br /><br />Everyone against the war (regardless if going to war in Iraq was wrong or right) should read both of this authors books before they are allowed to protest anything.<br /><br />War is horrible but it is part of humanity to do these terrible things to each other. What else can I say but that it should be the duty of those who are not tyrants, religious or otherwise, to stand together against such horrors.
0385338082|5.0|I loved this book.  I could not put it down.  We were on vacation and my husband kept looking over at me when I would laugh out loud while reading. <br /> <br />If you are looking for light summer fun reading this is it!
B000JJRIN4|2.0|Yeah... lame title, I know.  Anywho, Gwen Stefani's first solo debut Love.Angel.Music.Baby was without a doubt my favorite album of 2004, with it's slick production, catchy hooks, and just all around it was just feel good music.  Whether people admit or not, they did like the catchy hook of \\"Rich Girl\\", the upbeat production of \\"Bubble Pop Electric\\", the sexiness of \\"Cool\\" and \\"Luxurious\\", the retro vibe of \\"Serious\\", and the dark side of \\"Danger Zone\\".  All those elements that made L.A.M.B. so great were basically stripped for this album, leaving me asking, \\"...what happened?\\"<br /><br />Gwen Stefani achieved her best success in the U.S. with \\"Hollaback Girl\\", so I guess she figured if she coppied the same formula she would have a hit record.  That's where lead single \\"Wind It Up\\" comes in.  While it's innovative to use The Sound of Music's \\"Lonely Goatherds\\", that's about the only original thing it offers.  Saddly, Gwen trying to be a hip hop diva doesn't end there... Swizz Beats produced \\"Now That You Got It\\", and \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\" doesn't work either.  And while a lot of my friends LOVE \\"Orange County Girl\\", I couldn't get into it.  The tone in her voice annoyed me for one, and the lyrics aren't that best either.  Also, I tried to like \\"U Started It\\"... but it's lyrics are so dull that it prevented me from doing so. However, the worst song on the album is without a doubt \\"Breakin' Up\\"... the stupidity of the song gives me a headache.<br /><br />However, there are a hand full of good tracks on this album.  Second single and title track \\"The Sweet Escape\\" was catchy enough to be the most successful single off the album so far.  Third single \\"4 In The Morning\\" is a sweet ballad a little reminiscent of her past work \\"Cool\\".  also, Nellee Hooper produced \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"Wonderful Life\\", the latter being co-written with Linda Perry, are probably my favorites on the album.  Also, \\"Yummy\\" is probably the best hip-hop song.  The slick sexiness of Gwen comes out in this song and it's Neptune's beat.<br /><br />Gwen is without a doubt a woman who goes to beat of her own drum.  Saddly, up 'til now that was always a good thing.  However, with The Sweet Escape, the problem was she really didn't follow her own drum anymore.  Sure, her STYLE of hip-hop is kinda different than everyone elses, however, all the same she basically made it an all hip-hop album.  Maybe it was to compete with people like Fergie, however, Fergie pulls the hip hop angle better than Gwen.  I would recomend IF she goes for a third solo album, to go back to her roots because this just didn't work.  And that's really sad because I had to go from her last, 5 star, album to this...it's Neptune's beat.    Gwen is without a doubt a woman who goes to beat of her own drum.  Saddly, up 'til now that was always a good thing.  However, with The Sweet Escape, the problem was she really didn't follow her own drum anymore.

0618680004|5.0|The best book that I have read  in a long time. Can't emphasize it enough, very good.
1594489505|5.0|After reading The Kite Runner, I was so looking forward to Khaled Hosseini's new book.  It was worth the wait!  The plot is so interesting and page turning, I finished the book in less than two days.  Such a heartbreaking, yet uplifting story of two women who find strength in each other in the midst of extreme personal tragedy.  Mr. Hosseini's writing style is an inspiration and this story gives humanity to the struggles Afghanistan has faced in the last fifty years.  A marvelous book!  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!
B000EOTEPO|5.0|An excellent album by one of the titans of Scandinavian black metal, At The Heart Of Winter features what I consider to be Immortal's most solid line-up - Abbath on guitars (and pretty much everything else), and Horgh on drums. Horgh manages to maintain the tempos throughout, leaving Abbath free to concentrate on unleashing devastating blasts of distorted power. The production is also markedly improved over their previous efforts, and while those who consider themselves \\"tr00 kvlt\\" will no doubt bash this album for not having a \\"pure black metal sound\\", I think it fits the album very well. Why? Because Immortal had started to infuse their sound with elements of German thrash metal, and the enhanced production allows their updated guitar style to be heard in all its glory. Listen to the phenomenal riffage on \\"Solarfall\\" and \\"Where Dark And Light Don't Differ\\" for proof. On a more general note, the trademark Abbath \\"reptilian warlord from hell\\" croaked vocals are in fine form, and as usual, Immortal manages to inject beautiful melody and ambience amidst the carnage of whirlwind guitars and drums - check out the outro riff to \\"Withstand The Fall Of Time\\", \\"Solarfall\\" and \\"At The Heart Of Winter\\".   <br /> <br />I consider this one of my three favorite Immortal albums, along with \\"Battles In The North\\" and \\"Sons Of Northern Darkness\\". It's well worth checking out.
B000O178BY|5.0|This is the master's best album yet.  A concept album with an end-times theme predicting America's fate using its current state of affairs for reference.  Trent Reznor has stepped outside of himself this time and written about the human race as a whole instead of just his personal predicament.  This CD is worth a listen even if you were never a Nine Inch Nails fan before.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Seeing this movie, one wonders if she may have been Queen Elizabeth II in a previous life. As difficult it is to play someone still living, and very very popular, she performed with excellence and disctinction. It is no wonder the Queen invited her to Tea.

B000FQJAIW|1.0|I agree with any of a number of previous reviewers: Would somebody PLEASE take STAR WARS away from George Lucas before he ruins it completely?<br /><br />Like Francis Ford Coppola, who messed with THE GODFATHER trilogy over and over again trying to \\"perfect\\" it, Lucas keeps coming back to the original STAR WARS trilogy and adding enhanced effects and formerly deleted scenes.<br /><br />In what is now known as STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE, (let me catch my breath a minute, please), Lucas decided to add creatures to the Mos Eiseley spaceport scene, alter the classic cantina scene, throw in a scene between Jabba the Hutt and Han Solo in the hangar of the \\"Millennium Falcon,\\" add a sappy reunion scene between Biggs and Luke just before the Battle of Yavin, make the battle scene explosions more \\"dramatic,\\" do a score of other little tweaks, and clean up the print.<br /><br />Lucas has done this so many times over the past three decades that it's now impossible to figure out which film is the \\"real\\" STAR WARS. Of all the questionable \\"improvements\\" he's made, cleaning up the print is the only worthwhile effort. Most of the added scenes add nothing to the film, the \\"extra\\" creatures are interesting but unnecessary, and some of the changes  actually degrade the movie, because the dialogue is repetitious. For example:<br /><br />IN THE CANTINA:<br /><br />Greedo---Jabba has no use for smugglers who dump their cargoes at the first sign of an Imperial ship.<br /><br />Han---Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?<br /><br />and<br /><br />IN THE HANGAR:<br /><br />Jabba--- I have no use for smugglers who dump their cargoes at the first sign of an Imperial ship.<br /><br />Han---Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?<br /><br />Not only was it repetitious, but the hangar scene immediately followed the cantina scene, making the repetition even more obvious. DEAR LORD, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, MR. LUCAS??????<br /><br />Fortunately, this two-disc set contains the original theatrical release with all the nicks and imperfections it was born with. The print's a bit dim, and the special effects are showing their limitations after thirty years, but this is the STAR WARS that will remain STAR WARS. It is what it is, and it never needed changes. Given the immense amount of material that has grown up around STAR WARS since it was first released, Lucas would have been smarter to release one or the other or both versions as he did, but added an Extras disc with all kinds of \\"The Making Of..\\" and \\"The Legacy Of...\\" goodies. I was disappointed that this isn't that set.<br /><br />I was one of the first people to see STAR WARS when it debuted in the summer of 1977. At age 17, this now-classic movie became and remains a benchmark of an era in my life. While I never became a \\"Jedihead\\" (the original tag for the STAR WARS version of a Trekkie), I liked the film a great deal.<br /><br />STAR WARS is not CITIZEN KANE IN OUTER SPACE. It's not a \\"great\\" film, but it is a true \\"classic.\\" At the end of the first film you might even wonder what all the hype was about. Yet the movie has a engaging and endearing quality that makes you want to keep coming back for more, the true basis of success and the core of meaningfulness for any story. STAR WARS is clearly derivative. THE LORD OF THE RINGS has a \\"Dark Lord.\\" STAR WARS has a \\"Dark Lord of the Sith.\\" Lightsabers are yet another nod to the film's Sword & Sorcery roots, as is the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (a little Gandalf, anyone?). STAR WARS' \\"Corellians\\" appear in Isaac Asimov's FOUNDATION as \\"Korellians\\", and \\"Han Solo\\" is also there as \\"Hari Seldon.\\" The space war elements are a mishmash of STAR TREK, FORBIDDEN PLANET, AMAZING STORIES, pulp fiction, and a hundred other sources. George Lucas was able to take these well-used pieces and combine them into something that is both very original and yet archetypal.<br /><br />STAR WARS is a sci-fi retelling of the Mythos of the young Hero. Aided by a mentor (Obi-Wan), an older, more seasoned companion (Han), and his own court jesters (See Threepio and Artoo Detoo), the young Hero (Luke) is introduced to his special (Jedi) birthright, saves the beautiful Princess (Leia) from the clutches of Evil (Darth Vader), and then must confront that Evil himself (the Battle of Yavin).<br /><br />Since STAR WARS is so mythic and archetypal, it survives some really bad acting by the background characters, a few missed beats here and there, and even Lucas's post-theatrical obsessive-compulsive changes to remain a modern classic.<br /><br />FIVE STARS FOR \\"STAR WARS\\", ONE STAR FOR LUCAS' DECISION (OBSESSION?) TO \\"IMPROVE\\" IT.(See Threepio and Artoo Detoo), the young Hero (Luke) is introduced to his special (Jedi) birthright, saves the beautiful Princess (Leia) from the clutches of Evil (Darth Vader), and then must confront that Evil himself (the Battle of Yavin).    Since STAR WARS is so mythic and archetypal, it survives some really bad acting by the background characters, a few missed beats here and there, and even Lucas's post-theatrical obsessive-compulsive changes to remain a modern classic.     FIVE STARS FOR \\"STAR WARS\\", ONE STAR FOR LUCAS' DECISION (OBSESSION?) TO \\"IMPROVE\\" IT.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|By far the most engaging set of movies i have ever come across. A must see for anyone who appreciates the beauty of our world. The best photography i have seen across the board. Dont hesitate on making this  video apart of your collection. Wonderful series.
B000MTDRKE|4.0|Neal Morse has become one of my favorite prog musicians. His talent is astounding, mind-boggling actually, and his songwriting prowess is equally impressive. It was with great anticipation that I received Sola Scriptura after the perfection of ?, a modern-day prog masterpiece.<br /><br />Sola Scirptura falls short of the brilliance of ?, but only slightly. The first two tracks, despite being outwardly opinionated and even pompous in their lyrical content, shine in their instrumentalism and melodies. Impressively structured and heavy in content. Quite a shining acheivement! The ballad falls short of Neal's earlier efforts on Testimony and One, and the final track is a rehashing of material from Snow in the first part, and the revisiting of themes from the first two tracks, not as well done as it was on ? (12 and Entrance).<br /><br />Still--welll worth getting for the first two tracks alone, over 50 minutes of music.
0747541604|5.0|I like all of Gorey's work. The stories are simply worded and have a feeling of every word in its place. The art at a first glance also seems rather simple in an intriguing way, the you look closer and the tiny lines drag you in the rest of the way.<br /><br />I think for many people, Edward Gorey is a love him or hate him thing. You either find it very amusing or just plain sickening nonsense. I happen to be of the former. I do have some trouble with some of his stories (that dang statue book...) because I find them somewhat....pointless. This book, however, is one of the more comprehensible, if also one of the most simple in premise.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a bit of \\"dark humor\\" now and again. But, really, unless your kid is pretty tough, don't read it as a bedtime story until they are old enough to really understand that it's not real. If you must introduce them to Gorey at a young and tender age, go pick up a copy of [[ASIN:0747541655 The Epiplectic Bicycle]] (My other favorite E.G. book) or one of his more nonsensical books. Don't give your kid nightmares.
0609610570|5.0|Bossidy put together the most comprehensive top to bottom case for execution yet written.  What so many books on business forget to emphasize is the people part of the equation.  Bossidy balances not only having the right people but making sure the company is passionate about developing them and getting them in the right jobs where they can produce the best results for the company and themselves.  Strategy is worthless without the right people that can execute to make the strategy happen.  While Bossidy advocates strong messures for non preformers, he does so with delibert respect for individuals and reasonable compassion. <br />Rod Hagenbuch
0307346609|5.0|I am so embarassed to admit this (being an intellectual and a peaceful person, and a Buddhist and all that), but I absolutely could not stop reading this book.  I picked it up from someone else's bookshelf and had my nose in it all afternoon until I had finished.  Rumor has it that they're making it into a movie, but I'm sure it would make several good movies. <br /> <br />The author gives thanks in the beginning of the book to Studs Terkel,and this book really has that Studs Terkel \\"man on the street\\" feel to it.  Old Studs must have been a real inspiration.   <br /> <br />This book is also great for people who don't have very long attention spans, as the \\"interviews\\" with \\"survivors\\" of the Zombie War are quite brief.  Some are as long as 20 pages, some as short as 2.   This also makes it an excellent choice for bathroom reading.  It's a lot better than \\"People\\" magazine.  If you put this book in the magazine rack, your guests won't come out of the bathroom!  <br />
B000O75F7C|5.0|Porcupine Tree is perhaps one of the best rock bands on the new millenium. Although not as good as Deadwing, FOABP is damn close to perfect. A progressive journey that will please fans of many musical genres. It is with recordings like this that you will force yourself to explore a band's back library. You should do that with PT. They are a GREAT band, visionary even. And they just keep getting better and better.
0634060384|5.0|The Real Book is a Musician's best friend.  It is a reference guide to some of the best standards know to man.  Whether just jammin with your friends, or playin alone, this book is highly reccommended.  I have played many pieces out of this Real Book for each of these stated purposes, and many more.  Not only does this Real Book give you more selections of music to play, it allows you to broaden your musical ability, by learning more styles and chords.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|After reading many reviews from die-hard Wilco fans, many of them will take issue with the title of my review.  I can almost predict them now: \\"Classic Wilco?...but, but, but, they don't sound like \\"Yankee...\\" or \\"A ghost...\\" anymore...-those- were classic Wilco.    I disagree.    Whether with \\"YHF\\", \\"A ghost..\\", or any other Wilco album, Jeff Tweedy's ingenuity lies in his endless ability to recycle, then make his own, a huge pallette of musical influences from the 60s and 70s.  Sky Blue Sky is just a continuation or evolution of his method.     Some people seem upset that \\"Sky\\" doesn't contain the noise driven interludes of its two predecessors, but if you listen closely, they're still there.  Most of the songs on \\"Sky\\" do contain some spaces for improvisation, albeit more muted.    I read one review in a major publication that called \\"Sky\\" parody.  The old saying goes that imitation is the highest form of flattery.  While \\"Sky\\" contains a long list of musical cliches from the 60s and 70s, it's difficult to say whether it's outright mockery or parody.  If it is, then Beck and Wilco have elevated parody to the highest art form, and in the process seen tremendous success.    Can you hear Grateful Dead on \\"Sky\\"? Sure.  Some Steely Dan thrown in for good measure? Sure.  Eagles or Don Henley? Check. Prog rock elements? Yep.  It's all in there.    Sky Blue Sky may just be Wilco's best record to date. Not in spite of the influences, or in spite of being mellower than their previous efforts, but precisely because of it.      Wilco owes its existence to classic rock (a radio format I loathe with a passion), and in the process, has become classic (not to mention classy) itself.  Rock on, Mr. Tweedy!
0380778556|5.0|Rebecca is, hands down, my favorite book of all time.  I first discovered it at 13, after my mom suggested it to me (it's one of her favorite books as well).  I've read it several times since then, and each time is sheer pleasure, though I echo a previous reviewer's envy for those who get to experience Rebecca for the first time.  I admit the book is not perfect, literarily speaking.  It is also not a mystery in a traditional \\"whodunit\\" sense, nor is it a traditional ghost story.  However, Daphne Du Maurier achieves something very few writers can do (and none as well as her): she creates a sense of atmosphere that pervades every word and all the space in between the words, and truly makes you feel as though you are there in the story.  World War III could start while I'm reading Rebecca and I would not notice it.  The gothic atmosphere stays with you long after you finish the book.  I also marvel at how the main character is not actually a character per se but rather a presence--her ghost haunts all the characters and you the reader as well.  Absolute magic.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|When you are used to the rithmical lyrics, vocals and explosive beat of the past albums, this new one may seem a little too \\"normal\\" or bland. <br />But once you get used to it, is yet another great release.  <br />Linkin Park never dissapoints.

0618680004|3.0|It takes someone of Dawkins's brilliance and scholarship to write a work that misses the point so thoroughly, so irrefutably. If, for some reason, Dawkins did not believe that Earth is a sphere, I could see where his discourse on flatness of our planet would attract as many supporters as this book. Would it make our planet any flatter though?
B000PFUAO6|3.0|I have been a fan since 92.  This band peaked creatively with Scenes & Six Degrees and since then seem to copy themselves.  This CD sounds like it could have been the second disc to Train of Thought.  Systematic Chaos is much better than Octovarium, but is not a great DT CD.  They spend much too much time seeing how fast they can shred...after a while, yawn! They did enough of that on TOT.  For some reason they went into the studio and did it again.  I agree with another review that suggested they take some time off and get their \\"creative\\" juices flowing again.  How many more times can they re-record the same CD?
B000MG1YC0|2.0|I wasn't impressed.  The lead singer's voice is not as rich as I expected, and I read somewhere that this band considered themselves to be \\"symphonic\\" metal, and even went so far as to invite comparisons with Dimmu Borgir.  Yet I heard very few strings or winds, and I heard none of the bombast associated with Dimmu's latest offerings (Death Cult Armageddon & In Sorte Diaboli).<br /><br />The songs are amateurish with bland, predictable melodies that lack energy and lyrical content that sounds like it came directly out of my buddy's goth sister's diary.<br /><br />In short, mopey 14-year-old self-mutilators who just lost their \\"one true love\\" will eat this up.  The rest of us have better things to do.

B000O178BY|4.0|I'm sorry.  I love NIN to death and I think the sound on this album represents Trent at his most innovative.<br /><br />But, c'mon:  Did he honestly think he was bringing anything new to the table with the vision of the future that he's presented?  Countless bands have built albums around their own bleak interpretation of the future, totalitarian government and all.  It's been done.  Big deal.<br /><br />This political grandstanding among some of music's bigger acts is becoming tiresome.  Reminds me of Janine Garafolo's (sp?) puppet Doppleganger on \\"Team America:\\"<br /><br />  -\\"As celebrities, it's our job to read the newspapers  and then repeat what we read in the newspapers as if it's our own opinions!\\"-<br /><br />Read Reznor's recent interview with Terrorizer magazine.  It's as if he truly believes this album and others like it will effect some sort of far-reaching social change.<br /><br />Not likely.  But keep holding out, fellas.

0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist- Paulo Coelho <br />\\"If you believe yourself worthy of the thing you fought so hard to get, then you become an instrument of God, you help the Soul of the World, and you understand why you are here\\". This quote from Paulo Coelho highlights the main theme in The Alchemist, the story of a shepherd boy, Santiago, who decides to search for his \\"Personal Legend\\" and discovers the wonders of the ultimate creator, God. In The Alchemist, Coelho uses characterization, thematic ideas, and symbolism to create an inspiring tale of self-discovery that encourages readers to take risks and live life to the fullest.  <br />Coelho creates Santiago as a universal character who encounters struggle and joy while discovering his purpose on Earth. Santiago is characterized as a rather optimistic, curious, and determined young man who finds hope in despair, refusing to submit himself to defeat and regret. Along his journey, Santiago learns about the theme of one's personal legend, the dream or goal in life that is part of God's chosen path. By observing Santiago's reactions to omens and the teachings of the alchemist, the reader is encouraged to evaluate his or her own purpose in life. Furthermore, through the element of symbolism, Coelho uses minor characters like the baker and crystal merchant to represent the loss of a dream and the regret that follows. Despite this regret, Coelho leaves the readers with the hope that we all have the choice to follow God's path for our lives.  <br />I recommend this book to readers of all ages and walks of life because of its unifying element; Santiago's discovery of faith reveals that all humans have the ability to live life to the fullest. In The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho reminds us that sometimes the treasure we are searching for is right under our noses, but it is the necessity of the journey in which we learn of the true treasures life holds.     <br />
B000HIVO64|5.0|What I sought when buying this album was a sequence of funky, mostly upbeat songs, not too repetitive, with some original melodies, use of computerized sounds, as well as this refreshing, contemporary feel to them. And thats pretty much what the album turned out to deliver. The first half of the album - mainly up to \\"Nausea\\" - is a sequence of cool songs, while the album gets more experimental and more downbeat towards the end - but still quite interesting. Favorite songs? IMO \\"Cellphone's dead\\" and \\"Elevator Music\\". Hits? \\"Think I'm in Love\\" and \\"Nausea\\".

B000MRAAJM|5.0|If anything shows off your HDTV and your Playstation 3 or other BluRay player, it is this excellent series narrated by the ever green David Attenborough. Who, by the way, this time does get in front of the incredible zooming powers of the brand new cameras that captured some of the rarer and more pretty parts of our world.  <br /> <br />Only niggles are that some rare parts of video are not HD, that they could have fitted the whole series on 2 Double Layer BluRay discs instead of 4 Single Layer discs (I guess we owe this partly to HD DVD's lesser capacity, on which this was released slightly earlier). On the other hand, it uses VC-1 which hides 3:2 pulldown best, and there are is no region protection on this disc so you can purchase a U.S. version and use it in Europe.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|While spending the day with my brother (who had return to Utah soon), my parents suggested that we go to the theater to see \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\\" - \\"Monster House,\\" or \\"The Illusionist\\", ----- a film my brother wanted to see before he left. Naturally there was a disagreement between the youngest and oldest of the family because my brother had already seen Dead Man's chest. Nothing more was said about it and thus as we headed out I naturally assumed we had agreed on seeing Pirates Of The Caribbean, though I had my doubts. Naturally my doubts were solidified when I entered the theater and caught the neon sign that read \\"The illusionist.\\" My sister and I were right mad that we had been tricked by our parents into seeing a movie we had no desire to see at all. Grudgingly I decided to fall purposely asleep just to spite them.<br /><br />Well, my plan backfired. I ended up watching the film anyway.<br /><br />At first glance the film didn't seem to build up to much especially since they started off without much introduction to what was actually going on. Edward Norton's character, Eisenheim, is shown being arrested by Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) for crimes (or high treason) against the crown Prince Leopold for reasons unknown. From there Inspector Uhl returns to the Prince and briefs him on what he leaned of the Magician. As a young man named Edward, he lived with his family and helped out with carptentry. On one fateful day he met an old man on a path. There the old man shows the young man a magic trick before supposedly vanishing himself, taking along with him the tree that sheltered him (according to rumors most likely to be outlandish). From there the young Edward takes a strong liking to magic to the point where he is emerged in its rituals almost every single day. As luck would have it he happens to meet the daughter of a well off family, named Sophie. The two become friends, Edward shares everything with Sophie and the two eventually become lovers of the forbidden kind. Sophie's family forbids the young woman ever to see Edward again. One night the two run off into the woods in hopes to runaway from their respective lives when Sophie's bodyguards find them and separate the two. Edward disappears soon there afterward, never to be heard from again.<br /><br />From there Inspector Uhl explains with great detail, events that took place before the arresting of the magician Eisenheim. The storyline for this movie brilliantly crafted in a way that will certainly surprise the viewer. Throughout the movie -- after the reunion of Sophie [now Duchess and betrothal to Prince Leopold] and Edward -- the storyline has you believing in one scenario when in truth its entirely different thing all together. One would presume to have the story all worked out upon discovering Eisenheim plans to run away with the Duchess, that the movie is as predicable as it is mystifying. But it truth the movie fools you right to the very end, and is sure to leave your mouth hanging agape with awe. In spite of my ill temper, I found the movie to be overly entertaining. I was well aware of Giamatti's talents as an actor so it came to no surprise his performance as Inspector Uhl, was quite believable. Rufus Sewell was excellent in his role as the abusive and controlling Leopold, a person who, despite his foul persona, I ended up feeling sorry for in the end. Edward Norton, whom really isn't my favorite actor, proves in this film that he be a reasonably likable character beyond the usual 'scum bag' he portrays, and does it well. Everything about the character Eisenheim is believable and equally amazing; The magic tricks he performs are impressive. However, the one actor that amazed me the most was Jessica Biel as Duchess Sophie; I honestly was not convinced that she could play characters beyond the typecast 21st century girlfriend (of the scornful kind), or \\"Abigail Whistler\\" of BLADE: TRINITY. Biel's performance did not remind you of anythe roles she played beforehand, which proved to me that she was a genuine actress.<br /><br />The CGI utilized in this film was also quite well; The Phantoms lurking about in the film when Eisenheim is down on his luck, were crafted well in the ghostly like manner. Thankfully not a lot of it was used in the film, but whenever it was used it borderlined between believably real to obviously animated. The music, composed by Philp Glass, truly intensified the atmosphere of this period piece with romantic and sorrowful melodies sure to tug at the heartstrings. All in all THE ILLUSIONIST is sure to dazzle audiences with it sharp storytelling, romance, and characters. A highly recommended movie, sure to leave you surprised, a feat I believed no movie to do any longer. ---- [a 4 out of 5]BLADE: TRINITY.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|This set of dvd's is nothing short of breath-taking.  I've never seen footage like this... ever.  And what makes it that much more special is that it's in full high definition, so it feels that much more real.  I'll go as far as to say, if you don't buy it, you're crazy.
