B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was very intense it has a lot of parts that gave the book a twist. The book also got very emotional.
B0071CNGI8|5.0|Excellent book,packed with knowledge and history. Watched the movie twice on SHOTIME. Young actor has a bright future ahead of him. A good family movie about the love aof  a horse and all animals included.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|The product have an excellent quality and it's that I was waiting. The articles came to destination just time. Excellent!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works as advertised, very helpful and accurate. Would highly recommend to anyone. Very simple interface and good graphics and set up.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This had to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  Would recommend for adults no kids
B00AKCJB44|5.0|This soundtrack is phenomenal in its compilation and emotional evocations.  Illustrated with track 16, &#34;Ancora Qui&#34;, I haven't any idea she's saying or what the song's about, but it doesn't matter. I still love it for how it makes me feel. The whole album is like this. I can't stop listening.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story. Very entertaining and nice character development. Unfortunately, you want to know what happens after the series, and from what I gather reading some other reviews, they are not as well written. I will be looking for more titles from Mr. Howey.
B0054TVW04|3.0|Ferguson begins from an obvious observation, i..e, that the West dominated the rest of the world for the last 5-6 centuries.  Then he proceeds with attributing the dominance to six areas in which the West accomplished undisputed advantages and refers to them using a cutesy term \\"killer apps\\".  This alone made me cringe each time it was mentioned, particularly that the term did not bring anything to the understanding of the issue.<br />The execution of the book is confused and superficial.  For one, \\"West\\" is never defined properly.  Sometimes one has a strong impression that Ferguson means by it anglo-saxon culture.  Second, he never explains what kind of dominance he has in mind.  Large parts of the book are devoted to colonialism, but there are other ways of dominating other cultures and without a proper distinction it is difficult to understand what Ferguson is up to.  For example, Germans were latecomers and colonialism understood as physical presence overseas played only marginal role in their history.<br />It is also regrettably that the author is so anglo-centric.  The predominance of anglo-saxon model is a relatively new phenomenon (post WWII, to be precise) and by focusing on it Ferguson weakens his case.  Sometimes his remarks are unintentionally funny, for example when he calls napoleonic legal system second best after anglo-saxon.  Really?<br />The anglo-saxon racism is generally underplayed, for example much space is devoted to the fate of native population in South and Central America.  However, Ferguson never mentions strikingly different fate of native americans in the present US territories.<br />Most of the text is devoted to retelling of well-known stories and while the style is lively, I wish I could learn something I did not know already.<br />Finally, whenever Ferguson is supposed to say something original, as for example in the last chapter, he does not have anything profound to say and as far as predictions go the take-home message seems to be \\"who can tell\\".
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I see so many five star CD's here on Amazon, how is this possible I wonder to myself? This IS a five star CD, as is their other CD, 'The Wall', as is 'Led Zeppelin IV', The Eagles 'Greatest Hits', Nirvana's 'Never Mind', Meat Loafs 'Bat Out Of Hell', or The Beatles, ' Sargent Peppers', for example. So if all these are five star albums, as they indeed are, how can all these hordes of other, lessor albums also be five stars? It's an insult to what actually is a five star album, it waters down its significance. There should be very few five star albums here or anywhere else for that matter!<br /><br />Just like the standing ovation, remember when that actually ment something? I do. When I was younger, I overheard my Mom talking to my Grandmother on the phone one day and Mom said &#34;OMG did you see that Johnny Cash got a standing ovation last night?.....I got goosebumps too when I saw that&#34;. The standing ovation was so rare back then it was actually a topic of conversation! Today it is given out like candy on Halloween, and as such it is basically meaningless now. Sad really!<br /><br />So I guess to sum it up, this actually IS a five star album and belongs in every music lover's collection, right next to 'Morrison Hotel'!
1932907009|5.0|As an aspiring novelist, the advice given within by Mr. Snyder is invaluable to both novelists and (I imagine) screenwriters. Highly recommended.
B001EN71DG|5.0|As it is near impossible to find the actual theatrical edition of the trilogy, I was pleased as punch to find it here. The original versions come on the bonus discs of this 6 disc set, which is fine because then you have the remastered versions to do with what you will (i.e. coasters, frisbees).
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Rarely do I feel compelled to write a review, much less a bad review, but it is about to happen my friends, right here, in regard to this book. First off, I probably should not have read this book at all, just to keep things in perspective. I don't generally read romance novels, or watch romantic comedies, but the reviews on this book were so positive! It sounded like a religious experience! A magical journey full of awesomeness and non cheesy love! And it was $3.99 people, $3.99!<br />It was in fact a one way ticket on a fast train to Cheese Town. Lots of crying, dudes saying things they never actually would say in real life, crazy unrealistic plot twists which always resulted in either crying, or sex, or often both at the same time. And my least favorite aspect: the weird \\"girl is molested as a child and finds tearful healing in the arms of a teenage boy angle\\". Ack! Barf! Weirded out!<br />Perhaps this is common in romance novels and I am simply unaware. Perhaps in romance novels interesting, sardonic, quippy, female characters always devolve into some sort of tearful victim so that they can then be rescued by a dude. Maybe this is just an extreme example of that dynamic and I am simply unaware because I do not typically read this genre of literature.<br />I do have a few positives: The author is great at fast paced snappy dialogue so that was one enjoyable aspect of this book. I also give her props for never referring to anyone's vagina as their \\"sex\\",which I just sort of assume occurs in romance novels, I could be wrong here. I appreciated that she was not puritanical and judgy about teenage sex, though by the same token I have no idea why anyone would ever want to read about it. Unless they themselves are teenagers. But if not, just eww[...]<br />In closing, I am deeply confused about why so many people rave about this book, but like I said, I am probably not the target audience anyhow.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I have been a huge Michael Connelly fan since his first book.  I was disappointed in BLACK BOX.  The convenient coincidences and weak script were not up to Mr. Connelly's usual top flight writing. Next year is another book, right?  I'll be waiting.
0060765488|5.0|Although Anthony Z. thought  it was only OK, all the other kids in Room 35 who read it gave it 5 stars. They loved how imaginative it was.
B000XXTCF8|5.0|This is a great collection...truly a greatest hits... It's only missing 1 or 2 that i wish were on there
B00847UYWA|3.0|I'm a big fan of the Lovecraftian Cthulhu Mythos, and I enjoyed some of the stories in this collection of short stories and poems, but this is a very mixed bag in terms of quality.<br /><br />There are really only 3 stories that have much to do with &#34;The King in Yellow&#34; play, Hastur, or the Yellow Sign. They are &#34;The Repairer of Reputations&#34;, &#34;In the Court of the Dragon&#34;, and &#34;The Yellow Sign&#34; (obviously). The story &#34;The Mask&#34; makes a passing reference to the play because one of the characters owns a copy of it, but that's it.<br /><br />The rest of the stories are really bland, and have nothing to do with the King in Yellow at all. Most of them have nothing supernatural in them whatever. They seem to be simple filler with no central theme other than their location (France) and their protaganists being artisits.<br /><br />Since this book is free on Kindle, there's no reason not to get it, but I wouldn't bother reading past the first four stories unless you have OCD and have to complete every book you start.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great app that has a lot of features... the numbers are big and it is very easy to read and see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The graphics are sharp and colorful, the game can be played while laying down on your side (since tilting the tablet doesn't affect gameplay) and it's cute.<br /><br />The bonus characters are really expensive, but that's to encourage you to buy coins and support the developers. If you don't want to buy coins you will still eventually earn enough coins to buy any of the bonus characters anyway so this isn't really a problem with the game.
B005JABSB6|5.0|I love it. Been looking for one for a couple of years. Glad I finely found one and works great.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I own both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City for my PS3, and the gameplay is obviously based on those two games. It follows the plot of the movie more or less, but you'll be doing plenty of open-world thug stomping along the way. This game is worth every penny.<br /><br />The only downside to this game is that it has a large filesize and will probably go a long way to filling up your Kindle's internal memory. Since Kindle's don't have SD cards, unless you have one of the Kindle Fire HDs with the large hard drive, this could be an issue. However, since you can always erase it and re-download it from the cloud it's not a major problem, but it is something you should keep in mind.
B005H2IAM6|5.0|if you haven't yet...this is a must see and have!!!took me awhile but i finally found me a copy of my own.
B009XEE0DW|3.0|I am a long standing Mylene's admirer but my excitment to new material has already dimished 3 or 4 albums ago, waiting for a good come back!<br />Read the French reviews (quite numerous) and it is clear that, although liked overall, only 2 tracks stand out, 'Monkey Me' and 'Nuit D'hiver' (may be 'A force de...' also). They are more original and close to Mylene's style than the rest... ah, the rest. The rest is plain, lazy euro-pop style, samey and unimaginative. Listenable but not worthy of Mylene's best (and expansive) track record.<br />Not conviced that Laurent has any musical inspiration left or they play safe with average pop. Mylene's lyrics are getting worse also... really not impressed overall.<br />Not the come back I would wish to hear :(
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is one of the best books I've ever read. Katie goes through such a unique journey that draws you in.<br />I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to know what happened in Katie's past and the reason she<br />came to Southport. You can tell the first time Alex and Katie meet that there was a spark and Alex was going<br />to be a major part in her new life. I really liked that, as the reader, you knew what was happening from multiple<br />points of view. I never would have guessed the book ended the way it did, but it was the perfect ending.<br />Overall, Safe Haven was suspenseful, entertaining, and breathtaking. One more thing, Safe Haven is not<br />the average Nicholas Sparks love story. Although romance is a part of the story there is much, much more<br />that goes on.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|Good turntable easy software to use.  Only drawback is no editing of music.  If there are pops or scratches or skipping there is no way to mend those issues.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love the opportunity to read Kindle on my android. Very convenient & easy to use. Basically its the same as having a Kindle. Love it!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I haven't gotten excited about a new record since discovering the many faces of Kings of Leon back in 2006.  This one is a dandy from start to finish.  My favorites being \\"I found you\\" and \\"Be Mine\\".  \\"Be Mine\\" should be a single - I think it would be huge.  But they are all really good and no fast forwarding is required.  Download the whole record.  This is Otis Redding circa 2012 to a tee, and it's just a good, if not better.  The soul with which she sings is amazing.  The band is excellent too - great guitar, drums, and piano/organ.  Sounds just like an old Detroit or Memphis recording - except better.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Just installed this app and was given a high risk security warning. I would suggest anyone with this app do a scan.
030758836X|2.0|We read this in our book club. I still am trying to figure out what all the hype about this book is. I feel it dragged and ended lame.
0547848412|1.0|I bought this book before anyone had ever heard of it or the movie. What a disappointment. It goes all over the place, doesn't make sense, leaves gaps everywhere and ends in a ridiculous way. I gave it to my Mom to read - she didn't like it either. Two generations with the opinion of \\"do not waste your time.\\" We are trading it in for credit at the used bookstore up the street. As far as I'm concerned this book is not for kids. The violence is definitely too much and the disjointed adult story line would just confuse them. Instead of wasting time on this book, take out an old board game and have some quality family time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I literally had to stop reading so I wouldn't finish the book too soon! One weekend was good enough to hold out.
6304698623|5.0|Just as the product was described. No; scratches, tares, or any type of damage to the item. I am very pleased with the product.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this series. SO MUCH BETTER THAN TWILIGHT..couldn't put it down.  now I can't wait to see the movie now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you can do anything on it but its not as good as the Pc version recomend it to all minecrafters
B003TSEEDY|1.0|Format is annoying. Characters are stereotypical and protagonist's strange behavior is poorly explained. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Like the book. I always like happy endings. Ending across bit predictably though. Is there going to be a further book I wonder.<br />Poo
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Couldn't wait to get these - and they came right quickly. Am enjoying every minute. This time I get to enjoy the sets and the staging. It's amazing. Sometimes it feels as if I'm looking at these for the first time. If you enjoyed Downton Abbey the first time, you'll love the freedom of seeing them again - when you want! Wonderful performances! Sumptuous settings and what an eye for detail - perfection!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books were amazing. Once I started I could not put them down. Wish there were more to read!!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game I was looking for something like Sim City and this works I recommend this game if you want something like that
1451695187|2.0|While the story of Dr Alexander's illness and miraclulous recovery is somewhat interesting I didn't find any \\"proof of Heaven\\" in his account. His NDE is very different from many other's experiences I have read about. If you want a more scientific approach consider Life After Death by D'Souza.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was amazing!!! I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to read the rest of the series!! Woo hoo!
B0043EV774|4.0|That guy is really amazing.  Everything from Willy Wonka to Benny (& Joon) to Captain Jack Sparrow and now to the Mad Hatter.  His characters are always really quirky, intriguing, and well played.  It is hard to believe they are all just the one guy (and to see him off screen you'd never be able to imagine him in these quirky parts).  No, he's not the star of this film, but I probably would not have bought it if it hadn't had Johnny Depp in it.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film, I found it to be quite draggy at the start and then it got interesting.  It is night-and-day different from the original Disney animation film.  But this new film does follow the original Lewis Carrol work more closely.  This film is dark and strange ... just like the original stories//poems.<br /><br />Kids will enjoy the action but they'd probably enjoy the older &#34;cartoon&#34; film more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is unlike any I've ever read...There are so many twists and turns and you always know what's going on in the minds of the two main characters.
B004G6009K|5.0|This movie is reminiscent of the original Disney classic animations.  It was as if Walt and the original crew did this film.  Anyone at any age can watch this movie and feel great from watching it.<br /><br />The musical number at the tavern was hilarious.  That frying pan as a running gag was priceless.<br /><br />It is a heartwarming story.  Everyone who own Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast should also own this film.  (I just wish I could say the same about Brave ... what a sad waste of two hours and 30 bucks that film was.)
B0050SYS5A|4.0|I ordered this for Christmas for my grandson to use with his Xbox 360. Haven't really talked with him about it, but he hasn't complained either, so I figure it was good.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|If you watched the original TRON film and you were a computer person at the time, then you know the original was really, really so plausible as to what it might be like to be inside the computer.  It was very well done.  And the graphics at that time were as good as they could be.<br /><br />This new film loses that magic.  I don't feel like I'm in the computer any more.<br /><br />And I really don't like the way they made CLU into the bad guy (but then I'm still mad that they made Jim Phelps into the bad guy for the Misson: Impossible movie too)!<br /><br />But if you take this film on its own and not as a sequel to the original, then it's a good film.  The effects are great and there is a lot of action.  The characters are interesting, the story flows well, and the pacing is good.<br /><br />Of course in 3D it really shines as a visual experience.  It's even better if you've got a great surround system too.
B0045XICB2|5.0|Definitely a fun movie. Amazon makes it super easy to watch movie after movie. If you're a twilight fan, you don't want to miss this one! (Mr. Obvious)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have been playing this game since it was a flash game.  I played their &#34;Around The World in 80 Days&#34; before that and loved it.  That game is still my favorite match 3.  &#34;Call of Atlantis&#34; is just as much fun with excellent graphics, really &#34;smooth&#34; play, lots of add on plot segments, etc.  I really love this game.<br /><br />There are a lot of match 3 games out there but this one (and 80 Days) are among the very best.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|my grandchildren play this so its a challenge for me. Its fun to seemy 3 year old tell me how to play.
8866130915|3.0|You really have to dig down to the product description to see how tiny this planner is.  Based on the photo, it looked like the normal sized one you can spread out on your desk.  This one is too small to even stay open on a desk.  Only good to carry around in a pocket.  I returned it.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This season of American Horror Story is better than last.<br /><br />I hear there will be a season 3 and I am lovin it.
B00846REIS|4.0|Bared to you was painfully similar to 50 Shades. I liked this story as well but there were things that bothered me more in this storyline. The characters have an addicting nature to each other, but I don't quite understand his addiction with Eva. She is not described as gorgeous however the past women in his life are.  I was hoping to feel more connected with the main characters and their love or obsession with each other but never did.  The sex is mind blowing but COME ON!!! How many times can a person do it! Again and again like rabbits!! It just was very non believable as much as I would like to believe it! I will definitely be reading the next story in this series because I want to find out their history and why they are the way they are. I think this will help in understanding and connecting with the characters more.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Best zombie movie there is!  Hilarious cast.  Great times, excellent rewatch value. I highly recommend for all the zombie enthusiasts out there.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|We need to start taking care of ourselves, eatting right. I 'm happy to see that the medical profession is beginning to start taking notice of what has been going on for the past 30 years.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|It's a blu ray.  Came quickly, well packaged, movie worked.  I cannot complain about anything, certainly would purchase from the buyer again.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Definitely watchable with a couple of standout comedic performances, but nothing more. It's no Bridesmaids or The Hangover, but if you simply let yourself go, you'll enjoy a few laughs and a soupcon of good music. In the words of Carly Rae...watch me maybe...

B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Good effects and action. That Mila is still hot. Those flower mouthed Zombies need to evolve one more time, flower mouths are getting old already.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I guess cuz its easier to have it on the Kindle rather than carrying around a real deck of old fashioned cards, but personally I'd rather save my battery.
1932100385|5.0|I read the book and found that it was outstanding in giving factual info on health in America!!  Great info and very clear and precise!
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I got this game because it was free and because it was so popular, but I don't get it. I can't seem to get how to play it. I guess its me.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Game had a story to it. Felt that there could have been more to it. Game seemed to end way too soon.
1451695195|4.0|This book was a new look at life after death. Not the usual view - this one had more medical terminology and scientific views of what happens when you die, It shows that your mind, body and spirit are three separate things. and although one (the brain) is not functioning, the other two continue to live on. I enjoyed the book and will re-read it again.I have recommended to friends.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|I frankly did not like the Pierce Brosnan movies at all so this back to the basics approach was a welcome change. Daniel Craig is a great Bond second only to Connery. There are no Ice Hotels, satellite lasers and invisible cars here. One of the best action movies of the decade. This is a definite purchase for Blu-Ray.
B001993Y3G|3.0|Bought this as a gift for my mother, she is a big Kevin Costner fan and a fan of this movie.  I watched it with her on the Blu-Ray player I had gotten her for Christmas.  I was disappointed at the picture quality of the movie.  I even double checked the back of the case to see if it really was 1080p.  It claims to be but doesn’t appear to be any better than a standard DVD.  The movie is good and claims to be an extended edition, but if there is additional footage it must not be anything special as I didn’t catch any differences.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Nolan Batman films are easily superior to other comic book movies in terms of scripting, quality of acting, and sheer the craft of film-making. The cast has more Oscar nominees and winners than I can count. Nolan rescued the Bat franchise and has given Warner Brothers and DC a blueprint to follow when making future Batman movies- plausible plots, based in reality, a minimum of CGI, well conceived characters, and not insulting to the audience's intelligence. Batman can be evergreen like James Bond so long as the focus is on quality. Will Warner Brothers follow this? Signs don't look good as WB seems obsessed with shoving a Justice League movie down everyone's throat to copy the Avengers; does anyone really want to see Batman and Aquaman hang out? The Dark Knight Rises is an amazing end to an amazing trilogy. The Nolan trilogy may look even better in a few years when Warner Brothers is picking up the pieces of their aborted Justice League franchise. If you like Batman or action movies in general, pick this one up.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|First it’s hard to believe the Matrix is 10 years old, even harder to believe that Larry Wachowski  is now a woman.  Anyway the Blu Ray is excellent, I loved this movie the first time I saw it and still enjoy it when I see it now.  The special effects are still amazing.  A great addition to my growing Blu Ray collection.
1451696191|5.0|My daughter enjoys reading and this was on her pic list. She enjoys reading. The book was shipped just in time for Christmas
B005CA4SQK|5.0|The Walking Dead is amazing.  This collectible set is just as nice.  I’m so glad to see something good finally on TV.  Reality TV has taken over and ruined good television.  As a zombie movie fan, I was excited to see a series about zombies, but never expected it to be as good as it truly is.  It’s well written and the acting is good (with the exception of Lori’s character).  My only complaint is the season was too short.
B00338QENI|5.0|I like the parallel story lines of scientific advancement, the progress of patient rights/confidentiality laws and the personal story of the family. Very well-written and edited.  Surprisingly enjoyable and educational.
B008OOYALE|5.0|play with the dragons you can feed them to when you do. they get bigger have fun all day whither this game
B007J4T2G8|2.0|What's all the fuss about?  Left me uninterested in what comes next. Thought it might be a nice, light-weight diversion over the holidays, but I just couldn't wrap my head around it.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I purchased the kindle fire for my grandgraughter and I then purchased this case to go with it. Very fuctional and it can be used to support the kindle fire as shown in the picture.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Wonderful series extremely funny Sheldon is a hoot. A must see for everyone with a funny bone. And before long you week know ask the words to soft Kitty.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|It reminded me of situations in my life.  It may make you cry at times, but it is really good!
B001MSMULG|3.0|If you are a fan of Vince Flynn or Brad Thor, and expect the same from this book, I believe you will be disappointed. The book was well written, it had a lot of interesting facts and its obvious the writer did his research but its just not the same as with the two mentioned writers. I found the book to be somewhat boring and the action lacking in excitement.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This series of layouts is very challenging.  The only trouble I have with them is that I am too slow for some of them.  Have tried many times to get 3 stars and still  trying!
B007SGM084|5.0|Books like this are really not my type ! But this one had a great story to read ! By far my favorite book of 2012
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I keep my earpiece in this case when it's not on my head.  The case battery + headset battery = more talk time than I'll ever use.  I only actively talk for 2-3 hours on my phone a day making the charging case overkill, but I'd still purchase it again.  Works great for me.
B004G600A4|4.0|Great movie and if came quickly.  My daughter loves it and I like watching it with her.  Value good enough for Disney.
B0063GORYU|5.0|it was great I love this app couldn't ask for more from mobility ware I am so obsessed with this game
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I love Chris Nolan's take on Batman, and I bought this movie to complete my collection. Christian Bale played Batman better than anyone else.

B00499NHLC|5.0|Fantastic show! One of my new favorites so glad that amazon offered this so that we can watch it. Between  this and Doctor Who I am one happy camper.
B003JVH7XU|5.0|Great movie. Scott adkins is amazing. Unreal skill and fights. Seen it 4 times already. Much better than the first. Little bit better than the second
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Great! I didn't even miss Matt Damon! Well, just a little...hopefully he will be in the next one. Jeremy did a good job, although the leading lady wasn't my favorite- kind of b- list.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|It was an interesting perspective, but not always believable in parts.<br />I do not believe that the end of the world will occur this way.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is and always will be one of my favorite novels. It is filled with so much humanity, love, humor and wisdom, even in today's society, which is so different in so many ways! I highly recommend it for young people everywhere.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|The Extended version is a different point of view of the original theatrical version.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the original movie, the extended film will be your new favorite.
B004IE0NY2|5.0|Great storyline.  Excellent graphics for a future world.  Stallone plays his role with total authority and command of the lead charactor.
B001GCUNYO|3.0|I can't play this movie until my player is updated. this is a shame, I just wanted to watch this movie with my wife on sunday.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|The rating in the game is high because I like star wars. The game it self is awesome! Big thing is its free Yahoo!
B007P6VM04|4.0|We watched the entire first season of Smash on TV and we fell in love with the music.  I bought the soundtrack for my 20 year old daughter and she hasn't stopped playing it since she opened it at Xmas.
1400049628|3.0|A funny gag gift but overall not the greatest read.  Takes a very serious and honest approach to dealing with a zombie apocalypse.  This is not really a story but a true guide.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|NOW YOU CAN HAVE VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE BIBLE WITH YOU AS YOU LEARN. ALL IN THE PALM OF YOUR KINDLE FIRE OR OTHER DEVICE. ALSO THEY OFFER PLANS TOO READ THE BIBLE IN A YEAR.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Very visually striking footage.  I put this on in the background at parties from time to time and it always catches someones attention.
B007BFSYMS|2.0|The app has a wide range of cool sounds. I can tell several are on a loop, which simply drives me nuts. But the one I use, brown noise, works just perfectly. User friendly interface and its free!<br /><br />HOWEVER... it FORCES you to rate it in the most annoying fashion. It asks, then if you click either ask later or no, the request simply blinks back onto the screen until you rate it so the app become s unusable till you follow through. This is incredibly pushy, severely annoying and inconvenient, and just plain rude. Hopefully this review makes it go away forever, but I already wrote one that was rejected and it came back today after a week or so absence.
B00020X88O|5.0|bought this as a gift for someone.  this movie is really bad but absolutely hilarious with the commentary included with this edition.  more comedy than drama IMO
B00AHSINKO|1.0|How do I get my money back? I went back to Amazon, and looked for a category that applied to my problem, which was that there was a technical difficulty prohibiting me from watching the movie. Appears to be a bandwidth problem, which I do not have with NetFlix streaming video. As Amazon tests for this prior to playing the movie, I didn't expect this issue. All of the return policies are worded for merchandise, so this seemed to be the only avenue for a remedy.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love it.  There are a few extra tracks on this album for the same price as the regular album on iTunes
B006O6F932|5.0|Met all of my expectations. My grand daughter loved it. She played with it as soon as she opened it.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|What attracted me to this app was the realistic graphics, unfortunately you as the app's owner do not reslize how much one can spend just to loose. If you do not mind loosing at this game for a cost then you should purchase this app.<br />  Once you understand how the game works it can really be lot's of fun; however, once you get sevral wins at this game it  will adjust the level of difficulity automatically  with out giving the operator a selection of difilulity choices. This tactic is design to hook the player on the magnificent selection of jet fighters to choose from at a cost.<br />  So if you love the fill of a good simulating jet fight without the risks involve in the actual combat situation and at a COST with no chance to win at this game, this is the app for you.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|My husband and I laughed throughout the movie.  I would not show it to my grandchildren.  Not a G or PG material.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this book.  I could not put it down.  I saw the movie then read the book.  Helped me understand a  few details.
1569765677|4.0|I like the product, it expired with my expectations but I did not like that the pursuit of the goods when it was in hands of the carrier because it was deficient and he cannot know until I go over where the product was
B007O4XX9K|5.0|This was a gift and my mom loved it. She was very happy to receive and put it in for all of us to hear.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The only reason I read this was because I can't stand not to finish a trilogy. This series went downhill after Book 1. I won't give away the plot line, but after you read it I think you'll agree it was not well thought out. I would not recommend this or Book 2 either.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|funniest movie of the year, they should turn it into a tv show. cant wait to see what seth does next. hes a crazy guy lol can watch it over and over and its still good. def worth buying if u like rude humor
B007IXWKUK|2.0|After reading Book 1 I could hardly wait to read Book 2. By the time I was half-way through this book I was so over the main characters. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into detail about what was so irritating, but let's just say they rehashed the same issue over and over and over again. Don't waste your time.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Awesome!!!! Loved it, great novelist as well. Well invested money and time saver as well. I enjoyed this book a lot.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It keeps your interest because you're trying to figure out where the story's going. It does get a bit graphic, but it's worth the read--unlike the other 2 in the series which are a waste of time.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this app it has all I need in one place and I don't have to go anywhere else for anything
B0051QIGP4|5.0|When I bought Born This Way a few months ago most of my contemporaries ( over 55 ) thought I'd lost my mind but I don't care; Lady Gaga is one of the most talented young women in Pop music today! Not only can she play the piano well but she sings better than most the current pop divas out there and even knows how to write! To top it all off she's great at choreography and fashion. I knew what I was doing when I ordered Born This Way and that I wasn't losing my mind. If the rest of them want to sit home and listen to Liberace records they are free to do so. I didn't get my open mind and free spirit appreciation for the arts in a class or through a guru. I was born this way.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book! Is recommend it to any one. One if the best thrilling love stories I have ever read!
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|Really enjoy the Iron Man series. Can't wait for the third installment. The video stream works great and have enjoyed watching it several times.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is easy to use and does everything I want and need! Great job! I can't imagine needing anything else.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Couldn't put it down until I finished! Can't wait to read the next book! How is it all going to end??
B001O1O71C|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK.IT WAS ONE OF THE BOOKS I HAD TO READ FOR MY BOOK CLUB AT SCHOOL AND IT WAS SOOOOOOOOO HARD TO PUT DOWN.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I did not like this game, had too many to play at once.  My husband had one on this I Pad whick was much nicer and looked more fun.  I deleted from device
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I loved Matched, it was one of the best book I have ever read so I was super exited to read crossed the 2nd book it the matched series! I was disappointed, although it was still a great book it was not nearly as good as the first one. It was less mysterious and needed a bit more action and less hiking! The ending was a little off too it didn't really inspire me to get the next book.<br />I would recommend reading this hitherto be surprised if you were disappointed.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I this this is awesome, haven't used it yet but it has nice features ans can't wait to use it this week as a alarm clock.<br />Should get
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's amazing! I could not stop reading it. I finished it in 2 days. I can't  wait to start book 2!
B0063IH60K|3.0|My husband downloaded this game, he loves it and plays it alot.  I don't play the game.  But I know he would recommend this to others who like card games
B0065GC0BA|2.0|Seriously people, I don't get the hype.  Why would you blubber at the end of the story?  I think the characterization of Lou was better than the rest.  JoJo spent time on her.  But Will was a bit cardboard, not a lot of depth to him.  A chapter from his point of view might have improved that.  The same goes with Will's mom and Patrick - where is the nuance and the complexity?  And it was a bit preachy - \\"go out there and be the best you can be, Lou\\" says Will, \\"travel, listen to classical music, bungee jump, blah, blah.  Let's make Lou go to college at the end.  Yeah for her.  Let's stick her in Paris at the end.  Ooh, what culture she will acquire.  The ending is that Will's money and direction give her new meaning in life.  Lame.  Overall, it was just an okay piece of literature, not even close to amazing.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|So happy I got this for so cheap right around Christmas! This was a great early Christmas present to myself!
B008B11RLQ|4.0|I do have a few disapointments to say about this great collection. The songs do not play in the order they are on the albums and they skipped over a number of Elvis's earlier albums. Other than that, the mini-albums are great, almost a must for Elvis fans.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a great game. it salotire and its a great game to play at anytime. i am glad i got it.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|This whole series of films based on the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; book is just a magicial experience to watch. I laughed, I cried, I have watched them all 6 or 7 times, and they never disapoint me. This is all great story telling and great film making.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|who does not like FB and its amazing on my kindle. this is a great i am glad i got it.
0547884591|5.0|Just as awesome as Tim's other books!! I love how it's super informative and really fun to read. He never disappoints.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|great i use this all the time. i have an i phone and also have it on that. i use google for everything
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I used nothing else but this manual and, so far, I've uploaded four books onto Amazon. It took me through the process step-by-step.  I'm in no way a computer savvy person. My books were text only, so I can't speak to how well it helps someone with a lot of images in their books. The manual is written for Microsoft 2010, and I have 2007. Nevertheless, instructions were explained well enough that I was able to follow them.<br /><br />I wish there had been a list of categories in the manual, but you can find that on the web in other places.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The Time Keeper was had a story line unlike anyother I have read to date. I enjoyed the way the story unfolded and it was an easy read. It kept my interest overall. I would recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed Mitch Albom's other stories.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Slow going...and difficult to figure out what the point of the story is.  You know, Amazon, you might get a few more reviews if you didn't demand a headline and a minimum of number of words in the review.  The best book review I've ever read was exactly one word: &#34;Expendable&#34;.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Morton's characters are always well thought out.  Her writings flow and don't require going back to refresh the characters in your mind.  A good amount of intrigue can always be counted on.  This story does not disapoint.  It is her general excellent quality work.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I wanted to read this so I could see the movie. I had heard the movie was confusing, so thought it would help to read the book. Not so. I gave up on reading the book, went to see the movie and walked out before it was halfway through.
1433502410|5.0|I was surprised at how nice this study bible is. It is a thich heavy book, but does a good job for any student or everyday christian.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Fun and challenging.  Only drawback is energy runs out too soon and have to wait a while for energy to refill.  Otherwise this game is really lots of fun and addicting!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so simplistic but so addictive and challenging. I love even more the gadgets you use, collect and/or buy along the way.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Great Game. I saw the children play with joy, but it is suitable for six and up, I believe, because it requires some thought.
0307352145|5.0|This book was easy to read, well-researched and illuminating in a number of ways. I have been aware of my my introvert preferences for decades, but now I feel its OK to 'come out' as an introvert.  Recommended reading for (especially extrovert) managers and parents: introverts can shine if respected in the workplace; introversion in children is not a developmental problem that needs fixing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game.  I saw children playign together with this game for a long period.  Therfore, I believe it is an attractive game.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Ted is funny as hell. Fans of Seth McFarlanes other work will recognize the humor. Raunchy comedy with a surprisingly warm hearted ending.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent period piece; I can't wait for each episode! Find that I'm often rooting and booing for the same character!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Her voice is incomparable.  Not quite as popular as 21, but her voice is so true it should not be missed whenever you can catch it.  I'd recommend to absolutely everyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this on both of my Kindles and cell phone. It works great and provides me with<br />something to do while waiting. I have enjoyed it!
B006FE83UE|5.0|Great movie. I have watched this movie on TCM so many times I can't count, but I never get tired of watching. I see something I missed the last time I watched it.This movie is filled with so much history on how the south at that  time viewed the black race. This is a movie that should be shown in history classes. The bonus cd is truly a plus. This movie will never get old. I enjoyed listening to SCOUT as an adult telling what it was like to play her role as a child and and what it was like to walk up and just sit in Mr. Peck's lap whenever she wanted. Just a wonderful family movie.  Buy It. It's worth every dollar I paid.<br /><br />An2net
B009OYTAL8|4.0|My wife purchased these episodes and she really loves this new series. It was not to my taste - but she loves it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Certainly Will Ferrell's best character.  Believe in Santa and let the reindeer fly.<br />A fun family movie. Spoiler alert: He's not an elf.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|The beginnigs of vampirism, at least in written form.  Stoker is a good writer with a style that allows the reader an interesting POV .
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a great game when you have a few minutes to kill.  Something about it get you hooked. You just wanna keep playinjg.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Very good book. Keeps your attention, You want to continue reading,for results. Some what like Lee Child.main charater Harry Hole
B004GYY714|5.0|I have this on all of my devices. Great for people who are diehard radio junkies. Love that I can find my favorite stations anywhere.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|i use it when i go to sleep every night. its the best! i even got my cousin hooked! lol!
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I always loved the girls of Sex and the City and they pull off the charm and comedy in this movie just as good as in the first movie! =)
B008HK3XKO|3.0|The Kindle Fire 7 inch snaps easily and securely into the plastic frame/holder.<br />The case folds into an infinite number of positions to allow exactly the angle needed for reading.<br />For the first couple of weeks it works as advertised, holding its position via friction between the &#34;feet&#34; of the<br />frame/holder, then the pressure of the &#34;feet&#34; creates shallow grooves and smooths the base enough to let<br />the screen slide smoothly down until it`s laying flat.<br />Very irritating.<br />Home cure ... lay a smallish piece of that non- slip, rubbery material under the foot of the screen when in use.<br />The piece of non- slip material can be secured under the elastic strap after the case is closed.<br />My next concern is;  how long is the elastic going to last?<br />Except for the slippage problem I am very pleased with this case ... so far.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|Bought for a home server, spacious and organized installed all components and 6 3.5 in. Hard Drives with space to spare. Internal cable organization is OK.<br />Nice for a simple or specialized machine (Servers), sub par for gaming machines don't even try it.puse<br />For my purpose does the job and fits the organization scheme and look I designed.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was very disappointing for me.  I dont like the style of the writing, it goes back and forth on the time line.  It just wasn't as good as everyone had talked it up to be.  I was very disappointed.  Wish I would have spent my money on a different book.
B00AH69T22|3.0|Good stuff and a few good workout songs so I am happy.  For whom the Bell tolls is still one of my favorite songs.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the app and use it frequently. I am new to getting apps for my kindle . It is easy to use..
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was interested to see what JK could do with an &#34;adult&#34; novel. I was a HUGE Harry Potter fan and thought the books were allvery well written.<br />If you are a fan of maeve binchy novels, you will probably enjoy. Same type of set-up, small town with lots of storys that connect together. This isn't a book you really get hooked on (think potter, hunger games etc) but it was a good story. I wouldn't run and tell someone to buy it, but if you are looking for a simple book with a good story  (say for a 'beach-read'), I would pick it up.
B001MSMULG|5.0|First book of his that I read. Really enjoyed the book. I am going to order more of his books in order that they were written.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I love Doctor Who and got this season at a great price. Hopefully I'll be able to get the rest of the seasons for great deals as well.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Since I read this book I look at life differently. Morrie has made me feel that I could face alot of things I could not before. I reccoment this book to everyone, I have had a loss and could finally face alot of things I could not before because of Morrie's courage it rubbed of on me. Thank you Mitch Albom for writting this book and helping me throught hard times
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|I got this because it was free. I just wish that you could download more songs and they were also free.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is so cool I play it all the time. I<br /><br />love it. You should get it. It's free. Awesome.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I saw some friends playing this app and decided to give it a try. It is very addicting so be warned, but it is also a lot of fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book was exciting and interesting. Could not put it down. The book is very well written and keeps you wanting \\"more\\".
B000OXHRRC|5.0|A Good Year is my go to film.  It's funny and intelligent.  A movie for grown-ups.  Russell Crowe plays a self-centered stock trader who's into making money and screwing as many people as he can along the way.  The sudden death of his uncle,who he's ignored for years (played to perfection by Albert Finney) sends him to France.  He's the only heir to his uncle's country estate and can't wait to sell off the property and get back to London.<br /><br />The property turns out to be a wonderful estate and vineyard with the obligatory cranky French caretaker, a smart and oh, so sexy French girl, and the only to dream about, laid back life in the French countryside in summer.  Our prickly hero, who grew up there, starts to remember his childhood and the life lessons he learned from his uncle.<br /><br />Even as he's counting the money from the sale and plotting his next coup in the stock market, he can't help but imagine something better, something real.  I won't spoil the ending, but if you want a good, beautiful film, this is it.  You'll want to grab your backpack, buy Eurorail tickets and leave your hectic life behind.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|Good follow up to the Something Borrowed. I like that it gave the perspective of Darcy in this book when in Something Borrowed it was really about Rachel and Dex. Interested to see where the other books go.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you can get past the &#34;tasteful sex&#34;..it is a story about the personal development of two people and a love that is classic.. You have to dig but this is a great series
B009VLX8FS|5.0|First time buying a Taylor Swift album and I don't regret it one bit.  Love this album!! Its well worth the money!!!
0316232955|5.0|Chris Colfer is AWESOME and this book is nothing short of FANTASTIC!!! cant wait to see the movie and read everything he will publish in the future!!!!
0316056863|1.0|I have been waiting a long time for my book, and haven&#34;t gotten any tracking info on it. If its a present order months in advance!
B000SEFDP0|5.0|This book has long been one of my favorites.  It is twisted and complicated, abstruse to the point of absurdity, and sexual and wonderful. It has conspiracy aplenty and hidden messages for you to find that add richness to the story once you discover them. A thrilling read from the time you meet Saul Goodman to the last page. Buy this book.
B005LAIISA|5.0|My kids could not take their eyes off the screen. This is a very cute movie and we all loved it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe haven! Great book!! Couldn't put it down very sweet and romantic. And thrilling all n one. Great ending made me cry
B000002GXJ|5.0|Disc and case are in perfect shape and it plays great. The renditions of the classics here are superb, buy this album if you love the Eagles.
B0019IMVDG|4.0|Loved it the first time, loved it the 100th time, and loved it this time! Classic gangster movie revolved around the true Las Vegas mobster run casino time period.
B000050HTO|5.0|Disc and case were all in order and nice. Disc plays perfect. Great set of songs for a casual Dylan fan such as myself.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I think this is a great game. Awsome for making the time go by fast. You should get it! Thanks to whoever made it
B009YU62H2|5.0|Welcome back Soundgarden! You've been away for too long. This CD is amazing, as you'd expect from any Chris Cornell project.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Well, now I realize why everyone is talking about this series, it's like a good book that you can't put down! Definitely one of the best currently on TV.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Oh, the angst of growing up! And oh, the adventures \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" had in his short life! A few critics have slammed him for the chances he took...what would they say about others his age who joined the armed forces looking for adventure?<br />Sean Penn proved in just this one movie that he is to be taken seriously as a director, and Emile Hirsch the same as an actor.<br />See it, and be prepared to applaud, to laugh, and to weep!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was looking for something relaxing after a day of work.  I use to play solitaire, so when I saw this app. I downloaded it.  I have been hooked on it ever since.  It has been very enjoyable, so much so that I notice that other solitaire games are available and  I probably will download them also. I would recommend Mobility Ware if you are looking for card games that are relaxing or something to keep your brain sharp, they have it.
0375869026|5.0|My students loved this book. There  was something about it that they could connect to. We used it as a read aloud in a fourth grade classroom and talked about it. I would not suggest it for students lower than 4th grade.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an excellent book- I was concerned with the age of the characters, but their development was sophisticated and the plot just kept turning.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This was a really stupid movie and my wife and I hated it. We saw the unrated version. Skip it, please.
0547564651|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my son and I'm sure this will help him in raising his 9 year old daughter..
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I liked this movie but it took concentration and filling in the blanks to understand the plot and the characters. It took too long to understand that the main character was not Jason Bourne but another created assasin.  The plot jumped around so much that I had trouble putting it all together.  But for action and intrigue and just sheer spy stuff, it was delightful.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|entertaining. easy to use. As far as the movie I am sure that there are many other reviewers out there that can give a more appealing review than what I am capable of.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Such a gripping book.<br /><br />I was torn on my thoughts about the ending, but am now realizing how perfect it really is for these characters. I cannot wait to see what Gillian Flynn puts out next!
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I don't know how to play chess, but I am reading the rules and will give it a go once I get through them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is nice to be able to read it but at same time have it read it to you! I like it a lot very easy to use and lots to learn! =D
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved every word of it! I could've used some richer language, but I was able to get past it and focus on the story.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Great picture, Great sound, I was amazed that a movie can look as good as does on the big screen.  I also loved having a movie time with my granddaughter and watching a girl be the hero.  She loved this movie and I take it as a hit when she yells &#34;hold it grandma&#34; so she can scramble off the couch and get a drink and not want to miss a minute. Well we own the movie and we have seen it over and over and its great to have Mulan on our movie list.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is a great family or church youth group film for all ages. The message of kindness and living life to the fullest is at its best!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Her songs are infectuous. I listened to it so many times that I thought I should give it a rest, according to everyone around me. But I can't. I am totally addicted!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I had looked forward to this new offering from one of the &#34;big boys&#34; since it's announced release date. Not a bad book by any means, but I guess I just expected more, especially after reading the premise. What I got, however, was a very ordinary, standard &#34;wronged genius gets even with the system&#34; story laid out in somewhat painstakingly tedious fashion with few, if any surprises along the way. I kept feeling like I could sense the payoff from very early on into the story, and although I was hoping for some bombshell surprise twist at the end, there really just was not one--not really. Again, not a waste of time but not the can't-miss read that longtime Grisham fans have grown accustomed to over the years.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The Walking Dead is in the highest echelons of zombie themed cinematography.  On top of superior special effects makeup, amazing set design and unrivaled zombie slaying, the storyline is riveting and never leaves a dull moment.
B0057OOPXM|3.0|I would say that this album would be more enjoyable for someone interested in learning more about this type of music, instead of enjoying a jam. It was neat hearing these guys younger than I am accustomed to, but that novelty wore off. Amazon defines 3 stars as &#34;It's okay&#34; and I completely and whole heartedly agree with that label.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|I learnt a lot of tricks with this book. It is definitely a book I would recommend to everybody who likes non-fiction.
B0091REZMW|4.0|some of the scenes are to tiny and the spot like effect l do really care for,  those changes will make a difference.
B009JCL58G|4.0|I love the two main themes in the Cloud Atlas soundtrack and all of their renditions; however, I find that listening to the whole soundtrack, one track after the other, can feel a bit repetitive. Absolutely worth it anyway as its main themes are fantastic.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've read many Nicholas Sparks books, this one is at the top for me. I could not stop reading and finished the book in less than 24hrs.
0062200909|5.0|I'm very happy with this artbook. Both its looks and its contents are great - love the artwork from WETA, and the comments and insights from the artists and creators are very interesting. Also loved getting to see the evolutions in design for all characters. Hope more of these will come out for the each of the next two movies!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love all of Michael Connelly books, and this did not disappoint! Great book and I couldn't put it down!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It's a good read, but I kept waiting for a climax that never happened.<br />I recommend it, though. Go ahead, it's free!
0670026182|5.0|My wife and I have followed Katie's blog for sometime and are thrilled to have purchased this book.<br /><br />The design, photography and writing of the book has ensured that it will stay visible in the kitchen or on a coffee table.<br /><br />The food photography is superb -- you'll find your mouth watering and your mind dreaming on what you'll cook next.<br /><br />Basically, buy two, and give one to a good friend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless has truly rocked me to my core. I laughed and cried many times and was overwhelmed by the emotions that I felt while reading this story. Thank you for writing such amazing and heartfelt words. I will definitely reread this over and over again.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The speaker on my old LG Ally (which was my alarm clock prior to iPhone) crapped out, so I needed to download an app quickly for my Kindle Fire while I was shopping for a new phone.  This is simple, easy to program, and works identically to the Android alarm.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good narrative along the lines of Reacher storiy lines... well written... tedious towards conclusion... seemed to be a little unrealistic in time frame.... overall enjoyable ...
B00005JM02|5.0|She hated it, prefers Shrek.  While she played and did not pay attention, my wife and I watched the whole thing.  Good movie, very funny.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Mesmerizing and addictive. The story is exciting and will keep you turning the pages! The ending has an unexpected twist. I wholeheartedly recommend!!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|What a great idea.  This is a fun game for the kids but also includes problem solving.  My son played this for quite awhile.  he needed help on a few levels, but it was a great way to have him visualize what was needed to win.
0756404738|5.0|This is classic epic fantasy at its finest. Some people will complain that it is derivative. They are not reading carefully enough. Rothfuss uses classic fantasy elements and perverts them to tell his story through a narrator that is entirely unreliable. He takes the form of Epic Fantasy to its heights.<br /><br />This series works on several levels simultaneously. At its most basic level, it is a typical fantasy done exquisitely well. Beneath the surface lurks a post-modern commentary on story, the truth and the human condition. It is fantasy at it's finest. Heck, its story-telling at its finest.<br /><br />This specific novel was not quite as strong as the its precursor. It tended to ramble a bit in the middle and appeared to lose cohesiveness, but due to the author's track record, I'm willing to withhold judgement on how cohesive it really is until the third and final volume comes out.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|When i saw this game, i had to have it.  I remember spending &#34;tons&#34; of quarters to play this game at the fair.  Great game!  Levels are hard but certainly able to be reached.  Even though I have the game beaten, i still find myself playing!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It's small, so careful not to smash it!<br /><br />I needed to replace the thermal paste in my macbook for a while and this did the trick. Shipping was quick and convenient.
B0086700CM|5.0|i never really got into this game, but my kids, 13,9, &6 all love it!  The take turns trying to get the highest score!
B007QPFGJW|4.0|I have so enjoyed the Harry Hole books.  Harry is flawed but he is loyal, responsible, smart, and has a moral code.  Yes, Harry has done some questionable things, but he has a conscience and the punishment he metes out for himself is severe. He fascinates me because he is like a real person, warts and all.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I Rated it 2 stars because it was to to slow no real plot.  It went from being construction workers jumping to strippers.  And the girl that played the sister WOW AWFUL ACTRESS, she had no personality.  The only parts that were good was seeing Channing & Matthew naked that was GREAT!!!! then the ending was really off left u wanting to know what happens when and if they get the club Miami.
0439023491|5.0|If you read The Hunger Games, you are going to want to read this book! My favorite of the three, the ending will make you reach for #3...
B0063IH60K|4.0|At first it was confusing to me having to also get used to the Kindle, but I found it easy and entertaining.
159413586X|4.0|I like it when a book surprises me, and this one did! If you read the first two, the third is a must!
B007HJ96NO|5.0|My husband has been talking about this movie forever, finally wstched and I know why. Its moving, sweet, funny and serious...
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I rented this movie for my daughter when we were going on a trip.  She saw the movie already but liked it so much she wanted to see it again.  We have all the Ice Age movies.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't get enough of this series! I was constantly driving my husband crazy with the stories I'd tell him... The inner monologue of Ana sometimes drove me crazy, but it's all part of her character so it was totally worth it!
B008PWUTJC|5.0|no complaints at all. My son has been using for about a month now, and showing no signs of wear. It should last a while.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't get enough of this series! I was constantly driving my husband crazy with the stories I'd tell him... The inner monologue of Ana sometimes drove me crazy, but it's all part of her character so it was totally worth it!
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Simple but does the job just fine. Nothing fancy but it is what I needed in my car and from a trusted brand.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't get enough of this series! I was constantly driving my husband crazy with the stories I'd tell him... The inner monologue of Ana sometimes drove me crazy, but it's all part of her character so it was totally worth it! I would love for there to be more!
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My son had requested this case as well.  He already had a ton of Star Wars related merchandise...most of it being the larger versions, though.  So, we got this Zip Bin for him & it functions as the carrying case & battle ground(just like it's Ninjago counterpart).  So far, this has served him well!
0156027321|2.0|This book started out interesting and I thought I would love the story but I became very disinterested as the story progressed and finally put it aside for a more interesting adventure.  I love animals but this book just didn't do it for me.
B0071FBARY|5.0|Once again, I bought this for my 15 yr old daughter.  She LOVES this band & EVERY single song on the cd.  I have to admit...I'm quite fond of them myself :)
B009MO57H6|3.0|Your typical resident evil movie:<br />(1) Chessy lines and bad story<br />(2) Movie forced itself to include cameos from the RE game (Leon Kennedy, Barry Burton (including his magnum), Ada Wong (a scene that is very similar to RE 4) and mind controlled Jill from RE 5)<br />(3) Bringing back dead characters from previous movies DOES NOT make any sense.<br />(4) The giant licker does not make any sense at all<br />(5) Movie (once again) ends with the camera zooming out to see what's coming in the next movie.<br />(6) Wesker is willing to team with Alice to fignt against the Red Queen?!? What the hell is that about?<br />(7) Finally, the movie is a disappointment
B009E2U7L2|5.0|I personally don't listem to much of the current music, but my 15 yr old daughter requested this cd for Christmas so I got it for her.  She loves every song!
B007FJFDXS|3.0|I installed this two times after an intial uninstall from boredom, thinking maybe I missed something. For my Galaxy SII and Note 10.1, it's just too frustrating to play for more than just a few minutes, not worth the valuable space on my devices. Very good graphics though, it's a pretty interface.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My boy is obsessed with Star Wars, Ninjago & Harry Potter!  I downloaded this game to my phone for 2 reasons:  1) Because it was a Star Wars version of a game that even my older sister was addicted to!  And, 2) It was free!  Turns out, that combo was perfect & my son still runs my battery down every day, playing this game :)
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I'm glad I got this on Amazon faotd, cute little game with very creative premise. Can change figure drawing in mid-game but got bored quickly. Changed mind about leaving installed due to space- maybe should have given three stars, but I'm likely to reinstall and try and like this again. Too small graphics on my Samsung Galaxy SII phone but very good play on the Note 10.1.
B005HSL626|5.0|I downloaded a few free games on my phone for him a while back, while he was sick....to help keep him occupied while he was feeling so bad & didn't much feel like doing anything that required any physical exertion.  So, Fruit Ninja was one of the games I just downloaded on a whim.  I'd heard the name but didn't know much about it(although I could take a few guesses...giving the name & all!).  At any rate, he loved it then & still loves it today.  it's one of his favorite games!
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like the graphics, game play, and music are all aces for this game, when my phone tells me I'm out of room, this is the last app I decided to remove to make space. Loving Amazon's policy of downloading later if I get room again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Complete masterpiece! I can't wait to read the next one! Fifty shades of utter lust, passion, hot sex and pure adult entertainment!
B001N44BVQ|5.0|This guy seems to get better and better as his acting career goes forward. I expect to see his name along side other great artists like Robert DeNiro.  I believe his best work is yet to be accomplished.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm so glad a co worker turned me on to this show! The best thing that I have ever watched!
B0053O89JM|5.0|This last season of House was something that you would expect it to be, great. This season was just simply great.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the best multi platform functionality. Period. Across devices. Across platforms. Its the best.<br />I just got it for my kindle linking my phone &amp; tablet. My mac is next.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The language is just terrible.  And the characters are unbelievable or shallow.<br /><br />Two stars because I still seem to be reading it...
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy to read, respond to, delete, and hold e-mail from your yahoo mail account.  This app is one you should have if you have a yahoo mail account and you have a KindleFire.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|This book actually turned out to be kinda boring for me. Nothing huge happened and some parts didn't completely make sense.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider solitaire and I was excited to see this app. Good clear graphics and challenging play. Best of all it is free.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I am going to follow the rest of you guys and not download this program until they fix and update thanks everyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Not only have I enjoyed the PC version of this game for awhile, the Pocket Edition provides is simply great. Though this version lacks some features, such as tools for redstone contraptions, much promise has been shown for future updates.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love this book. I feel the need to spoil my dogs even more now. This story makes my heart smile.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|dlove this swoop much fun challenging and interest r uring to keep busy during waiting room times or anytime for adults or children
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I like fishing and like the barometer link is very handy. I have not been in bad weather to know how well the &#34;alerts&#34; work.
0920668364|5.0|This book is so great, my kids loved it and now we are reading it to our grandson. A classic.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|This is a great headset, but I might recommend something in the 5GHz band if you're in a city or apartment complex where you're fighting with a lot of wireless activity.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book and my name is Payton  d Dr :) funk dgdfdgdgdr err rd rd st f2f err  e scdcrdf
0743270754|5.0|Saw the movie, Bought the book.  Now I want to see the movie again.  Love the book, I would recommend it.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Like the other Men In Black movies, a great combination of science fiction and humor. The actor who played a young Tommy Lee Jones looked like him but also sounded like him... I was wondering if Tommy Lee did a voice over? Loved the movie.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|A timeless classic,<br />I watch this movie every few years and each time I enjoy it more and more.<br />&#34;and about those TPS reports, yeeaah&#34;
B000W44IZW|5.0|Based on real life divers and deep breath hold diving records. Fascinating information and story. These guys set records down to 400 feet deep.
0545265355|5.0|A nice set of books that is well-worth the reasonable price.  This made an excellent gift for a fan of the Hunger Games series!
B002SJ8FH6|5.0|I don't know what I was expecting when I watched this movie, but I knew not to look for amazing acting, and while watching very old films i'm sure no one is, but I was impressed with both of the lead actors. Madeleine Carroll is beautiful and protrays the rich and spoiled well. Robert Donat is also handsome and he acts very well. I often rooted for him.<br />I love 30's films, I'm the biggest Shirley Temple fan there is, so I love all of it. A lot of good actors came from these legends.<br />I recommend for any Alfred Hitchcock fan, as I am, it was fun to watch where he started!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Easy to use and I find it better than the Explorer version.  The app could use more features but I believe this is more driven by the youth of the Pinterest community itself.  The app is addictive and fun to use!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Don't have Blu-ray so I wasn't looking to shell out a lot. But the price for the 3 DVDs and the included book couldn't be beat!
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is a cool application and it allows you to listen to the radio and work on your computer at the same time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really good but a little slow and such a good ending there should be another book about the new panem
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The grandkids loved it, we also got them a blue ray player, so they loved the better picture also.. Helped them have a great Christmas.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The perks of being a wallflower we an amazing story.  The way Charlie wrote his life into the story really fascinated me.  I recommend this book for everyone. It truly touches your heart.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great app, takes a little getting used to, but I like the challenge. I love hidden object games so keep bringing more like this one.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|New to Mahjong but will continue with the various versions ~ really keeps your attention ~ helps keep brain active
B003YNFYCO|5.0|My husband wanted this for Christmas along with the 1967-1970 (The Blue Album) cd. It was just what he asked for. Shipped by Amazon quickly.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I don't like dictionarys and there boring!!!!!!!! Don't read only if u are forced to please 945070 pages!!!!!!! $#/?@-\\";)/#&-! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
B0084B5TK8|5.0|The story is classic, and the audio is a wonderful addition to the kindle version of this book. Highly recommended.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella' s work. Her wit throughout this piece is much appreciated; she's managed to pull off a character who is, at once, both intelligent and ridiculously incapable of mundane tasks like cooking and cleaning. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie brought her A game again! She really is a national treasure, hope she stays in the business till she's old.
B00992CF6W|5.0|As advertised. Very addictive. The simple graphics don't detract from the open ended and fun game play. There's not a lot of support on how to play in the game. You need to research online.
B001QWBM62|5.0|The Zoom H4n has an intuitive feel to its menu system. Whether recording abient room sound with its built-in stereo mics or upping the ante with my Rode NT3 attached, the sound quality is fantastic. The case is plastic and the unit is very light. I don't know if this is good or bad, but it does what's advertised and hasn't let me down.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This device is the most practical way to ensure your phone never runs out of juice.  Even if your kids use it and don't recharge it, you will still have plenty of power left to charge your phone multiple times.  In my house this unit is used very often by everyone.  It allows us to be charging the phone even while on the move.  It's more convenient to charge the phone through this than a wall adapter during the day.  At night we charge the phone and this device and we are set to go for a couple more days if we have to...  I an yet to run out of charge since getting this.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|adds a bit of weight, though it is the lightest full function cover. seven more words required to submit it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never cried so much while reading. Just when I thought I was all teared out the last chapter comes up and I'm balling haha such a great book I laughed and of course cried but it was all worth it. Excellent book.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Get ready to read the same phrases and words over and over. The book is anyways addictive, but I have to say that I have slow down in the middle of the book. Got a little bored with the same outfits from Grey, the same attitud fom Ana (which by the way seems to be q copy of Bella from Twilight). Anyway, you can read it to fulfill your curiosity, but it would be best if you could borrow it istead of paying for it.
B00AHHODH2|3.0|***I received a free copy in exchange for a book review.***<br /><br />Since other reviewers have described this book plot quite well, I won't go into any more details on that or add any spoilers. I will say that I would classify this novel as a cozy mystery. My overall experience of the story is that for a first novel, this author has done a decent job. The scenes and characters are well described, although in the first half of the book the character details severely slowed the pace. After about the middle, when the young wife, Kelly, goes to Paris, things start to pick up. Then, as more and more characters begin plotting against each other, the book becomes very entertaining and hard to put down. The twists and turns are also excellent and will keep you guessing. I see a lot of potential in this writer and expect many engaging books to come out of this series launch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The twist and turns. The holly s*** moments. The painful heart breaking moments and the I never saw coming moments are what made this book my favorite. Just like Sky reviving her first ereader this is also my first. I love this book. But I also have to thank my sweet heart Robbie Sierra thanks baby because of you I was able to read this wonderful written book by a amazing writer  at a amazing price.
0439023513|4.0|i thought it was a great book. Alot of people complain about the ending though. i thought it was a decent ending. the whole book just kept making me want to keep reading, but i didnt think it was as good as the first two.
B005RDF2RG|2.0|I felt like this was incredibly way too violent and curse words, really?! It just wasn't necessary. Too much had to be assumed that beauty is on the inside and so obviously stating that outward appearance is what makes someone ugly or beautiful. The violence was shocking. Shrek is violent as his approach to get people away and so is Princess Fiona....the donkey was the only redeeming character in this movie
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Mack and RL and beyond amazing and true artist. Today, a lot of the music is garbage but they have found a way to mix in today's beats with motivating and inspirational lyrics. This is the only albulm I have ever paid full price for and it was worth every penny.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|The trouble with most books written in the late 1900's is that the author seems to anticipate that the book will be made into a movie and therefore he/she will write the script. I find this to be the case with Neil Gaiman's \\"American Gods.\\" Frankly, I can't wait for the movie: I can't wait to see the surrealistic scenes described in the book come to action on the screen; I can't wait to hear the existential thoughts spew forth from the mouths of the characters; I can't wait to see the scenery that shapes the actions of the characters. Kind of like waiting for Godot, it just might not happen! It's a long book (over 500 pages), and it is slow reading, that is, I wasn't riveted and had to finish it in one or two nights, but that doesn't mean another reader can't breeze through it. There's a lot of philosophy, mythology, symbolism, magical realism, etc., to consider, so the book is thought-provoking. Read it on your next long road trip.
075669812X|5.0|I bought this for my six year old .. Him and I enjoyed looking thru the book reading the captions and looking at the pictures.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Excellent app, the tap to move feature is a real plus. Very good graphics. I play this game quite a bit.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing book. Not many can make me laugh and cry like this series did. I can't wait for the movies
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|bought it on my samsung 2 and couldn't download it what a waste  looked like a good game. Went to try to download again and it wanted me to purchase it again rip off
0761169431|4.0|We have not tried any thing yet, so hard to review. Overall, book looks great, great ideas, and for someone really into Star Wars it would be an ideal book.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A bit long but a great way to learn about a long gone era and a horrible event in our country's history.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I like it! It certainly brightens my darkest hours and warms my heart.  It just makes your flash turn on continuously on your camera phone, or you can switch the light source to use your touch screen as a white background. Pretty simple. I don't know why that's not a standard operating system function of all camera phones... should have been a &#34;No brainer&#34; for phone designers!  LOL
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow great book. Must read book. It haven love compassion a what it truly means to be loved by the one u love.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just awesome...couldn't put it down! I loved the connection of teenage love... the situation was so upsetting but so worth reading!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love love love ! Read the 3 books in 2 weeks ! I wish it wasn't just 3 books though . Good books
B004SBS8LA|5.0|When this came out it was free for me, how could I hate it, its angry birds need I say more?<br /> while most Iphone users at the time were paying for it I didnt have to (android user)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was excellent. I couldn't put it down. There was just so much depth to Charlie and who he was and where he was going.
B002APU580|5.0|I really enjoyed this version of Pride & Prejudice.  Even though it's a condensed version from the A & E's rendition, the characters in this movie gave it a flavor all their own.  The only disappointment was in the character of Mr. Wickham.  He wasn't portrayed as the rogue he really was.
B000W9399S|1.0|This was a horrible book. The author obviously had no outline for the plot, and spent more time creating a fantasy world then a story that happened in it. What a total waste of my time.
B002NWOOXW|5.0|This was a great film! Very amusing performance by Zellweger, interesting locales, some surprises. I've seen it twice, and enjoyed it both times, and I rarely watch movies.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Beautifully shot, acted and directed.  The production was stellar and the intimate cinematography made me feel as though I was on Alex Supertramp's journey with him; only as perhaps a cultural anthropologist.  The sincerest connections between Alex and the many other characters he encounters were deeply heartfelt and even hard to watch sometimes.  See this film.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This thing works amazing.  Was never able to take picture while swimming with the kids at Great Wolf Park.  With this case, I was hitting the slides, floating on the lazy river and even jumped into the hot tub with it.  Kept my I-phone dry and I was able to snap some amazing action picture and video...
B00005JM02|5.0|Was happy to find this movie in stock. watched it as a family and my kids were so excited. great condition.
0307711773|5.0|My 10 & 13 year old both love Rick Riordan. They are not done with this audio book yet, but are enjoying the story so far.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A co-worker (who really didn't know me very well) recommended this book after a conversation in which I was being particularly negative about myself.  I've read a plethora of self-help books, so I thought, \\"Why not?\\"  I am so happy that co-worker spoke up. I am eternally grateful to her. From the outset, I read things in this book that spoke volumes to me. Born with a disability, I made agreements with myself as a child 40 years ago based on what my parents, older sisters, their friends, neighborhood kids and my \\"friends\\" said to and about me, and I lived with those agreements until I read this book. No longer will I allow other people determine how I feel about myself -- I'm making new agreements!
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was amazing! I want to keep going on with the series! Couldn't stop reading it, it was so amazing to read!  : )
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play. Lots of fun. Good time filler when you need to keep your mind engaged. I like the graphics and options this game offers.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I first saw the interview with Shin, on 60 Minutes. We in America, are sometimes overwhelmed with videos and reports of violence, on the major news networks. Not only in America, but events taking place in the Middle East and Africa. A few minutes, and then we change the channel. It is hard to believe , that this type of political incarceration takes place in the 21st century. Not only the physical abuse, but the mental brainwashing and emotional results. There is so little news , that comes out of North Korea. Shin's story was gripping and heartbreaking. Where are all the so-called do gooders in America and the western world? Look at all the politicians and Hollywood types, that get support for causes. I won't go into details of Shin's story, but everyone should read this book, to really appreciate how good we've got it here in the U.S.A.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an AMAZING book. It is the best book I have ever read and always will be. It's wonderful.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i was hesitant to read the Hunger Game series since every kid in the neighborhood had read them and wasn't sure if they would hold me captive-but i was wrong.  I really loved these books.  As soon as i finished the Hunger Games-i immediately downloaded Catching Fire to my Kindle.  I am now reading Mocking Jay, which is also a page-turner.  I will be sorry when i'm finished.  Hope I can find something else that can compare to this series.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|4 out of 5 stars.  Great series, but sometimes I think they can move a little faster.  Love the casting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the third book, it sums up the series and has a perfectly ending to a good plot. Great series!
B0089OBLDO|3.0|I was hoping I could use a PS3 Hori fighting stick on an Xbox 360.  That didn't work.  Using a PS3 controller on an Xbox or vice versa seems to work just fine.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Horribly written, but it still manages to suck you in. The writting is extremely repetitive, and some of the scenes make your skin crawl.
B008HK3TXK|4.0|I dock the product a little because I think the Velcro isn't as great as the magnetic snaps these days.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great ending to the trilogy, Lisbeth Salandar is one of the most interesting characters Ive come across. By the third book,I was already used to the Swedish to English translation.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't understand why this is so popular... there are a bunch of thesaurus words thrown in to make this seem like literature but really, I've read way better soft porn before.  I craved the parts that went back to the plot.  Trilogies are annoying when they just &#34;end&#34; with no ending, just a chapter break.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The ending was quite a cliffhanger, so I am thankful to buy the second book this series right away. The book is a grown up version of Twilight, with all the love and commitment, plus a new take on the fantasy of vampires and witches.
B008B68IUY|5.0|It's very cute and different. Better quality than the Barbie cars and has more details to it. Can fit 4 dolls which is nice. My little girl was so pleased to add this to her monster high collection!!
B003B02O14|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the book which involved a simple plot that became quite complex as the story unfolds. Great page turner in true John Grisham fashion. I was not bored for even a minute. Can't wait for the next one.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great value.  Not sure what else to say.  The packaging is also stunning detailed.  Highly suggest if you don't own any part of this trilogy yet.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I really enjoyed the humor and yet down to earth development of characters and plot. The story leads through plot and subplot magnificently, and is a very satisfying book.
B000NDIAWY|3.0|Unfortunately, the song I wanted wasn't reproduced on this album like I had been hearing it on the radio.  Too bad.
1449415881|5.0|I've had the Dilbert Calendar on my desk for years and can't imagine not having it.  Yes, like others, I wish it had separate calendars for Saturday and Sunday, but only because I want 52 more comics to read.
B00076RT24|5.0|This was the one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. To bad it is shown on TV after 10: oo Pm.  When it airs on regular TV.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game I liked the variety. u should buy it cuz its that amazingly awesome. yayyy for cool games. yeaa
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Easy games, and if you don't get one, you can just replay another for more points to unlock more. Defiantly a good free app, and if I had kids to play, they would love it! (I actually feel guilty playing it as an adult, but as I said, it passes time!)
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Impeccably acted and scripted, this is a tale of those who would rather live genuinely than safely. It avoids the pitfall of the predictable just enough to keep you wondering and waiting for what happens next. The characters, while not idealized, are surprisingly likeable in their unique ways. The plot is fast-moving and engaging from start to finish. This is the first I've seen actor Tom Hardy in an American movie. I became a fan of his work in British film, and was impressed in this case, by his ability to do perfect-pitch backwoods southern speak. Warning: not for those who have a low tolerance for violence.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Boston is a great city and a great backdrop for these movies. But, I think I'm biased having grown up here.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love the game and I finished the game I can not buy boofenshmuch evil incorporated<br />Because it has a sort so fix it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You already know about this show, there's nothing I can say. You might think that it's got the ending sort of baked into the premise - how long could you spin a yarn about a small band of survivors? But they've done a great job finding a way out of that apparent dead-end, without getting completely loopy (à la Lost).
B0094K1K42|1.0|The most depressing movie ever.  Depressing and disturbing throughout the whole movie and ended even more depressing. Don't wait for a happy ending in this movie.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Really drew me in. As a scientist, I often have a hard time with science-based movies, they cut so many corners, leave so many loopholes. But as science-fiction, you just accept that &#34;OK, time travel HAS been invented in the future&#34;, and then you're free to get sucked into the story of what that might be like. It's a great yarn, and unlike many (most?) sci-fi movies, it leaves untouched the whole question of &#34;How?&#34; (we never learn how it works) focusing on &#34;Why?&#34; (why do people make the choices they do? what choices would we make in their situation?). The characters are quite credible and normal. The really kicker for me was how we begin to see things from multiple angles at once (much like the main character): we witness awful things being done, yet we simultaneously sympathise with the victims AND with the perpetrators. Quite the feat of writing/directing!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love using my Pinterest.  I use it for recipes, fashion ideas, home ideas, organizational ideas, etc...  I use it a Lot!
1419701533|5.0|I bought these books because my 9 year old loves the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies.  He started reading some of the books, but they weren't in order.  So i decided to get him all of them so he wasn't all over the place. He was ectastic when he recieved the books. I guess reading is fundamental.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|First off, this is a young adult dystopian future book. It wasn't written as a deeper look at society, or to find the layers upon layers of meaning throughout the novel. Don't go into the book thinking that it is. Approach these books as a teenager looking for some entertainment, and you won't be disappointed. I know a lot of people - namely, adults - have very different opinions on this book - on this entire series, actually. I've read several reviews on this series that have torn it apart - citing many different reasons. Some say the characters are all the same and there is little to no character development. I completely disagree. In the first book - The Maze Runner - all of these characters are thrown into the same situation with no memory of life before it. These boys are all gonna seem a little bit the same. It's the nature of the beast - they're in survival mode. But even though they're all in the same situation, I feel that there were many differences in their personalities & I felt closer to some than others. I liked some characters, but certain characters I hated, yet I still understood the characters' motivations. Any book that can illicit that sort of emotional response - hating or loving characters - is a good book IMHO. And it's really interesting to see how these characters have evolved from the beginning of book one, to the end of book two - the ones who made it, anyway. The story was also an interesting one. I'm pretty sure I've never read a book like this one. And I'm also pretty sure that no other \\"monsters\\" in any other book gave me nightmares - yet, I had a couple scary nightmares about Cranks - especially after reading the tunnel part. Speaking of Cranks, I've read many reviews that have called Cranks \\"zombies\\", and have said that these books are zombie books. Again, I disagree. If I remember correctly, zombies die & come back to life as the \\"undead\\" & try to create other zombies by biting them or eating them. The biggest difference is that Cranks aren't dead. They can also be hurt & killed - even if they're not injured in the head. Another big difference is that they can talk - which, IMHO, makes them that much scarier. Dashner has really come up with an interesting \\"monster\\" - a very scary, panic-inducing monster.  I was definitely terrified of their unpredictable behavior. But there's also the antagonist - WICKED. So, really, there are two kinds of \\"monsters\\" or villains, and you aren't quite sure who is worse!<br />Anyway, I hope I haven't spoiled anybody's reading experience  in fact, I hope to enhance it. I read the book in spite of the reviews, and because I didn't agree with them, I had to write a review for myself. I've finished the series, and I have to say, I was entertained by it. (Maybe I'm just easy to please???) I hope you enjoy these books, too!!<br />Oh! One quick note: these books are GREAT if you have a young teenager - especially a boy - who is a reluctant reader.
030758836X|2.0|I know this is &#34;one of the best books&#34; to most folks, and I know that I am a hard mystery reader to please. I lost interest at about the half way point in the story. I could not get into any of the characters. To me the author randomly picked a bunch of character types and never really developed them. Of course he was having an affair, but the rich princess becoming a housewife baking and ironing? Toss in a mall scene ala George Romero and you lose me.
B000VEA38E|5.0|The greatest box of all soundtracks by John Williams of the best movie ever made !!! Superb !!! I love it !!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've enjoyed this on my iPhone for awhile now and was pleased to add it to my new Kindle Fire HD.  It's a great way to entertain yourself for any length of time and the ads aren't too intrusive.
B004UFEJS0|1.0|I am rating this disc low as I watched it two nights ago and it pauses and skips to the next chapter 3 times.  Not sure how much of the movie is lost but needless to say I was a bit disappointed.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If you like Family Guy, you will love this. Not a lot of movies make me laugh out loud these days, but these want definitely did.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|Nothing wrong with the disc, played perfectly. Worked great and also enjoyed the movie, thank you very much, have a good day
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|This is not my kind of movie, it was bought as a present. It is a good Christmas movie for children though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book! Great character development and it kept me gasping. Even if I could tell what was coming next I would still be eager to see it unfold. A disturbing story that will make you start looking at people twice.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I saw this in theaters when it came out and recently bought it as a present for my dad. Sherlock Holmes is an awesome character.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|As the cover says, this is a highlights album.  Many songs are missing. Many of the included are edited.  Wait for the full recording or, better yet, buy one of the London cast recordings.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|One of the best books I have read.  You learn more about the  history of the US over the last century that you never knew.<br /><br />Morey Breyman
0071762345|5.0|A breath of fresh air, generally.<br /><br />'Likeable Social Media' peels back the skin philosophically and practically. The author provides business philosophy of being genuine and forthright, in other words, honesty, believability and trustworthiness. These values are essentials to good business.<br /><br />The book provides pragmatic advice on establishing DND (Do Not Delete) and other policy/positioning guides.<br /><br />A well written, relatively easy read that inspires pros and introduces foundational guidance for beginners.<br /><br />The bottom line is being likeable is attractive; attractiveness develops enthusiasm; enthusiasm sells in social media and elsewhere.<br /><br />I am the Management, Marketing, Media Consultant @3msage.
B005V2S7FW|4.0|Good product but I need to learn how to make it easy to work. Just have to take more time to understand all the features.  A better video would help.<br />Morey B
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is awesome! As a history buff, I loved the detail and recount of events. More specifically, the extent to which King goes in order to tell an entertaining, believable, alternate history. There is some sci-fi element, but anyone who enjoyed back to the future will like this book. Highly recommended.
B00942S4OY|5.0|The CD was in perfect condition, arrived on time and has been enjoyed regularly by my 14y/o daughter. Thanks a lot
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love it!  This is an app I use daily!  It is so easy to use and also works with your media player
0062213423|5.0|My daughter has loved reading about her favorite band! The book was in excellent condition and is a good read
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Stayed up way past my bedtime because I Couldn't put the book down. Absolutely loved it!  Would highly recommend it.
B00117AXUS|5.0|as all the other beirut ones!<br />I bought it since I love 'The Flying Club Cup'. If you liked it, you shouldn't be disappointed by this one, great mood and music.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I rarely gravitate to an unknown author or this topic but I was genuinely surprised and am totally hooked!  This is a great story and is well written.  I am now anxiously awaiting the rest of the silo series.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I got a good deal on this movie. Where I live things take time to get here but I got my order promptly! Good stuff.
0345803493|5.0|It was the best out of all 3.  Why do you require a certain amount of words? Makes you not want to review
B007HACDLK|5.0|My only complaint about these books is they only come out once a year. Can not wait till the movies start
B000B589JI|3.0|This needs a better washer to work effectively, its an easy fix but what is not an easy fix is the seller. I contacted them and they simply ignore me. So shame on Zippo for shipping a product with bad QC, but that can be fixed. Shame on Stealth Rabbit for not following through with any amount of customer service, that is not something that a .15 cent washer cant fix.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Enjoyed every word. Look forward to the next book in this series. Enjoyed the different perspectives and was glad that it wasn't predictable.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|First, let me preface this review with the information that I have read every book Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston have written together and separately.  They write well, on a consistent basis and always have a compelling story to tell.  This book was a disappointment.  The opening cross country chase was ridiculous.  Sorry, folks.  Someone with Pendergast's wealth doesn't drive cross country.  He rents a plane and jets and meets the bad guy when he gets there.  I almost put down an ultimately good book because the first part was so unbelievable.....and went on forever.  I have the terrible feeling that Child and  Prestan have gotten too successful. The editors are afraid to do their jobs.  They aren't editing.  What a disappointment.<br />I gave this book two stars because even at their worst, these two are better than average.  What imaginations.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Enjoyable film, especially for younger women. Fun music selection and a good mix of jokes. Rebel Wilson is the breakout star of this movie.
B0091XT22O|4.0|no matter how many times I watch it.  The HD version is great and makes Jack Nicholson creepier, if that is even possible.
B008XBASVY|5.0|Such an amazing book! I really couldn't put it down!  So witty and hilarious. It really takes you through his entire experience!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I suggest reading a review or summary of this movie, as what happens in the movie is not always apparent...
B0000C1733|4.0|I so enjoy Red Hot Chili Peppers! The first half of this CD is great and all songs we've heard on the radio! The 2nd part of the CD gets annoying...I'm not sure why but I tend to take it out before it's through playing.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|it is one of those movies that critics love and rave about, but most people would find weird and just OK.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It doesn't disappoint you but its more of the same..I saw it by streaming on AmazonPrime. That was great and convenient!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This was a great video for my 4 year old and adults will enjoy too. We watched it over and over again. Very cute.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked up Wool in early December 2012 and devoured the books in quick succession. Easily my favorite books of the year.<br /><br />The series does a great job building a fascinating yet mysterious world. It takes the post apocalyptic setting of the Fallout video games and mixes it with background mythos similar to LOST the TV show. If you are a fan of either I cannot recommend this book series enough.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was recommended by an English teacher and definitely didn't disappoint. It was well written and engrossing. I would recommend it to anyone who loves dogs!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a well done game with good graphics and story. HO games zoom well; story is entertaining and there are several locations and puzzles. G5 should stick to this model.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I love this book,I love this whole series!they are all a must read! Can't wait to start Iced! :)<br />Can't make myself put it down
B00APUQKDG|1.0|I could only take this movie for about 30 minutes, and then I turned it off. Never did understand what the movie was about and it was going no where.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thru this whole book I cried. It made me think. It made me feel.  Great author. I look forward to more of her work.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|this was a gift and was sent right to him. I was told he just loved it. I went and bought one myself
B005HSL626|5.0|What's not to like.  This is a fun and easy game.  I especially like that you have a choice of playing &#34;modes&#34;.  I enjoy the arcade mode especially.
B003KJF2WE|3.0|I watched the Hulk after I watched The Avengers but it would have helped fill in some gaps for me to watch this one first.  The special effects are definitely improved in The Avengers but they're decent here.  The story is entertaining but not very compelling.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great.  Originally I did a &#34;test drive&#34; and couldn't believe the ease of playing this game.  Definitely a keeper.
B009329Y30|5.0|The performance of Taylor Schilling was iffy, but I absolutely fell in love with Zack Efron....<br />*Overall, loved this movie*
B00498YXG6|4.0|This was fun, but there was more friction in the first movie which is a must for a good story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is by far one of my all time favorites. I laughed, cried, held my breathe, got mad and even felt relieved. I have never felt so connected to a book before. MUST READ
1451695195|5.0|I purchased this book for my 86 year old mother for Christmas.  She read an exerpt of it and was very interested.  So I placed an order for the book.  She would definitely give it a 5 star rating!  She said there is so much more to the book than she read in the exerpt.  She will not tell me very much about the book as she wants me to read it when she finishes it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I LOVE THIS show, I am hooked, I am really sad that they took Lori off though, and I can't wait for more!
B000A6T1JU|2.0|I did not like the director's cut.  There are scenes that are left out that to me made the movie was it was.  I would have preferred the original cut!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have blasted through several levels, it is a fun game!  I can't stop playing<br />The colors are eye catching.
B008745B32|5.0|I mourn the end of this book, having found in it a new companion. But books do not leave us, I may relive this life anytime I choose, simply by opening it. Waugh is maddening and delightful and quite often mistaken for pompous, but I adore him. Adore. He manages to write first person well, as so few do. For this alone, I love him. I must open another of his works immediately. Vile Bodies next, I think.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a calculator to do basic calculations with a memory, this is the best. They used the philosophy of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) on this one. Refreshing! Nice app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a great app I play it everyday but takes a while to download but it is worth it
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is the 2nd game I downloaded for my Kindle Fire - I enjoyed it very much, plays well, graphics are great - occasional problem in attempting to click on a tile but I don't have a stylus
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game. Awesome free Rome, and it really makes you feel like spidey. The crimes and other problems continue after you complete the game and NEVER STOP!!!!! It is so awesome. As far as I am concerned this game is flawless, except that I can't figure out how to replay the missions.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books.  This book kept me reading wanting more.  I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good love story.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought it started out a little slow at first but then as you might expect the book picks up quickly at the end.  It definitely leaves you hanging for the next book.  I think anyone who has seen<br />the movie or read the first book will enjoy this one as well
B000RJO578|5.0|Thank you for sending this in a timely maner.  Sometimes we can't find titles we want in our area, so it is great that we have a reliable source to order movies online.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Excellent acting.  A story of hope and redemption.  People helping each other to understand what life is all about. A must see.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|i like this movie it was great . i would tell my friends about this movie . almost as good as the first one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play it so much that it is the first thing I think of is it and it is in my dreams
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love this movie, it's really cute.  It is great for the whole family, including our four year old daughter.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Save your hard earned money.  Marc is always nice to see, that's all.  I can't understand why actors feel its necessary to do these kinds of things, don't they watch the rushes?  Make the decision then, UCK!
B003Y6GJD4|5.0|An intelligent thriller--well acted,written and directed. I've seen this movie perhaps five times and it's always interesting, provocative , thought provoking and just swell!
B005NF2UE6|5.0|totally awesome album and even better hearing the songs live!!  Rock on Nickelback!  Will definitely go see them every time they are in our area.
B008XBASVY|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book by Chris Colfer.  I hadn't heard anything about it and just happened upon it from a picture that Kevin McHale had posted when he got it to read before Christmas.  So I was hoping for more publicity for it.  I love the way Mr. Colfer writes.  He makes you feel like you are already apart of the story from the beginning.  It doesn't take you long to get to know the characters at all.  The only thing I had a hard time with was the language of the students (probably a generation thing).  This book was engaging and a quick fun read.  I would recommend it highly!
0345803485|5.0|Loved loved this series!  Couldn't wait till the next chapter.  The suspense was unbelievable!  Would highly recommend to read even though everyone said it was porn.  I disagree.  Just a very detailed book series.
B007V508CC|5.0|I really like Maroon 5's music, but I would have liked the radio/edited version better.  I didn't know how raunchy the music really was until I listened to the unedited version.  It didn't deter from my liking it; just changed my mind on my kids hearing it.  I recommend the music, but the edited version.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|OK, I was not expecting this.  Daughter wanted to so this so with a sigh I said ok.  Really enjoyed it.  Funny, good music, likable characters, good (albiet predictable) story.  Worth a watch.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I enjoy this CD over and over.  The music is smooth and easy to listen to.  I recommend this CD to all Train fans.
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|Formulaic and poorly acted.  Cruise is OK, Baldwin is atrocious.  Brand should go back to doing voiceovers for cartoons.  Lot's of other musicals that satisfy, but this one?  Not so much.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Because it was really funny and entertaining ;) I enjoyed every minute I read it in a week<br /><br />Peace out
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie had it all: sci-fi, action, emotion, good acting and a great story line. I especially liked evolutionary development of some of the human race and the futuristic elements/approach. I'm writing this 5 star review because I don't think 3.5 stars does it justice at all!
B0037471TE|3.0|Its an ok book. I felt that it dragged on a little and so didnt enjoy it as much as I thought I might.
034580404X|4.0|Great book! i didnt want to put the book down. I recommend this trilogy, but adults ONLY! lol. Hope everyone enjoys it!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Its a surprisingly good book. I've never been a fan of the new craze for vampire novels, but I still enjoyed it.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|We thought this movie was good and my husband liked it better than me. I can't stand looking at Jean Claude van Damme during this movie and his plastic surgeon should be brought up on charges! The story was okay and unbelievable. it was funny more than I thought it would be and it was violent but not as much as I thought it would be. Sequels have a way of becoming more violent then the first action flick. I think the actors did a great job and the cameos were worth watching this movie. They were hilarious and sarcastic and it was a total guy's flick minus no nudity. So it's okay, worth seeing but don't have your hopes too high.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Im not really sure what genre this novel fits into. I really enjoyed it. I haven't watched the movie yet, but Im sure the book will be better. Theres a second (related) short story at the end which is very interesting makes you see the Life of Pi in a whole new perspective.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I love Joss Whedon's work. I have been a big fan of his for many years. I was excited to see what he would do for this movie and it blew my mind. My husband and I have seen this movie thrice in theaters and multiple times since. We loved this movie and the action scenes were great. The storyline was perfect for those coming into the movie and those who have been watching since Ironman. So worth watching and if you haven't seen it see it. I love watching it again because it's so good each time and there are little bits I catch each time I didn't see before. The writing, action, special effects, comedy, and true Joss Whedon style of the story within a story. You think you know what will happen and you don't. Amazing movie such a good job!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I found thus book to be amazing. I just never wanted it to end. It was good :) and wonderful.
B003OUXECE|5.0|Every thing about this book is amazing. It defiantly answers all the questions you may had about the game. All the characters personalities are great and this is one of those books that automatically interest you the second you read it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I literally could not put this book down the moment I picked it up. Such a GREAT read! So glad I picked it up!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's like my on personal dairy.  You can do just about anything with it. If something too long to put down than you can record it. The only thing I wish it had is an video recorder so u c and save a funny moment and watch it over again.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book takes your imagination to places that most authors can only wish to conjure in their writing. It is a great selection for anyone who wants to see what life is like when freedoms and choices are privileges, and survival is only given to those smart enough to seize it. This book is The Giver meets Brave New World meets A Handmaid's Tale.
B000MAH5O2|4.0|Well written. Barack Obama appears to be aware of the various sides of issues. I don't agree with all of his ideas, but his thoughts are certainly compelling. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know Barack Obama's political philosophy and ideas.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I real love the look of this clock.  The alarm not only has nice ring tones but is also loud enough to wake even me.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Not the best ending to a GOOD SERIES.  Disappointing at best.  There were too many characters and a rushed ending.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I picked up the Wool Omnibus, by Hugh Howey, some time ago, though I can't recall why. Possibly something I saw somewhere, possibly it was a Kindle daily deal. But when I saw it on Ruth's preliminary top ten list for this year, I decided it was time to pull up the first story (it's somewhat a serialized tale). So I did. And I read it. And then I read the second. And then the third. And when I got to the end of what I had on m Kindle, I checked to see if the story continued. The Wool story doesn't, but I'll be getting to the prequels pretty soon, I can tell you that.<br /><br />The setting is not all that original. It's basically a \\"For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky\\" genre:  a group of people are living in an artificial world and eventually learn that the world is larger than they imagined, as well as that their history is not what they thought it was. More specifically with regard to Wool, the artificial world is an underground Silo whose view of the toxic world outside comes via a group of cameras and sensors that reveals only a barren, brown, poisonous land with some tall ruins in the distance. Due to the constraints of their living space, life is strictly regulated by \\"The Pact\\"--which determines jobs, relationships, etc. One of the biggest taboos of the pact is talking about the Outside, a taboo punished by being assigned the one-way trip outdoors to clean the sensors (the bodies of past \\"cleaners\\" are clearly visible on the camera monitors). As one expects in this type of story, eventually someone or ones start to question their society and what they `ve been told and then hidden truths begin to be revealed, causing all sorts of trouble.<br /><br />So yes, the plot here isn't all that original. It is, however, utterly compelling. I'm not going to say any more about it because while it's not all that original in the big picture sense, and while it does get a tad more predictable toward the end, the details are captivating enough that I don't want to ruin your fun. Also, Howey does not shy away at all from killing off major characters, including point-of-view ones, and it would be difficult to talk more plot without spoiling such events. I'll simply say that the deaths, when they come, are extremely effective; you'll mourn the loss of more than one of these characters.<br /><br />And that is really where the strength of Wool lies. I'd say the major reason the plot is so compelling is because the characters are so compelling. Each point of view character is fully formed and distinctive. Howey has a way with succinct characterization--we feel we know each of these characters intimately without getting bogged down in a lot of back story or interior monologue, making us care deeply about what happens to them even as we speed through the plot, dragged on by its urgency and by our connection to the characters.<br /><br />Wool also deepens toward the end, as more and more is revealed about how this society was created and maintained, and what decisions went into such maintenance. Here, Howey poses some big questions about ethics, the needs of the many versus the needs of the few, means versus ends, etc.<br /><br />As I was reading Wool, I kept thinking it reminded me of those great early Heinlein books I read as I was first introducing myself to science fiction. It shares a lot of qualities with those books--a sparse and speedy plot, characters who are good with their hands and who use their skills and knowledge to get out of trouble, ethical dilemmas, and so on. It's been a while since I've read those old novels, and I don't know if they'd hold up at all, but Wool certainly feel right in place alongside them in my memories. Highly recommended, though I also recommend you don't start Wool without a good block of time in front of you. Having to stop will just annoy you.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|Not their best work. Most of the songs on this album are okay but I wouldn't recommend to others. Wait for the next one.

B00005N6KG|3.0|Better than no music while running, but not much! the flop around a bit and arent tight in your ears, so i find myself squashing them down to mke the music louder. fills the billet though and cheap as heck
0143121421|4.0|I remember the opening scene of the movie of this book from my high school days but I didn't remember any of the story. Le Carre isn't always easy to follow, but I found this novel intriguing and quite interesting despite the dated setting. Guess living through the Cold War helped. It's a quick read and fun to try to figure out what's truth.
0307744434|5.0|Let me just start out by saying: this book was in all seriousness magical. I have never read a book quite like it. It is first and foremost a love story, but that isn't where it stops. It has layers upon layers of themes and characters and events that can almost overwhelm you at times. But in a good way. I picked up this book, read the explanatory blurb on the back and I expected a cheesy love story about a girl that ran away to the circus. That in no way describes the pleasure that I had when reading this book. It was phenomenal. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to others.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|There is no way to order this via kindle either paid or free.  Can you please sort this out so that I can read this highly rated book and give it the rating it deserves.
B0086213XW|1.0|Take This Waltz is an overly-artsy, extremely pretentious, incredibly BORING movie.  It's very rare that I don't finish any movie that I start watching, but after 45 minutes of this one I just couldn't take it any more and started fast-forwarding through it and watching bits and pieces of the rest of the movie to see if it got any better.  It didn't.<br /><br />The reason I watched as much of the movie as I did was because A. Amazon had it listed near the top of the \\"free download\\" list for Amazon Prime members, and the Kindle I got for Christmas came with a one-month Amazon Prime membership, and B. It had Seth Rogan and Sarah Silverman in it, so I figured it might be at an least half-way decent comedy.  It's neither decent nor a comedy.  All I can say is, I'm glad it was free because if I had paid to watch this movie, I'd want my money back.<br /><br />The \\"plot\\" follows a shallow, self-centered, completely unlikeable woman in her late 20s who I guess we're supposed to sympathize with because she's insecure and not sure what she wants out of life.  She's married to a decent man (Rogan's character) who loves her (despite the fact that she acts psychotically towards him), but she's willing to throw that away when she falls in love at first sight with an artist who makes his living as a rickshaw driver (and yet can somehow afford a huge house in an artsy neighborhood).  She agonizes over it for the first hour and a half of the movie, occasionally discussing it with Silverman's character, including during a lengthy and pointless shower scene at a pool.<br /><br />Finally she leaves her husband, bangs the artist (and apparently a couple of his friends), and in the end discovers that throwing her marriage away didn't really make her any happier.  Cut to a final scene of her riding some sort of amusement park ride in what appears to be a disco, fade to credits.<br /><br />It's been a while since I've seen a movie this bad that wasn't on Mystery Science Theater.  And the film just goes on and on and on - what little story it has could have been easily told in about 20 minutes, but instead was dragged out to two hours.<br /><br />Even if you're thinking of watching this as a freebie with an Amazon Prime membership, my advice would be not to waste your time.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|There is no way this movie should work at all, yet there I sat watching and laughing at this silly thing.  There exist something quite unique about the Bostonian dialogue and ideologies portrayed by these characters.  Yes, even Ted is not exempt from their barroom philosophies on just about every aspect of contemporary middleclass bluecollar Bostonian lifestyles.  I found myself following their conversations without any bias as to what Ted is.  That said, it is a<br />tough film to recommend so when asked I simply say &#34;I liked it and it made me laugh,&#34; which it did.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I had heard this was a great series, and it IS. Now my son is addicted as well. Watch it!
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|All the songs sound alike.  I love Enya, but was a little disappointed in the mundane sounds of this particular CD.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Same as first season. Great cast and interaction. Like family setting in Castles home. I hope as the daughter gets older they don't write her out.

B0025YKDJC|5.0|Great movie! Bought as gift, but wouldn't mind having it in my own collection of DVDs and BluRays. Very funny!
B006O6F932|3.0|My 7 year old loves the idea of it but we've had issues from the beginning. The &#34;lock&#34; on the house doesn't work so when we pulled it out of the box the whole product came crashing & unfolding out.  The things do assemble easily, however the directions are nothing more than a bunch of pictures and the plastic parts bags are not labeled. The stairs do not properly attach to the floor so they just kind of hang there  When we try to fold the school up the stairs pop out of the top notches as well so the little nubs are getting damaged.<br />It would seem that they could have easily made the unfolded product more sturdy by providing some sort of notch or link at the center so that the walls don't wobble around. As it is, the &#34;upstairs&#34; portion just wobbles and tips while she plays.<br />Overall it is cute and my daughter loves to play with it, but it is definitely very overpriced for the quality.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Interesting story hold your attention, it does mine. I read all of Preston-Child books, the stories are always different from the last.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I hate Disney movies.  I rented this movie only because I had seen Secretariat race in the 70's in black and white on TV.  What a surprise.  The movie works.  It worked so well, I purchased it from amazon.  Sometimes I forward it to just the last 3 races and sit there cheering -- he's been dead 40 year, but he might lose if I don't cheer him on.  What a delight.

B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read every book Michael Connelly has written, but Harry Bosch remains his very best character.  Not perfect, except at his job.  Worth reading and rereading always.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|well written and suspenseful cant wait to see the rest of the season. It is much better with the different writers
B004LWZWGK|3.0|It's got lots of cool action...<br />it's got lots of cool gadets...<br />it's got a really good portrayal of Catwoman (which surprised me)...<br />what it's missing... is BANE... and about 80% of the story...<br /><br />What it has is really good... but I was disappointed in the final product.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|There were some funny parts, but very cheesy in most. I guess you can't expect much from a talking bear movie.
0525952926|4.0|Liked the development of the characters and situations.  The story line and history made it realistic and hard to put down, once started.

B000VZYPB4|5.0|We recently bought this VOD selection because we had missed the first two seasons of this show. We discovered that there is a particular joy in watching the shows back to back, watching the story arcs and characters develop and immersing ourselves in the oddball world of these supergeek characters. I highly recommend this series in particular and the VOD service in general. Having the entire catalog of these shows available when we want them is making our Amazon Prime membership worth it.
B00005J6T0|4.0|This is a great cd by Madonna love all the songs. She is a great artist, and still looks good today.
1599290642|5.0|Amazing art delivered in a fantastic book. The hardback copy has good, durable binding, which i think is very important. Detailed end-papers. The dust-jacket hides different art on the book cover itself.
B001O3SSWY|5.0|This has always been my favorite soundtrack to listen to---I think because it stands alone as a beautiful collection of songs.  Many soundtracks have songs that repeat the main theme so often that you think you are hearing the same song over and over.  That is not the case with this CD. This is such a sad and heartfelt soundtrack and will always be on the top of my list.

B0083TXXZ4|4.0|My daughter and I have had shoot outs with various toys for years now.  We have tried a variety of foam dart blowguns, launchers, blasters and without a doubt NERF makes the best and most fun (and durable)ones out there.  Well as I've gotten older and shes grown up the shoot outs were less frequent until recently.  She took some Christmas money and bought herself a Recon-6 and some extra darts and clips, and has been blasting the daylights out of me for a couple of weeks (My only defense has been one of those generic foam disk launchers).  That is until now!  I got the HailFire just recently and our battles have finally turned in my favor.<br />This is a really cool blaster.  It is well built and seems as durable as any other NERF product.  With the ability to use a variety of N-Strike clips this blaster will hold an insane amout of darts (all sold seperatly of course- but if you have other N-Strike guns the clips can be used- Even the Rotary Clips- but I believe based on some YOUTUBE vids that the rotarys may take up more room and may not rotate as smoothly)The blaster shorter than you would expect (about the length of the Recon without the barrel extension), and with 8 clips (yes this insane thing holds 8 clips) it is a pretty hefty blaster.  It take 4 AA batteries and has NO PROBLEMS with rechargeables.  It is a semi auto (trigger must be pulled for each shot) and when all is running smoothly you can rip off 48 shots (6 shots per clip, 8 clips total) in under a minute.  The blaster is pretty gentle with the darts and does not jam very often.  If there is a jam the clear slide cover over the reciever is INSANELY long-  and makes unjamming very quick and easy, there is even a little indicator window so you can tell at a glance if the cover is in place (green) or out of place (orange).  The cover locks with a nice positive feel and stays locked.  The clips can be taken out and re-inserted at any time and in any position (even firing position)and they click in with agood positive feel.  All in all this has a lot of good things going for it- BUT it's not perfect!<br />For some reason Nerf decided to include 4 six shot clips and 24 darts. Right off the bat this limits your fire power as the clips have to be rotated around the turret once they are spent.  Unless you don't mind an unbalanced blaster you have to space the clips apart so there is a space between each one.  This slows down your fire time as you have to rotate the turret 2 times to get to the next clip.  They also start you off with the smaller capacity clips right off the bat.  This of course limits your options.  The 18 shot clips are around Ten Dollars right now so to fully outfit this blaster with 18 shot clips (time 8 clips) will run you EIGHTY DOLLARS!!!!!!  Of course you will have 144 shots but OUCH twice the price of the blaster (and then some!)  If you elect (as I did) to get the 4 clip HailFIre upgrade kit (4 clips, 6 shots each plus 24 darts) the price is a little more managable- but then your only at 48 shot capacity (an insane amount to all be loaded at once!).  This gun has a top and bottom barrel tactical rail- but neither is really usefull.  Anything on the top rail will be blocked my the turret advancement handle (and if you use the handle to hold the balster- then you hand and arm).  The bottom barrel rail is really too short for anything other than possible a flashlight.  I would have rather had 4 18 shot clips and passed on the tactical rails completly.  The gun is some what unbalanced when fully loaded (as to be expected)and aiming it is really a joke (its more like sling it from the hip and adjust your aim based on where the stream of darts are hitting!)  Their are spots for a sling- but I have not tried one out yet.  The Blaster is also pretty noisy.  I must activate the flywheel button before launching your first dart- so sneaking up on someone, beign stealthy, or even trying to snipe, is very difficult as your intended vistim will undoubtedlyhear the indy car motor revving up.  Of course this is the price you pay for a semi-auto, and if the victim does not duck for cover right away they will face a steady stream of foam doom!<br />If you have the money, and hate to have to pause to reload (or even change clips)and love that indy car engine rev- then this is the blaster for you!  If you need stealth and precision- well then look else where.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I found the Complete Saga worth every dollar! The behind-the-scenes commentaries were very interesting. It was a good way to spend time during the holidays.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I can't believe the ending which came out of nowhere.  Typical Harry Hole, but much better and worse at the same time.

B0045HCIYA|5.0|I've read other review that were not kind but I decided tosee for myself. Watch it and see for yourself. I looked threw the striping and seen a single Mom fighting for her family. Don't get me wrong Demi's striping was great. She actually did a great job and so very beautiful. This movie will have you pulling for her hard as you travel with the plot. I lovrd it for the story as well as the subject. Guys will love it for the obvious reason but the ladies will love it for her cause, a Mother pushed to do what she has to for her family.
B0024CEY36|1.0|have read a novel by mr. Follett previously  and thought it was pretty good.  this book was not my kind of novel.  It was so boring after about 20 pages I simply discarded it
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Interesting premise for a story of life, mixed with spiritually.  fFound that it dragged in places.  Not up to all the  hype, but overall entertaining.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Okay, so I'm the last person around to play Angry Birds.  But I'm hooked.  The freebie has a ton of ads so I will likely upgrade.  I'm glad the freebie was available to try out.  This game is hilarious and addictive.

B000AJIF4E|3.0|Maybe it's just me ... maybe something's wrong with my ears, or maybe something's wrong with my headphones, but I'll be damned if these things aren't EXTREMELY bright to me. When I go from listening to my Yamaha NS10M monitors to these things, I absolutely hate it. It sounds almost painfully bright, and I almost always have to keep the volume at a pretty low level, else it almost hurts to listen to. I have a few other $30 or $40 pairs (AKG and AT), and I almost always listen to those because it's not such a shock putting them on.<br /><br />With so many other positive reviews, I wonder if there's something wrong with mine or something. I mean ... the bass sounds good and crisp, but it just sounds as if someone cranked the treble knob up about 10db or something.<br /><br />The cord was severed a long time ago (15 years maybe), and my friend spliced it back together. That's really the only thing that's ever happened to them. It's hard to imagine that something like that would result in a severe treble boost. It seems as though if there was some issue with a bad joint, there would be an intermittent problem, and there's not. They've worked just like this for as long as I can remember. (I honestly can't remember whether or not I noticed this before the cord was severed. I do know that they were my first \\"good\\" pair of headphones, and so I didn't have anything against which to compare them ... so maybe that was why it didn't seem so outrageous to me.)<br /><br />Anyway, I use them for vocal tracking mostly, because they let me hear the vocals clear and up front, but other than that, I avoid them like the plague. And I'm shocked to read people say that they don't leak much. I never track acoustic guitars with them because there's way too much leakage. If I'm playing to just a click, it's clearly audible when the guitar sustains a chord or even during quieter fingerstyle stuff.<br /><br />I won't give them the 2-star rating I'd like to give, simply because, with so many glowing reviews, something has to be up. I've never heard of headphones developing treble-heavy sound before, but maybe mine have for some strange reason.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I have been wanting to read this book for awhile now and I am glad I finally got around to it.  This book starts out kinda slow but it picks up towards the middle.  The book is about a boy named Jacob Portman.  He has spent his life listening to stories that his grandfather Abe Portman has told him about all the peculiar children that he lived with in an orphanage.  He also told him stories about monsters that were out to kill him.  He even had pictures to show him of all these children.  While he was younger he believed everything his grandfather told him but as he was getting older he began to question all these stories.  The family told him that his grandfather was loosing his mind and he was beginning to believe them until one day his grandfather calls him and is very upset.  Jacob goes and checks on him and what he finds will change his life forever and it will also start him on a journey of discovery to find out who these peculiar children are and what they have to do with him.  One of the most interesting things about this book is the pictures that the writer has included.  They really make it easy to follow along with the story line and the fact that these pictures are real just adds to the mystery of the Peculiar Children.  I recommend this book to anyone that likes to read mysteries.  I am glad that I finally got around to reading it.  I give this book 4 stars.
B0010YQ9F0|5.0|This product was just plain awesome. All the oldies for half the price. The records are in good condition too!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|It gives you credits then a big chunk of them suddenly disappear. Game freezes often in the middle of playing. Emailed developer and they told me if I paid for credits to email them a receipt number but if its free credits they aren't going to do anything.  This has been going on for days so I don't think I'll be playing anymore. Just now I went from 31 credits down to 19...useless...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing..considering I finished it in 2 days. I highly recommend this book to anyone out there who needs hope. This book is raw bit beautiful. Nicholas sparks is one of my favorite writers..and he did not disappoint. Very good book..I couldn't put it down.

B00AA7O22U|3.0|This movie had more violence and less plot line than I like but my husband enjoyed it.  Ok for a Sunday afternoon as we took down the holiday decorations.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. Endless amount of coins. Any one who will get this game,  it is so awesome. And the best part is that it is free!
146500632X|5.0|The One Direction had all 12 months and 365 days.  It is cute and has charming pictures of the group which just made my granddaughter's day.  Good daily squares so she can put in special occaisions
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely loved the book from beginning to end. Better than the cliche Vegas story about an elope in Sin City.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I had been ordering Grey's for my Son every Christmas because with work and family he was not able to watch week to week. Well this year I was informed that he really missed catching up on Grey's over the Christmas; New Years Holiday Break...OOPS I guess I missed # 7 & 8....OH MY !! Well that could explain why I had such a hard time figuring out what to get him....I guess I totally SPACED it. Well I have now ordered #7 & 8 (Happy Fathers Day and Birthday) And so I don't FORGET again I have pre ordered season #9.  Grey's just keeps getting better year after year !  Love it and now Pre Ordering will be a New Years tradition....One more gift out of the way! LOL
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I originally gave this a negative review because of the IAP, but have decided that it's worth four stars.  Here's what happened: I won my first game on easy difficulty, thereby unlocking an upgrade for my disease.  I then tried normal difficulty, but got crushed.  Okay, that obviously meant grinding out wins on easy level to unlock more buffs before moving to normal. I won my next four games on easy, earning four more upgrades. Very cool.<br /><br />Then I lost five games in a row.  It made no sense to me that the game had gotten harder -- I was becoming a better player, AND I was adding upgrades to my disease!  I concluded that I had hit the \\"IAP wall\\": i.e. in order to progress, I'd have to spend money on IAP.  That's to be expected in a free app with IAP, but I had paid a dollar up front for this one.  Also, the sum of all IAPs is over $20, which is outrageous.<br /><br />I then decided to scale down to just zero or one upgrade, even though I could use more.  After that, I began to win games again.  My scores were not as good as my first few games (again, even though I was becoming a better player) but I was getting more upgrades so it was better than losing.  After my 11th victory (I think), I finally unlocked the \\"get more DNA for red bubbles\\" upgrade, and got my best score by far. (If you pick just one upgrade to purchase, that's probably the one).<br /><br />I'm still disappointed in the bait-and-switch (game gets harder after winning a few times, so you'll get impatient and shell out money), and I still don't know if all the features can be unlocked without paying.  However there does now seem to be plenty of gameplay for your initial dollar, if have the skill and patience.<br /><br />The game itself is nicely done, and can be won with a variety of strategies. I'll leave full gameplay description to other reviewers who have done it better.  I'll just add that it runs great on my Droid Bionic; very few glitches.  It's a battery hog, but that should be no surprise.rise.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was easy to read and had great characters and storylines. It has many twists to keep you engaged.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Mildly funny movie. Enjoyable, but the ending was rather uneventful. The  ending was almost like the writers wanted to be done without finishing up the storyline.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read the first one,  it was ok.  This one was also ok, nothing great,  but I'm not going to read the 3rd one.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|my 7 year old grandson liked it, but found it difficult to move to other levels. So I tried it, having a master's degree and retired teacher, and I also found it difficult to move along.  It says there are clues and hints online, but the object of a portable game is to be portable, not my whole reason for living!  It's cute, but I think I'll move along.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|It was<br /><br />awesome<br />Great book<br />Awesomely awesome best book eva<br />You lol lo l l l l lol lol olo
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am very late in the angry birds department-- i downloaded this game only in December- but let me tell you, it is one of the funniest, funnest and most addictive game i have ever played.  Spent hours playing!  the horror!  but oh what fun....<br /><br />if you like games to pass the time, this one is a keeper
B007CI81IQ|3.0|The book disappointed me. As other reviewers indicated, it includes a good diagnosis of poverty and a lot of anecdotal evidence. However the conclusions are not sustantiated on solid statistical evidence. In short, the book failed to add breakthrough material or arguments to the discussion or bibliography about poverty.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I usually abhor watching anything on television that isn't an HBO or Showtime documentary or movie. And even then, I watch more Amazon Instant and Netflix Instant than any of my other viewing choices. So when I was bored one night with nothing to watch and, after reading all the fantastic write-ups about The Walking Dead, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />After all, it was only about zombies, a category I lost interest in about the time I had outgrown adolescence and was leaving high school.<br /><br />Was I glad I was bored that night! Yeah, I would highly recommend this series for anyone interested in experiencing what has rightfully been dubbed &#34;the finest series television has ever produced&#34;.<br /><br />And here are the reason:<br /><br />1.) the writing is top drawer. The overall plot and sub-plot[s] subject for each episode are well conceived and brilliantly written. The dialog moves along at a natural clip and never sounds phony or even rehearsed. It was immediately obvious to me, after watching the first half of the first season, that the core group of actors comprising the series, had all fallen &#34;sympatico&#34; in with the writers.<br /><br />2.) the production values are also top drawer, particularly the special creature effects and all the interesting ways that the producers have dreamed up to show us how a zombie can quickly be dispatched into the next world, each method more grusome than the next. But the special effects department has also built for us a port hole into their imagination of how a post-apocalyptic zombie environment is supposed to look like. Entirely convincing!<br /><br />3.) The acting is first rate. Now, I had never heard of any of these actors before, but I did recognize Andrew Lincoln's face, although I couldn't recall from where. That such a &#34;diverse&#34; group of &#34;characters&#34; would find themselves and build for themselves a cohesive, self-supporting family unit appears entirely credible and possible byway of the writer's magic. There's a young boy. There's an old man. There's a young woman and an old woman. There are smart leader-types and then there are reactionary &#34;emotional&#34; types. All of these attributes allow for some fine discourse and interaction amongst the cast, as they flush out and develope their roles.<br /><br />When I started watching this series, quite honestly I didn't start out with any great expectations. By the end of the first episode I was intrigued and by the end of the second I was hooked. I spent the rest of my time watching the entire series straight through, I couldn't pull myself away.<br /><br />When I heard that Season Three had already been released through Amazon Instant, I immediately fired up my Roku Box, clicked onto Amazon Instant, found Season Three of The Walking Dead, and commenced watching all of the episodes.<br /><br />Amazon has not posted all the episodes of Season Three, for what reason I have no idea. But I hope they don't make us wait too long before we can watch the rest, because I can't wait to see how their current predicament resolves.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|excellent reading most enjoyable gives a great insite to the pc trail, and the toughness of undertaking such a walk
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|It's one of those books that breaks down a lot lot of things you know, but need to see it in writing to make you really grasp it.

B000HWZ4A2|4.0|Good but too short to cover the book which went into much more details. Good quality acting however.  Glad it was available.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book was a great starter to the other books in the series. I loved the comics , they were very creative and the writing print was cute! And sometimes I did actually feel sad for Grew. I recommend this book to creative minds and children who need to read more.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It felt like they tried on this movie, unlike MiB 2 which really felt thrown together. I got a couple of chuckles from it and I felt the story was somewhat interesting. I'd recommend watching it.

B005GSVFAK|5.0|I'm a long time Toy Story fan, I already owned 1 & 2 on DVD. My daughter just turned 2 before Christmas, so we decided to buy Toy Story 3 on Blu-Ray for her. It's a great movie, I really liked how they finished the story. My daughter walks around saying &#34;Buzz&#34; when she wants to see it. We haven't watched it on DVD yet or the Digital copy so I can't comment on that part, but the blu-ray works perfect in our PS3. I highly recommend the Toy Story series, it's a must see for all ages. Slinky dog is my favorite characater while my daughters is Buzz and my husband likes Woody. Great entertainment for the whole family.

B00AFWEPVI|2.0|I guess the camera app is ok. I am used to a front facing camera, or, like my iPhone, one that switches front to rear. Who wants a picture of their own face? So I was disappointed. This review may be better directed as a review on my kindle, which u am otherwise quite happy with.

0439023513|5.0|Good book, but the ending could have been better.  There should have been one more book to explain the ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing!  Much more than I anticipated, looking forward to book 2, and what the story will hold.
1577311523|5.0|Best book ever ! it's the kind you read over and over again. You can turn to any page randomly and get something out of it.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|After reading various reviews of this title, I decided to give it a chance.  It is by far one of the best DS titles I have played in years.  For older players who have fond memories of descriptive text games for the C64 and the Apple systems, this will bring you back to the days of being glued to the screen engrossed in the story.  The puzzles and gameplay are reminiscent of Myst, in that you are thrown into the game blind, and have to figure it out as you go along, through interactive \\"hunt for items and solve the puzzle\\" play.<br /><br />The puzzles are not very difficult for puzzle-game fans, but are varied and interesting enough to keep it fun regardless.  Players who normally find themselves wanting to throw their DS out the window playing games like Professor Layton should not have much trouble with this title at all with a little patience.  Though the game is \\"timed\\" - you have nine hours to solve it - the time progresses via the script, pausing during the puzzle scenarios.<br /><br />\\"999\\" definitely earned its \\"M\\" rating; the gore is relatively minimal visually (but very, very graphically described in the text), but the language is definitely for the adult crowd with some extremely suggestive jokes thrown in for good measure.  Its description as an interactive novel is also spot-on.  You will do a LOT of reading . . . much more reading than you will spend time actually playing the game.  This is not a bad thing in this title, as the story is engaging, well told, and the characters are diverse and entertaining.<br /><br />Definitely a \\"must buy\\" title for the puzzle and story crowd.
B005XLN97M|5.0|My granddaughter loved it! I was so surprised at how nice and sturdy it was. So glad we ordered it!
1451629184|5.0|This was a difficult book to read at times. It is so incredible that this woman was able to survive indescribable torture and emerge with a kind heart and a positive outlook on life. She is such a hero. There are lessons here for everyone.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|This is now one of my favorite Tim Burton films!!  I love Dark Shadows and to see it on the Big Screen in a Tim Burton way... WAS AMAZING!!

B007EDYN36|4.0|Being a big fan of Kiss, really enjoyed this book about peter criss' life with and without Kiss. Lots of good dirt , and stories about the road. I think any rockker would definately like this book.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|Really opens your eyes to the reason for our country's economic struggle and debt... Must see movie for everyone of all ages!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not much of a reader. I stay so busy that I just don't have time. A client left this book in my studio. I just happened to be slow so I picked it up and read the first chapter. I was so hooked. I was sad when she returned an hour later for it.<br /> I got a Kindle for Christmas so I purchased this book and read it in 4days. Loved it. I am a hunter and relate to her love of the woods. I actually read most of this book while hunting. I am a huge fan. This story is so complex. Thank you Susanne Collins.
B007SGM084|5.0|A truly great read!!!! The deeper message is what makes the trilogy so good.  I've read it twice in 6 months.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Excellent product I am happy with this purchase, it met all my expectations with this product. Thanks for this maravolloso product.

030759565X|5.0|I was so excited to finally get this cookbook for Christmas. I follow her blog regularly and look to her hundreds of recipes when I want to try making something new. Really nice packaging complete with gorgeous photography and quick tips along with her delicious recipes. Can't wait to cook my way through this book!
0812548094|5.0|my FAVORITE of the series.nonstop orgies of epic and violence.and always a hint of romance and  perseverance...all the books seem to have a positive message.
B007712XAU|3.0|One disc was damaged which meant I was very disappointed that I could not watch one episode.  The rest of the discs were fine.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 8 yr old Grandson, Noah told me I had to have this. I said ok, and 3 days later found out it cost $2.99. Told him it was the best $2.99 I've spent in a long time Started playing it with him. Went home and was up past midnight. It is not addicting, but it sure is fun.
B0056369RO|5.0|Got Sorry For Party Rocking (Amazon MP3 Deluxe Exclusive Version here because I felt it was cheaper than itunes. And it was very easy to download.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game, it's just an amazing game, and so addicting. The problem is that after playing for awhile a big ad blocks me from playing. The ad  is asking me to buy the full version...any way to get rid of this?
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Love this movie so much. I have watched it many times now and very glad that I bought it. Also price was cheaper than in store at the moment when i pre-ordered it.
0345803507|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations! No torn or bent pages. No stains or anything. I was actually expecting a little more wear and tear. It's just about perfect! Thanks.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|The video quality of this HD series on the Amazon Instant Play App on my television was excellent.  Buying new episodes is a breeze, simply enter your 5 digit pin number and the video buffers quickly then starts playing.  Season 6 was well written and entertaining. Thank you Amazon for another high quality product.
B004P1JEXE|3.0|Some aspects of the book seemed long and somewhat pointless. At times the book with its twists and plots kept me as interested as his first novels in this series although certainly not as engaging.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I've played it on multiple platforms, and it's just awesome!  The gameplay is easy, but the strategy can get pretty tough as you go on.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Fast paced keeps me on the edge of my seat !<br />I love the Jack Teacher books,can't wait to see the movie!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|When this is working, it is very fun to play with friends.  It will not always open up correctly so I've had to uninstall and reinstall several times.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Watched it with my wife.  We laughed alot, and teared up a bit.  Both Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are outstanding as usual.  And a surprisingly straight and good performance from Steve Carell.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Super easy, perfect for keeping all my ideas together! So easy to find new ideas, this site is so much fun.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is definitely my favorite game, especially on hand held devices. I often play during the night if I can't sleep.
B0036SUQWA|4.0|This movie is based on true happenings in the military.Naturally some things are exaggerated as in any movie but the main<br />premise was true.Someone without a sense of humor and who can't see the insanity and fun in life wouldn't appreciate this<br />movie.I like it,but then again i'm a psychic warrior.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Nothing better than Downton Abbey. Love it! The characters are so well done. It draws you in, the first scene or two, and then you find yourself swept away. Wonderful show!
0345529057|2.0|I got my boxed set at Costco and had no issues with the books themselves. As to the series, great writing, but don't start unless you have a lot of time on your hands and don't mind constant rehashing of character themes. How many ways can you read about the mother worried for her children, the 'broken' boy with a new \\"sight,\\" the power hungery queen, etc. After so many books you'd think there would be an end in sight....no! It'll probably take the author another 10 large books. I haven't seen the show, but it has to have the benefit of editing!
0812993292|4.0|I needed a change from the mystery novels I usually read. While this is slow, it still kept me reading and left me with a warm &#34;fuzzy.&#34;
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is one of my favorrite games on my kindle. I wish that you had more coins so you could play longer. I love game circus apps. I have the prizefighter claw<br /> game and it is just as good. I definitely would.tell.everyone in the world.about this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0307719774|4.0|I have had my book for a year now and am pleased to say I have kept up with it.  I enjoy sitting down to answer the question of the day and only a few times over the past year had I more than a day or two to catch up on.<br /><br />Some questions are very easy and some are much more thought provoking.  My only con...which could be a pro... is that because the book is so small there isn't much space to write.  Each page is a date, like January 1st, and then there are 5 spaces below that for the 5 years.  On an easy question day this isn't a problem.  I can fill out what I had for dinner in just a few words.  On a thought provoking day it could be harder to fit in everything you want to write.  On the plus side having it as a smaller book means that you don't have a very large book sitting around and taking up space.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|She has done it again. Colleen Hoover is able to successfully capture our hearts with wonderful characters we grow to love.  He male characters are thoughtful, strong, sensitive, intelligent, engaging and captivating as they attempt to overcome hardship.  Excellent book. A must read
0553712837|5.0|This was a great book and the first one for Grisham that was this short and very humorous. The movie was very good and I would read this book again and again.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I literally stayed up most of the night as I couldn't stop reading.  This one took me through almost every emotion in the spectrum - it made me laugh, it made me annoyed, angry, happy, sad, it's so well written I found myself pushing for almost every character in the story and putting myself right at the table with Lou's family or in the annex with Lou and Will, wanting to snAp at Will 's parents and pick up Thomas. What a refreshing, real story!
B002K0WBXW|4.0|It was entertaining and was well performed by Sandra Bullock, I do not buy very many DVD but without question this was worth the price and I am glad we have it in our house to view on any day and for anyone in our family.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband who likes sound garden.  Heard one or two of the songs on the radio before buying, and liked them.  Bought this and was not disappointed.  If you like their sound, then you will like this album!
0070511136|4.0|I use this methodology and have read the book more then once. It is referable years later and is easy to teach. the value of the book and the methodology will help everyone who is open to new ideas and to be a consultative executive versus a price driven sales person.
0756655307|5.0|I bought this for my 12 year old nephew as a gift, and every guy in the room proceeded to look it over- every age group- had to look it over!  This had great detail, bright colors, great graphics, lots of characters and very detailed descriptions.  I would highly recommend this.  My nephew could not put it down (after he wrestled it away from his uncles).
B00005JMFQ|4.0|The movie is one that we see often and love to see it again and again. It is a classic for the holidays and reminds me of my friends in London and when I hear the music I instantly think of the movie
B008C1O8CA|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband who likes Green Day.  Heard one or two of the songs on the radio before buying, and liked them.  Bought this and was not disappointed.  If you like their sound, then you will like this album!
B00003CX5P|5.0|The characters and story line was perfect and it align the stars for the next two movies. this is a classic and the true story line you have to see before you view any of the SW episodes.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|I give a five star because I can't find any other performer that is comparable to lead singer Freddie Mercury. His range of voice is outstanding. The collection has 51 of Queens greatest songs. For the current market price, this is a steal.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I love the movie and it is a wonderful story for all time. The cast was perfect and the music was excellent choice. I hear the music and I instantly think about the movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|You can set different days with different times to wake up. It shows when it is set and is very easy to use. I recommend it. I use the free version that has ads. They aren't annoying like some free apps' ads.
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter loves the game cant stop playing it.. it can be a little addictive I have started to play it as well..
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 18 year old granddaughter. She loved it and so I loved it too.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My daughter loves the game cant stop playing it.. it can be a little addictive I have started to play it as well..
B004TI5N38|3.0|A little far fetched, and drags in some places.  Maybe a few too many elements mixed in to the basic story.

0547884591|5.0|I bought this for my cousin for Christmas, and he didn't put it down all day. He introduced me to Tim Ferriss's other 2 books (which I love as well), and these books have really helped him turn a new leaf. I admire the power of metalearning and the encouragement to take action that these books really presses on the reader. 4 hour chef is the real deal!

B0009P5YXO|4.0|This is any Whovian's dream come true! Like many of the other reviews say, you need to be careful with the nibs because they are REALLY easy to lose. However, the blue light and sonic sounds are spot on. I also bought the 11th Doctors Screwdriver for my friend, and I'd say that this one is far less sturdy. Nonetheless, it's great (:
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter loves the game cant stop playing it.. it can be a little addictive I have started to play it as well..
B000S1M9LY|3.0|Fantastic read. I just wish there had been more of a resolution to some of the story lines. Great anyway.
B00A757EFW|5.0|this game take me back to when I was a wee bit younger love to play the game at the arcades
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is not an action packed horror book, but it leaves you in the edge of your bed. The author found a great way to draw in the characters and make them all interesting in their own way. It is a good read that leaves you wanting more. Grestgreatgreatgrrat read! My 23 year old son read it and loves it!
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughter loves the game cant stop playing it.. it can be a little addictive I have started to play it as well..
B002W2U3H4|5.0|I've enjoyed watching the movie with my 5 year old son. The animation and the sound is amazing!<br />My son wanted to watch it over and over again.
0765322889|4.0|** spoiler alert ** Maybe, it was just me but, I didn't have such a hard time with this first book. I was hooked from the scene with the old seer and what turned out to be Sorry. I wanted to know what came of the fisherman's daughter and make sense of the seer's message to her. So, I kept reading. Was it a slog through at times? Yes. But that comes of world building. I thought it was some of the most intelligent writing I've recently read. And I have been doing a bit of that lately. I am no literary scholar by any means. However, reading this book gave me a sens of excitement for what will come. This to me was an introduction to the series. Paran's family in the south, Sorry's father being spared death, Tattersail's reincarnation among the Rhavi, the T'lan Imass, the man that is chained inside of Rake's sword, Rallick Nom and the Azeth house, so many possibilities and each direction I want to get to know more. No, I think this first book was well written in the buildup of anticipation for me. Not giving too much away but just enough to make you want to know more. You can sense the depth in the patterns in this series. I am only wondering what took me so long to get to it after reading the Game of Thrones series (which was my intro into this genre.) Oh wait, I know, Jordan, Sanderson, Weeks, Ambercrombie,Rothfuss... If this first book in anyway proves to be the blueprint for all I anticipate with this series, I think Erikson will dwarf some of the aforementioned, just saying.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|great way to buy on roku and amazon was fantastic, and a lot of fun to watch on the roku
1400049628|4.0|An interesting book. Definetly a good light read. The author has done his homework and done some deep though on a lot of varying subjects. I do feel most of his writing is not backed by personal experience with firearms or other weapons.. but he makes some great points. It is a &#34;zombie&#34; book.. so.. have to take it with a grain of salt and just enjoy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|well what can i say it was very good read and i enjoyed it verry much grisham is a great wrighter
0307346617|5.0|I didnt know what to expect with this book. The style of it and the radical shifting from place to place.. made for an interesting read. I found it to be very well thought out and in a genre that has been visited many times over the years this was a breath of fresh air. The author makes some excelent points and brings up some great surprises.
B00877R85I|5.0|You won't be able to put it down. Unless you have been living under a rock you, you have probably seen the movie; however, like most other book-to-screen adaptations, you have to read the book to truly appreciate how amazing this story really is - especially in this series.<br /><br />As I see it, the sad truth is that the first book is the best in the series; however, I still found all of them impossible to put down after I started reading them.<br /><br />This is a must read for people of all ages, all religion or creeds, from all over the world for more reasons than I can detail. Just know that whatever you age, and whatever your point of view on distopian novels, this one is worth your time.
B004FHBO9K|5.0|Fantastic album. The LP works like a dream and the sound quality just blew my mind. Awesome buy. I recommend it highly.
B00AKCJB44|5.0|Heard this sountrack before I saw the movie and was blown away by it. I'd be surprised if some of the tracks are not hits in there own right.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|LOVE this CD! I have always enjoyed these guys and I bought this for a gift and I love listening to it just as much. Very relaxing.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|My 5 year old daughter loves it and keeps playing it over and over and still enjoys it. I thought it might freak her out because of zombies but she actually picked this movie and loved it!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This film takes a much more scientific look into the \\"Treadstone\\" project, and Jeremy Renner does a near-perfect job portraying a surprising honest & likable killer agent.<br /><br />And the action is TOP NOTCH.  Choreography is treated with much more respect, and far LESS shaky-cam crap (my one real beef with the original trilogy).  I found all action sequences to be much easier to follow visually, as well as more believable.<br /><br />Overall, a very entertaining watch, and possibly my new favorite in the franchise.
0805086846|5.0|This book was very well written and provided heartbreaking, and often graphic, insight into the other side of the American West. This book will tear at your heart when you read how time and time again the Indians were betrayed ... and the manner in which they were slaughtered. I had to put the book down several times because I found the stories to be so heartbreaking. But I highly recommend it to anyone who truly wants to know what really happened to the Indians at the hands of the white settlers.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This is the begining of cowboy heros and stort lines. Long but would not cut a scene. After you watch this (if it is for the first time) you will see plots of your favorite spagheti western just waiting to be filmed. One of those movies that I will wear out from watching over and over.
B006O6F932|4.0|It was an awesome toy. A lot of assembly but overall a great toy.A little pricey for plastic parts that get lost, and if you have little ones keep them away.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Got exactly what I was expecting... Was a gift for Christmas and it came to the house very quickly.  Thanks!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it....the sounds, the birds and pigs making noise, the game is fun and I can't pull myself away!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved the book! Amazing ending, I enjoyed this book very much and highly recommend this to anyone who is interested.
1609611543|3.0|Bought for relative (who has several healthy issues) to read.  Don't believe he has read it.  His wife was reading it for him.  Have heard other others who have had success giving up wheat.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the story line ! It's such a good book with a beautiful ending. Definitely a must read !!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't out this book down! Highly recommended to those of all ages that love romance novels with a twist.
0316228532|2.0|This book was far from what we expected and it does nothing to &#34;grab&#34; your interest. I read it when I have nothing else to read.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I love your discounted album deals. Haven't listened to the whole album, but there are some bangers on there. thanks
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This is no doubt the album of the decade that turned the music indstry around and launched the pioneering of excellence of the music video.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is such a fabulous classic for anyone who loves musicals!  It does run long and have a very adult undertone toward the end of the film.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The person I bought it for loved it! We are all video people and I wass<br /> thrilled that you had it on hand.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Love the Big Bang Theory!!!  There is no way to watch this and not connect with atleast one of the characters!
B009GESJH2|4.0|Great cd, love it. Shipped fast, listen to it all the time. Use it to work out to on elipticle.
0061980269|5.0|A must reading for anyone in the country today.  For young people it can be an inspiration and an understanding of what conditions were like in the south just a few years ago.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I don't know how I would have rated this film had I not already seen the Swedish trilogy of films, or if I had not read the books.  This American version tries to condense all three books into one film.  In so doing, it loses much in content and changes other plot elements in an effort to achieve continuity within the abridged story lines.  Had I not read the books, I would have found the continuity even more problematic and the changes were sometimes actually bothersome.  Also, the actors in the Swedish version look more as I would have pictured them and seem more comfortable in their roles - this is particularly true of the female lead.  I highly recommend the Swedish trilogy of films and might have liked this one more had I not seen them.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|WAS AN ALRIGHT MOVIE&#62; I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR MOVIES LIKE THIS BUT MY BOYS ENJOYED IT&#62; ALSO OWN PART 1
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and I am on it all the time but this is all the minecraft I know. I have a ps3 and I don't want to pay $30 for the Pc but I love the edition.
0767802624|3.0|WAS AN ALRIGHT MOVIE&#62; I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR MOVIES LIKE THIS BUT MY BOYS ENJOYED IT&#62; ALSO OWN PART 2
B006M4RN3U|5.0|They're the biggest band on earth right now and for good reason.  There are at least 6 radio singles on this album.  It is an amazing album that strongly reminds me of Queen.  I never cared for Queen, but this album is amazing.<br /><br />The beauty of this album is that it appeals to the mainstream establishment while also appealing to those who have a more discriminant taste in music.  It's really a great album.<br /><br />fun. has another album out older than this one, and Nate Reuss was in a great band called The Format before he formed fun.  Check all that out as well.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Since my family background comes from this type of lifestyle with the cattle industry I especially enjoyed this movie.  However, it gives an amazing outlook and perspective from someone who is dealing with autism and is just an uplifting story, whether you know about cattle or have never even seen a cow in your life.  Yes, there are definitely moments were I wanted to jump through the screen to help Ms. Temple, but to know what she has overcome and accomplished in her life is just astonishing! ;)
B006LSZECO|3.0|This page turner was fun to read.  However the ending was a big fat disappointment.  With all of the suspense you'd think the ending would follow suit.
B007SGM084|3.0|I heard the rants and raves about this book, so I bought the triolgy. It was not like I expected.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|LOVED this!!  I had never watched this before, so beginning with Season 1, i was sucked in!!  It was everything I heard it was!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Not too hard and not too easy. I liked this game a lot. It pushes you to challenge yourself on some levels.
B009H442DG|5.0|The CD was great - i was hoping it would be a video but this is just as good!  Great to see and hear that they got back together to do this for their charities
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app has come in handy. Even with my business.. I love it tons.<br />I love the big screen and how easy it is to use. Anything that makes this busy moms day a little easier is good for me....
B003VANOFY|2.0|The headset seems to have a very low battery life and I have to keep it plugged in more than not.  Also the 4/5 second on off switch is a bit of a pain.  Overall this headset is not worth the price they ask  for it.  I will use it till it dies and get something else.
B009H442DG|5.0|The musical scores are so well done, and the songs are great.  I think they really thought this through, and did a great job.<br />It is a &#34;make you feel good&#34; cd. Also, all money goes to charity ......everybody wins!
0061142026|3.0|It's been hard for me to sort through my feelings concerning Stardust. On the one hand I think this is, at the bare bones, a fabulous story. Boy goes into magical land, whose entrance is a guarded wall, to get a star for his love. Witches and royalty are splashed in along the way with their own agendas and plans. Boy grows up and realizes what he truly wants and where he truly belongs. It's cute, right? It also makes a fabulous movie.<br /><br />The writing isn't bad either. After reading some of Gaiman's other works it's very clear to me that he has a way with words. Sometimes though there are too many words for my liking. The story seemed to really drag at some points making it hard to keep my interest. How many pages does it really need to take to tell the tale about Dunstan Thorn and Lady Una?<br /><br />It also seemed that there were so many lost opportunities along the ways. There are so many minor, minor characters and there is this exciting new world, but so much seems to be left undeveloped. Usually I'm asking for less world-building, but in this case I did not get close to enough!<br /><br />Then there is that ending. I think what I disliked the most about the ending is that the witch, who spends so much energy and time chasing down the star,  suddenly seems so complacent. Now, maybe that has to do with how tired and old she has become, but I had hoped for a little more of a fight!<br /><br />Overall, the movie was enough for me.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|I would recommend this movie for any child at any age.  He loves the characters and the music.  Thank you!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Firs of all this book was absolutely amazing it was so good that I didn't even skip through the boring parts like I usually do because there were no boring parts! The relationship between sky and holder was so intense that I literally couldn't breathe the whole time I was reading it! Not to mention how much meaning this story held just every part of it had a deep meaning behind it that made you want to read more. This book brought out so much emotions in me that I didn't even think were possible to show while I was reading a book. Half the time I was a sobbing and than I was smiling and than I was angry it just, had to be the best book I have ever read in my lifetime, this author is amazing for giving us this incredible book that will make us feel all over again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing!! Loved the whole book from start to finish! It is a must read for adults! I didn't even like reading until this book.
193609648X|5.0|Great book lots of choices to choose from and good instructions.  If you want to create something stirking this is the book for you.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|This novel is one of the best sci-fi books I have read in a long time. Clone has created a masterpiece with READY PLAYER ONE, especially with his inclusion of many real-life video games as part of the plot. I find myself wishing the OASIS was real. If any potential games developers are reading this, that is your next project :)
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite games hands down. Great gameplay, wonderful graphics, and awesome  music. I would definitely recommend this game to a friend. Levels get progressively harder, with new challenges. I love this game!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A heartbreaking story but there were times I would have to put the put my Indonesian I was laughing to hard. Colleen is an amazing author who is witty and will have you clinging to every word. I enjoyed this book through the love, hate, humor,  hurt, and passion.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|My 6 yr old played and I helped her get points we had 35 pets and 50000 in coins and for some reason it reset the game.  Not happy and after for some reason it keeps resetting its self so I took it off my kindle.  Other than that we liked the game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|You can't really experience any computer device without playing solitare. The ads are not bothersome to me. I love it!!!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a really good book that I sped through because I couldn't put it down. Now it's over and I find myself still thinking about Harold and some of the insights he offered. I kind of miss him!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The characters were great. The ending could have been a little longer. I recommend it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|After looking at several apps for monitoring battery usage, I decided to buy this one and was very glad I did. It does exactly what I want it to, no more or less and buying it leaves out any ads that might pop up. The graphics are elegant and the monitoring is very precise. It's perfect for my Kindle Fire HD. Buy this app, support this programmer - you won't be disappointed.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I absolutely love these books, the fast and easy read I'm all about and I would love to read more.  My only complaint is the price.  They should really make them cheaper;the price they have right now is ridiculous and because of it I'm not buying the other books in the series even though I want to so so bad.  All in all its an amazing book and I think every one should read it and anyone will love it.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Great set of movies. Comes in cheesy cardboard packaging, that's the only reason for the lower rating. Overall great product.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Both my husband and I love this app.  You save numerous locations and check on them as often as you'd like.  As an example, we like to look at the upcoming temperatures for the Iditarod in Alaska.  We have several of the town's available at any time.  We can also check on our family members home town's.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Christian Grey for President! haha. No seriously, amazing book. I love following the characters stories and wish the series would continue.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the series! I just couldn't take my eyes off of it! I would recommend this book to anybody that likes action and the law !
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Christian Grey for President! haha. No seriously, amazing book. I love following the characters stories and wish the series would continue.
630542845X|5.0|I am happy to have it in my collection.  It arrived in excellent condition and I am very happy with the DVD.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Christian Grey for President! haha. No seriously, amazing book. I love following the characters stories and wish the series would continue.
B008IZYWXU|4.0|The DVD set arrived in good order and I am happy to have it in my classical DVD collection.  I am very happy with it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is one of the finest biographical books I've ever read, bringing history to life in a way I've never encountered.  Stirring reading and amazing insights into the time and people.  Unlike so many historical biographies, it reads like a novel, partly because it provides insights into the lives of all the players, not just Lincoln.  So the breadth of the information is complete and wholly engaging.  Don't want to put it down and can't wait to pick it up again.  Haven't even reached the part from which the movie's taken, but I'll want to see the movie (which was also amazing) again after I finish the book.  Doris Kearns Goodwin is a genius!
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I love Alice Munro, I don't know if it is because she writes about the farm life in the far north (I was raised in northern Michigan and spent a lot of time with horses and on farms) or if it's the simple, straight-forward, unpretentious prose that is her hallmark. But she is one of my favorite authors.
B0058VW36U|5.0|They just love it my kindle now is my entertainment for them when the come over an it keeps them happy for hours.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is fun and I actually got it for free so it's worth every non-penny I paid. That said, since others reading this review would presumably be paying for it I gave it a four star rating. It gets a lot of credit for polish and putting a goals-based twist on the Bejeweled model. That said it doesn't do a whole lot that's new necessarily and I've found it pretty easy so far.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As always I enjoy all of Sparks books and movies.  Looking forward to seeing this one when it is released.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the various games are easy and difficult at the same time. fun to try to unlock each game in order.
B00440CX9I|5.0|This is my all time favorite move to watch during Christmas. I love it. I love this set also. It comes with a colored version and a black and white version. I thought both versions would be on one disc, but there were two discs. I liked that feature. I'm used to seeing it in black and white but watched it in color and liked it just as much. I was able to share this movie with my daughter this year and she loved it too! This is definitely a must have for every holiday.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|love the series and my family has been able to enjoy these books all in their own time.  Great series!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put it down, had to finish it ASAP to get #3 and see how it all ends. A definate good buy.
B004X4R49Y|3.0|I enjoyed this for the dramatized history that it is. The pacing was good,  the acting was great and the story interesting. However, I felt that it ended a little too soon. I would have liked to know more about what happened over the next year or so.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am new to Kindle and starting to become a reader again now that I am retired.  Found this engaging and exciting.  Enjoyed second and third book of this series on my kindle.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The Navy Seals are the best of the best.  It is hard to believe that men step up to the plate to serve at this extreme level of endurance, skill and commitment.  This is a great true story of very brave men serving our Country in the most dangerous of places.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|This set arrived promptly and there were no scratches on the disc(s) and voice quality was great. We enjoyed it
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is the search engine that I like the best. I have tried others, but I always go back to Google. Try Google and you will see that what I say is true.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This was one of the top things on an 8 year old's Santa letter. He absolutely loves it. The adults do too!
B007N8RULO|5.0|If you enjoy playing solitary then try this one. This is really fun and I am sure you will enjoy it too.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The Case is Lightweight yet durable material that feels good when holding. Easy to install and remove when not needed.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|If you have always wanted to learn to play the piano, try this and maybe we can learn to play together.
B007712XAU|5.0|Great stuff! Great plots and realistic characters.  Pulls you in like a classic novel. You will feel so many emotions as you go from up stairs to downstars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!! This mantra will have to suffice until I can gather up my soul and try to write a proper review for this AMAZING book. Six days later and I still have a well of feelings flowing through me over this marvelous book and I still don't have properly adequate words. I think I'm going to have to settle for my initial words. LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!! If you want to fall deeply in LOVE then come and experience Hopeless.
B005LAII62|5.0|Thank you. Unusual plot twists and nice character development.  Very nice movie like animation.  We had a lot of fun watching it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock ever; a brilliant program worthy of any Holmes fan's attention. Set in modern London this BBC masterpiece incorporates current technology against a more servant Holmes and his worthy associate Dr. Watson. I am a fan of most Sherlock Holmes programs and serials - this is by far the finest depiction to date.
B008FDP7AW|5.0|VERY GOOD CD, ALL THE WAY THROUGH, HOPE TO HERE SOME OF THIS ON THE RADIO, ITS THE BEST FROM THEM IN YEARS
0062127241|5.0|Unlike the Keith Richards autobiography; which is murky and clear based upon Richards review of other biographies, Townshend takes the reader/ fan into very personal remberances with the level of articulation that we have come to expect from one of Rock Music's great thinkers. More than a mere collection of memories, Townshend is seemingly writing a very long letter to fans, exposing his insecurities and sharing his embarrasments and discussing his private life. At the closure of the book you feel as though you understand him better and that you have once-again connected with a old friend whom you better understand and enjoy all the more. Well done!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am a habitual rating reviewer before trying apps. Since I was paying a whole $1 I had to really read the reviews. Anyway all of the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews were spot on for this little puzzle game. Perfect to play a few minutes during down time and well worth a buck. Yes the music really is relaxing. Really nice bonus feature imho.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is an excellent book. Read it. I really don't need to say anything else but Kindle needed more words. Read it.
B004HO6I2E|4.0|Even though it's all been done before so to speak it was the r version, but they just played it up so well.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I had never played before and just wanted to give it a try.  Easy to play and slightly addictive.  Fun!
B00101ZOTA|5.0|A great movie that truly showcases Kevin Spacey's amazing skills as an actor!  Great movie that gets better each time you watch it!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This is a great UNO game with lots of play options and custom rule settings.  It's easily worth the 99 cents.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|As usual with Preston and Child and their Pendergast series, this one has a theme of some very weird stuff that will both make you say \\"come on man, really?\\"; yet still keep you hooked until the end.  In this one, you do get to see Pendergast in a very vulnerable state and learn more about his history, that of others, and reveal some secrets.  Without revealing it, there is a twist in this story that will surely ensure more Pendergast in the future.  If you're a fan, you will like this book; if not, then not so sure.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Wonderful series, now I'm hooked on watching the rest of the shows that will be upcoming.  Loved every minute, a little hard to understand the accents at first.
1465001123|5.0|The photography on this calendar is great. Lots of great poses and black and white artistry. Taylor, as always, is beautiful.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Why spend more on a camera brand name bag? Fits all our cameras - 2 DSLRs with 3 additional lenses, 2 Small digitals, and a digital camcorder.
B004EPZ07K|2.0|Surprisingly bad. I think this may be the first time I've given only two stars on anything. I couldn't even make it through the whole thing, although I tried. This was all over the place. A Green Lantern movie was a good idea, but I'm not sure what went wrong here. Although I couldn't give the movie a good review, I was  pleased with packaging and quick delivery of this product and give five stars for that.
B003Y5H5F6|3.0|I thought this movie had great action from start to finish (not to mention great sound and special effects), the only problem was the finish came way too quickly. An hour and 18 minutes is too short in my opinion, even for action movies
B00ACB9Z3U|5.0|I really liked the prior season's of the Big BangTheory and this one has lived up to the rest. Adding more characters was a good idea along the way. The individuals they chose fit right in and each add their own tone to the show.
B008Y5OWSO|5.0|Beautiful movie, music and scenery second to none!  May be long but worth the visit to see spectacular scenes of the northern Rockies.  An interesting look at early emigrants experience of western expansion.
B00337KM2S|3.0|I really like George Clooney and he gives a fabulous performance.  This is not a &#34;feel good&#34; movie but it's well acted.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I try not to spend too much time on Facebook, it can be addicting.  But used correctly it is a wonderful tool for communicating with the world.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a family favorite!  Steve Carell is just SO funny in this film.  It's truly worth owning.  We've watched it at least a dozen times and it just keeps getting funnier :-)  Great family night flick!
B004LUS390|1.0|the latest update really messed it up. I bought it because I like to sketch, but I usually am out of paper or pencils. it says I paid, but I can't download the app.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|This is a such a great film!  It's clean, intelligent and wonderfully acted.  I highly recommend this movie and it should be a part of any collection.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|I've only recently gotten interested in Taylor Swift's music over the past year or so. I really love this album, certainly different and more &#34;poppy&#34; than her other albums, but I am enjoying it none-the-less. It's not so different that fans of her other albums won't like it, but rather it's just different enough to pull in some new fans for her (which is, I'm sure, part of her plan).
B00000IIXH|3.0|I usually love all springsteen music but was not exactly thrilled with this CD. I do occasionally listen to it but not like the others.
B00984668E|5.0|This album is awesome--Cloak of Feathers and Apocryphon stand out but a lot of other bad ass tunes on this one!!
B007SUW24W|4.0|This was ordered for my daughter for a gift. She was excited to get it and has not complained about it, so I guess she likes it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game for kids and adults. My 3 yr old loves to play it. it's not like other games that once you run out of tokens you have to buy them. With this game the more times that falls the more u get to play with.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was an excellent read!  The emotions portrayed by Marcus Lutrell was definitely heartfelt...God bless our military and God bless the USA!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My wife and I were looking around the instant video store on our Roku when we saw Pitch Perfect. We tried to watch a preview of it, but while not really paying the most attention ended up buying it for full price instead. Ended up not being a bad move either, as the movie far exceeded our expectations. It is funny and well written, the acting is good, and the singing sounds pretty well done. It is easy to make the comparison between this and Glee given its current but fading popularity. And I can say if you are a fan of that show, this may not be what you are looking for. The tone of this movie is more adult, but that is not to say I would not let kids watch it. This just seems more like the real world, and more believable. I preferred the music as well, as it did not sound anywhere near as altered.<br /><br />As for the movies story, it was serviceable but nothing spectacular. The aspect of the movie that really shined was the comedy and simply watching everybody interact with each other. The different characters really played off of each other well. Fat Amy was a favorite, but even the smaller characters in the group had there own moments. As a \\"Workaholics\\" fan I was thrilled that Adam DeVine was in the movie. He played a similar role to what I was used to, and did not sound to bad in the musical numbers.<br /><br />In the end this was just a fun movie. It has a okay story, good humor, and interesting and enjoyable characters. I would suggest this movie to anybody who likes musicals, or comedies in general.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I usually have a hard time putting a good thriller down.  Not the case with this book.  I actually made myself finish this book and toward the end, it did get better.  It was a little slow for me and not what I expected after reading the intro before purchasing it.  Just an okay read in my opinion.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I love her series.  The author has a great sense of wit and amazing creativity.  Please keep more titles coming.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I  think that this book is AWESOME! Hope you like it because I do. Please<br />Like it . This is the best
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was w wonderful. It held my attention and I didn't want it to end great book and going to read the next one.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I loved the original Men In Black but had not been as enamored of MIB2. This time around, however, they got it right again. Did Josh Brolin learn Tommy Lee Jones' voice, or did they do a voice over. Either way it was terrific as a followup/prologue to MIB. Aliens and all!
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|Got my bluray set about 2 weeks ago and have been watching them since then.  Picture quality is amazing, love the new effects(the old ones can be easily switched to).<br /><br />Also must mention that I like that they come in slimline plastic cases(with cardboard slip covers) that take up less than 1/2 of the space of the old fancy dvd cases .  The fancy dvd cases were cool, but I don't buy the sets for the case and its behind a closed door anyways so its not like its on display.  This saves me a lot of space in my shelving unit.<br /><br />The big thing missing still is the play all option that seems to be on every on TV box-set.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|My husband discovered this musician thru a movie of his life and really liked his music.  He loves all the songs on it.
1932735410|5.0|This book is excellent. I used it as my primary source for the PMP test. I read the PMBOK to make sure that there weren't any gaps and there wasn't. I highly recommend this book.
B008TRUDAS|2.0|This book came highly recommended from a friend, but I didn't get what was so special about it.  I thought the whole book was predictable and cliche.  I couldn't wait to just finish this book (even though I already knew how it would end).
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My children love reading their &#34;books&#34; on their Nabi. Works wonderfully and my girls are happy to take their &#34;books&#34; with them every where.
B00942S4OY|5.0|This was a gift for granddaughter who really likes this group.  She really enjoyed it and was thrilled to get it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoyed so much finished in one sitting.canNOT wait to start book three. ANa has some serious thinking to do before the big day
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Great book that will change the way you think about baseball. All  the things that you thought never mattered do.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|We love it, it's great .... arrived on time and exactly as decribed... great shopping experience.... will order more.... thanks
B004LROUNG|4.0|Typical Grisham entertainment.  Always enjoy his lots and twists and his development of characters and story lines.  Another page turner from Grisham as usual.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it and can pick from so many versions, have it read to you by most and set up different reading plans.  Highly recommend.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I know now why they call it angry birds... It makes me so angry when I can't beat a level. I am obsessed with this app and so is my husband.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This movie is shot in the Sahara desert. The scope and breadth of the cinematography is incomparable with any other movie. It is real not digital. This is  based on a true story of a heroic historical figure a desert loving Englishman played by a peerless actor a Peter O'toole and directed by an equally peerless director David Lean. A young Lieutenant single handedly unites previously warring Arab tribes to defeat the Turks only to die in a motorcycle accident after returning to England as a Colonel. Omar Sharif is in this movie who you may remember from Doctor Zhivago.I like the way the Arab's take this fair haired light skinned young man in as one of their own and allow him to lead them to vast and bold war time successes.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|I've read Dave Mustaine's book as well as Slash's, and this book far surpasses theirs. Much more shocking, blasphemous, and philosophical. Manson cleared up common rumors and misconceptions which was great because now we all know the truth. The only complaint I have is that it was written way too early in his career, having only released 2 studio albums and 1 EP. I wish he would have held back so we could have read the behind-the-scenes of Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood. Other than that, great book, thoroughly informative and interesting.
B000002AGN|5.0|Nice to just sit back and relax. A timeless masterpiece. Not to much into Jazz, but would encourage anyone to give this a try.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Just found another reason to keep my Kindle around all the time.  This app has:<br />-intuitive functions which makes it easy to use<br />-a sleep timer<br />-weather<br /><br />Thanks for an attractive and useful free app.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|it is a great movie.  Great action, great scenes, awesome.  Will watch it again and againa and again, and again....
B003O86FMW|4.0|Quick read, very much enjoyed this book just as much as the first. Bring on the Mocking Jay. Thumbs up.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|My sister loves this movie and I was relieved that the item showed up in a timely enough fashion that she could receive it for Christmas.  Awesome.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Julian Fellowes has taken a place in my estimation next to Jane Austen.  All of the characters, whether staff or family, are genuine individuals with touchingly human trials and aspirations.  And the TV production and acting are absolutely spot on.  It is so refreshing to watch a contemporary cinematic production of this stature that omits the bathroom humor and invasion-of-intimacy sex-act displays that seem to be ubiquitously obligatory.  Perhaps that is, in part, why DOWNTON ABBEY has achieved such stature.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Could not put the book down. It was like meeting my old friends again. You will feel every emotion while reading this. It awakens you. I can't wait until the third book comes out.
B002C949AE|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  It is a quick read because you can't put it down.  Easy to read and honest.<br />Nga mihi ki a Waris
B00999DFP0|5.0|i was so excited when i got my 5 seasons of the big bang theory.  i watched them all very quickly and can't get enough of it.
1451648537|4.0|It was a gift that was shared with many. Great insight into one of the finest minds of our lifetime.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|My mom loves this movie, so I thought I surprise her with an early Christmas present.  She was very happy to see it again.
0525952926|5.0|Only Ken Follett can describe a battle and make me want more. Character development is, as usual, fantastic. I cn't wait for the final installment!
0061801313|5.0|It's a pretty good box set for those who want to complete the series,the books are great,the story is awesome,Sara Shepard is an excellent writter. Sorry my english,tough,i am brazilian.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|works wonderfully on the kindle fire... great for any pirate or lego / playmobil lover. i personally am both and i enjoy sim(ulation) games so this was right up my alley. very well thought out and activities dont take too long to wait for workers to complete (forcing you to use your precious gems) its quick and easy to learn ... try it out :)
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I have been waiting for the seasons to come out on cable but I'm glad I have an inexpensive way of ordering them now.  Thanks Amazon.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This is a great family movie with a great message and the kids loved it. You can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss!
B006H5120E|5.0|I know its a 3 hour film, but time flies when I'm watching it. It looks great  on blue-ray. I don't have a 3D TV so I'm unable to rate that version.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This is far from the best MIB movie. It was just good enough to keep me awake. Be glade you did not go to the movies to watch it as it would piss me off. Other than that it was OK.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My daughter was playing this game on my sister's ipad, and I was most intrigued. So I had to purchase it! Really Fun!
1609611543|5.0|This book is a great read. Anyone that has any type of undiagnosed condition needs to read this book. Very informative.
0316069434|5.0|I have read every Michael Connelly book, and they just get better and better. Harry Bosch is my favorite, and I can see and feel his actions in Connelly's books. My only problem is that Connelly doesn't write these books fast enough. I'm already waiting for the next one.
B00004TH83|5.0|Nobody can deny, Lara has a great voice and her talent cannot be discussed. Please listen especially  &#34;I am who I am&#34; which kills me..
B007THA4FI|3.0|The story line kept my interest.  I thought the characters were interesting but I didn't like the end. I cried.  just a little.  I wish that Fat Dude would have died instead!
B0087ZG7HK|4.0|I didn't get the code to download the digital copy. The dvd works really well and its great!! Was there supposed to be a code to download the digital copy?
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved it!! Couldn't put it down! It kept you sucked in til the end. Now I need the next one!! Definitely a must get.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This was my first game on my new Kindle Fire.  It was fun and easy to play for a beginner.
0525952926|5.0|A very good story teller.  I was disappointed when I finished the book because I had finished it.  Definitely want the third book
B007HACDLK|5.0|my broyher gave me one book of Vince Flynn's and I was hooked ! I went and bought every book he'd written and now can hardly wait for his newest one.<br />The draw of course is the character Mitch Rapp, whose escapades are so tension filled you just can't help reading faster to find out how he's going to get out of situations that you're practically biting your nails off.<br />I've never read espionage or covert operations better than Robert Ludlum especially in his prime. But Vince is my go to now and I like familiar characters appearing in each book . That is also part of the draw and the fact that he is aging them over time as well. I hope Vince carries on like Ludlum did for many, many years to come.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This movie collection is a great find and it is wonderful watching all the batman movies in high definition. I love it and will recommend this set to anyone who enjoys the batman movies!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game it's better than the farm games...there are more aspects to it and more interaction with characters.
B00770KR7W|5.0|This was a awesome action figure and is a great deal. The Chief is greatly put together and very detailed. So for anyone debating to buy this I recommend that you do, you won't regret it.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I have always loved this book. It is real, it is honest, frank and completely removed of any fairy tale bs. I will reread this over, and over again. It is a chilling, dark and horrifying tale of an alcoholic, a drug addict, and a criminal and I completely adore James Frey for sharing these beautiful words with the world.
B007IGRV6U|5.0|I got this for my almost 2yr old because he played with it in a toy store for 20 minutes. He loves it. We put it on a train table at his height so its easy to play with. The only thing is I recommend the clips you can buy seperately to keep the tracks toghether. because it is for 3yrs and up he would pull the tracks appart and then be upset it wasn't toghether anymore. The tracks can come appart easily since they are wooden and fit together like a puzzle. Its much nicer than any other train set we looked at.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|It wasn't as- good-as the1st. MIB,but Much better than the 2nd. It was a fun see, especially since it wasn't all about Will Smith this time. Love that Tommy Lee Jones, & Josh Brolin was a Great young K.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Great initial concept muddied up by another great (STAND-ALONE) concept. Wish the writer/director would have picked one and gone with it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|How can this movie be anything but 5 stars.  With the breathtaking scenery, the classic songs and dancing, and the classic entertainment without the trash,  there is nothing but a win here.  Enjoy this movie with the family.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is aca-awesome!!!  And the comic relief is unbeatable.  I have watched it five times since the rental and it gets better every time.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|This movie is a whimsical tale of the importance of being responsible for the world around us.  It highlights how important trees are to our environment and how corporate greed can derail our responsibilities.  While this is a fun movie and my grand daughter loves it (7 years old), it does get a bit preachy for those of you who are turned off by the &#34;yeah environment--boo capitalism&#34; message.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Extremely well built this game is the best  G5  map so far. It is worth the money ( full version). This is a must get game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished this book and I can't form the exact words I want to say about this book. I will give it my best effort.....<br /><br />Amazing, awesome, heartbreaking, thrilling, sensual, funny, witty, steamy... and the list could go on and on.<br /><br />I started this book and I could not put it down. I had to keep reading, I just needed to know a little more about Holder and Sky.<br /><br />Now I sit here. I've finished the book and I want more. It just can't be over, I want more Sky and Holder!<br /><br />Colleen Hoover has a storytelling ability that captures your attention and keeps you intrigued and hanging on her words. The story line was wonderful and new. I found myself holding my breath while reading some parts. It was just the right amount of steamy and serious.<br /><br />This book is a definite must read, and will be placed among my favorites.<br /><br />Way to go Colleen!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 1 and 3 year old love the movie. My husband loves the movie and I love the movie. It's a great rendition of the timeless classic. My children choose this movie over every movie in their collection. They have literally played the DVD so much that it now skips during their favorite song. All of the musical numbers are great!
B005EVE8WG|5.0|If ever there was the epitome of catchy, this album is it.  The comparisons to Toto are inevitable and may take away from the album's own merits, but they are unavoidable.  I listened to &#34;Emelie&#34; about 12 times in a row before I realized it was on repeat; that's how much staying power this album has.
0762434279|1.0|It looks like a book for baby dolls. I purchased it for my stepson but it was hard for him to take seriously due to the size of the book.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|I wanted to try this pinball game because it has been a while since I've actually played .  It's a good way to spend a little time. It helped pass some time but was little disappointed with graphics. But if your  looking for something to pass some time it was good.
B008LSVLVA|5.0|Don't miss out on this one, Steven Wilson and company at their best, a must have for anyone familar with Mr. Wilson's varied background.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|Saw it on TV.  Bought the disc.  Viewed it twice.  Best movie Crowe ever made.  Neat twist on the old Robin Hood plot
0062127241|5.0|A definite read for any WHO fans or just rock fans in general - Buy It you won't regret it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the whole trilogy - but a scary concept.  Not a future I want to look towards.  It's hard to remember Katniss is only 16years old.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|I am sorry, I normally like stuff from Seth, this one is crap.  It was a slow going movie, boring and the jokes are lame.
0345525558|1.0|Have no idea how anyone could give this insipid book more than one star.  Plot line was improbable to say the least.  The characters were all stereotypes, and the story really made no sense.  A complete waste of my time and money.
B0027MJU00|4.0|The book was great, it was very dark though in that of the descriptions of the murder scenes. Very good though!
B0052GACNM|5.0|Saw the Duets II performance on PBS and enjoyed the show so much that I ordered the CD for myself and 3 other people.  All the songs are great except for the one with Aretha Franklin. She is a fabulous singer but the song didn't suit her voice.  Loved Lady Gaga, k.d. Lang and Queen Latifah.
B0053O89RY|5.0|My daughter loves, loves, loves this show.  She spent a whole weekend watching all 3 seasons and can tell you about them all.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|This game was picked for my grandsons.  I have three of them and they all love to play it. It was one of those games that you can get for free and that is how I picked it up.  I like the free ones to try and if the kids like it then I will spend the money for the whole game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i love rick riordan i read all his books this i a amazing story full of action mytholghy humor its amazing i cant remember reading a book this good i love you rick riordan
B006LSZECO|4.0|entertaining<br />captures the reader<br />unexpected twists<br />unexpected elements:<br />suspense, murder, romance, humor, philosophy<br />i recommend reading this book.<br />overall rating: 8.5
B000JQUKKU|4.0|Who doesn’t love a classic? This was great. I read it to my niece and nephew. They loved it too.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I just started playing this game yesterday. It has nice graphics and so far no problems. It's challenging and fun.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This is a great introduction to BDSM books. If you have never read anything like this before, great way to start. If you have read allot of BDSM books, you might not like it as much. There are allot of errors in the story while Christian and Anna \\"play\\" that wouldn't really happen in the real BDSM world. Good way to wrap up the series thou.
B007SGM084|4.0|This was a fun read, I found myself not wanting to put it down! Definitely recommend all three books and they get better as you go.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I couldn't get enough of this book. The love scenes were AWESOME and tastefully done. I can't wait for the follow up. Keep it coming Ms. Day!
B00000K29E|5.0|Here is Big Brother and the Holding Company WITH Janis Joplin, not yet famous, playing more for the joy than the Benjamins.  The studio was used to recording jazz musicians and kept asking the band to turn down their sound, which is humorous now but then it caused the group to produce a record with a very clean sound.  Janis was not half-drunk, the band was not self-important, the musicians were actually darned good so this album is indeed a gem.  You can hear various influences in their style, a tiny bit of Jefferson Airplane, some folk, lots of blues included in the rocking recording.  I think BBHC deserves some credit for being a band worthy of respect and not simply the guys playing behind Janis.  Here is the group before fame and fortune and all the dangers thereof had come to them.  I love it!  Who would have thought that the first of their albums would be recorded far from The City in Chicago??! Yet if you think of it, since Chicago is a blues haven, it is apropos.  Five stars!
B005N0PJJO|3.0|This is a great introduction to BDSM books. If you have never read anything like this before, great way to start. If you have read allot of BDSM books, you might not like it as much.

0452289963|4.0|Love the book, but I am glad I watched his classes on Oprah.com first; which made it easier to understand... I notices changes in the way I look at self, people and life in general. Truly awakening experience.
B0052U59F4|4.0|I loved this book. I actually downloaded the first book by mistake before it went completely crazy and blew up into mommy porn. It was funny because at first I didn’t want anyone to know that I read it. And now, I am proud to know that I did before it went crazy.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking Up Married is a sweet love story slowly unfolding. The couple both learn about their conflicting feelings towards love.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|game has a good storyline! !!! nice graphics... interesting puzzles to solve. I enjoy G5 entertainment games keep up the great work! !!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I liked the pace of this book and had trouble putting it down. Larsson does a good job of involving many characters without confusing the reader.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books ever! Loved the story line, the characters, the emotion it brings out, and the unpredictability . Colleen Hoover is an amazing author!!! I will recommend this book to everyone I know.
1250007305|5.0|Zero day was an exceptional novel. I listened to the audiobook via Audible.com, and found it to be gripping, romantic, and exhilarating. The insight into government corruption, public sector warfare, and international intelligence systems brought real life fears into existence through Russinovich's incredible story telling. I highly recommend this book for anyone in the InfoSec community, as well as anyone looking for a thriller.
B008L40Q7E|4.0|Great mindless fun, but with some surprising insights into human nature. I've now read all the Bond books, and this is a keeper.
1250010489|5.0|Picking up right where Zero Day left off, Jeff Aiken saves the day. In a very controversial yet realistic scenario, Aiken finds himself in the middle of an international scandal defending his country against the union of China and Iran. This scenario, in conjunction with current events reported around the world, seems more like a premonition than a work of fiction. As with Zero day, I urge any InfoSec community members to read this book.
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|Love the one liners in this movie. A classic feel good film. Good guys win. I can watch it again and again.
B001DF68MA|5.0|We bought this for our son when he was 15 months, we first got one that sits on the back but he would have to turn his head to the sides to be able to see out or he would be starring onto his dads back(no fun in that!) so we purchased this one and it been one of the best investments we made! With my son sitting in the front its easier to hand him water and snacks as we ride and interact with him as we ride. After  four months of use it is still great and our son loves it!!<br /><br />On installation, it took my husband about 20 min to install.
B003NTEX9E|5.0|One of my favorite mood Lps ...tempo and feeling stays the same throughout...great for background at a dinner party or at a low volume for romance...David Sylvian just croons at you..one of my all time favorites
B006964E8S|5.0|Excellent book, full of action, story line great, just wanted to read and read,now my teenage daughter is reading it, she is loving it as well.Recommended
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The Original was better. Need to read the book. Need to get rid of the word requirement to have rating register.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game can get fun and addicting but once you play it too much the adds start to take over. whenever I try to continue a game an add pops up and my kindle freezes so I have to force close the game. Either way I'll play the game though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love it, one if the best trilogy I have ever read. Can't wait for the movies, but I know they will not do it justice.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I guess the producers wanted an arts-fartsy movie but this bordered on child pornography. It could have easily been a fun movie about children's antics such as Christmas Story, but instead acted out on ADD and other problems we would love to escape from. Not a prude, though I have standards--truth is I was in the middle of the &#34;business&#34; when I lived in S. Cal so I know of what I speak.<br /><br />Stay away from this and especially keep your children away from it.
B001LM1456|3.0|Pure fun and all action, as I expected. =)<br />I enjoyed the plot, the execution, and of course, &#34;Hulk smash!&#34;<br />If you want to brush up on your green &#34;Avengers&#34; hero, this is the best version of Hulk to see. =)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Is was very heartbreaking and somewhat traumatizing of what happened to hope when she was a little girl and  why and how she was &#34;adopted&#34; . Also when I first glaced at the title of the book I didn't understand the meaning behined it (other then that's the main character name , hope) but Then more into it I found the true meaning behined that name and made the title that much important. Also I wouldn't recommended this to anyone who is sensitive to rape or violence because this book defiantly ...... Includes it. But overall the i enjoyed almost everything about the book , the twist and secrets that hope finds about her life .......and not to forget the hottie name holder. Holder is the guy I want to marry when I grow up because he is definitely there for hope when she needs it and the heartbreaking situations that hope has to face , he is always there with her.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I really could do with a LOT less blood and cold murder, but I understand that all of that (hopefully) was for the purpose of portraying how desperate things were and how lawless the world had become.<br />The idea of the Loopers totally blew me away, and kept me engaged through the film, as well as the use of psychology to explain who would become &#34;The Rainmaker&#34; and all the end was heart-rending, but very good.<br />The heart of this movie is really good--see it! =)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app! I wish it came standard on the Fire!<br /><br />I love this application!  great job!<br /><br />Keep it up!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The ending was slightly disappointing, but not too bad. A lot of shooting, running/chasing and not as much &#34;thinking&#34; material, but I suppose that should be expected in a Bourne movie. =)<br />All in all, I enjoyed it, but would prefer to watch something like Inception, Looper, or Skyfall, for a little more character depth without losing the action/adventure.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|This is a fun game that any one can play.  Challenging but not difficult.  A good game<br />for children as well as grandmas.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Wow. just, wow. I gotta say, the power-house cast and the twists and turns of the plot were amazing. Brilliant. And the end left room for the individual's imagination--love it!<br />Definitely a must-see!

B0034DGPEU|4.0|I gave it 4 out of 5 stars solely on the ending. I would have like to see the loose ends tied up a little more. Overall,this book is excellent and would recommend highly anyone!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|arrived on time.  packaged well.  works well.  i am very satisfied.  i would recommend this  purchase to my friends ...
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I liked this book a lot better than the Slammed books.  Emotional, sad and yet sweet at the same time.  Sky and Holder had chemistry together and I liked their humor (especially the texted insults!).<br /><br />My only gripe is that I wish there was an epilogue.  I wanted to know a bit about how Sky and Holder got through everything.  But I DON\\"T want a sequel, not everything is meant to be a series!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This was a gift for my son-in-law, who is a &#34;Godfather&#34; fan.  He loves it and is adding it to his blu-ray collection.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I watched this with my grandson and I enjoyed it. (He was on the fourth time of watching it.) I would definitely recommend it.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I give this app 5 stars because... I love Chess ... and this app makes it convenient to play on my Android phone.<br /><br />It has 10 lvls of difficulty against the Computer. And can support 2 Player on the same device.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it does not have online play... and if I am wrong, please let me know!<br /><br />But it still deserves 5 stars for looking so darn good on my AMOLED screen :P
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Not only a riveting story but tremendous insight into the risks and difficulties experienced by those who keep us safe.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I like these books.  They are fast, fun and the concept is interesting.  Catching fire gets pretty close to teenage sappy but it never goes over the line.  This is a good series for a quick read that does not require you to think to much.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited away is definitely a classic, the story line is excellent, with a hint of a love story.<br />No matter if you are a child or a full adult this movie is wonderful to watch.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Great book. My daughter had to read it for language class. It was nice to be able to discuss with her.

B00006CXSS|4.0|This is an historical archive for us as my  father went through World War II and I wanted something to show my grandkids.
B009369Z8A|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE. MY DAUGHTERS TOOK ME TO SEE IT ON MY BIRTHDAY AND I COULDN'T WAIT TILL IT CAME OUT ON DVD. GIVEN THE FACT THAT I AM FROM VIRGINIA, I FELT A SPECIAL CONNECTION TO IT. THE ACTORS WERE GORGEOUS AND I LOVE JESSICA CHASTAIN. SHE IS MY NEW FAVORITE ACTRESS.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read this book 4 times. I have never done that before. All sex aside, it is a beautiful love story.
0452289963|1.0|I did not like this book at all. It was too heady and not an easy read. I dreaded having to do the obligatory reading it required of my waning intellect. It was too heavy for me.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I like this book all about it, i will give 5 stars to and ill recomend it to EVERYONE that like 1D...
B005LAIIQC|3.0|What do you do when the original director and actor of a successful franchise you're building backs out of the upcoming sequel that's already planned? It's really quite simple. You either replace the lead actor and continue on or you somehow shift the focus of the movie onto another character. How hard can it be to find a director to replace another when the series is already a guaranteed payday?<br /><br />Universal Pictures made good decisions all the way around with \\"The Bourne Legacy.\\" Instead of concentrating on the character of Jason Bourne, they altered the center of attention to other agents affected by the Blackbriar and Treadstone programs. Enter Aaron Cross, played by newly established action star Jeremy Renner (\\"Avengers\\").<br /><br />Instead of just replacing Paul Greengrass with some other random director, they chose to go with someone very familiar with the series. Tony Gilroy co-wrote all the other \\"Bourne\\" films and stepped in to helm and pen the latest entry. He did an acceptable job balancing these two enormous jobs.<br /><br />I love a great action movie. I also love a good spy thriller. It makes perfect sense that a movie like \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" would appeal to me. For the most part it did. However, somewhere along the line a feeling of tedium set in. It didn't stick with me throughout the film. It just came and went. Sometimes I think I've seen too many of these types of movies and the excitement has worn off.<br /><br />One thing I really enjoyed about the film was the sense of realism director Gilroy captured. He doesn't lean on a crutch of CGI like so many of these action films do these days. It reminds me of the newer James Bond films. When you see Daniel Craig and Jeremy Renner jump onto the ledge of a building or cliff and slam into it, you know it hurt. You don't look at the scene and go, \\"They used a miniature for that or digitally enhanced it.\\"<br /><br />The high-definition transfer of the film gives viewers a pristine picture and an engrossing audio experience. The clarity of the video doesn't compromise the gritty atmosphere the movie holds. The 7.1 surround sound will cause some home theater audiences to jump out of their seat frequently as explosions and gunfire ring out from different speakers.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" comes with some impressive bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by director / co-writer Tony Gilroy, co-writer Dan Gilroy, editor John Gilroy, second unit director Dan Bradley, director of photography Robert Elswit, and production designer Kevin Thompson.<br /><br />Five featurettes focus on everything from casting to shooting locations and working with real and animatronic wolves. They include \\"Re-Bourne,\\" \\"Capturing Chaos: The Motor Bike Chase,\\" \\"Enter Aaron Cross,\\" \\"Crossing Continents,\\" \\"Moving Targets,\\" and \\"Man vs. Wolf.\\" There are also three deleted scenes and an animated storyboard / footage reel titled \\"Wolf Sequence Test.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" Blu-ray will give action fans and enthusiasts of the franchise something to satisfy their need for a fresh kick of adrenaline. It does get bogged down at times with plot-pushing dialogue, but you can't really fault filmmakers for wanting to give the audience something with substance. Although it's a great outlet for people to see Jeremy Renner in a very physical action role again, I don't think this will be remembered as one of the better entries in the series either now or in the future.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is available in a Blu-ray Combo Pack with Ultraviolet, DVD and a digital copy right now.engrossing audio experience.

1594487154|5.0|Selling is  one business topic  ill-served when it comes to insightful books and authors. Leaving us frustrated with sales training methods stuck in yesteryears.<br /><br />If you want to read a thoughtful book on sales backed by insightful research, this is one. Thanks to Dan Pink for choosing the topic of sales, apply the common sense principles of social sciences and providing a fresh look at the process of a sale.<br /><br />The subtitle, `The Surprising Truth about Moving Others' is apt. The essence of selling is indeed moving others to action. The marketing around the book calls Pink's findings `counter-intuitive'. Though for those of us with sales responsibilities don't need to be sold on.<br /><br />The book is divided into 3 parts. Pink first establishes that Selling is the heart of every occupation. And that the rules of the game have changed in the last couple of decades .. the world of buyer beware has given way to a world where honesty, fairness and transparency is the only viable path for the seller.<br /><br />In Part Two, Pink dispels the traditional ABC's of selling (\\"Always be Closing\\") with an alternate set of qualities needed in a salesperson - Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity. Couldn't agree more.<br /><br />Part Two is how to `be' and Part Three outlines what to `do' - Pitch, Improvise and Serve.<br /><br />I found the first part a tad long ... felt Pink could have hurried through this.<br /><br />I found the second and third parts very insightful and actionable. The chapter on `Serve' is absolutely brilliant. Gets to the heart of what selling is .. selling is SERVING. If you have time for only one chapter, make it the one on `Serve'.<br /><br />Here's one of my favorite passages from the chapter. If this strikes a chord with you, you will like the book:<br /><br />\\"Among the things that distinguish our species from others is our combination of idealism ad artistry - our desire both to improve the world and to provide that world with something it didn't know it was missing. Moving others doesn't require that we neglect these nobler aspects of our nature. Today it demands that we embrace them. It begins and ends by remembering that to sell is human\\".it didn't know it was missing. Moving others doesn't require that we neglect these nobler aspects of our nature. Today it demands that we embrace them. It begins and ends by remembering that to sell is human\\".

B006YTTVHO|5.0|I love this book don't change a thing just make more books like this I love you so much thank you
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It is one that you get to solve puzzles and search for key objects. I liked that it allowed you to go forward and back in the different locations which would allow for you to revisit anything that you might want to refresh on. The only thing that I would change is to have it more interactive. Over all it was better than the other games that I have tried that were similar.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|I got an email from Amazon with new books.  This book seemed like something I would love to read.  That was until I saw the price for the Kindle version.  Really??? I thought the idea was for Kindle books to be a lot cheaper.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a challenge to read and hard to understand at first, but then I got it and the book seemed amazing and it really is
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|The first year set was exciting.  This year's set lost some of its charm, especially given the higher price.  I would recommend this for children under the age of 12.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not stop reading! Good detailed book! Can't wait to read the next one and then the very last one. It was better than the movie anyone who saw the movie should read the book!
B0053O89JM|5.0|This is a great show! I watch the reruns whenever I can between seasons.This item arrived quickly and in condition described.
B00AE2J93I|2.0|The animation is excellent, although there was no need to make most of the characters so ugly looking and grotesque. The plot is too silly and slim. It would have been fine on a short movie, but it is clear that it had to be stretched too much to fill a full-length feature (a common defect of too many movies). It is essentially a tale of the redemption of all the inhabitants of a small town. the problem is that their conversion from stupid and nasty to smart and nice is poorly done. It only happens in the last five minutes of the movie and it felt too rushed, forced and unbelievable. Most of the characters are too stereotypical, which is disappointing.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I love all of this director's movies! It was a classic Wes Anderson flick so I wasn't let down! I love the story and all the characters and the colorful scenery
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I loved him on American Idol.  I thought he should win.  In this album he takes it up several notches.  The mix of styles is unbelievable, and I think this is the first American Idol they didn't screw up on their first album.  It's ALL (or almost all) pure Phillip but even better than the one you heard on American Idol.  10/10 and a big 2 thumbs up for this album.  I'm going to go listen to it again now.
B005LAIISU|4.0|We watched this last night and really enjoyed it.  Not sure if our younger grandchildred would understand some of the movie, my husband and I thought it was great.
B008RNYNDM|1.0|I'm a huge fan of director Ken Russell's work.  His treatments of D.H. Lawrence in \\"Women in Love\\" and Aldous Huxley with \\"The Devils\\" are among the most visually powerful films released in the early 1970's  - a time when more accessible film technology, and clueless studio executives allowed a new generation of young film makers to stretch out.  These two films are \\"must sees\\" for any serious student of film-making, period.  Russell was a genius at bending the rules, pushing the limits and presenting \\"subversive\\" visuals in his films.  Who could forget Oliver Reed and Alan Bates in that homo erotic nude wrestling scene in front of a roaring fire or the horrific burning of Father Grandier (Reed again) in a surrealistic courtyard constructed of \\"coved\\" white tiles.<br />Sadly, Russell misses the mark with this film, especially by departing from casting superb actors and relying instead on pop stars in central roles.  With an amazing catalogue of movies about art & artists under his belt -  any of his low budget BBC-TV biographies are far superior to this- the inherent silliness of 70's rock culture just seems to have gotten the better of Russell.  Of course, there are plenty of startling visuals in Lisztomania, as well as numerous humorous \\"inside jokes\\" and references about pop culture - but, to me,  the film rings hollow. There is no passion or weight behind any of it.  The film is pure pop - a visually stunning precursor to the random disconnected imagery of MTV - complete with adoring groupies, arena-rock pyrotechnics.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Similar to Nelson Demille's style of writing for me.<br />Good character development, fast plot, exciting story line.<br />Easy reading! Great for the airplane!
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I head one song from this CD at the health club and it got my attention. Most of the stuff they play at the club is, well, let's just say not to my taste. The style of the song that got my attention was just on the hard side of classic rock. I came home, listened to the snippets of the other songs from the CD on Amazon, and bought it. After a few listenings, I found I like every song, and still love almost all of them weeks later (the rest I just like a lot). I plan to buy more Muse CDs for sure.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|works great with the D7000 and allows for extremely flexible flash techniques to bring out the desired results for quality photos.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|AVia media player plays several types of media with no problems, freezes occasionally and won't play many divx files.  Considering that it is free, not a bad app.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Outstanding writing and engaging storyline. I never write a review but, I can't put this series down. Money well spent.
B00632HWOG|4.0|It does what it should, nothing incredible or special but it is useful on the Kindle Fire.  Easier than using the browser.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|&#34;Couragious&#34;<br />An artistic representation of Jesus Christ as good as the movie. Everyone hould havse to watch this movie and stand up for our Lord and  Jesus Christ.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|Just a fun thinking game with some puzzle qualities, and occasional quick thinking needed.<br />The puzzles can usually be accomplished with relative ease, but getting the extra goo is the real challenge.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|This video is very entertaining and also has a very true ring to society and its effects on Nature. My six Year old Son fully understood the movie from beginning to End. I would highly recommend The Lorax !
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you want you kid to ever do homework again, this would be 1 star.<br />If you want a great game that's really addictive, and lots of fun, it's 5 stars.<br /><br />Minecraft has an incredible following, and you build anything with it.  The portable version is missing some items, but is still a great deal of fun when you don't have the full version around.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book is very entertaining just a junk novel about nothing to enjoy. The story setup was good because it kept you wondering what would happen next

B002UM5BXW|5.0|This is an amazing book as a soon to be culinary grad and a current line cook so much of this book rings absolutely true
B003MC5N28|5.0|I first read this book in elementary school. I liked it then. I read it a few more times in high school and liked it even more. I read it a few weeks ago on the heels of a Hunger Games-fueled young adult novel spree and The Giver is now officially in my Top Ten. Lowry paints a powerful picture of a society that seeks to control everything from the weather to feelings of attraction. No matter how many times I read it, I find myself holding my breath for Jonas as he unpacks the truth about his &#34;perfect&#34; society known as Sameness.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|At first I thought a book about a woman waking up married would be one in which the woman was a total ditz.  Instead the characters had a surprising amount of depth.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|The best thing about this movie, to me, was it was a superhero movie that I felt comfortable letting my (then) 10 year-old son watch with me.  That is not to say that the movie, from a comics fan standpoint, does not suffer from some serious technical flaws.  For instance, Volstagg was not \\"Vast\\", only a little chubby.  Hogun was Asian (and not particularly \\"Grim\\").  And, Heimdall was African American.  I never realized the Norsemen were such an ethnically mixed group.  Thankfully we never saw \\"Balder the Brave\\"...<br /><br />However, casting Tom Hiddleston for Loki was truly inspired (and even moreso in \\"The Avengers\\"!).  Perhaps they can get Jake Ryan of the University of Michigan Wolverines Football team for Thor in the sequel?  ;^)  Although, Chris Hemsworth did fine work.
B00000G3I2|4.0|An all star acting group.  Classic rock songs that were from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />I was born in 1976 and my parents were born during the baby boom era (currently divorced).  They both like this movie (my mom more so).  I like watching this movie too.  I just haven't seen the entire movie straight through.  I suppose that parts of this movie just drone on and on.  The storyline could've been quickened up a bit, but my mom hasn't complained.  My dad would tell you there's too much muchy emotions being talked about, but then he isn't good at speaking his own emotions either.<br /><br />The actors:  William Hurt, Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Jeff Goldblum, JoBeth Williams, Tom Berenger.  Now with this amount of big names, what could go wrong?<br /><br />The soundtrack:  Marvin Gaye, Three Dog Night, Aretha Franklin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Band, The Beach Boys, The Mamas And The Papas and more...  A lot of times I can tell what movie my mom is watching just by hearing the songs.  Just hearing these songs together, I can tell she's watching The Big Chill.  It's a good collection for this somber movie.<br /><br />Those of my generation... I would recommend seeing it once (I still need to see it straight through from beginning to end).  But if you're like me, seeing bits and pieces is good too.
B004G7UTXG|4.0|I have seem bits & parts of this movies over the years & decided to watch the whole thing.<br />It was a really good movie, but a little disturbing based on historical events.<br />Similar in ways to Mel Gibson's Apocalypto.<br /><br />Liam Neeson had a role in that movie.  We were all young once.
B00866JL96|5.0|The movie is wonderful, but the only trouble is that I do not have Blu Ray function on my DVD set.  I was forced to return it to the shipper and request a regular edition
0823015033|5.0|I want to start making dolls. So I checked Amazon and found this book. I like the idea of using Polymer clay because the end effect is so lifelike. This book covers tools and techniques for sculpting realistic figures. I would recommend it to any prospective doll maker.
0765322889|1.0|After reading the reviews on the Malazan series, I thought this would be great to pick up and would hopefully add a great, new fantasy series to my reading list. Wow, was I mistaken.<br /><br />This is a horribly written book. The characters have no internal consistency, the environments feel like an old movie set - you see facades but then realize they're just plywood stand-ups, and the dialog is bland in most places and downright cheesy in others. I wanted to like the book, but continuing to plow through it started to seem like a chore. By the time I was done, I was fantasizing about what method would be most suitable for its destruction. Tossing in the trash? Burning? Shredding?<br /><br />Each of the characters are empty sacks that the author animates with the latest plot device he's devised to advance an already questionable story-line. You never get the feeling that these are characters with their own lives, aspirations, and dreams. Some of them change direction (and sides) completely in the middle of the book without any believable reason for their about-face. The locations are no better, with barely enough detail tacked on to give a vague impression of what they look like, but not enough to create a vivid picture. A good author can get away with this by creating a compelling narrative that attracts the attention elsewhere, but Erickson's plot is so flimsy that it makes the poor descriptions stand out more. And I found myself frequently re-reading entire passages because I got to the end and couldn't parse what the author had been trying to communicate with his lousy prose and disjointed conversations.<br /><br />As a positive, I will say that Erickson has come up with some novel concepts - how magic works and the divine cosmology and its interaction with the world, in particular. But good ideas don't necessarily make a good story, and that is decidedly the case here, unfortunately. The thing that confounds me is how this book has gotten so many good reviews - I'd question my own tastes if there weren't so many other modern fantasy stories by authors that I respect that are widely well-regarded like George R.R. Martin, Joe Abercrombie, Tad Williams, and others.<br /><br />In short, if you like evenly-paced stories with believable characters in a well-defined world, don't buy this book.- I'd question my own tastes if there weren't so many other modern fantasy stories by authors that I respect that are widely well-regarded like George R.R.

B001EN71CW|5.0|This show is awesome. It's like a space western with a captain who is a hard ass softy. The only problem is there was only one season of it. The special features are pretty good, the best one is the cast interviews after it was cancelled.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|My son absolutely loved this Volkswagen T1 Camper Van.<br />He had a ball putting it together and it is very usable!<br />He LOVED IT!
B00008J2PG|5.0|I like true stories and how brave people are in dangerous situations especially on trying to help people against discrimination.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|I watch this movie every year..............<br />I have to say it is my favorite movie!!!!<br /><br />Packaged well and great in blue ray; still love the black and white version!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|i really enjoyed this book, i recomen it to persons that likes history but in a story contest. love it
B000002KE2|5.0|Great studio album from Sabbath in their prime! This has their original line up of Ozzy, Tony Iomi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward! I was dissappointed when they recently reformed without Bill Ward.
0143121006|5.0|Midnight in Peking is fascinating. An amazing story. In some ways it reminded me of a Chinese version of the book 'Shantaram'. I really felt like I was in the hutongs of Peking in the 1930's. And I didn't want to leave!<br />The author mentions this story is for Pamela Werner, and throughout his research, he wanted to learn more about 'the real Pamela Werner'. I found this story should be told just as much for her father, ETC Werner. He lived an astounding, accomplished and intriguing life. I found myself wanting to know more about his work and his remote postings before settling in Armour Factory Alley, Peking. It would be great to see a biography on ETC Werner by this author. Paul French writes well, a good balance with dialogue and narrative, his book is truly 'unputdownable'.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After just reading the little description I had a totally different idea of what this book was about. But I was pleasantly surprised with then real story. You will be staying up late to read this one! :)
0439023513|2.0|The book is well written and whatever else (although there is a fair bit of repetition in the story, and a lot of dragging passages, especially with the PTSD and whatever else), but my main gripe is with the author's so-called \\"message.\\" Whatever her political bent, the author paints a pretty grim and hopeless picture here, and a pretty apathetic one, since seemingly she believes that fighting back against oppression is always a mistake, as it will only leave an equally hopeless situation with equally authoritarian people in charge. If she offered any kind of alternate scenario or solution, I would be okay with that, but she, well...doesn't. To me, this smacks less of an 'anti-war' vibe as an anti-humanity one. According to her, we should just lie down and take it, I guess, because anything we try to do to improve things will only make things worse. I have to say, I'm glad I don't live in her world.
B0063GORYU|4.0|A great twist to solitare.  Recommend this game to people searching for something different. Fun and easy, my kids love it.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|so creative and talented. bought for myself and other cellists in my extended family.  daughter, also a cellist, has it on her ipod.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Highly recommend.  Love that there are updates, so you never get bored. Love that you pick such a variety of puzzles.  You can do animals, seasons, holidays, cities.  Highly recommend!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Well written story of lives that at first appear completely separate - only to discover they are intricately intertwined with a shared past.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love to play mahjong. It is challenging. Games do change. Like that you can change puzzles. Highly recommend this game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Before I read the book, I doubted that the author could possibly write an entire novel about an event that was over in a matter of hours and still keep the readers interest. Reading made me a believer, as I was glued to it from beginning to end.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This second season is just freaking AWESOME@! It is completely different from the first keeping me on my toes the whole time! Not being able to predict what is going to happen is just so nice!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another well done book by Nelson DeMille - good story line and the characters were well done - very good job!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A book which resonates as it embodies the angst of becoming an adult. Having said that, it is rather sad. Well worth reading.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Having had an experience similar to the one discribed in 'Dying to be me', ( not quiet as dramatic) I know this to be an authentic description of an actual experience, I congratulate Ms. Moorjani on writing a great inspirational book!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|If you haven't read the book then you'll be able to follow along with the movie.  However, I do feel that there was a wealth of background details in the book that didn't transfer to the screen.  It's not easy to fit a book into a two hour time window, but I will credit where credit is due and say that it turned out very well.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|The special effects were great, however, the story was a little disjointed.  If you have ever seen the original movie it makes it even harder to watch.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Item was exactly as described.  Arrived sooner than expected and was in original packaging.  Watched the Dark Knight Rises and the DVD was flawless.  When I first saw this price for a Trilogy, I immediately thought that something must be wrong.  No way could I puchase all three of the Dark movies for only 17.97, when Dark Knight Rises costs more than that on its own.  However, when it arrived, I was very happy with the purchase and was glad that I got two of them.  One for me and one for my brother.  Excellent price for this Trilogy and would make a great addition for any movie collector.  The comic book that came with it was nice as well.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was good! It kept my attention and had me on the edge of my seat excited to get to the next page. I'm not one to pick apart the Author.... I finished the book in 2 sittings and that says to me, I was enjoying my time spent with this book! I'm not disappointed! :)
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This was a birthday present for my brother.  The box was brand new and in original packaging.  The shipment was fast and accurate.  My brother loved the game and after playing it, I found that I like it as well.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it is the best I hope there is a second game because it is awesome I could play it forever
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book in the series! I am never disappointed by a Philippa Gregory book. Highly recommend!
B005LAIGTG|4.0|Okay, this is a chick flick.  Gotta just get that out of the way.  McAdams and Tatum have decent chemistry together and make this story believable.  This movie IS based on a true story - which makes you really think, if you lost your memory and ** number of years like that time never existed and the last thing you remembered was that you were dating/engaged to someone else, how it would make you and the people you love feel to basically leap back in time?<br /><br />I think they could have delved even more deeply into the story of this couple, but it is a movie and unfortunately there are time constraints and you can't always get everything you want!!<br /><br />All in all, good movie with good actors and makes you think... or if you just want entertainment you can watch it for that also even though it is sorta the normal 'romance' type story all in all.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|app is okay but could use the side walls a bit longer or more frequent. add a choice of music for background.
B007Z9QS5K|4.0|Okay, I have to admit the main reason I wanted this movie was because of one particular actress - Lea Michele.  I wanted to see how she would do on the 'big' screen besides the whole Glee thing.  Not a lot of the story was towards her but I was pleased with her acting ability.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye on that young woman to see how her career progresses since she's already hit it out of the park with an out of this world voice!!<br /><br />Anyway, on for the movie.  I liked it.  Was it a great movie?  No.  Was it entertaining?  Yes.  Was a lot of the 'plot' lines kinda far out?  Yes.  But take it for what it is - entertainment.  A pretty great group of actors with story-lines that crossed in small ways with each other through the movie.  What most everyone wants, a more or less 'happy ending' and a kiss on New Years Eve!!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Flipboard is truly awesome.  It has become my #1 news reader and is so simple to use.  Not only do I use it on my Kindle Fire but I also have installed it on my GS3 phone.  I highly recommend this app.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|Okay, if you've looked into getting this movie you have to realize this is sorta a big single finger flying in the sky from the 'hair bands' of the 80's towards everyone else!!  This takes all the twisted sex/drugs/rock and roll craziness that was the 80's and flaunts it out for everyone and says 'Yeah, we were drunk, drugged and screwing anything we could nail, but DArN it, WE HAD FUN!!'  If you're looking for mindless entertainment and enjoyed the 80's music - check it out.  If you don't like 80's hair band music and don't like laughing at/making fun of what life was like back then (yes, I graduated high school mid 80's), then go rent/buy/see something else.
B008BM9L72|1.0|The best thing about these books - is the amazing marketing. Who could have thought that marketing could push a rubbish book so high up the leader board........
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Okay, I don't know how many of you were/are familiar with the series American Gothic - but I'm SURE most of you are familiar with X-files at least to some degree.  Watching the first season of Haven had me scrambling for my American Gothic dvd's because here soon I plan on re-watching this series and seeing if I'm just imagining it kinda reminding me of that show or not - though American Gothic was DEFINITELY a darker series with more evil afoot...  and was WAY before it's time.  That's not to say that Haven won't visit deep into the darkness, it very well may.<br /><br />I guess I should try and figure out another series to cross with those two since Haven does have a lot more light hearted tone a good portion of the time than the cross-over I suggested, but my brain isn't really coming up with anything right now!<br /><br />If you like sci-fi/twisted paranormal shows like Fringe, Warehouse 13, X-Files etc...  Give this series a try, I honestly believe you will enjoy it!
B00755MHXG|5.0|Here is some perspective on the troubles that teenagers have to deal with . You thought you had problems?  Great read - super characterisations and wonderful insighful writing.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Does what it says, as far as the screen light is more of a glow but does a fine job of giving light.
B007TK77QE|2.0|Too many characters - hard to follow. Then a little predictable at the end.  Finished it - but it was a struggle.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Honestly took a while for me to get into the book but once I did I couldn't put it down. Once I finished it, I went back to page 1  to 're-read some  parts that didn't grab me in the beginning. I would recommend this book.
B004DM0UII|1.0|Downloaded to my RAZR Maxx HD. Seems to work but have other similar apps that are much better. Already uninstalled.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I chose 5 stars because it was a very intriguing story. I loved how the author brought two lives together and showed the differences as well as the likeness.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone that wants a better understanding of two cultures.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|You can't really go wrong with a Clint Eastwood movie. The only reason I didn't rate it a five star is I don't give movies that rating even if I really do like the movie.
B005HSL626|4.0|Grand kids love to play as they help in the kitchen. I would recommend this to all that need to keep active minds occupied.
0375507256|5.0|I thought the different narrative styles used by Mitchell provided the reader with perspectives that made story rich and deep.  Thought provoking.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I am enjoying the second season of American Horror Story as it goes along, but not quite as much as the first season. In this second season, I think the writers have packed in too much what with the Nazi theme and the Bloody Face theme. It seems to have lost a little of the subtly of the first season, in trying to do too much at one time. Still, the acting and writing are good again, and it is an entertaining show.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Very bad choice of senes in the movie. Very bad for older people to enjoy.<br />View tips and guidlel ines
B008QTV3X0|5.0|-Wow On the edge of your seat entertaining.  Watch first season in one day.  We did not want is to end.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|This one was weak. lots of jerking around the fight senes. This one was weak. lots of jerking around the fight senes.<br />View tips and guide lines
B009SIE6AA|4.0|Some tracks seems a bit out of place. I like this album enough to make it a part of my regular Christmas rotation. If you love JT this album will most likely please you.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|After all the hype recently from reviewers who were probably paid off by the studio, myself and my girlfriend went to see this in a theatre recently. Not only did my girlfriend fall asleep to this over-rated movie, but I had trouble staying awake. It was cliche ridden and it reminded me of Jessica Alba's excellent TV series Dark Angel from 2000, which is a much better choice of DVDs. Don't waste your time on this crap!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This movie is an excellent teaching tool for schools and/or families, for although it is a highly entertaining classic Broadway musical comedy, it also accurately portrays the importance of mastering the English language, and how that skill influences everyone around you.
0689853637|4.0|Someone bought this for my daughter and there was something wrong with the last page.  It is supposed to turn on lights when you pull a tab, but the lights wouldn't turn off when you put the tab back.  All the pop-ups are BEAUTIFUL and AMAZING.  We exchanged this item with ease on Amazon.  My Aunt, who bought it, somehow sent me a link with a return label that I printed out and sent the book back to Amazon.  They then sent me a link with a refund amount.  I then used the refund link as a gift card online and was able to get another one.  I am now awaiting the second book and hopefully the lights arn't faulty.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is one of the BEST movies ever made, with wonderful songs for everyone in your family to learn and sing along with.
B00001OH1S|5.0|CD was just as described.  I got this for my hubby b ecause he loves this movie.  He said that the sound track helped relax him on a stressful driving trip in the snow.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I love this show!<br /><br />I love the music!<br /><br />Yes, I also bought the album, so I could listen to the songs when I'm driving my pickup truck.<br /><br />It's a grrrr-REAT family movie, and I very highly recommend it!
B009CF3P7E|5.0|loved it so much I had to have it on my Kindle. Not much else to say, no need for more words
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The animated movie, \\"BRAVE\\", is an excellent family adventure for all the proud wee Scots (and those who WISH they were!).<br /><br />I very highly recommend this show for an evening of family fun.
B004X80HEE|5.0|PLEASe, beyond the fact that the film is beautifully amazing, the music is also amazing. the musical theme that plays throughout i've been searching for it for a while now with no luck. Does anyone know if there is a recording of the music available?
B005974CNA|4.0|not there best album because Mike Portnoy is not there anymore still is Dream Theater but without the best drumer
