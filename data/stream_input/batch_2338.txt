030759565X|5.0|Even if I never make a single dish, I am happy with this book. Deb Perelman puts so much attention to detail into every single dish I am just amazed. But she does it because she really wants it to be GOOD and she makes you feel like there's no reason why any of us can't cook like her.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you like the The Hunger Games you will like this one to. This book really keeps the suspense going.
B009L6UDUG|4.0|Mostly action.  Very little plot or dialogue.  What little dialogue or plot there is is stilted and unconvincing.  The Bondgirl is supposed to be an agent, too but Bond has to rescue her over and over.  Nice scenery.
B006POGWB6|5.0|I feel taken for the high cost of this 3D BLU-RAY movie. Tried to played it for the first time today and no luck! It was a Christmas gift and was past the return limit, but I'm calling AMAZON.<br /><br />  SEE MY ADDITION BELOW
B004N0I3U2|5.0|After License to Kill failed and the Bond series entered legal purgatory; it seemed possible that 007 might be forcibly retired not by bad guys but by poor box office receipts and squabbling lawyers.  Well, they sorted it all out and they finally got Pierce Brosnan, who they had been after forever. Here we have the 1st Bond flick for the pc 90s and its just about the best flick one could hope for. Brosnan does a fine job in his best Bond flick.  From here, he would only regress.  Sean Bean is one of the best villains in the series.  Basically, he is Bond's evil twin.  The action is awesome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love how the relationship between the characters develop in this book.  It is hard to put down one you get started!
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|A professional production.  Acting, script, sets, direction, and tone are excellent.  About as historically accurate as one can expect from Hollywood.  Spielberg is an entertainer, not a documentarian.  Take it w a grain of salt...then go read a book.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is the best TV has to offer in the way of compelling story telling.  Great acting and unbelievable cinematography!
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Not a fanboy so not obligated to love all things Middle Earth. Too long.  Repetitive.  Not enough material to justify 3 hours, much less 9.  Rides on the coattails of the LotR without earning it's keep.  Bloated blockbuster event spectacle.
B005LMEB8E|3.0|I like a couple of songs,but not all! I really wanted to give this a good listen to but some of the songs I felt she just seemed like it was her-
B009A87Z6U|3.0|Good:  Craig, Dench, action scenes, locations<br />Bad: silly, muddled plot taken too seriously, boring villains, camerawork<br /><br />A definite step back
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Ian McEwan is always good.  I found Sweet Tooth absorbing and multidimensional.  Was impressed by his ability to get inside the mind of a woman as he did.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Once again, this series is brought back from the dead.  New Bond.  New tone.  Less cheese.  Excellent action.  Actually has a plot.  Good balance of serious and silly.  reasonably intelligent for an action/ adventure.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game.  The graphics were pretty life like.  It is challenging, hints are very useful.  The story line is good.
1932735410|4.0|The book is good.  I have not sat for the PMP exam yet.  I'm re-reading it now.  time will tell.
B000UL61D4|5.0|the devil is perfect the actors are perfect the move master pice i love ANDRZEJ ZULAWSKI his style is different you never see the move like this in your life 5 star for me
B005K17RU0|1.0|Ever since the update, I don't like to use this app anymore!  It is hard to look things up and can't figure out how to delete cities after I look them up.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is SO much fun (for puzzle lovers, logical thinkers and literal minded people with a bent towards the unusual).  It is guaranteed to make an eight hour layover a joy.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Awesome musical history lesson and unexpectedly moving at times (Rick Springfield!).  Transfixed the entire time I was watching.  Highly recommended.
0061801313|5.0|came exactly as advertised. i love the show on abc family and wanted to know what really happened and see how the story line has/will change
0375869026|5.0|Amazing must read for adults and tweens- has really important life lessons and hard to put down- also lots of tears!
B003L77GH4|5.0|Or, as we know them on tv, Stefan, Damon, and Elena/Katherine.  I love the show, watch it every week.  I especially enjoyed Season 2 because we got to meet, and see quite a bit of Elijah and his family.  That brought a whole new set of issues to the Mystic Falls group, making life more exciting in this small town every day.  If you like the tv show, you will love the DVD.  Go  back and relive your favorite episodes and favorite scenes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|La la la la la this is an amazing game la la la la the best ever la la la la
0689504764|5.0|Absolutely love this book. Gave it to grandson who's 3 now. Also I use to teach pre-school and they loved it as well. Very fun to act out story!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is the best although it would be nice to get coins quicker other than that its great oh and it should have more characters to be I recommend subway surfers and this game is the best!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just started but I like this game so far. It's pretty cool so interactive you are with horses. I'll be playing this for awhile.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This recording will take you on another marvelous journey of love around the world with beautiful music.  I fell in love with this album the first time I heard it.  It is a must have for any Bocelli affectionado.  Bravo!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Love the Franchise.....So, going back to the beginnings, for me, this was an awesome addition,&#34; two thumbs&#34; up coming from me!
B0058YZ2KG|5.0|I love the light weight feel of the shoes and the protection they offer for barefoot running.  It's nice and cool as well.  My feet get hot quickly and the shoes helped keep my feet cool.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great book and as always it gives me perspective on life. I enjoyed all his books and love his anecdotes.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|AMAZING! I found my curls this Friday as my birthday treat. I went to a salon that specializes in curlybhair and was completely transformed. I am thrilled with my new look.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait to read Mockingjay!  I have to know what happens to Katniss and Peeta!!!!  I'm hoping President Snow gets what's coming to him.<br /><br />jkellie
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I know you've read it probably a thousand times already, but the strength of this movie is the characters. There's a cute plot, but the individual acting performance delivered from not one but all of the actors involved was amazing! This movie is a rare example of a powerhouse cast all delivering their best in the same film.<br /><br />If you're a fan of quirky comedies, dramas with real people dealing with real issues or just overall well made stories, I implore you to watch this film. If you cannot find something to enjoy in this film, you may very well want to question your ability to fairly judge a film.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br /><br />-Action buffs, this is a drama. If you can't like a movie without explosions, sex or gunfights then stay clear.<br /><br />-Comedy fans, if the only thing you find funny is Will Ferrell screaming about a boo-boo, this may not be for you.<br /><br />-Fans of the book, accept that this is an adaptation of a book, not a recreation. There will be differences, accept and enjoy it! Believe me, this is about as good as book adaptations get.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good action, a little more character development and a resolution (of sorts) to the story.  We finally find out whether Katniss ends up with Peeta or Gale or....  I enjoyed it!
0385535147|5.0|Like all of Grisham's novels, I could not stop reading it.  When reading any of his books, I almost feel like I am part of the story. I am now waiting for Grisham's next book.
1451673442|5.0|During the last two years, I've been through the darkest time of my entire life. When a person gets that low, and others say, \\"Just count your blessings\\", you want to slap them, because you cannot mentally get there. This book is truly magic, because the author gives you the tools and steps to  begin counting your blessings in a way that is doable. Not only that, I have seen magical transformations in my life. The day after I did the first money exercise, two unexpected checks totaling more than $100 showed up in the mail.<br /><br />A word of caution: because these steps really work, sometimes you go through what I call a \\"detoxification\\" process. On some of the steps that you are really struggling with, you can actually feel worse afterward. This is simply the old negative programming escaping your body and senses. Its a good idea to just do days One and Two for a day or two after this just to regroup, then you can proceed.<br /><br />And don't give up. Right about day eight, my dad passed away from colon cancer. I was with him, and it was so hard to see him go through a tough and terrible time at the end. I loved my dad so much; he was my rod and support. When Mom died, I mourned for years. As Dad passed, I used The Magic steps as I worked through my loss. The difference has been miraculous. I  miss him every day, but I do not feel the excruciating pain in my heart that I did in the beginning. I am coping with many of the difficult things in life so much better.  I can tell the days I miss my gratitude lists. The sweet peace they bring is obviously absent.<br /><br />The Magic is an inspired book.
B00AYJCEYC|4.0|I always enjoy listening to Michael Bolton.  I really enjoyed the selection on this CD. I would recommend this one to anyone.
B006OZKX02|2.0|All the movies worked fine except First Class, that's the only one that is 'Region B' only, the rest are 'A/B' and work on standard american bluray players.  I suppose it's a good price for the collection without the final movie, but I decided to return it upon discovering this detail the seller left out.  Amazon didn't ask any other questions about it even though it was opened.
B000000XB9|5.0|I chose this CD because I wanted a collection of Creedence Clearwater Revival's famous songs and this one has them all.  It brings back a lot of memories.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I have trying to get back to reading and this was just the book I needed. I couldn't put it down at night...lot of tired mornings as a result!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I applaud the efforts of the actors and writers, but it's just ok. It's like a mixing pot of different movies from the past combined, to name a few, Aliens and Alien vs. Preditaor and a few more. But tying it together it needed something because I wasn't connecting to the movie all too well. Again I just found it to be ok, would I watch again no, once is enough for me.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have an older slower computer so it is great to connect on my Kindle. I also love it while travelling. I can connect to WiFi from my room and not have to sit at a hotel lobby community shared computer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not a big reader but this book kept my attention for 3 days and I finished and automatically purchased the second book!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a very interesting game....I had me wondering what was next...It had a good story line....might even play it over again.<br />My daughter also like it
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is cool!! I just hat how you can't use coins to remove a hill. Other than that, I like this game.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I love Hungry Shark Evolution! It's great, but it's animated features that take away from the life of a shark. I love sharks, I have a love of sharks. When you become a  shark, you  carry the traits of the shark you become. It's great, but not what you're expecting.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was amazing ... I would recommend it to anyone that loves an action mystery... however I recommend it for ages 10+ because of some gory details about how the children die
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game it is like temple run but better because there is<br />Less obstacles so I really like the game
B000W93CHC|5.0|I loved pillars of the earth andafter reading several books that were just ok I longed for a book I I could get really into.  This is it!!!
1451695195|4.0|I chose the rating because I believe it to be as factual in presentation as Dr, Alexander was able to translate his experience from telepathic language into English.<br />I do not know enough about the brain/brain stem to stay abreast with his theories, or that of others whom Dr. Alexander quotes from; would that I did.<br />Dr. Alexander stands alone in the graphic pictures he presents to the reader. I would like to know whether the swamp experience is a metaphore from premordial times - my honest opinion is that if this happened to me I would have psychotic fit similar to the one he had while in the ER and would have died from terror.<br />Reading the book left me feeling most uncomfortable; I have not been able to shake this feeling off. My mind is not ready for this kind of information.
B00008QSA5|5.0|Not much that I can add to the other reviews except concur that this is indeed a classic album. I've been listening to --- and buying --- music for 40 years, but only recently heard this album in its entirety about buying the CD. Wow, and double wow! This is definitely worthy of the hype and the glowing reviews and the legendary status its received over the years. Few albums that I've heard have so successfully merged rock with blues and jazz, and throw in some soul and country and few psychedelic flourishes while you're at it. And this musical stew sounds amazingly natural and effortless. Brilliant musicians on fire, as you would expect, but there are some great songs on here too, not just a bunch of guys jamming. Most impressive stuff.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|Right out of the box, this became a must-have for two ipad fans.  Must see it in action to see its ease of use, manueverability, and engaging interface.  Great product.  Would highly recommend.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This was a new take on an old story. Same plot as all zombie stories, just told in a new way. Instead of being in the first person, and seeing through someones eyes, you are listening to the events being remembered by the people. Because of this format, the story jumped around a lot, and seemed a little disjointed. Still a pretty good read.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Devil Colony lived up to everything I hoped it would.  I have read the previous Sigma Force books and am a huge James Rollins fan.  The Devil Colony continues the Sigma Force characters in a new adventure.  Typicall James Rollins it is a story steeped in history and realistic possibilities within his fantasy World.  It was a not want to put down read through to the end novel.  I highly suggest everyone read all of James Rollins novels including this one.
1401322786|3.0|wish I had read the book first lessoning to the cd was a little difficult to understand in parts sometimes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game.... have already played it many times and won many times<br />..... never get tired of playing it.
B00B671W6W|4.0|I found out about this like the day before it was released and only found little snippets about it on the net.  I was really hoping the Jailbreak cover was of AC/DC's Jailbreak, but no, Thin Lizzy.  As a drummer and a HUGE fan of Charlie Benante, i'd always been interested to hear how he'd fair covering Neil Peart. On &#34;Anthem&#34; I got my answer.....I think he did about as good as anyone who isn't Neil Peart covering Neil Peart: ya just can't match the master craftsman.  The funny thing to me was Joey Belladonna sounds more Like Geddy Lee than Geddy Lee does anymore!  For the most part the covers are done straight on, only a little variance on T.N.T..  It's certainly worth a listen.  My only problem is the song selection, &#34;Big Eyes&#34; over &#34;Gonna Raise Hell&#34;?  And i'd much rather hear them cover the song &#34;Escape&#34; than &#34;Keep on Running&#34;, if they're going to cover Journey, but that's just me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is really fun! I love how you don't have to organize it yourself! It's already organized for you. And you don't have to worry about the cards moving around! It's fun for everyone and if you are bored you should play this! You'll entertain yourself and it will keep you occupied. I would definitely recommend this game because it's fun and very easy! I played it for a really long time on the plane and my brother asked me &quot;Woah! I want to play that&quot; and ever since my mom taught him, he's been addicted to his kindle playing solitare! I love it! It's very fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a really creative and fun loving game. It really gives kids an idea on how to take care of horses on train them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely amazing! So addictive! My new aim is now to beat my friends, as I attached it to Facebook, and me and my friend  have a leaderboard.
1250027624|5.0|Got this resource for my wife, who is more of a Downton Abbey fan than I am. We watch every episode when they come out, nice to have this inside look at the series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its Linda like temple run except your running from the security guard guy across trains and stuff very interesting and fun
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|if you look it up online there is a story with all of tylers album with wolf being the first part then bastard then goblin ending it its about tyler losing his gf and dealing with his multiple personaities thats just my sum of it but loo it up its mad crazy. This album is good to just listen to when you are higher than a kite tyler did a good job making his songs more beat orientated.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Kingston has always come through with their products, this is no different. I installed in my HP Laserjet CP1525nw without a hitch. Great price and quick delivery.
B00BFTV09K|4.0|Hugely informative book on how we're being poisoned by our food produders. A little dense but very clear and easy to understand
B000WZAE1I|5.0|If you love fantasy then watch this.  It has a bit of everything from adventure to love to comedy.  An absolutely delightful film, with Gaiman's genius for storytelling
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I use this software on my phone to monitor a Foscam FI8910W camera and the software does a great job at this.  The only area that I feel could be improved would be to move the microphone, record and speaker icons off of the video image and on to the surrounding screen where they can be better seen as they sometimes blend in to brighter images.  Otherwise this software was easy to setup and use and works great, at least with this camera.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I've read thousands of books.  This was something different,  amazing, and perfect.<br />I can't wait to read the next one.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I was really excited when i saw this was for free on the kindle store! I downloaded it, and it's so much fun.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This movie is very well done.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed it.  She had seen it earlier and wanted to share it.  It is worthwhile to see.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I enjoy being able to access FB on my Kindle Fire, which is an alternative to downloading it on my computer at work.
B005GK6QSO|5.0|I'm not necessarily a fan of the type of love song lyrics. But that aside, this album is a must buy for fans of melodic hard rock.The musicianship, vocals, song construction & above all the massive production is great.
B005K17RU0|5.0|If think this is definitely one of the best weather apps out there definitely the best free app for weather from my experience
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A post apocalyptic world story. Reasonably well told, good character development, interesting description of a novel society. I would have given it five except I am aware of how civil society copes in extreme situations and this seemed to stretch probability.
B007L5GDGW|5.0|I am a gamer and I love this game.  It is very difficult initially, but gets easier as you play it.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|If you are looking for a book that is creative and will have you laughing the whole way, this one is for you! This was my second time reading Good Omens and it was every bit as entertaining as the first read through.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Interesting game.  I am a gamer and I love having games on my phone so that when I am out and in a position of having to wait on something or someone, games are very nice.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|You should get it  although it takes time to pass it graphics are good I would highly recommend  it is a awesome game
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is such an addictive game! I love that even though you can purchase upgrades, everything can be had by just playing and a little hard work, no money needed. 2 thumbs up!
B000V8A95C|5.0|Love the play.  Love the songs.  Love the preformances.  Took a while for me to see the play because I thought it would be kind of stupid, but it is not.  Love it.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I like this album. I like this love songs and it's a chill CD for Aerosmith. Good for any Aerosmith fan.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This novel started slow, I even stopped reading it and switched to another book. But when I picked my Kindle up again the book picked up too.  I would rate the first half two stars but the last half a five.  Good book!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always love reading John Grisham. The book takes you all over and ends as I did not expect it to.
B00797MB0O|4.0|Sometimes it's good medicine to watch a piece of cultural sickness (that we may participate in to greater or lesser degrees) simply be expressed. The &#34;resolution&#34; heart to heart at the end is an amazing piece of filmmaking and psychology both.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Fun but it freezes when inviting friends on fb. I would think they woul  fix something like that quick so people can share.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This is a great CD!  All the songs on here are really good.  I have really enjoyed listening to it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought this book was a poorly written soft porn novel.  I really don't get what all the hype is, I was so sick of being in the bedroom with these freaks that I didn't even finish the book.  I guess if you like living vicariously and have no sex life, this could be a great read for you.
B000005RU2|4.0|DEEP PURPLE-MADE IN JAPAN: Coming off of DEEP PURPLE's legendary MACHINE HEAD album, this flawless concert captures the band's MACH II lineup at the absolute peak of their self-indulgent headbangin' powers. MADE IN JAPAN busts out captivating stage versions of piledriver anthems HIGHWAY STAR and STRANGE KIND OF WOMAN helmed by IAN GILLAN's hard rock screech, RICHIE BLACKMORE's gutsy lightning licks, and JON LORD's theatrical organ salvos. The tawdry true life tale SMOKE ON THE WATER (even better here than in its well known studio take) benefits from a slightly faster groove set by skin-thrasher IAN PAICE and bassist ROGER GLOVER, while JON LORD's staggering solo climax is a thing of squawling beauty. Perhaps no hard rock institution better typified the epic jam band ethos than DP; their brooding, atmospheric CHILD IN TIME, THE MULE (basically a ten minute drum solo) and tricked out instrumental LAZY allow the band to stretch out, while a twenty minute smackdown of SPACE TRUCKIN' is the perfect capper to an exhausting metal rendezvous peppered with RNB, prog and classical flourishes. The incendiary MADE IN JAPAN is deservedly the early seventies juggernaut by which all other live rock recordings are measured.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR FLASHPOTS
B000VR824S|5.0|A great man Eric Clapton and for a tremandous cause comes under people helping people doing what the government doesn't but that is another story. This release is full of the best guitar players showing their best. I'm watching all three of the crossroads I have. What I really like about this is it shows the concert lots of close ups of hands and they keep the camera on the subject this is not MTV with tons of cuts and before you know it you're a nervous wreck. I like concerts they show you the concert specially when the music is this good. Now as far as I am concern if the only thing on this was the two songs by Jeff Beck it would be worth it each time Jeff and his band amazes me. There is so much on here tons of blues greats BB King is so sweet with statement about Eric and then to hear him he still has it. Susan Tedeschi with the Derek Trucks Band brings the house down. This release is full of peaks. But then Eric comes out wifh his bands which includes Derek Trucks but then he brings out Steve Winwood and they play a number of the Blind Faith tunes and Steve plays some of his then Steve & Eric do crossroads. You think it is all over I'm satisfied but no there is more out comes the great Buddy Guy it's Chicago what better way to end it with a heathy helping of Buddy Guy who is a master. Nothing more to say this is a wonderful release.
B00AZKCU7G|2.0|If you are going to buy the Blu-ray+DVD+Digital_Copy version for Digital Copy, you will regret it. It is not like what the Blu-ray+DVD+Digital_Copy version of Les Misérables is.<br /><br />It is a digital copy NEITHER from iTunes store NOR Zune video. The Digital copy is from an extra DVD that comes with the Blu-ray and the DVD for feature movie, and is only 2.05GB (2.38 GB for WMV version) with DRM. The actual quality of the digital copy is even worse than DVD video, even though it says it is in 720p. You will NOT own this movie in iTunes store or Zune Marketplace. And you can get the license for DRM for ONLY ONCE, in other words you cannot re-transfer the movie from that Digital_Copy disc after you delete the movie from your hard disk or after you re-installed your Operating System.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Storyline was GREAT, i loved and the graphics were great. The movie was hilarious and also it was heartwarming. This movie was AWESOME!!!
0743297334|4.0|This short novel does for the reader what good prose should: allows a perspective on an experience not easily had, and inspires some though and introspection. Also, I found I was inspired to drink more wine...
1471101223|4.0|This is a fantastic athlete and admirable person.  You get to get into the head of Ian Thorpe, the person, and see he is quite likeable and normal, though he may think otherwise.<br /><br />Even the media's invasion into our private lives happens to people other than celebrities, though not in the same public way experienced by Ian Thorpe.<br /><br />Much of this we already knew about Thorpey, but his genuine good nature is confirmed in This is Me.  He has given much of himself to sport and humanity, and this book keeps in that tradition.  Thanks for sharing Ian.  You are a champ in life.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|i love this show. the story line is unique and well done. i loved this season as you start out and it gets more intense. great acting as well. 5 stars!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the easiest horse game ever. I like it so much that I play it for a long time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun I play this game a lot and, I like it because there is always new versions of this game and I liked every one of them and overall I like this game 5 out of 5 stars
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|After using it for a few weeks I am confident in saying this is as good a mouse as everyone else says. One thing about this mouse that is not said so often in the reviews is how ergonomic it is. Others compare it to the deathadder (which I used prior to this mouse) however on significant improvement to it is the rubber pad for the thumb that gives a very good grip of the mouse that allows you to control it better high higher DPI. I would have problems using the deathadder at 3k+ DPI however I am using the mouse with good control at 3.6k DPI. The only drawback to the feel of the mouse is the difficulty in getting used to operating the three buttons for the thumb from the deathadder. However the design is logical in that to operate the front and back you depress the end of your thumb or the center of your thumb, then to operate the top button you push your thumb up which gives you distinct hand movements to operate each button without it feeling clustered. Practicing a few games using these three buttons makes all three of them as easy to control as the two buttons of the deathadder. The reason for not giving the product a 5 star review is mostly because of the software. It lacks a \\"mouse button\\" keybinding that razer synapse has so that you don't bind something from the keyboard to your mouse and can link it to an action within the game keybinding settings. I found this feature very useful for games like Guild Wars 2 and Eve Online where lots of buttons are needed from your keyboard and you want buttons that can operate like F1 that will work through chat windows or not cause accidental keyboard input when doing something aside from the game. Another lacking feature is that you're limited to switching between two profiles at a time. I never use more than one, but if you wanted the option to switch between additional profiles you would need to save and load two profiles at a time through the software package. Additionally you can't link profiles to programs which is another nice feature of razer synapse. However one advantage to this software package over Synapse is that you can link function keys in a combination and have the button perform windows operation which can't be done with a macro (I.E. opening Launchy with Ctrl+win key+space bar). My last issue was their was no clear guide to the macro manager within the software package and the manual doesn't even mention how to get to it. If you were to use the mouse without toying around with the software package it would appear you are only able to store one macro at a time and have to use one of the buttons on the mouse to record the macro. To get to the macro manager you have to click on any button to reprogram it then navigate to the Macro sub-menu then click on macro manager as if you're programming the button to open the macro manager. It doesn't actually link the button to the macro manager, but this is the only way to open it. Additionally when I contacted support about it they told me to look at the manual which in my opinion was a joke that they can call that a manual. It's 7 pages in a 5x5 inch packet with 1 page dedicated to warranty, contact, and service statement, and another page that literally restates mouse functions to define it. (I.E. Acceleration: Adjusts the acceleration level.) Generally I don't expect the manual to cover everything, and I also understand that manuals contain info that you don't consider useful for mouse operation, however the only thing that's not intuitive about the mouse is not mentioned except for on the second page where they label the default mouse button functions. All it states is that the button in front of the scroll wheel is macro play and the button directly behind scroll wheel is macro record.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The earlier version was simpler and better.  This app is very slow on Kindle Fire 1st generation.  Would not recommend.
B0063M22QO|2.0|The game is ok, but I really like the one you can get for free.  It's more challenging.  The one I paid for is not as<br />Challenging.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I fall in love with a TV serise. I never thought I would like it so much. It is the best.
B002KGEORM|4.0|I never purchased this so I have no Idea what to rate it.  I watch the show on tv and love it
B00133KFGW|5.0|and safe for the entire family. Its really to bad that in today's world there are not many movie that parents can watch with their kids and both enjoy the show.
B0091QS88K|5.0|I had a friend who had this on their iPad and my kids loved it.  I was happy to find if for the Kindle.  I might just buy the full version or other versions.  Funny thing is now my 4 year old is giving me cooking advice.  :D
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|OK I'm sure you read the other reviews, you know there is a new singer and a new drummer , to me that's all well and dandy, but that does not matter to me as much as the music !!! as long as there SPOCK\\"S BEARD let's talk about that . I have been a beard fan since i first heard or saw the light. there one of my favorite bands.Like one of the other reviewers V is my favorite followed very closely by SNOW. I was upset when Neil left, but my collection is better for that. They have released 4 great albums since then with in my opinion X being the best. Until now. Remember this is only my thoughts  pun intended.<br />  I think the band knew that X was going to be the last album they would record as a unit. Just listen to X its light hearted its easy to listen to come on the Kings new clothes is a old kids story,but the song is still great and my favorite. I think they decided to have fun in the studio and it shows it is a FUN album to listen to.<br />  I too  per-ordered it and had it 3 weeks ago,I've listened to it 4 or 5 times and I LIKE IT (another intended pun) it shows all the members' old and new, as the great musicians they are. there are no multiple-part epics as in the past, just some well crafted and expertly played songs that make a great album. I'm not going to take it apart track by track, that's not how i listen to a album. I take it as a whole so on a whole this is a great album beard fan or not. I hope for more from this new incarnation of the beard.<br />  SO, as always, take it from from me Vinny the old Hippy  I KNOW THESE THINGS. This is a album well worth having.<br /><br />  V.J.P.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|great movie lots of exciting features it shows an in depth  story about the making of the hobbit and the movie is wonderful
B00455TTXK|5.0|This is a fantastic greatest hits album, by the legendary George Harrison. No matter what format it is in..CD, cassette, or vinyl you cant go wrong.  A must have for any George or Beatles fan.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|This is a very good story line. It reminds me of how we need to really love our children and teach compassion to our fellow man.
B000274THQ|4.0|This is the funniest (East) German movie I have ever seen!  Growing up in Europe, I saw many German movies. They are either super serious or  stupid slapstick movies.  This one is neither.  The movie is clever and shows the love of the son and daughter towards their mother and how they are trying to shelter her from the truth (of the collapse of the wall).<br />Blending real life footage of that time with fictitious events was genius.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed all three books. I have the movie and can't wait for the next movie to come out. I totally recommend this book for all ages.
B000SOZXJG|2.0|The Whale Rider is the story of a young Maori girl and her family.  It could also be described as the story of an indigenous people being forced to adapt to modern society while trying to retain their beliefs, traditions, and identity.  The Maori are natives of New Zealand.  The story starts with the birth of Paikea, the granddaughter of a Maori chief.  Both her mother and her brother die during childbirth, leaving her grandfather very disappointed.  He truly believed that the grandson that died was going to be the next great chief and a powerful leader for the Maori people to usher them through this disjointing time.<br /> As time passes, her grandfather does come to care for her, although still wishes for a male heir.  Meanwhile, Paikea's father has moved on with his life, starting a new family far from the Maori heritage.  When Paikea starts to leave with him, she realizes that she can't.  Her grandfather and other elder Maori decide to do something to save their heritage.  They build a school to teach their youth the past and rituals of their people.  This school is supposed to be only for boys, but Paikea refuses to let this stop her.<br /> Paikea sits in on most of the lessons, albeit hidden behind the house.  When her grandfather catches her using the taiaha, an ancient fighting technique using a stick, he becomes very angry and bans her from the house.  She starts living with her uncle, who continues to teach her the taiaha.  Paikea continues to try to become a part of her heritage.  Meanwhile, her grandfather tests the youth in an attempt to find an old relic.  The boys all fail, but later Paikea succeeds.  All the while she calls to the whales.<br /> As stated earlier, this is just as much a story of a young girl trying to get to her heritage as much as it is a story of indigenous people suffering displacement.  The Maori try hard to keep as close to their native land as possible.  The culture is very male dominated.  They try hard to pass along the ancient ways, like the use of taiaha.  Paikea shows an extensive knowledge of her ancestors, revering all they had done for her and keeping them with her, another aspect of indigenous sacred ways.  The respect for animals is apparent, especially in the way the Maori have such respect for the whales.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Omg. i loved this book! i had read this book in 4 days. I had even related it on some parts of the book and at the end it feels like charlie is really talking to you!!!!
159562015X|5.0|have not been so incredible surprised in a long time, I had an issue with the shipment and the service was top notch. The book is excellent too
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Five fictional families travel through the 20th Century. We see and live the century through the eyes of these families. It is a great read!
B0067R0APK|1.0|please fix the broken maps that the update added, on galaxy s3, and then it will be a worthwhile app again.
1409136612|3.0|enjoyed it light reading amusing, but like the author and enjoyed the family events which i could relate to now.
0375758992|5.0|This could have been written with my thought process! I love the setting and the way that the writer captures the child's point of view of a life so oddly lived and experienced. The cover of that kid looking so weird sold me on this book!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Good advice. Not a MBA, but a short lesson in motivation and insight. Read it and know you may be smarter than you believed you are. I'm going to read it again and again.
B001EJIMUG|2.0|It was okay. It was kind of slow to get into and I like other versions Of this movie better.
B0072X2O66|1.0|I found it difficult to distinguish the songs from one another and nothing really sticks out. There are some good moments on the album but honestly I really don't want to listen to it again to tell you where those moments are. I hated it that much. The lyrics are just awful, very trite and not thoughtful. I felt like every song was a loudness war between every musician. Russel Alan has some ok moments but most of the time he's just yelling and while his voice has power, it lacks emotion on this record. There is very little dynamic range on this album. All the musicians are talented but their attempt to try to do a more mainstream album from their former works just doesn't work. The guitar riffs, drums, vocals are unoriginal. The album itself sounds overproduced, over compressed, and just too loud. I would save your money on this one. While their follow up album Coverta is better, it's not original material and, again, I can't even suggest that record. I think the band needs to find their place and that may take some time. Right now they sound like they are fighting for the spotlight at the expense of the music.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|My 19 month old daughter loves watching this movie with her mommy.  It teaches kids some good family values and has a bunch of funny parts.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Its a fun game but so frustrating when it does things like put up a Success message which blocks the screen and so you die as you can't see what's about to happen. Or a 750 head start that propels you straight into a fire ball before you can react.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|I must have watched this movie a dozen times with her already and still not bored of it.  I would highly recommend this movie to all parents.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|This has never occupied the serious shelves above that The Sopranos, Mad Men, The Wire, Breaking Bad have occupied, though I felt it had a little potential.  I swallowed the campy gore and one-dimensional character types because it seemed to offer a little bit more philosophically.  Unfortunately I don't think they know what they want to do with the series.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is easy to use. The display is pleasing to the eye. I like being able to keep up with the weather in multiple locations.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|For me, this part is the best of the three as it is finally reveals all the secrets :)<br /><br />Enjoy!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Such a great book.  I was surprised by how good it really was.  Being in a family with a sibling who is mentally ill... this really hit home
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I went looking for a &#34;best of&#34; Adele CD.  What I found was this live album with a DVD, all for a very reasonable price.  This was so much better than I expected!  Like Adele?  Start here.  You will be thoroughly pleased and find yourself singing along in no time!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had the game for the first year and it is awesomely awesome and the first time I had played it was the first thing I would play all the time
B002LFPAUC|5.0|My old VHS tape that I recorded Fawlty Towers on has worn out to the point where it was like watching a snowy picture.  This remastered collection includes every show--and more.  What a great collection, and the extras make it that much better.  Now, I'm back to watching Fawlty Towers with better quality video than when they were broadcast on PBS!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Action packed. Have to be fast and its fun to play with others.u have to really concentrate and move  move  move
067144901X|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter for Easter. She is 5 months yet enjoys the colorful pictures, her eyes light up as she is able to turn the pages. Small enough to rest in her lap as she sits in mine.<br /><br />Will continue To buy from this author again!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|really love this music.  i listen to it constantly.  only disapointed there is not yet another cd.  i need more!
B008I43DYU|4.0|I use this to check on purchase prices versus shipping and handling charges when I am using my kindle to buy online from more than one web site.  It is simple and does simple calculations like this well,
0307454541|5.0|I really enjoyed reading all three of them. They are not great literature, but they are very entertaining and easy to read. Page-turners.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I bought this Alarm clock application for my Kindle and had to use it recently.  I could not sleep because the smoke alarm in my bedroom kept chirping loudly but the maintenance man was dealing with an plumbing emergency elsewhere on a Federal holiday weekend.  I set up the alarm on my Kindle and went to sleep on my sofabed and got up and got to work on time when I probably would have otherwise overslept!
030745455X|5.0|I love the whole trilogy. Not classic literature, but well-written and entertaining. I totally enjoyed all three of them. And the movie.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The move follows along the book, with a few exceptions.  If you liked the book then your will love the movie.  Can hardly wait for part 2.
0440238609|5.0|I totally enjoyed reading this trilogy. First books my daughter and I shared. I found it very imaginative. But don't see the movie! It will disappoint you!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|A fantastic collection of short stories. The italicized words and numerical figures often show as jumbled. Other than that, the e-book is flawless.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Excellent acting, story lines and only a few edit errors, and it will have you wondering exactly where the line is in terms of police ethics, where it should be, or maybe even whether it should even exist. This series points out the fact that law enforcement is seldom a bright line occupation, and it points out where and when such issues often arise. But when it came to Season 7, suddenly no subtitles. Season 7 also appears to be inferior in terms of video quality, and has none of the prior show highlights which help jog the memory if you come back to the show after not having watched for a while.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Excellent.  I used this to find knots for making bracelets, macrame.  It is great, very useful and love the demos.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I loved the first Matrix it was my Favorite movie but as the story continued it did get a little cheesey but the Adventure and action was worth buying it in better quality I recommend trying it out.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I would reccomend this book highly - It was well-written, with a timely subject matter. Get your tissues ready! Enjoyed!!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|If you have already looked up Game of Thrones then the only thing to do is support this collection, I enjoy this TV show as much as any person would the DVD and Blu-ray Disc where in good order no scratches and no damage done to box
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Well acted, action packed drama! Have always been a fan of Serlock in all his itterations, but this tell combines humor with over the top action. I t's a bit predictable in places, but a pure romp!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you have already looked up Game of Thrones then the only thing to do is support this collection, I enjoy this TV show as much as any person would the DVD and Blu-ray Disc where in good order no scratches and no damage done to box
B006VFLIYK|5.0|What a great book He even makes an assassin seem a likeable person<br />The characters are so real I again could not put it down
B0000639FE|4.0|This movie should have received an oscar for best movie.  Tom Cruise has been associated with seveal oscar winners.  This is one of his movies where he should have one an oscar himself.
B00479SVBU|4.0|This player works well. I drive truck for a living in western PA and eastern OH, and use this Soundfly in the truck to listen to my MP3 files. I tune the radio to 89.3 and never have to change the frequency all day. The sound is always clear with no fade or static. I would definitely recommend this player.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think its great if you've played tap zoo and liked it then you'll love this. I personally think its amazing and you need to get it.
B009VB998I|4.0|The scenery was great.  I liked the story and loved the humor!  I would recommend Tangled to anyone.<br /><br />Secret of the Wings:  Nice story, great artwork and color.  Would recommend to my great granddaughters.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Only thing I can say bad about the movie is you have to wait next movie is released. Since I can't go to the theatre, I probably have to wait until the until next Feb. 2014 to buy it.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|Nice story.  I am pleased to see a &#34;modern&#34; way of teaching the sweet things that generations of children have believed in.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This was the best of the 12 Baldacci Books I have read. I couldn't figure out where it was going till the end. I was spellbound.<br />J Rogers
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was a great value having all six episodes plus the bonus disc.  I was very upset however, that there were none of the behind-the-scenes featurettes for the prequels.  Pretty much just concept art which you can get with an art book, but with a blu-ray dvd I want actual movie extras.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fin better than temple run. \\"Could play all suave iglf Alvan but I cant so o eelll<br />  Maybe I I cant probly play at work but I might get introuble by my boss
B00AH8FTT2|1.0|Quite frankly, this is pathetic. It is trhe sort of stuff I used to enjoy when I was about 11 or 12. The ending gives promise of more rubbish of this type.<br />Jeffrey Archer, you started off some years ago writing not bad novels buit now just churn out rubbish. No more of you for me. I think this book is a worse crime than the one you went to prison for.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|It's a deep look into a high functioning addicts world. Lacks in the reward to the viewer for caring about the character.
B000W4HIXQ|5.0|As always Bruce Willis out did himself. He is one of my favorite actor.  Great movie, it would make a good gift for any guy
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It's a good one for children and/or adults. The story keeps you involved but the humor keeps you talking about it for days
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is additive and fun,those who worry more abort coins will not get very far. But you have to get them to unlock characters and boost. Either way avoid the trains. Have fun all of you.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|This game has great mechanics but the language took away all the fun. This game should be rated M because in just the first 25 minutes they say the F word 9 times. This will probably please players of COD and Battlefield but it took away the fun for me.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Having been a Robin Trower fan since the Long Misty Days Album it is always exciting to see what will the next release bring! This latest ode to his roots is still in my Vehicles cd player after many repeats. If you call your self a true Trower fan then purchase this cd right away. Out Here in Ridgecrest, Ca. there are many dedicated Trower fans and cds like this tell you why!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Although the brain science is a bit confusing for a common person like me, the author's description affirms what I believe holy Scripture also tries to communicate about the glory that we can't even imagine at death
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I play this most of my free time and my daughter recommened this to me I'm adicted!!!! She also recommended most of my games
B000FFJYB6|4.0|Though it came in a different case, I love this movie.  The disc was the original and used but worked just fine and had both wide and regular screen versions.  Fast delivery.
0307476073|3.0|Although its a pretty easy read I kept waiting for some  important revelation that would explain this journey. I just kept thinking how ridiculous and stupid the author was while on this trek. She made so many bad choices and was ill-prepared for this supposed search for meaning in her life. I felt like I wasted my time on this one.
B000FA675C|4.0|Keeps your interest, lots of facts with layers. Interesting story line with twists and turns. The story does not dumb down the pieces as they are presented to you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game. It isn't one of those games you get stuck on a level and lose interest in it forever. I highly recommended it for poeple who like templerun.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|It was an ok movie for a Friday evening.  It did not hit it out of the park as they say.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a page-turner.  Each scene painted a vivid picture and got you inside the head and body of a driven perfectionist and patriot.  Thanks for sharing your story and, most of all, for your selfless service to our country.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|The story unfolds with energy from the beginning as you are introduced to the different fathers in the movie.<br /><br />The message that fathers need to stand up and lead their families is a great message that is meant for all dads and father figures.<br /><br />Each movie that the Kendrick brothers have put out has gotten better. The acting is getting more polished and the stories are getting deeper. And they don't have the best fairy tale ending you could think of, but instead real life takes place.<br /><br />There is a bit of an emotional roller coaster but you will come away glad you watched this movie.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This is one CD I will certainly keep and listen to for my life time.  It brings the movie back to life!
B00BHU261S|3.0|Alfred Hitchcock would have hated it. The only interesting thing about it was finding out how important his wife was to his craft. Didn't need to watch this movie.
B009AMANBA|2.0|\\"Team of Rivals\\" by Doris Kearns Goodwin is a wonderful book and it is worthy of recommendation to anyone.<br /><br />This film, however, is not.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg was wildly the wrong person to make this movie. From the very first sequence of dialogue it screamed \\"Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.\\"  The film hasn't run 30 seconds, and you can tell right away that Spielberg has no natural feel for the material.  The following 135 minutes merely confirm that first impression ad nauseum.  There is nothing subtle or clever or insightful in either the scriptwriting or the direction. The cinematography is good, and there is nothing wrong with DDL's performance. Other than that, though, given the material they were starting from, the screenplay is uncomfortably close to awful.  Ham-fisted, really. Like something out of the 1930's or 1940's - Stilted, and awkward as \\"Ruggles of Red Gap\\", or \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\".<br /><br />135 minutes of bathos. Cannot imagine anyone sitting through it twice.<br /><br />What it brought to mind was the contrast between \\"Schindler's List\\", which won a bucket of Oscars, and \\"Remains of the Day\\", which had the misfortune of being in the same year, and therefore won nothing.  Nobody watches \\"Schindler's List\\" anymore, but \\"Remains of the Day\\" is rented over and over and is rightly regarded as an enduring classic for the twin outstanding performances of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" would have been a far, far better film if the screenplay had been written by somebody like Aaron Sorkin.  He would have understood the material and would have brought it to light, in a way that Spielberg apparently could not, and did not.  Spielberg doesn't get subtlety or irony - the qualities more than any others in which President Lincoln's transcendent genius was most often seen.  As for a director? Somebody like Clint Eastwood 15 years ago - at the time of \\"Unforgiven\\" - would have had a much better feel for it.  Spielberg was embarrassingly the wrong guy to make this film.
B000XKZQ74|5.0|This was a great film. Just great filmmaking. Very sensitive story . Very thought provoking. No car crashes, no special effects. Just a great story.
B000UUF69A|4.0|Good movie, good price. My 5 year old loves to watch it. Easy to buy through Amazon. Don't have to go to Wal Mart
B009VB9VKY|5.0|Great dancing.. Unexpected . Channing Tatum did an amazing job.  He's a great dancer. Will look for him in other flicks.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like it! it fills my leisure time with a way to relax! I recommend  people to geg it and enjoy.  It is a good product.
1592407889|4.0|From the first page, I was sucked into Sachi Parker's story.  It is instantly engaging and I found myself feeling shocked and sympathetic to her plight.  As a child, she tells a tale of neglect and abuse, continuing on into her teens.  Sachi longed for a &#34;normal&#34; childhood and loving family.  She seems to have spent her whole life looking for love in all the wrong places, as a result. I did find myself getting a bit weary of her victim mentality as she went on into adult life though.  She seemed to be constantly demanding that her mother make up for neglecting her as a child.  Although Shirley McClaine does not come off well.  I couldn't help thinking that there are two sides to every story.  This one could have been titled &#34;Poor me&#34;.  Having said that, I applaude her for having the courage to put her story out there.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Really good game takes long but really cool also great with kids who are about 8 &amp; up love it one of my favorites
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A bit confusing at the beginning because I didn't know what the dialog was about (you'll understand when you read it); then things fall into place. The story is a good one, the twists & turns keep you on edge, but the idea of the parents...  I can say no more.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I like the Bad Piggies and have fun playing it sometimes just for fun.  Yes I would recommend it to friends
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was different.  I had never heard of all the meanings associated with flowers.  It was a very emotional story and not one that the reader might forget
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I like adobe products and thought it would help to use it on my Kindle. Yes I would recommend it to friends.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I saw this at the movie house and got nauseated in the fast left to right scene in the goblin cave. Watching the movie at home i didn't.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just love the Holy Bible and have started to read it. The Bible on the History channel was great, so I would like to read the Bible and yes I would recommend it to my friends.
B005LAII4E|4.0|Everything you want in an action flick, hot guys, great action and good story. Like De Hard, the GI Joe franchise has not disappointed.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I liked the Virtual City Playground but did not use it very much so I deleated it as far as I know.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|I would recommend watching this movie to anyone that is interested in a good non X rated movie. It is a great feel good movie and Meryl Streep looks beautiful.
B000005Z0E|5.0|This album is raw. That's pretty much all that is needed to describe it. This one came packaged still too
B000026OW3|3.0|Rubinstein deserves his reputation as a great player of Chopin, but that reputation rests more on his earlier recordings than these.  That said, these recordings are occasionally great, and never less than enjoyable; however, they shouldn't be the gold standard they've become.  I resisted buying this set back in the days when it sold for $100+.  At $20, there's no need to hesitate.  Listen and judge for yourself.
B000005Z0G|5.0|It was still wrapped in the store plastic when i got it in the mail. It came on time too
B000HL09MG|4.0|Kubrick was the best in his imagery. There are (in my opinion) very few directors this era (Fincher falls into this category respectively) who not only value the importance of mood and the power of imagery but will obsess and spend more time than needed on how far these two techniques of film can be implemented. Kubrick's final film is a sort of ironic parallel of his whole body of work: obsessive, challenging, transcendent. These themes are all on display. EWS is the story of a man transitioning within the span of a week from disillusioned to powerfully obsessive. Relationships, no matter what is at stake, however stable can begin to tilt ever so slightly from carnal desires, fulfillment and pure physical nature and this story not only deals with what it can provoke someone to do when slapped with it but what it can symmetrically do to a decent person. All seen through the one of a kind eye of Kubrick, he not only plunges you into an array of questions and self-conscious reflections but can do so at a time of the year that is represented by love and warmth: Christmastime. The cinematography is one to be reckoned with and it is a rightful shame that this film was mostly recognized for its music score during awards season. The performances, whilst not the primary focus, are all solid. The running time does not surprise but never once does it feel like the film is meandering; every shot is considered astutely and it all serves as a necessity to move forward. It is a marvel to watch and a wonderful example of how consistent Kubrick was able to make a film that will always be in the back of your mind.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|it is difficult to navigate and hard to locate simple things in comparison to the real website version. Distinctly average
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Really enjoying this game. I haven't played the first one but this one is great. The graphics r great and its really easy to play.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It was so terrible  no one should play this game do u know why it is stupid it is because it is boring
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|When I was a kid I loved this movie! I still like it to this day even if I noticed how similar the animation is to The Jungle Book. They didn't have enough money back then I guess to make it better.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|A wonderful alternative history of the world, that is believable and yet not so much.  Fun to read and enjoy.
B00005JM02|5.0|I remember when I first watched it and being amazed. The animation was beautiful and it still is. The story,the characters are perfect IMO. I don't see how anyone can dislike it. (:
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|The lighting quality of the reproduction was substandard and was distracting throughout the movie. Every 2 to3 minutes the light level would flicker a little brighter for only a few seconds, the film would go out of focus, then it would it would to normal. This continued through both discs and reached a point where we couldn't wait for the end. I can not be be sure but I would think this problem occured in the reproduction process and not everyone has been effected,<br /><br />In this condition, I could not recommend this reproduced film to anyone.<br /><br />Sorry,
B00005JKDR|4.0|Not gonna lie it's not my favorite Pixar movie, but I'll still watch it. It's really creative,family friendly,etc, but I'm more of a Finding Nemo type of person lol.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|I liked this movie. it is 'based on a real story' - how much it follows that is anyone's guess, but it kept me watching all the way through. I was a little hinked out afterwards, which makes this a good scary movie for me, even though parts were very predictable, and the ending could have been better.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I think I enjoyed the movie as much as my sisters kids did lol. I love the inside jokes they have here. I love how different of a personality each car has.
B005PM3YII|3.0|I really liked the first two books in the series, however I found the story line a bit cumbersome and tripping over its feet. The ending was average as it left some of the characters not finalized which I found disappointing.
B0013ND30W|5.0|Another Disney Classic that everyone should own! Well more like anyone whose around little girls lol. They'll enjoy it. It was remastered better than Bambi was. Sorry Bambi.
B003XNTTYY|5.0|What a follow on from the Final Empire, the story is progressing quite well and can not wait until the next book in the series is released, just hoping that it will be just as good as the last two.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. Even though Snow White isn't exactly everyone's favorite princess. this movie is still enjoyable. I'm glad it was remastered. :)
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|great entertainment for me and my grandsons - who are nine and five. the color and action is what I like best
B005LAIII0|5.0|I've been wanting to see this movie for a while now. I finally got to watch it and it's a shame I didn't see it sooner! There's quite a few scenes that are my favorite because of how beautiful they are. The story itself is tragic, but it teaches you a lot as it goes on. Even my sisters kids loved it and they usually get bored of &#34;long movies&#34;.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|If you travel a lot or maybe just on weekends you will fine this very helpful. I fine the reviews very helpful when I'm looking for a motel or hotel or even a place to eat. It will even tell you how to get there. I put it on my computer, my Kindle and on my cell phone. There is even more to look at, good luck
B00003CXA2|5.0|I love the story and even if it's long I don't mind re watching it. I sort of consider it a family movie, but only for the older kids.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its a fun game and its very addictive. The one problem I have is when I move from side to side it gets regestered as a jump and when I jump it makes me move from side to side. But beside that its really fun!
B000F8O35U|4.0|This is another Disney movie that never gets old. The songs,the story,etc. I have no problem with it except that I think it should look better. Compared to Cinderella and other movies; this movie doesn't have anything remastered. I'll probably go for the Blu-Ray version instead.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|If you place a heavy camera on this mount, the whole frame warps as you hold it. If you are trying to get very stable shots, this will produce a very annoying little wiggle as you move around with it. This wiggle causes your shots to not be as smooth as you would like. A great cheap alternative, but would not recommend for professional use.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|I'm not sure why some people don't like this edition. I like it and my sisters kids love this movie. The only issue I guess is the whole &#34;oooh they say jackass&#34; in this movie. It took them over a year to even catch that though because we never made a big deal about it. When they did catch it I just told them this movie was made a long time ago when things were different for kids. Glad it was a good enough explanation for them because they know they can't say it. :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Will keep the reader guessing to the end.  Hard to decide whom to dislike more, Nick, Amy, the parents, the police, or the press.
B004G600A4|5.0|I don't think anyone could ever get tired of this movie! The singing,plot,and animation are just perfect in my opinion.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Unlike anything I've ever read. You never know what will happen next, which is great. Can't wait to see what comes in the final book.
B003L1ZWG2|3.0|this is a low cheap budget movie a lot of errors why nobody have cellular??? teen people don't live without cellular....well is one of the many logical errors..wolfs????? ))))) well see this movie is ok the idea was good but is not for 5 or 4 stars...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put it down... so disappointed the series is over... such a great read.. I recommend it to someone interested in reading something different.
B0018QCXGY|1.0|this movie was work only in marketing nothing to do with horror, suspense, thriller, nothing, this movie is a cheap low budget movie...stay away
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good game. Fun to play. Easy use. Lots of cool stuff to do and play. Makes me want a horse of my own.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie deserves five stars.  I wasn't sure what to expect; had not seen a musical in years.  The scenes had more than enough action and emotion to keep you involved as the story unfolded.  I have one suggestion, keep a few tissues by to dry your tears.
B003YCIE68|5.0|This movie came out when my son was a youngster. It is never played on TV for Christmas and it should be. This is the best movie about Santa Claus. I love having it and being able to watch it at Christmas time.
B009YU9J0E|5.0|I really enjoyed this album, probably more than the first one but it's a great follow up from II. Every song is great!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Being from the South, the way of life in this movie brought back so many memories. I have the paperback book and the movie. Always readable and watchable for me.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|Almost forgot how incredibly good this album is.<br />Probably one of the best ever recorded. Like catching<br />up with an old friend. The new Vinyl will be mothballed<br />because I bought the CD too!
B00003CXA6|5.0|My husband loves history and he truly loved this selection. He said the acting is fantastic and the film is fabulous without commercial interuptions.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|It is fun, you just eat and eat, fish and people that scream, and avoid harmful things. I looked at my stats, I am not getting credit for everything; like it shows the number of turtles eaten as zero. I've eaten lots of turtles...<br /><br />You can buy upgrades for your shark, and fun stuff with coins earned rather than real money. Great graphics, neat theme song. This is one I can't really say whether it's for everyone.<br /><br />Davemonster
B000IY03DM|5.0|A friend at work told me about this group,  I heard one of her CDs and I knew I had to have my own. I do not understand the words on most of the songs, however, there are some in english. But it does not matter that I do not understand the language the music is simply REGAL and it makes me feel very special and priviledged to have it in my collection.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The main reason for having the app was to see at a glance the current weather by viewing the shortcut that runs in the background. With the latest app update, the data doesn't update anymore. It's 4pm right now and the &quot;current&quot; weather data still shows 9 am. Syncing does not work to force it to update either. For my purposes the app has become useless. Terrible!!!!!!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|My family are horse lovers, so this story really meant a lot to me. The story is so well well put together ..be sure to watch with kleenex.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is fun for long car rides and has lots of activities I recommend they make more games like my dog or my cat!
B0089XH38M|4.0|It's good except it repeatedly directs me to 'settings 'to disable usb debugger, but doesn't allow me to do so.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This was amazing because i have never seen nothing like this in my whole life it was really amazing to me !!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Overall a very nice puzzle. I really enjoy these puzzles, my only gripe is there only been 10 puzzles, it would be nice to have more levels etc.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this version because it has more challenges and it has no adds.<br />It is worth the little money it cost.
B00371QQ2U|5.0|This special edition blu-ray is absolutely amazing. The movie is my favorite space true life drama.<br />The launch scene is stunning. I re-live the emotion of those 4 days as the crew and ground support battled to advert a tragedy.<br />The re-entry scene moves me to tears every time I watch it.<br />The additional footage and features enhance Ron Howard's original masterpiece .<br />As an engineer I appreciate the authenticity of his work. I feel I am right there in that crippled space ship.<br />Tom Hanks and all the cast excel in this film.<br />After a visit to Kennedy Space Centre, Houston the whole family could not wait to re-watch this movie.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|First of all, I've read a lot about the fact that this box set doesn't go deeper into the vaults and give us more unreleased material. As a long-time fan, I would love to see more of that myself, but let's be realistic. This box isn't here just to give us rare and unreleased tracks; it's a retrospective that attempts to appeal to obsessive fans and more casual fans alike, and represent Stills in the best possible light. On those terms, it succeeds beautifully. There are plenty of rare tracks to keep me interested, and even though I've been convinced of his genius for a long time now, when I listen to this box that genius comes into focus even more clearly. Stills has contributed more to the music of his time than most people realize. For What It's Worth; Bluebird; Suite: Judy Blue Eyes; Helplessly Hoping; Carry On; Love the One You're With; Change Partners; the list goes on. Has there ever been another artist who can span so many genres as beautifully and successfully as Stephen Stills? Is there anything musically this guy can't do, and do exceptionally well? Gorgeous package, great photos, excellent essays -- this is beautifully put together. Many thanks to Graham Nash and Joel Bernstein for getting this done, and of course to Stephen Stills for the music.<br /><br />Thank God he failed that Monkees audition.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this product for a friend. I really can't rate it as I am not the one reading it. My friend was happy with it.
B008PALI5S|4.0|This 8th is  great performance with fabulous picture and sound. I have deducted one star because it's missing one key ingredient, if you are looking for any deep bass on the organ forget it, it's non-existent!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I work in a very successful e-commerce website with over 2000 people and this book has dozens of similarities with my day to day work life.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Why all the fuss over this album? So many people just want to complain over the amount of ballads on this album, but with an album with 15 songs on the standard edition, why complain? I own and enjoy all of Aerosmith's albums, old and new (Yes, that includes Just Push Play), and I think this is one of the best ones. Is it Toys In The Attic, Rocks, or Pump? No, but I'm proud of this album. With songs like LUV XXX, Oh Yeah, Tell Me, Out Go The Lights, Legendary Child, Street Jesus, We All Fall Down, and Another Last Goodbye, it's a no brainer that this album is great. I own the deluxe edition from Walmart, so it came with four extra songs: Shakey Ground, Up On The Mountain, Oasis In The Night, and Sunny Side Of Love. Combined with the other 15 songs on the standard album, that's 19 songs to listen to, and if you can enjoy at least half of them, then there shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />LUV XXX is the best album opener on an Aerosmith album since Young Lust on Pump, and it's actually one of my absolute favorite Aerosmith songs. Oh Yeah sounds like something that could have been from the first album, it's bluesy and rocking. Beautiful sounds like something from Just Push Play, it has a simple, but cool sounding riff and great verses; the chorus is a little weird, but it has grown on me a lot. Tell Me is Tom Hamilton's first songwriting credit since Janie's Got A Gun on Pump, and not only that, but it's his first solo songwriting credit, and he did an incredible job. Tell Me is amazing and powerful, I can't think of a better way to describe it. Out Go The Lights is a song that sounds like the child of Get The Lead Out and Last Child from Rocks, it's a great rocker and it has a riff that'll get stuck in your head. Legendary Child is a song written during the recording of Get A Grip, but the song was unfortunately left off of the album. It has a Zeppelin-like riff with lyrics that detail Aerosmith's entire career and even references some early songs (Walk This Way andAdam's Apple). What Could Have Been Love is a country-like ballad that took a little time to grow on me; I used to hate it, but I can enjoy it now. Street Jesus is the first Tyler/Perry/Whitford song since Voodoo Medicine Man, and it's the heaviest song on the album, incredible rocker. Can't Stop Lovin' You... no. Just no. Lover Alot is another song that took some time to grow on me, but I always loved the verses of the song, the chorus just took some time. We All Fall Down is a beautiful ballad written by Diane Warren, it's so amazing and so inspirational. Freedom Fighter is sung by Joe Perry and it sounds like a song that could have been on one of his early solo albums, another great rocker. Closer is another ballad that, while not a song that sticks out to me, is a good song, you can definitely enjoy it quite a bit. Something is another song that Joe Perry sings on the album; it details the band's hatred of their past (and possibly current) managers. Nice way to stick it to the man. Good song. Another Last Goodbye is a ballad that could easily compete with You See Me Crying, Home Tonight, and Mia. It may even be better. It is so beautiful, I can't think of a better way to close an album.<br /><br />Now those extra four songs that came with the deluxe edition from Walmart. Shakey Ground is a cover of an old funk song by The Temptations, and it fits really well with Aerosmith, they did an incredible job with it. It's extremely funky. Up On The Mountain is Tom Hamilton's first lead vocal performance on an Aerosmith song, and it is incredible. Great riff and great lyrics. Oasis In The Night is another song sang by Joe Perry, and it is a ballad. I never thought I'd see the day where Joe Perry would sing a ballad, but it happened and he did a great job. Sunny Side Of Love unfortunately never interested me.<br /><br />Overall, this album is incredible and I highly recommend it to any Aerosmith fan.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It isn't a shoot-em-up game.  It isn't a time killer.  You think.<br />Also, it doesn't take baby steps and suddenly change to be this inscrutable mess.
B004I744AS|3.0|A few too many quirks. Can be a little frustrating at times. Good layout if it could just get on with being a dictionary.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|Lots of action. Creative story line. Great addition to the trilogy. Not to mention how awesome the CGI is in the movie.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It's a gun game that can be both relaxing and challenging at the same time.I play on my Kindle Fire and the quality is great.
B000067FP8|4.0|I purchased this movie for my children because it was an oldie I watched as a child too! I would recommend this movie when looking for children's movies that don't contain adult content.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey in season 3.  I became addicted to it.  I watched uninterupted episodes for hours while it was dreary and rainy outside in February.  Fantastic realistic video.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My granddaughter was thrilled upon finding Sofia the First in her Easter basket!  She has watched it more times than I can count.  What a wonderful story!  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I read the book first and felt it was one of the best plots I have read lately.  The movie hits only the highlights of the very involved book, but never the less, is a really good movie as is anything with Matthew McConaughey.
B009JZTOG8|3.0|The writing is really starting to upset me.  Emma is not Henry's mother.  She gave up all rights to him with a &#34;closed adoption&#34;.  Regina is his mother and every time Emma, Snow or Charming jump in with their parenting I, want to jump through the tv and smack the hell out of them.  I am sure there will be a third season and hopefully it will improve upon the second, I would hate to quit watching the show.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|why would you make game like this? its like portable jaws! I cant stand jaws ether! I wont even watch my friend play
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Too bad it is another exercise in mass mind control.....Oh, well...I'm sure the resistance will be successful in the end.
B004Q08BE2|5.0|My ballet obsession has been defined in this brilliant compilation of a crazed mind. I couldn't believe how entertaining and mysterious the actions were. Each scene had a mystery and the actors were phenomenal. Is this going to be a classic? I will watch this again in the future and see what I think of it then. If you watch this movie, it will have an impact on you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a ton of fun! Its a great way to kill time and compete with friends! I am hooked.
B004WGIXX4|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing Natalie Portman in a new movie, but I knew it may be tainted with foolishness, since Ashton Kutcher also stars.  I only watched about 45 minutes of it and then I fell asleep. It is so boring, pointless,  no interesting characters to care for, not relatable and not funny. Do not waste your money.
0321885112|4.0|This review was originally posted on my blog at MatthewBogart.net    I don't like to write. I'm a terrible speller, and I have terrible sentence structure, I use punctuation haphazardly because I don't truly understand it. I usually embarrass myself when something I've written gets published. (Like, perhaps, right now?) When people say, \\"I don't know how to draw, I'm not an artist.\\" I understand. I don't know how to write, I'm not a writer. With all that being said, writing is simply too useful for me to not do it at all. Text messages, journal entries, scripts for comics, bizarre observations, I might not consider myself a writer but I write all over the place!    I wonder about the reverse. Do the people who have no interest in being a capital \\"A\\" Artist feel fine busting out sketches and doodles? I don't think most people do, and, until I read \\"The Sketchnote Handbook\\" by my friend Mike Rohde, it never occurred how much people who write off drawing are missing out.    Often people look at drawing and sketching as a superfluous trait akin to being a really good whistler. Good for you if you take it seriously, but it's hardly in the same league as having an understanding of language, reading, or writing. I think \\"The Sketchnote Handbook\\" gives us a sense that drawing is a great deal more useful to everybody. That's an important lesson to pass on.    Mike maintains that \\"sketch notes\\", which are a combination of words, symbols, and pictures, can be vastly more effective at getting to and retaining the core of an idea than traditional, text only notes. The book bills itself as a toolbox for helping people incorporate sketching into their note taking, specifically in the context of seminars, meetings, classes, and the like. With a lot of fun mixed in, he makes his point convincingly. I think you'd be hard pressed to argue with him.    Yet, while the idea that words, symbols and pictures add up to more than the sum of their parts seems like it would be right up the alley of a cartoonist, \\"words, pictures, and symbols\\" being just about our entire arsenal, there's another important aspect to the book that I think most cartoonists could learn from. Mike points out what little drawing skill you really need in order to kick an idea's ass. You don't have to draw like Chris Ware in order to convey gorgeous, inspiring, useful ideas in crude, crazy, stick figures.    Mike illustrates wonderfully, through tons of simple, beautifully drawn pages, that sketching is no more complex than writing. Once you've learned the alphabet, it doesn't matter if your penmanship rivals the great calligraphers of the last hundred years. All that matters is that your writing is legible. After that, what you're writing is usually all that matters.    ​A page of \\"The Sketchnote Handbook\\"  There's a free sample chapter if you'd like to take a look.  I'd love to hear what you think. Even better, I'd love to see something you've drawn. Anything. I swear. ANYTHING! You might not think I'd be interested in that thing you've drawn but you're wrong.  Post a link in the comments or send me a message with it.    You can see the original post with images here:  [...]
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This item is great for those that love Downton Abbey.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a Downton Abbey fan and wants to watch the episodes over and over or who would just like to do a recap before the next season starts!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|i began  reading  the hobbit in the early 70's only got to the third chapter,[was young,@ starting new job] , yrs later picked it up read it 3 times before going to the fellowship,waited for the movies @ was so impressed,loved it,now this,having to wait again is a hoot,did enjoy this one,@ look forward  to the next,the only reason for 4 stars is the waiting.
1416955070|1.0|Through a post on my LJ F-list, I'd looked up the series on Amazon and it sounds really great, but I can only echo one of the commenters replies: \\"Oh, bummer. The books sounded good, but I don't want to support that kind of behavior. :( \\"<br /><br />There is, apparently, a movie that's going to be premiering in August - the first of the \\"Mortal Instruments\\" series.<br /><br />While it looks totally awesome, the author is embroiled in controversy with regards to plagarism.<br /><br />Two links that I found informative are:<br /><br />fanlore.org/wiki/Cassandra_Claire<br />and<br />[...]<br /><br />Given the PTBs have made a movie of it, I'm beginning to wonder if plagiarized material isn't being taken seriously any more.  Does that mean everyone can now start publishing-for-profit all their fanfiction?  (Something I wouldn't do whatsoever given that one of my favorite fandom's, Numb3rs, creators has denounced fanfic via a personal Twitter conversation with her.)<br /><br />That said, I wish the author luck and hope that she can overcome her history because, if she can create more work that does not have its roots in other peoples creations, she's heading somewhere.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Wish this was on Amazon instant prime...great series i would suggest everyone to watch it. The governor is mean. yeah
B000N2HCM4|3.0|Let me say right off the bat, I recommend this book; it says more about the author than it does about race and truth and aspirations. It is important to understand Pres. Obama and where he is coming from to understand the vision he has for America. For whatever reason the author takes too much to heart, feels things too personally, morbidly sees all as if it related to him personally.  Where this will stand him in good stead  in reaching out as a community organizer it prevents him from seeing the bigger picture. He will never see the vision most Americans have, he will never understand the  dreams of our forefathers. It is very important that America should know this.<br />Stanford Beebe, author of \\"Ben Franklin and the Prius.\\"
B0070Z4LLW|2.0|No, I haven't seen it yet; I expected to find it on Amazon Instant Video for a reasonable price, but hey, $10 to \\"buy\\" the rights to stream it from Amazon? For that price, I'd expect to be getting an actual Blu-Ray disc. Come on, Amazon, what gives with this outrageous price?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent book and I had it read in 2 days. Power and or money seem to corrupt a lot of individuals no matter the circumstances.  As long as they have power over others it seems to work in most situations.  This book is a great example of this.  Also the book was well proofread for the kindle version.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Everything looks good--thanks! Disc is clean and scratch-free, and the package is in good shape. Thanks very much for this!

B00AH8FTT2|5.0|This book is a continuation of the previous book which was also a very good read.  He finishes with a cliff hanger, so I expect there will be another book in this series which will be wonderfu.
1607066017|5.0|In this book you get what you pay for. It is only 5 issues and just gives you a taste of what is to come. The witting gives just enjoy back story to intrigue and you can see the great potential here.  The funny thing is this is all really a flashback with the narration from the baby. Just read it and be excited for the future stories.  Other books to look at are the Fables delux series.

B008XBCJ34|3.0|There is so much info on the 3 disc collectors edition on the barebone theatric 3d page that it makes the consumer think they are getting the fullest edition when this is not the case. I know there are many reviews on here stating to avoid this copy because it is a barebone verion in 3d but I didn't believe them because there is also so many reviews on here stating this is in fact the collectors 3 disk set in 3d not to mention the sellers many notes on the collectors edition contained therein the page to buy the normal theatrical 3d version. Oh well, I own avatar 3d the theatrical version and dont feel ripped off just misled. I'm sure the 3 disk set will be marked down anyhow once another cameron film is released.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. It is really good and we get to go to different places that we don't get the opportunity to go to. It's great!!!!!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I was looking for an adventure type game that I could play to pass time and Lost City was  challenging enough to keep me solving and easy enough (thanks to the generous hints) to ease frustration. Loved this game!
0817439390|5.0|easy to understand, great information, great examples, gives you all the tool you need to keep it on manual and a little more.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book was good but not great. You will have to read it if you like the first one. I will have to read the third one now.

B00BS7HNTK|5.0|Great stuff!!!  I love hearing the folk/rock/pop fusion!  It's refreshing to hear honest and true music.  Home!  Ho, oh oh me!  How can you not feel safe?
0670023329|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. It was very good. A moving story that made you want to know more. It is sad but needed to be told. Go read it..you won't be disappointed.
B00138J342|5.0|This album is a gem!  &#34;Ten&#34; was a great debut but this really captures the bands expandable horizons.  Listen close!!!

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was a very good mind bending movie.. It helps you look at things differently or shows how others think. :)
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Accompanied by black and white drawings, simple advice like keeping a log, make sense. For writers, look up the remix Steal like a Writer (on YouTube) too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|accuweather is a simple easy to use app. it gives you the weather quickly and easily. it also has a lot of settings you can configure to your liking.
B009G41CG2|4.0|This is a great Mahjong Puzzle app.  You cannot cheat because there are no hints and no reshuffling of tiles which makes these puzzles a real challenge.  The only thing I did not like is some of the crazy layouts but I really love it.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|this is the 2nd book in the Game of Thrones series. I read these first 2 books before watching the DVDs. The world, characters and plots are complex and I love it! My favourite characters are Arya (strong female character), Jon Snow and Tyrion the dwarf (for his quick wit and intelligence).
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoy this game it legit! Even my 20 year old sister loves it she gets my kindle and just plays .... best app ever!!!!
B003KK6GJQ|4.0|Everyone raves about Jodi Picoult books. The first one i read 'song of a humpback whale' was one of the most dismal books I have ever read and one of the few i couldnt even finish reading (i rarely stop reading a book part way through). However, &#34;My sister's keeper&#34; was completely different and I really liked it. The ethical/moral issue at the heart of this book is of interest to me as a geneticist, plus I liked the characters in the book. I was very disappointed with the ending of the book however, and preferred the ending in the film version.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like Temple Run, you'll like this too.  My kids love playing it.  Easy movement and entertaining premise.  If you're looking for some time to kill, this is a great way to do it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I found I enjoyed this more than the Game of Thrones in many ways. This second book by Patrick Rothfuss even better than his first book The Name of the<br />Wind.  I'm waiting for the thirds book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It may take a long time to read but it's the best book ever you will greatly like this book I gave it 5 stars
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game but you need to buy gems with real money and you need to buy them a lot.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Loved the movie as I was a small kid, still love is now as a 17 year old. Great story line and the lesson learned from the movie relates to life, realizing this only once I got older, but still an amazing movie for kids, and enjoyable for adults.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Wife and I are very glad we bought the series. This shows just how good Tom Selleck is. No wonder he is on Blue Bloods
B0075564A8|5.0|Riveting.....Love Madonna........Great Price! Fast Shipping......A must have for all Madonna collectors. Excellent, Fabulous, Real.......An inside look at one of the icons of our time.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Wife and I are very glad we bought the series. This shows just how good Tom Selleck is. No wonder he is on Blue Bloods
B00B69UQJY|2.0|what a disappointment and now its being sold at starbucks... enough said. i suggest you save your money or buy another latte instead.
0062080237|5.0|I want to start off by saying that I loved this book. It captured my interest right away and kept it all the way through. I've been telling everyone about it and can't wait to get my hands on another book by Gaiman. The storyline is unique and off the wall and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Then there is the writing. Gaiman is a master of language. There are even passages I marked because I loved them so much and want to reread them again later. All that being said, I did not race through this book, but savored it. It took me a while to read because I didn't want to rush it..<br /><br />It is not only the writing that's intriguing, but the subject matter.  Gaiman explores interesting issues and philosophies, the way our culture has changed since people started coming to North America, and even what has happened since. This all revolves around the gods - the ancient ones from the old country and the new one's of technology and money.<br /><br />Shadow is in jail for a bank robbery and, after three years, is going to be released. He has everything to live for, until he finds out that his wife and best friend (also his future employer) have been killed in a car accident. Shadow leaves jail and goes home, unsure of what he will do. Along the way he meets Mr. Wednesday, who offers him a job. It turns out that Wednesday is an old world god, trying to rally up other gods to fight the new world gods for survival.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much about this book because I don't want to give it away. There are so many twists and turns, rich explorations of ideas, and stunning writing, that it will keep you turning the pages.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes (because I love books so much):<br /><br />  \\"What I say is, a town isn't a town without a bookstore. It may call itself a town, but unless it's got a bookstore it knows it's not fooling a soul.\\"
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Saw that this book had gotten a lot of (1) stars, and everyone is entitled to their opinion.  The majority however loved the book, so I bought it.  I am glad I took a chance based on the odds to read this book.  To me the written word can be interpreted any way the reader wants.  For me I didn't see it as 2 young immature teenagers, I saw them as you adults that had already grown up due the lives they had already led.  Travis was strong man who knew what he wanted and went after it.  He was human so when woman threw themselves at him oh well what was he to do?  Abby had issues with her Dad, she was street smart but relationshiply challenged.  I am not afraid to admit that this book had its ups and downs, but like all romantics I held out for HEA.  I cried through the scenes where they were hurting each and I laughed when they got back together.  I LOVED THIS BOOK, because it did what any work of fiction is supposed to do...it allowed me to escape into another world that is not my everyday reality.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game to play. Addictive. Once you start playing o you won't want to stop. Only bad part is the wait time for more lives.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am now addicted to Pinterest. I search this sight as often as possible for some great ideas!! I has something for everyone. Definitely a wonderful way to spend time.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|So I LOVE Tron, and Tron: Legacy has surpassed it. So I am deeply in love with it. To the point where it feels like I'm cheating on my girlfriend because of how much of my heart feels for this film.<br /><br />Yet another reason to love Jeff Bridges!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I absolutely hated the ending of this series.<br /><br />So many loose ends...too many \\"what, where who's\\"...enough of them to think that there will be a #6, but was bad enough to be greatful that there will not be.  I don't mind using my imagination to figure some of it out, but closure is missing.
B007N31ZKQ|5.0|I could sit here and tell you facts about the movie or quote it word for word, but I will simply say this....<br /><br />Buy this bluray and own the Coen Brothers masterpiece in stunning high definition!
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Recommended to me by a friend - a good read, inspirational. Really enjoyed his perspective on his time in the concentration camps. How really, the human spirit can get through anything.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Like, but needs more ways to get free diamonds.  App was free, but need diamonds for so many things. and they cost real $.
B0064QNS62|1.0|Downloaded on my Motorola and I can't start it on level one. Also installed on my wife's' tablet, where it was OK.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook is a mechanism for people who don't have lives to feel like others care about what they are doing. Hey Facebook users - get a life!
B006GHC3DS|5.0|The purchase of this SHM-SACD marks my comeback to this wonderful recording after many, many years.It has not lost any of its original appeal. Ever changing themes complement each other and flow in a natural way never disturbing the listener. Melodies are ear-catching and beautiful, choice of instruments makes this music sound rich although not too luscious. The sound quality deserves a mention as well. The combination of a high quality SACD remaster from original analogue tapes and SHM disc material yields a blissful listening experience. The only gripe is the substantial price. Yet the recording receives my highest recommendation. Money well-spent.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is sooooooo much fun if you love horse you will love this game. I am on this game all the time so get it
B0091REZMW|3.0|Enjoyable.  Don't like that you cannot buy diamonds with coins.  I would also prefer a few less phenomenon that need to be banished with diamonds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Game Is Amazing. It Always Has Different Places && Fun Characters. Lots of colors. Better Than Temple Run.! I Absolutely Love This Game
B0053O89XI|5.0|I love this show and I love that this had the Blu-rays, DVD and even Ultraviolet with it. Ultraviolet is kind of a lame excuse for digital copies but in a pinch they work.
B0092B125A|3.0|Still have not had the chance to completely look through it, but it seems worth while, and seems to cover important muscle groups of the hands.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|I love this show and I love the blu ray version. The episodes look great at the special features are fun.
B003SHDRQ6|5.0|Certainly worth the buy for the sake of building up your understanding in forceful posing and dynamic drawings.  Worth the buy.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Seriously, built insanely well and it is super convenient. I wish everything charged like this. Google should bundle this with the tablet, it's a must have.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|This game may look awesome but the steering is very hard to master and also it lags out your game way to much. it nearly froze on me. if you want to make your kindle slower, I suggest getting this app.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a great game it just seems like it is a copy of temple run. I think that everyone should give this game a chance
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fun and witty - with some morality woven in. I loved these episodes. It is a shame it was taken off the air.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|you may or may not like it but so get it and try it and if you don't like it just delete it but if you do like it well get as many coins as you can
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I never watched the series when it was actually playing. I got DVD's from a friend and fell in love! This was a great series and I did end up buying my own set of DVD's.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was not prepared to enjoy this show much because I don't watch much television but alas, I'm hooked and thoroughly loving it! The acting is flawless, the set is gorgeous and the story line is fascinating! I really can't ask for any more, can anyone?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the fact that it progressively gets more challenging as you go along. it is a tub game the whole family will enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow..Loved the book!!! Better than the movie if You ask me.. Can't wait to start reading the second book!!!<br />Whoa
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rocks I love the challenges and updates. This is a game that keeps your attention and its great on my kindle.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|its very good but it stalls sometimes. i really enjoy the different aspects as you go further to make this game unique.
1476734941|5.0|So far it's working and the recipes are quite good and easy to prepare.  A great a take on maintaining and maximizing your health.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time. My friend makes the most awesome creations. I tottaly recommend this.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|5 Stars because I Love Colin Farrell.  Just a find movie.  Got both versions, old and new, as I like the original but wanted the remake with Farrell.  Great disc, no hangups.  Recommend to all.  Was gift, and this is what my friend John said.<br />Cecy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|for a fresher this game is great.  we are both enjoying it and have become addicted to it! better then smoking!
B002ZG976U|5.0|Can't believe at 50 that Cher looks and acts SO GOOD.  Super movie, disc pristine.  Wanted for a long time.  This was bought for a gift, and this is what John said.<br />Cecy
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is the second time I have read this series and I have never laughed or cried more. This trilogy is one of the best ever.
B00899F0G8|4.0|Began watching PLL at the suggestion of a friend, reluctantly I did and ended up not bei g able to stop.  I watched all 3 seasons in approximately 2 weeks.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Plain and simply not my type of books.  The writing was ok but toward the third book it became very boring
B000FA675C|5.0|The movie was good but the book is great! I love that its just different enough to keep you engaged.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have spent a lot of time in the gym during my life, but I took a break and didn't go back. After a 13 year break I decided I was ready to start working out again. Lots of things have changed  from that point to now as far as programs(reps and number of sets, over-training) and nutrition. I saw the rating the book was getting, so I thought I would take a look at it. I was amazed how this book gets to the point with no filler or long drawn out sciencey type stuff(It has links to that info if the geek in you wants to read that too). I have been on the program about a month and I have had great results so far. My gf has noticed the difference in my physique and I am ordering the ladies version as well for her. The BLS program is great for beginners to advanced lifters and the nutrition is easy to follow. Another great thing is that to get great results so you don't need to live in the gym. The author encourages that if you have questions to contact him, which I did over a nutrition question and he provided an answer within 24 hours and was very helpful. If you want top notch information about all aspects of weight training, cardio and nutrition this is the book for you.
B0036TGSR6|3.0|It's probably ok.  I did not finish it, but for some people, it might be worth finishing.  Just not to my liking, but it's probably fine.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|FANTASTIC! Hard to put down, loved the characters and story line. I enjoy Karen Moning's writing and will definitely read her next book.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A record of the harsh reality of war fought in a foreign country for reasons that are blurred by the actual outcomes.  The commitment of a soldier (SEAL) first to his country and second to his new wife and children is disappointing given the promises/moral undertakings given to them.  The killings of endless thousands opens one to the harsh realities of the religious conflicts in our world.  The killing score sheet of Chris Kyle compares to a competition with the highest score. A book to be read with these comments, which you may disagree with, in mind.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|I LIKE THE REST OF THE SAXON FAN'S WERE GETTING RESTLESS WAITING FOR THE CD TO COME OUT.

B00BBW16HW|5.0|Based on an inspiring true story, this is very well acted, beautiful, visually striking and with excellent dialogue. Truly enjoyed it and the chemistry between the two main characters which is what the story runs on is excellent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome. I once sat on my kindle fire 3 hours playing this game. If this cost $7.99 I would buy it. That's just how good it is.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg perfectly articulates the &#34;double bind&#34; women feel in the workforce and how women's generally more dominant traits can hold them from seeking the highest positions in their organization.  I believe this book does a good job of promoting women's choices, whichever path they choose, and providing a few good takeaway points which will be useful for women at various points in their careers and desires. The book does not demean any choice, whether to work or not, but merely provides women and men with strategies to make the most of those choices.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app.  is great I can play at my own pace..it is a winner. I will be using this one for a long time
B004G5Z0B4|5.0|We didn't quite understand this set came in a different format from US discs, vendor understood and promptly credited our account.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's so getting all the characters and seeing all the new places that the game takes us
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really fun. i play it all of the time, it's very addicting. i love the world tour its doing.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Too many people expect an experience that matches your browser.  It's a free mobile app.  The point is to get the basics of what you need while on the go.  It's perfect for what it was designed for. Need more? Buy a PC.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|If you like the Batman series you will like this movie.  I got it for my husband as a gift and he really enjoyed watching it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I don't see how this could get any less. It's a basic calculator app that has never forced closed or glitched on me and has never miscalculated.  If you have problems with this app it's either your mobile, or human error.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'd like to start out by saying, this game has been very addictive. The game is so much fun. It gives different courses and lots of prizes to win. I'm very pleased with this game. Thank you to the creator.
B002ZG98VE|4.0|Its the only version of robin hood that doesnt make the main character look like a comic book hero,  Im also a huge fan of Russel Crowe,,,
B00AKFG15S|5.0|the book was just amazing the way the lives of various characters were linked keeps the reader totally engaged and guessing as to what will happen next. A new generation of clifton-barrington was shown. in all the book was a good read.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Love the CD for the music I bought it for, not so crazy for the cardboard case which is now dented and bent. Will have to get creative with a blank case. But never mind, there is not a bad song on this CD.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|I felt is was a strong book on a hard subject.<br />I believe in the United States Navy.<br />Thank you Chris.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Got this as FAOTD and have been enjoying it. First I thought &#34;oh crap another game with no instructions!&#34; but learning as you go seems to part of the fun of this game.  Think I finally figured out that &#34;invincible&#34; mode is intended to mess with your head... only a guess but going into a totally weird zone may be the price to pay for being invincible?  Overall, I think that the developers put a lot of thought into messing with players' heads. Throwing strange new things at you, then something from a previous level turns up again. Makes it hard to put down because I want to see what's coming next.  I like the old-school graphics, and the music, too.
B000ZM1FXO|2.0|Just plain weird, but it was kind of interesting seeing those actors so young.  But I would not recommend it to most people.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|great game fun for all...if you like diablo you will love eternity warriors2. plus it is free to play so u cant beat the price.
B005LAII1C|5.0|If you have a sense of humor you will love this film, heck if you enjoy a decent plot you'll like it! I laugh my arse off every time!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|cool I guess its a lot of work to get anything it is also confusing at first so hi hops hi loop da loop
B009WO7NQO|4.0|the app itself is great, for some reason amazon gets the updates really late, kind of a hummed if you are hungry for new levels.
1594487154|5.0|Far too many people simultaneously perpetuate and distaste the old notion of sales because they don't know any different.  Daniel Pink successfully debunks the notion of sales and effectively presents a new view of selling that applies to everyone.<br /><br />This is a great book for anyone who views themselves a selling professional.  Careful, it may make you very uncomfortable.  If you are paying attention, it will transform your sales behaviors.<br /><br />The real power in this book is how it reminds everyone that they are all selling something -- as humans, we are all in sales. Daniel Pink offers ways for those who believe they are not sales people to become more comfortable and confident in how they \\"sell.\\"<br /><br />This is a game changer writing.  Highly recommended for everyone who interacts with others.  In other words, this is a must read for all!
B004L9IDD2|4.0|Although it was more of an action fest than the original series, lacking the psychological elements that made it so great, and I could have done without the fan service, it is still a great movie and essential for any eva collection.
B005LAII80|4.0|Firstly, other than the title, this has no connection with that stinky pile that contained Stallone and Rob Sneider.  Even the stories don't line up which was a great decision; it's a clean start.  Lets start with the uniform. It looks like something a tactical cop would wear; leather, weathered, scratched up.  The uniform has seen a lot o action, so has the bike.  The city landscape is dirty, gritty, unruly and filled with desperate people.  So the crime is off the scale.  A place where Dredd belongs.  Keith Urban plays Dredd the way you imagine; like a Clint Eastwood western.  Tough, smart, and a man of few words who's ready to bust some caps.  However, devoid of the ego typical of these type of heros.  He is not a man on a mission.  Many of judgements are very matter of fact.  Just a man with a job to do.  However the action is any but mattter of fact;  if you want someone to get dead in a hurry; try 3 belt fed 50 cals and not concern yourself with the bystanders.  These dudes weren't playing around.  The story, however, was not entirely original.  It is similar to The Raid: Redemption or you can even see shades of New Jack City.  I think this is better film than both of those films, largely thanks to the main character.  Keith Urban is an actor that doesn't get his due, and this film should have raised his stock.  I just think people still associate Dredd with Stallone and that is unfortunate.  Best thing to do is pretend that the earlier film did not happen.  This is the first film, and it was done right.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Thanks to amazon for quick and no hassle return and rep lament however the DVD materials used to make copies are defective. Both the first and second copies freezes and not worth keeping the DVD copies though I was able to watched it however so many scenes stops, freezes and then continue. I watched lots of DVD on the same DVD player I know it's the copies not my player is defective!! I hope amazon will still replace my copy. I love The Hobbit movie and I like to have my own DVD collection.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I love Jessica Chastain's  character in this movie.  Her determination, courage, faith, persistence, really showcased the feminine<br />spirit at its best, despite all the machismo characters all around her.  At the end of the movie, when she was inside the airplane, and when she realized that, its finally over, and also that her efforts were finally recognized,  it then showed her softness, and fragility, and the tenderness  of the human spirit.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I play this game everyday. It's a lot of fun. Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|it has neat effects and spooky story line.  I like a lot of the games this company offers.  I like the search games that have stories to them...this is one of my favorites.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|See the title above.  This is not a pay-to-win.  Lots of fun to play solo or online.  Traditional MOBA with nice graphics.  Character balance could be better.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I love this app.  I use it constantly to find out what song is on and also to remind myself which ones I want to purchase later.  It does struggle a bit with live versions of songs though.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|It was okay, not great.  My husband and I are Judi Dench fans but it is unbelieveable that senior citizens would want to move to India.
1575666286|4.0|I was introduced to the Gerson therapy through a documentary on health and diet and became intrigued to learn more about the healing of cancer and other life-threatening diseases through therapy of juicing and consuming only healthy, unprocessed foods. This is a great resource book for anyone seeking alternative therapy, or guide to a healthier body. Dr. Gerson was a pioneer in his field and his clinic, now lead by his daughter give other options to the mainstream medical protocol for fighting cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other medical conditions. Knowledge is power, and this book shares a different way of viewing the power of our bodies to heal themselves, with the help of good nutrition. An alternative to chemo, radiation? Why not ponder that a little further? Check out the documentary &#34;Food Matters&#34; might just save your life, or at least make it healthier. Dr. Gerson had a couple of ideas worth reading about.
B003O86FMW|5.0|OMG its one the best books ever I love it I'm so glad I was forced to read it ,and it has that crazy twist at the end that leaves you wanting more. So get the last one
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I show this as part of my WW II unit to students.  It's a great film, nice if you can match it up with the documentary of the true Memphis Belle.  If showing it to students note there is some language (but compared to what is shown even on TV today it's &#34;not so bad&#34;.  Regardless, I require parent permission (and I will hit mute) for my piece of mind.<br /><br />Great film, DVD shipped quickly.  I have always enjoyed it and the kids (8th graders) liked it too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's amazing and fun. It is very time consuming and it didn't stop working and its a block as st  to challenge friends and family.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|Despite all the venom and hate spread in the direction of the Boston 5, NKOTB has spent years perfecting their sound as a group, and the proof shows again in this latest work. Critics may pan that they are not truly a &#34;boy band&#34; anymore, or that, in their 40's now, the guys are not the hit makers they once were, but after seeing their tour two years ago with Backstreet Boys, I knew that New Kids On The Block was not done with making great music. While the album retains their roots as pop singers with songs like &#34;Remix (I Like The)&#34;, &#34;Now or Never&#34;, and the dance floor movers &#34;Crash&#34; and &#34;Take My Breath Away&#34;, it is the soulful expression of lyrics in songs like &#34;Fighting Gravity&#34; and &#34;Jealous (Blue)&#34; show that the maturity and growth was not in vain, and really make the album. My vote for best track goes to &#34;Wasted On You&#34;, which aptly describes the intense feelings of lost love and time spent in a dead end relationship with a clarity of thought that resonates with heart strings that have the same issues.<br /><br />Most songs have charged melodies with strong guitar riffs and heavy drum tracks that, while being strong, are not overbearing and actually compliment the lyrics and emotions being expressed in each song. Each member's harmonies blend and compliment the songs like a well-oiled machine, which after more than 20 years of work together should come as no surprise, but is definitely refreshing compared to the latest Top 40 fare dished out on the airwaves nowadays. The album overall is a driving force that demonstrates that the boy band components like Justin Timberlake and Backstreet Boys are not alone when making the transition from Pop to R&B, and NKOTB do it with a flourish to boot that was lacking on the last album. The shine on this record will be hard to dull, and with a strong lineup of dates on their Package Tour this summer with renewed boy band act 98 Degrees and R&B heavyweight champs Boyz II Men, it seems that NKOTB has decided to make their impression on modern music just that much more indelible. Here's hoping they don't rush things, but keep producing quality albums like this in the future.

B00BJA2VFW|3.0|It was fun and addictive.  However, my tree was not finished.  For some reason when you play 100 of the required grids, it stops playing to finish the tree.  I feel ripped off.  It would have been helpful to know before purchase.  So, it is fun while it plays.  Just know it does not let you go past 100 plays and does not finish the tree.
B005LZWA5W|5.0|Terrific cast, timeless script, great direction, a true Best Picture.  I have it on my phone, my tablet, as a dvd, and on my dvr.  Like the boozer with his hidden bottle, I just need to know I can get at it when I feel the urge!

B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is one of Grisham's best stories in several recent novels.  All along the reader wonders how the hero's plans will fall apart.  However, when the reader hits the last page, he finds no twists and turns. The plan has been followed, and it works.  Seems like the author just lost interest and decided to quit.  The epilogue seems to confirm this. Please, Mr. Grisham, don,t be lazy next time!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Move over Harry Potter!  The Hunger Games started out as a young adult novel and ended up the same way.  It is a very exciting and interesting view on a future society where children are thrown into the ring every year for the annual Hunger Games to fight to the death!  I don't want to give any more away, but I knew after reading the first book in 2009 that this would eventually be a movie!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  In the beginning, you certainly don't understand the depth of the characters.  They unfold as the story progresses.  I would describe this as a psychological thriller.  It was definitely a page turner.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Great game, very similar to Advance Wars DS for Nintendo DS.  My only gripe is that it ended too quickly!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I enjoyed this court room drama, about two young childhood lovers, and how many twists this story takes. truth prevails in the end, this is a book you will have difficulty putting down.

B005K17RU0|3.0|Not impressed, I liked the old version.  I would really like to download the old version if that is possible.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|Very interesting game where you mine minerals form nearby stationary asteroids.  The only catch is that you can only get to them via connecting power nodes.  Everything you build must be attached to your space station via a power node, and all your weapons drain your station's power, and you can only build a limited amount of structures so you have to decide if you want more mining power or more defenses.  It brings into play some very unique situations.
B0091REZMW|5.0|very nice and remember me the london mirrow :))) also, i like this type of games. recommend it. and the graphic is really nice. looks like a real world and the best: its totally free!

B00B8PRDHE|5.0|Although, like many Ringo fans, I wish that Mr. Starkey would devote a concert entirely to his own songs (as he did with [[ASIN:B002G3DTS4 Soundstage: Ringo Starr and the Roundheads]] in 2005).  But this concert, filmed at Nashville's historic Ryman Auditorium on July 7, 2012 - Ringo's 72nd birthday - is the best All-Starr concert yet.  Not only does it feature Ringo perennials such as saxist Mark Rivera and drummer Gregg Bissonette, plus All-Starr alumnus Todd Rundgren, the lineup is incredible - Gregg Rolie of Santana and Journey, Steve Lukather of Toto, Richard Page of Mr. Mister, and a special guest appearance from Ringo's brother-in-law Joe Walsh (who is married to Barbara Bach Starkey's sister).  All of the artists perform their classic hits from the '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s, and Ringo opens the show with Carl Perkins' \\"Matchbox\\" from the Beatle days, and does two songs (\\"Wings\\" and \\"Anthem\\") from his latest CD [[ASIN:B006OHJT5K Ringo 2012 [Amazon.com Exclusive CD+DVD Version]]].  You'll also hear Ringo perennials such as \\"Photograph,\\" \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" \\"I Wanna Be Your Man,\\" John Lennon's \\"I'm The Greatest\\" (\\"Now I'm only 72, and all I wanna do is boogaloo!\\"), \\"It Don't Come Easy,\\"  and \\"Act Naturally.\\"  For the finale, \\"With A Little Help From My Friends/Give Peace A Chance,\\" the All-Starr cast is joined by Joe Walsh's daughter Lucy, and several Nashville guest stars, including Brendan Benson, Kix Brooks, former Roundhead Gary Burr, Vince Gill (where was wife Amy Grant?), Brad Paisley, and former All-Starrs Felix Cavaliere (The Rascals) and Richard Marx.<br /><br />Unlike previous Ringo All-Starr concerts, no audio CD was issued this time, only the DVD.  It's just as well, because this concert deserves to be seen, not just heard.<br /><br />Now, if Universal would put out a DVD of Ringo's 70th birthday concert, filmed on July 7, 2010 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, which features Paul McCartney's spine-tingling performance of The Beatles' \\"Birthday,\\" which came as a total surprise to Ringo.  Look for that clip on YouTube.

B00AR3WD8W|5.0|I purchased the [[ASIN:B00025L4JO Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii (Deluxe Edition)]] two-DVD set in 2004, and enjoyed it immensely. Until now, I did not own the audio CD of the shows (I never had the vinyl, as I was not that big an Elvis fan then), but Sony Legacy has put together an excellent two-CD set, commemorating the 40th Anniversary of this concert, which was broadcast in most parts of the world on January 14, 1973, but was not shown in the U.S. until April 4, 1973, due to a conflict with Super Bowl VII (the undefeated Miami Dolphins 14, the Washington Redskins 7).<br /><br />The first disc contains the 24 tracks from the actual concert that appeared on the original vinyl double LP, though they are in conventional stereo, not Quadraphonic, as the original LP was (can there be a Quadraphonic CD? I doubt it). The second disc, originally issued by RCA as [[ASIN:B0006IYYTE Elvis: The Alternate Aloha]] in 1988, is the rehearsal concert that was filmed in front of a live audience as a &#34;fail-safe&#34; measure. Both concerts have similar programs, except that three songs done in the final concert were not performed at the rehearsal - &#34;Johnny B. Goode,&#34; &#34;I Can't Stop Loving You,&#34; and the medley of &#34;Long Tall Sally&#34; and &#34;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.&#34; The second disc also includes the five bonus songs that were taped after the concert for the U.S. version of the TV special - &#34;Blue Hawaii,&#34; &#34;Ku-U-I-Po,&#34; &#34;No More&#34; (which was cut from the U.S. NBC special, but later appeared on home video releases), &#34;Hawaiian Wedding Song,&#34; all from the soundtrack of [[ASIN:6305837708 Blue Hawaii]], and Gordon Lightfoot's &#34;Early Mornin' Rain.&#34; Another difference is that the concert's &#34;Closing Riff,&#34; which follows the concert's last song, &#34;Can't Help Falling In Love,&#34; is a separate track on the second CD and lasts a lot longer. Unlike other Elvis concerts, we do not hear the announcement that &#34;Elvis has left the building!&#34;<br /><br />2016 UPDATE: The latest version of ALOHA FROM HAWAII, included in [[ASIN:B019YQJRKO The RCA Albums Collection]] box set, has the original die-cut packaging, but only the final concert, not THE ALTERNATE ALOHA concert, though the five bonus tracks (listed above) are included.<br /><br />This was the last major televised concert that Elvis would give in his lifetime, though other live material would be released posthumously (look for a Legacy CD reissue of [[ASIN:B000002WEV Elvis In Concert]] in 2017, the 40th Anniversary of that concert and The King's death, but don't hold your breath waiting for a concert DVD - to date, the Presley Estate has never allowed a release of ELVIS IN CONCERT in ANY home video format, not Betamax, VHS, SelectaVision, LaserDisc, DVD, or Blu-ray - because of The King's awful physical appearance. Only those who recorded the concert off the air when it was originally broadcast on CBS-TV in late 1977 are lucky enough to have it, although some of the home tapings have been bootlegged and/or downloaded to YouTube. Some clips from the concert do show up in various Elvis documentaries.)<br /><br />Although this CD set is excellent, I would also recommend the DVD. Although a [[ASIN:B000G7PO6M single-disc version from 2006]] is available, I would recommend the Deluxe Edition mentioned above. It not only contains all of the music from both shows, but archival footage of Elvis arriving in Hawaii, several outtakes of the &#34;bonus songs&#34; mentioned above, and the re-edited U.S. version of the concert, broadcast as a &#34;special program in Living Color&#34; on NBC, April 4, 1973.<br /><br />Either way, audio or video, you will love this concert if you are an Elvis fan.<br /><br />By the way, ALOHA FROM HAWAII VIA SATELLITE was not the first worldwide satellite broadcast.  That honor goes to the 1967 British-based arts documentary OUR WORLD, which featured the first performance of The Beatles' &#34;All You Need IsLove.&#34;  OUR WORLD was not widely broadcast in the U.S., except on a few &#34;educational television&#34; stations.except on a few &#34;educational television&#34; stations.
0517548232|5.0|This book is outstanding and should be required reading in every high school and college; period!<br /><br />It captures, in one simple sentence, the essence of economics and applies it in multiple examples of legitimate economic activities, even laying waste to economic theories commonly promoted in the media.  No previous background or experience in economics is required because it is such an easy read that anyone will be able to have a basic understanding of economics after reading.  The chapter length is ideal for commutes (on a bus, train, taxi, or airplane) or simply reading during a lunch break, even in the evenings.  Although no previous understanding of economics is needed even the most experienced economist would benefit from reading this well written book.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in understanding the economics of yesterday, today and/or tomorrow through an non-political, unbiased, logical, and practical perspective this is the book for you.  Although it is a useful tool for understanding economics it will also help a person sift through the plethora misleading economic theory often promoted by politicians, professors, talking heads, managers, and analysts (etc.) through the various types of media.<br /><br />Had I simply read this book when I was in high school I could have saved myself 15-20 years of trial and error trying to understand economics through reading other books, reading economic journals, watching educational videos, following the financial news, and I would even include going to college (with a formal education in finance/economics).  This will be required reading for my children as soon as they show an interest in economics, finance, and politics.<br /><br />I am personally on my third read through this book and I keep multiple copies of this book on hand (I stock up when it goes on sale for $8.50) for spur of the moment gifts to friends and family who have an interest in learning more about economics or express frustration with conflicting information found elsewhere.with conflicting information found elsewhere.

B00181JGI2|5.0|You know how embryonic stem cells can basically stitch themselves into many different types of other cells and actually become that tissue? That's what this movie is like. The acts and scenes have so comfortably woven into my conscious and subconscious self that they are now memories just like any other. I remember pulling out my sunglasses from my sweater pocket while the Big Lebowski lectured me in his spacious study. I remember the flash and ringing in my ears when the Malibu fascist chief of police beaned my forehead with his coffee mug; when my feelings about Jesus changed when Walter told me he was a pederast; when I left my coffee unfinished at the diner because Walter was melting down about a toe and 'Nam; the smell of my car when I got it from the impound, and the relief at finding the actual clue, Larry's homework; Maude sharing that she'd like to be fertilized; the moment I said Us instead of Me just before the drop; and hundreds of others. I wrote a review for this movie a long time ago. So long ago I don't remember writing it, but that's alright, because the Dude has filled the gaps. The Dude abides.

Some people you can actually shop from their list, Making coffee, weighing produce to make a ticket, and also putting money into a cash register. These are great games, that never get old.

0345803485|2.0|Let me begin by saying, I am a writer myself. Not published as of yet, but if this can get published I should have no problems. The story itself is engaging. Very repetitive, but it's interesting enough to keep me reading. That being said, I'm on chapter four. What I really have an issue with here are all the grammar mistakes, the punctuation mistakes, and the recycling of the same five adjectives over and over. And I'm only on chapter four! Did no one edit this book? Does she not have access to a thesaurus? I am so disappointed with everyone who was involved in bringing this book into print in its current state. It is clearly a rough draft.<br /><br />However, I will end on a positive note and say that she builds character attachment well, and is consistent with the personality traits of her characters. Also, every time she writes, \\"oh my\\" (which is too often), I read it in George Takei's voice, but that's me. If the book gets better, I'll come and update my review.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved it to perfect for words. I hope you read it. You will die because it is Soo good

B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is an incredible book. To be able to keep a story cracking along at such a pace when you have a person stranded all alone with no other character interaction is a testament to the author's ability. The situations that arise and how the hero solves them are brilliantly done. Thanks
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|I rented this a second time for my family and it still does not work on blue ray TV. It only is clear on the laptop. We have Direct TV.<br /><br />Please credit.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I'll start by saying that I didn't read the Host so reading through some of the other reviews for the pieces that are missing I understand exactly why the movie wouldn't have worked for them. I went through the same thing last month after reading through Beautiful Creatures and then watching the movie which was a disappointing shadow of am amazing story. That being said, I really REALLY enjoyed this movie. I don't think I'll be reading the book in this case though. I can appreciate how much everyone enjoyed it but for this once I'll just stick with the movie.<br /><br />Updated:<br />Okay the book was on sale via Kindle. Bought it and it's on my to-read list. I enjoyed the movie that much and the book can only serve to fill in a few blanks and enhance :)

B00866JL96|2.0|I thought I would really enjoy it, but it seems like all the best parts were those that were seen in trailers. Will end up giving it away, it is not one of those movies that I will watch again and again.

B0050DIWFC|1.0|A decent idea poorly executed.  The question of who and what is evil is valid and one well suited for fiction as it is often too disturbing in reality.  however the long grand jury passages are perhaps too realistic to carry a plot.

0812983459|5.0|The philosophical bent of this National Bestseller had me hooked from the start.  Harold and Maureen were NOT living the dream life of retired couples.  Harold was boarded and boarding.  Maureen complained about anything and everything, with Harold being at fault for all her disappointments.<br /><br /> When a seemingly innocuous letter came for Harold, everything began to change. An old work colleague, Queenie Hennessy, has written Harold to tell him she is dying of cancer.  Harold hasn't seen her, nor really thought about her in 20 years.  BUT, he feels the need to write her a short consoling note.  Thus the \\"pilgrimage\\" begins. In taking his letter to the mailbox, he runs into a young girl who tells a tale of \\"just believing\\".  Harold then decides that if her walks the 500 miles, to hand deliver his letter to Queenie, she will keep living.<br /><br />During his miles and miles of walking, he meets many different people. Some want to just talk with him and give a helping hand.  Some, become nuisances in many different ways.  Through all of this, Harold thinks back on his life and gains different perspectives of it's meaning for him and Maureen.<br /><br />I agree with all the many fans who have made this book a bestseller, and  book award nominee.  The writing style is engaging and very compelling.  Harold's perspective on his life, reads almost like a journal, with life lessons and questions intertwined. There is a great deal of sadness in this book, but many lessons learned in the backward perspective Harold attains from his very unusual walking trip.  Different, but wonderful book!!

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|As a Preschool Teacher that plays video games once in a while (more when I was younger), I took delight in this movie. I watched it with my sweetheart, and I think he liked it, too.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I do not think it is developmentally appropriate for preschoolers, that is, children under 5. Children under 5 are still developing their understanding of reality vs imagination. Wreck-It Ralph is a \\"good guy\\" who is actually a \\"bad guy\\" trying to be a \\"good guy\\", even though he does \\"bad\\" stuff. There is a lot to follow to get to the message of this movie, and I have seen first hand that some preschoolers cannot get there yet.<br /><br />This movie condones a lot of violence and confuses \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" (words that I don't like to use, anyway, but that's getting into my classroom and my philosophy) in a way that young children cannot yet understand the way older people can. However, I highly recommend this movie for people over 5 years old.
B006LSZECO|4.0|the characters really came to life, There were a lot of twists and turns......very engrossing.  Great read from beginning to end.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I didn't think I would be into this band, but after previewing the album, I'm a huge fan. I love their sound because they're so versatile. I love 'Radioactive'
B000H305U0|5.0|I have played it numerous time already.<br />I never knew justin timberlake had great R & B music.<br />would buy more from him in the future.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I like that this album is different from all the other pop albums. I love her voice, it's so unique.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|love it! it adds all of the dinosaurs from the movie! love it even though there are a fie bugs.
B009410J9I|5.0|My husband had mentioned wanting this DVD when he had heard about it ad he is a big Stray Cats fan. I decided to order it as a little surprise and he is happy with it. It shipped in a timely manner and was in good condition.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I wanted more with Shirley McClaine.  I'm kind of getting bored with the characters.  The way they handled a gay story felt more like wishful thinking than a true depiction of the time period.
B008VBYN80|5.0|It's just like the Oregon trail. I am fan of city build games and this one is really fun and cool
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|I wish there were better special features about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  I loved the movie and expected more from the Blu-ray disc.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really like this book when I'm bored I have something to do<br />This book is really awesome I love it
B0042AGN7I|4.0|There is a great featurette about this skirmish in Somalia that's about 30 minutes.  The movie, of course, is great.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|The book is insightful and almost  comprehensive on almost every aspect of normal health issues and the most efficient ways the author has found to deal with their . I found it in my local library and wanted a copy for myself, but it is a thick tome. The information charts and illustrations are all there, and both the price and portability are improved in  this format.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I was loving this book, right up until the last few pages. I've never been more disappointed in an ending.<br /><br /> Twice i flipped back a few pages, thinking i'd missed something.<br /><br />So many strings left to tie up.<br /><br />Too many unanswered questions.
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|I like Noctua fans. I'm in for the quiet with good airflow. These are the ticket. Price could be lower.
B006OAB432|5.0|The album is very good, and to be able to let my daughter listen to the fullness of vinyl was awesome.
B008602KQI|4.0|It was nice, it followed the book for the most part. I really wish they could have found a way to include zombie versions of the dead tributes!
B0017VG69U|5.0|We needed this Season to help complete our series.  Love the old school Star Trek.  Definitely recommend it for those who are a fan!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this game because you can wear armor and spawn things like dragons a d I think it's really fun and great
B008PQAPLU|5.0|Great collection of songs for this concert. Just left out his greatest performance ever from the concert with &#34;Woke up Dreaming&#34; but still a fantastic concert!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Being a Colin Firth fan, I learned of this book when it was announced that Firth would be playing Ben in the upcoming film version.  I read it on my Kindle from start to finish in two days!  So much of the clever plot hinges on an amnesiac's written journal - she jots down what she experiences each day, so that she can reread and remember the next - that I'm wondering how on earth that will translate successfully to film.<br /><br />I can't say I was totally shocked by the twist at the end - but getting there was very gradual and well plotted.  This is a book I will recommend to my friends and family - anyone who is looking for an absorbing and highly entertaining psychological thriller!
B002R27J1W|5.0|Audrey Hepburn does an amazing job!!! I love this movie and think its a classic. Perfect for anyone's movie collection.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This is an AMAZING movie full of suspense and action that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire thing! I defiantly recommend this movie for teens and above because of the scary content and language, all in all it's the type of movie that you would watch over and over again!!!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I liked the premise and some of the characters got my interest up (only to be discarded at the drop of a hat); now that I have read more of Scalzi's work I know he likes doing that. The story is thought provoking enough to keep me reading and it takes an interesting twist.<br /><br />This is a good stand alone read and got me started on the Human Division series which jettisons characters with wild abandon. I don't think character un development is a virtue.  The chapters in that yarn ( purchased individually) are very uneven in quality but they all cost the same. Enough.
B0098460O4|5.0|My husband and I really like this CD.  They are much better on this recording than when on Britain's Got Talent.  Hubby puts it on a lot when he gets tired of the jazz I like to listen to.  And I enjoy this CD as much as my husband.  Nice listening music.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|great game can't wait to try and beat all level.....just dont like the fee for the one player but glu has to have a way to make money too.
B004G600A4|5.0|I have screens and a headrest monitors and my daughter loves it giving her something to watch while I listen to my music.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|After buying the concert and falling in love with the musical score, I just had to have the movie version. I just got through watching it three days in a row.  As if the beautiful music and lyrics were not enough, the performances by Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Samantha Barns, & Russel Crowe, simply blew me away. This movie is so touching, and when I recommended it to my daughter, I told her that when she complains about what's wrong with this country, all she has to do is remember this movie that shows what life was like in 19th century France to know how good we have it here.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a super fun game. You can collect from your dinosaurs at any time which is super nice. I love this app
B004J64QSI|4.0|Familiarizing myself with the musical score made me want to see the full movie, which I sure am glad I did
B009UX2YAC|4.0|So addictive and fun for children could be easier by putting less trains around but other than that it's a good game
1118109791|5.0|That is really a good guide for GMAT test, I like it very much and I will recommend it to others.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|All I can say is WOW!! Her voice still floors me! I love the song choice on this CD, a nice variety that shows the depth of her talent. Thoroughly enjoyed the duets. Her voice blends especially well with Donny Osmond. Susan seems to be getting better and better and the full orchestra arrangements behind her are wonderful. I would love to hear her sing some American Standards in her next album. I gave this album a 5 star rating for song choice, arrangements, orchestration and of course Susan's flawless voice. Hope she does more soon.
B00AU15HPC|3.0|I thought the music sounded dull, not like the strong songs like &#34;Nights in White Satin, and &#34;Never Comes the Day&#34;. They all pretty much sounded the same. Sorry Justin, just my opinion.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Cannot go wrong with Sons of Anarchy's songs they choose to feature in their series. Nice collection. Katey Segal is featured in some of the pieces. What an outstanding singer!
B006CR2PD0|5.0|Very interesting romantic tryst with some unexpected plot turns. Wonderfully acted and very nice story. Worthy of being in a collections of cutting edge classicals.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It keeps clutching when I try to chat. Besides that it's fine it's just like any other facebook app needs some fixing that's all
0143118420|5.0|I chose this book after seeing E.G. on the Oprah show. Read it once, twice, three times and I've so far read it 9 times. I love this book because it speaks volumes to me. I learn something new every time.<br />The way E.G. writes is so amazing.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|This is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination.  It's the official film adaptation of the West End/Broadway musical Les Miserables (which is an adaptation of the French musical of the same name, which is based on the Victor Hugo classic - Whew).<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />- Ann Hathaway - Fantine is important, although she is relegated to being a medium character in the musical as far as stage/screen time goes.  She does as well as you can expect.<br /><br />- Russel Crowe - Probably the most controversial choice in the casting of the movie, I think he does a fine job.  I think he plays Javert a bit more introspectively than the inspector is usually played.  His singing is good (not great, but good.  I think those that listened to the cast recording are the reason we get that he sings so badly in Les Miserables.  On the cast recording, he is dreadful.  In the film, he is good.).  He's not Quast, but he really fills out a uniform!<br /><br />- Aaron Tevit - Maybe the best Enjolras I've seen.  Yummy to look at and just the right amount of intensity.<br /><br />- Daniel Huttlestone - A pretty good Gavroche.<br /><br />- Eddie Redmayne - I was leaning the other way until \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.\\"  To be honest, his voice sounded like a goose's honk up 'til this.  Then he cuts loose and wins me over.<br /><br />The bad<br /><br />- Hugh Jackman - Pretty much every reason that Crowe works as Javert is why Jackman doesn't work as Jean Valjean.  He was pretty much wrong from the start,  It's pretty interesting to say that the lead in a movie is bad when the movie turns out pretty good, but then again it is Les Miserables.<br /><br />- The cinematography - It's not that it is all bad, but it's so hit and miss as to be a distraction.<br /><br />All-in-all, it's a good movie (hence the 4 stars), but it could have been great.
B00005QW5X|5.0|As soon as the movie starts you will be into it. That is if you a clasic rock fan. I can't believe I did not hear about this movie or sound track until 12 yeasr later.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|I rented this the first time and was fairly impressed.  The ending caught me off guard.  Good movie if a bit slow in places.  This has deleted scenes, so when I watch I hope it will fill the slow spots.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Daughter has watched this movie over ten times and loves it each and every time.  It was easy to download and the quality is very good.  Perfect kids movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Simple when you need it to be, with additional options when you need more complex info. Great app for my not so smart Samsung epic 4g
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|I found this movie to mostly silly.  If you appreciate realistic portrayals then this isn't the movie for you.<br />Sopiler alert !!  It was boring.  Sensationalist and just unrealistic.  Makes our elite troops look like a bunch of bubbas.<br />Anything for a buck.
B000002OR4|5.0|Another masterpiece by John Williams. great movie and great OST. This was added to my collection of other OST's. One day these CD's will be extinct. Buy them now while they are available.
B00C7L2QCA|5.0|I love the Hannibal Books, I love the movies, and if this first episode is any indication of what the rest of this series will be like, I will love the series as well.<br /><br />I was able to quickly relate to Graham because they put in enough character development.... and that is saying something for one TV Episode. There was enough development, and still enough time to tell a story.<br /><br />I don't watch TV, so I did not know this series was even out there. I just logged on to Amazon Instant Video today, saw it, and thought \\"Why not?\\". I am so very glad, I really enjoyed it. I can not wait until next week!
B0000DZTIW|5.0|One of my favorite OST by Hans Zimmer. This is a truly beautiful and powerful OST. I've listened to this many many times. I have it in my car, phone, pc. It's a must buy!
B008I43DYU|5.0|I love it.  The size is great for older people.  I recommend it to every one. It easy to use.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|Not your usual John Williams style but that's what makes it great to hear a different style by J Williams. Great OST.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I liked it much better then thor much better like the story and everything so I bought it  for me and my cousin who loves it
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I have used Google for many years, there is nothing better out there. To have it on my kindle fire is just great.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a good app it works well on my kindle fire I just got it but so far so good
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I'm a fan of the Decemberists.  I love their instrumentation, their tight, accurate but passionate or whimsical performances, and Colin's beautiful writing.  This is their best album so far.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love it. I can stay on it for hours, I can't stop playing it. I recommend it for everybody.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was an enjoyable read...more suspenseful than I anticipated, but  needed something more in the way of a plot.  Characters were a littlle predictable.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My wife and I both play and enjoy the game. Waiting get aggravating but we love the app<br /> He's is on her IPod touch and mine is on a Kindle fire
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought they did a good job taking out the parts of the book that would have made the movie too long but didn't contribute much to the story either.  I guess they also had to make the dogs as dogs and not with the other tribute's faces or it would have been too scary.  But they did a nice job with the arena and most of the other aspects.  It was better than I thought it would be.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|The slapstick humor gets a little heavy but its fun reading. The beginning will pull you in and then you are in it for the long term so you have to let the continuing schtick grow on you.
B002WXMPLA|2.0|I really liked SG-1 and I liked Atlantis even more.  And after watching Atlantis for the second time I decided to go ahead and try to watch universe.  I agree it is somewhat like BG although honestly I loved that series.  This is almost work to watch.  It complicated and annoying and dark.  BG was dark too but it moved right along.  Atlantis was exciting and fun and almost campy.  I could watch it while I did other things and still enjoy it.  SGU demands my attention and when I waste time just watching it it's not fun at all.  I'll try to keep going but if they don't get off that ship soon I'll have to quit.  I'm up to episode \\"Life\\" and so far overall the series sucks.  Half way through the season, there is no one moment of joy so far.  I'm going to skip to the last episode of season one and then hope season 2 is better.
0143121006|4.0|In 1937, the one-time Chinese capital of Peking was in turmoil, a British colonial outpost slowly being choked off by encircling Japanese troops and an internal struggle for the future of the country.  On a frigid winter night, Pamela Werner, the daughter of a member of the British legation, is found brutally murdered and mutilated, and in this spiraling, chaotic atmosphere, two detectives - one British and one Chinese - rush to solve the case.<br /><br />This would be an original enough premise in a novel, but in a work of non-fiction it is captivating, and author Paul French, does a commendable job of bringing to life not only Peking of the 1930's, but a cast of characters that would do any opera proud, most notably Detective Dennis and Pamela's father, renowned China hand E.T.C. Werner.<br /><br />While the murder of Pamela Werner was never OFFICIALLY solved, Mr. French has managed to get ahold of the results of the investigation her devastated, but relentless, father conducted on his own in the face of a British bureaucracy more interested in avoiding scandal than in bringing her killer to justice.  It is this investigation that is the heart of the book, and which makes it truly compelling.
B004R5Z30Q|4.0|great book and as usual better than the movie.. though i liked the<br />movie as well! lol  i recommend this
0525952926|5.0|Another Ken Follett winner.  His books are long but worth every word.  They enable the reader to live through history as they become a part of the lives of the characters in the books!  Great reads - this series and \\"the Pillars of the Earth\\" series too!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Super series... I am a bit burned out at the moment with it, but<br />will defo go back to reading them.  I want to know where to find<br />me a Jamie! =]]
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Unlike similar apps that offer free versions that only show the program works and then prompts you to buy the premium version....this app works as is....syncs right up to your printer quickly transfers the data or photo from your device and yes it works on a wide variety of devices...no issues....well done...well not done yet...guess what...very premature in my review....ap will only print a couple of copies before it tells you to go buy the premium version...that was a sucky surprise...and it only prints a short list of file types...not too happy
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Spoiler Alert<br /><br />I love this show! The second season was spectacular. If you have time and you are an anglophile, you need to see this show.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am 65 years young. LOVE this game to pass the time and to keep my mind sharp. Really improves your hand eye coordination.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I like space invaders even the remakes that came out few years ago on handhelds bought both and with my current shifting life is a good game to play
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. The author just made my list of the books to read. Could reread it many times over.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i use it for Bible Study every week.  Different versions/translations are available to compare the text for various verses.  Very useful!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could  not wait for the next book. Keeps you interested the whole time. Not for the bashful people. Have to have am open mind.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|I've used this app to plan trips locally and abroad to Canada, i love the ratings and comments.  I find it reliable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book, could not put it down. A must read if you are in to romance in a modern setting.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Auugh!!!  I can't believe Sybil and Matthew die this season!  We wonder what's going to happen to O'Brien too.  She's leaving right?
075669812X|5.0|My 9 year old has been pouring over this book for more than 2 weeks.  It is a great value for the money.  It is a great book for all kids, but especially great to entice some reluctant readers into the joy of books!
B00AKFG15S|2.0|I found this book extremely disappointing. After the first book which was excellent, the second which was quite good - this third book in the series was not up to Mr Archer's standard at all - in my opinion. Endless pages on how the electorate works in the UK.... at times I also felt that bits of the text and definitely story-line had come from previous novels.... as an avid fan I did notice! This is not a spoiler - but I felt that the ending invited another book of the Clifton Chronicles some time in the future. I will not be buying it. Hopefully Mr Archer will return to writing stand-alone novels again and not drag out a story over three books which could have easily been written as one.....
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|This is a fantastic piece of GFI or whatever the new term is now. I was a fan of Herge's Tin Tin as a boy, and this is so real that it looks like real actors. it is based upon the book &#34;The Secret of the Unicorn&#34; and keeps moving continually throughout the movie. My 7 year old grandson loved it, too. I hope that the studio follows up with more of the series.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|It has been a while since I picked up a Grisham novel..... and I am so glad I did! The Litigators was a page-turner, well written, lots of humour, an interesting plot - plenty of twists and turns - and I did enjoy the ending. Mr Grisham also tied up all the loose ends (not all authors remember to do that) - rounding off the pleasant reading exprience. Definitely recommended!
B001F12J48|1.0|This movie does not play in 3D with or with out 3D glasses, we tried 3 different glasses including the $80 glasses that go with the TV. No luck, kids were very disappointed
B00C10N3EW|5.0|I've got every album Joe B has made and enjoy every one of them.  I caught his Acoustic Evening on PBS special and had to sit around a couple of weeks to download it -- well worth the wait and money.  If you even like Joe B - you'll love this one.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Intense!!!  Worth the read  I recommend it to anyone. Keeps you guessing the whole way through. Scary that there are people like that out there.
B00A83075M|5.0|My kids love this movie. They are constantly quoting lines from the film. They love telling the toilet joke from the movie.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Definitely worth watching, movie plot may be a little dark for some and definitely not for the little ones, but still a great cast and I am looking forward to the next one.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good start, plot, and excellent ending..just a little dragged out at some points..overall it is a thought provoking, entertaining, well written book.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|A fantastic concept and wonderfully executed. Beach Buggy Blitz has the excitement of an arcade style race game with the graphics of a console game.
B000V63C4Y|5.0|One of the greats of early Latin-jazz music.  The album has influenced so many of its contemporaries.  Also perfect for playing whilst you pretend you're on a Brazilian beach watching beautiful women walk by.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Finally a reward for making all the way down the trail. A virtual village not to tough to play, but very tough to put down. Also with graphics that . Harken back to floppy discs, and High-C  cooler.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I like a courtroom based drama, and eventhough it is a page turner, I felt the response of the characters was a little off my common sense.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|While the first book in the trilogy was not quite what I expected, it was a book I read during any spare time I had.  The second book was not as titillating, but was OK.  Actually, I thought everything could have been wrapped up in two books (after having read the trilogy).  Just not that exciting to me.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked the story of the medical issues, well told. The family, the children and the adoption was very interesting. It is well written. I liked the vivid fantasy images. It is thought provoking.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Having read the Fifty Shades Trilogy, I was really disappointed after all the hype.  The third one was a \\"why did the author bother\\" read, in my opinion.  I did not care for the style in which the books were written, and the same tired phrases and expletives were inserted way too much.  It seemed to me that \\"Freed\\" was written only because the second book just did not quite finish the story, but the time frame of the future and the somewhat sappy ending were just a letdown.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|The cd is mostly full of Dance tracks. I would have enjoyed if it was longer but the pace is good and youll have a good time dancing to the tracks.

0060989157|5.0|Forget 'The Game', Neil Strauss hit this book perfectly. Great concept and layout that makes reading it fun, just to hear the isolated opinions of different band members. I've read all of the 'Motley' books, am a huge fan of the band, and this book was certainly my favorite.
1400069742|5.0|America has a strong cultural amnesia; an inability to remember past conflicts over the creation of American foreign policy.  There is a myth that America's going to war up until Vietnam was based on a strong national consensus.  \\"Those Angry Days\\" is an apt term to describe this vitriolic period.<br /><br />Although a centerpiece of the book is the infamous Des Moines speech, in which Lindbergh excoriated Roosevelt, Britain and the Jews; this work is far more than the story of Roosevelt's and Lindbergh's struggle over the role of America in the opening days of the Second World War.  It was also a fight for the soul of America and to determine the future nature of America and the world.  Roosevelt and Lindbergh had a deep personal antipathy going back to the President's cancellation of private air mail carrier contracts; but this was quite tangential to a deep-seated difference in how they viewed the world.<br /><br />This was an America with a White House \\"enemies list\\"; an FBI vigorously investigating threats to America and ignoring civil liberties; thousands of Canadian (preferred by the British as their lack of accent would be a benefit) agents; a military disclosing confidential reports to the isolationists; and socially accepted anti-Semitism; and a Harold Ickes who is compared by the author to Hugo's Inspector Javert in his pursuit of Lindbergh.<br /><br />The book goes far beyond a personal conflict of two cultural and political figures.  The book discusses the role of the media and Hollywood; the significance of Edward R. Murrow's \\"This is London\\" reports; and a Yale and Ivy League that was openly isolationist and anti-Semitic.<br /><br />This is an extremely well-written book.  The work has excellent notes and an outstanding up-to-date bibliography.
0143039601|5.0|Required reading if you have any interest in 'vagabonding' travel, the beat generation, or the spread of Buddhist philosophy to the West. Have probably read this book 4x and still appreciate it each time!
B00005JM20|4.0|Johnny English is funny, but you get the feeling it could have been funnier with a little more effort.  The sequel, Johnny English Reborn, is hysterical.
B004OR199G|4.0|Loved the book! Funny, logical, convincing, informative. I followed the 21-day cleanse with VERY good results. My skin feels and looks much better. I lost a bit of weight, but mostly I don't feel bloated and my digestion is much better.<br />I don't think I'll become a vegan, although I will drastically reduce my intake of meats, dairy and SUGAR because it feels good. I have enjoyed eating more vegetables (raw) and function much better after my morning green juice/smoothie.<br />I took some and I left some, I also learned a lot about my body's reaction to certain foods by isolation, removing and then reintegrating into my diet.<br />Definitely recommend and have suggested to friends!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG....this was the second book in a series of three.  LOVE this book and the first.<br /><br />This series is hot, hot, hot.  Love reading this.  I couldn't put it down and can't wait to start the next book.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is about true magicians who pretend not to be real and a competition that two elderly magicians hold between their protegee.  The circus in this book is truly magical in a wonderful and imaginative way. exciting and a bit eerie.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I've made the mistake of assuming that comedians would have a funny memoir, and this book rarely got me beyond a happy little smile.  However, it was well written and an interesting look at the details of TV production. Worth reading.  Just don't expect a lot of laughs.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this sext, thrilling series.  Couldn't wait to start the next one then the next one.<br />This is a hot, hot, hot book and if you need a little something spicing then you need to read this!!!<br /><br />Couldn't put it down.......next book please!,

B0012TWRAO|4.0|I got this to mount on my Harley and have a cell as well as a gps and it lets set up the arm in many direction with ease . I also noted the coating keeps everything in place very well. The coating is on the clamp as well to protect handlebar as well as grip.

B00A9V2JSG|5.0|The whole series was EXCELLENT.  Recommend to Hunger game readers. great story line throughout series.  Its a must read people
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It is pretty slow until you get to battle. The JAR is very easy to beat but multiplayer battles spice it up. The biggest downside for me is not knowing how to enable base protection when I am offline.
0205313426|5.0|Good rule book for writers,one of the best I have bought. This should be on every writers bookshelf. Buy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome you jump everywhere and onto trains you can use jetpacks for coins this game is just really awesome i cant even believe it
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I've just started this game so far so good. I'm sure I'll have to pay to unlock the rest of the game. Hope it's not more than 99&cent;.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I used to love the original Pac-man game.  This one is a little difficult to play on the Kindle Fire.  I guess you just have to get used to how to maneuver around and Pac-man does not have the same appeal it had when it first came out.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Clever plot, wonderfully developed characters - simply gripping story. I can't wait to get into the next two books in the series.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A good game that is more fun to play with an actual deck of cards than a virtual game.  It is quick and fast paced but I still enjoy playing the old fashioned way.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Lots of story, lot's of action - sound could have been better, but I still enjoyed it! Makes you hope for more to come!
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|some people have been comparing this to temple run, and I wouldn't say that is an accurate comparison. I do like both games, so it is quite likely if you like the one you will like the other, but I see them as quite different. In TR2, you can't turn around, what in this game you can keep left and right and stay in the same place, and even climb up a wall (ie. it is relatively easy to climb up two parallel walls, but I'm talking about just one wall), and there isn't that flexibility in TR2.<br /><br />I like the game is self teaching (and so don't need instructions, for those people complaining about that), and the in-game tutorials provide just the right amount of help.<br /><br />great game!
B0091WAN3C|5.0|This is a great follow up to the Prequel. Even better on the large Hi-Def Screen I just got for the living room.

0451232852|4.0|I'm rounding up a bit on this one.<br /><br />Ken Follett likes to write about strong, independent-minded women, and about intelligent men attempting to outmaneuver their hidebound peers. We find these types again in this novel of World War I. In the largely fictional setting of Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, these characters had room to maneuver, and their resourcefulness was often rewarded with success. Given the historical constraints of a World War I setting, Follett could not do quite as well by the characters in Fall of Giants -- which made the book somewhat more depressing. Reading it, I was momentarily distracted by fancies of where the story could have gone if Follett had pursued an alternate history a la Inglorious Basterds, and allowed one or another of his characters to save the away and avert disaster.<br /><br />But that fantasy faded quickly -- because Follett shows, step by step, why disaster was not, in fact, averted. We see, from multiple points of view, the logic, the rational calculations, that led each of the nations inexorably toward war. It is a sobering experience. One cannot easily assure oneself, afterward, that one would have found a different path. At the same time, various characters are trying desperately to do just that, and Follett manages to make the reader hope they will succeed, even while knowing that any such hope is in vain.<br /><br />But then, around mid-book, Follett starts spending much more time dwelling on who is having ill-advised sex, or not having desired sex, with whom -- and the book started to lose me. (One could argue that historical fiction covering this period should enlighten younger readers about how seriously people in the early 20th Century took premarital chastity (for women) and marital fidelity (for both sexes, to some extent) -- but I doubt many of Follett's readers are entirely ignorant of the mores of the time.) I have nothing against romantic entanglements in fiction, but something about the transition didn't work well for me.<br /><br />Follett's focus does eventually return to the war, and related events such as the women's suffrage movement in Britain and run-up to the Russian Revolution. I learned quite a lot. And I did care what happened to the characters -- but less than I might have, if the original seamless blend of individual stories and worldwide events had continued throughout.e transition didn't work well for me.<br /><br />Follett's focus does eventually return to the war, and related events such as the women's suffrage movement in Britain and run-up to the Russian Revolution.

B009YP9L7U|2.0|Endlessly. After an interesting beginning this book quickly goes downhill. Instead of putting her characters into situations and letting them run wild while we watch, this author chooses to remove us from all the action and talk about it instead. And oh boy do they ever talk! Every last tiny bit of their relationship is analyzed down to the last minute detail. They talk, almost have sex, talk some more, almost have sex, talk, have sex, talk, etc etc. It's as frustrating as watching a racy version of Waiting For Godot.<br /><br />Every time a scene starts to have impact, the writer cuts readers off and once again, guess what? They talk. One emotional scene has the heroine run into an older father figure at the grocery store but ends just as we're dieing to see what comes next. Instead we get to hear the couple TALK about it later. In a good romance the interaction between the couple and characters is the pay off we read for. Here it's like non-stop punishment for wanting to see more. With a shift in focus this could have been good. It's not.
B00ANGICRE|5.0|This movie was very, very good. My husband and I both loved it. the acting was superb. The story was very touching. Can't even imagine living like that and remain so positive. Very inspiring movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart. Loved it.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I started watching Doctor Who a year ago and now thanks to BBCAmerica and Amazon Prime I've seen all of the re-boots and a few of the classics. This may be my favorite season, with the 7th a close contender. The Doctor is dazzling--clever, brilliant, inventive and generous. You can almost see him thinking. I love Amy and Rory. Our new companion looks quite wonderful but I miss my old friends and I can't help wishing our paths will cross. At least we can be reunited on Prime.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|How excited I was to receive an e-mail about a month ago that all the albums I have purchased from Amazon over the years would be available in my Cloud Player - and accessible from my Android Phone.  Apparently, April Fool's Day came early because I really believed Amazon.  I have installed this app on my phone through both the Amazon app store and through the Google Play store and neither way works.  I tap on the &#34;sign in to amazon&#34; button and....nothing.  nada.  So thanks Amazon - for nothing.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The 4-disc combo is great for viewing it in different areas where 3-d and blu-ray are not available. The movie is great for everyone in the family.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|This was working fine on my Kindle Fire until about a week ago when it started running very slowly and sometimes freezing. Pages don't load and I have to continually close the app and reopen.  Frustrating!  Please fix ASAP.
B0089LOKHG|1.0|Just like most of the previous reviews, I waited so long for this book only to be disappointed. What happened Lauren? The ending to this amazing trilogy was a tremendous let down of epic proportions. There were too many loose ends and unanswered questions. I am curious to see if there will be another spin off book with answers. Just not sure if I trust Lauren anymore to deliver a well written story worth my time from beginning to end.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Several years ago, I was on plane bound for Ohio, and seated next to a child. He was about 6 years old, he held out his tiny hand and introduced himself as \\"ATTICUS\\". He told me that this parents, who were sitting behind us, had named him after their favourite film character.<br /><br />This little boy was bright and super intelligent. He told me about the film and why it was so great. He said that his parents, who were both lawyers, wanted to name him after someone who did great things. He told me that he had hoped to do great things too, when he grew up. I hope that he did.<br /><br />The film, itself, was groundbreaking, a seminal work. The cast in the film: Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch), Phillip Alford (Jem), Mary Badham (Scout), Collin Wilcox (Maybella Ewell), Brock Peters (Tom Robinson) and Robert Duvall (Boo Radley), were wonderful.<br /><br />I have loved \\"Bobby Duvall\\", ever since this film...<br /><br />There is so much in this movie, the complexities of human nature, the love of a parent for his young children, who are growing up in a mis-understood, divided world. The desire to set things right, the need to prove that wrong is wrong and to stand tall in the faces of adversity. This film has it all.<br /><br />There is nothing more that I could add that has not already been discussed by writers and film makers around the world.<br /><br />For me, seeing this film in high school and at home and then meeting (many years ago) a little, smart boy on a plane, who  was actually named \\"Atticus\\", was the height of my experience with this film. The child was a joy to talk to and his understanding and knowledge of the film, was remarkable.  I think of him again, when I watch this movie.<br /><br />The film and the chance meeting, made my life a better place and me a better person!
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|Second time i get an HD movie, just to find out i can reproduce 5:1 or stereo. Standard def movies reproduce correctly. Ended renting The Hobbit on Itunes, to at least have some decent sound.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|Great storyline, amazing graphics and a great price! If anyone that is thinking about purchasing this movie on Amazon, stop reading and click Buy now!!
B00913DPW2|3.0|I love games like this AS LONG as they give you some direction! This one gives you NOTHING, NO direction at all. You also have to go back and forth over and over again from screen to screen. This gets frustrating after the 10th time. If it wernt for the walk through I would have NEVER got through the game. It was no having to cheat for the whole game!
B003V3FTTU|5.0|I had watch this on tv and told a friend about it and he hadn't so got it for him as a gift.

B00A77II0U|5.0|I had a great time with this game, and everything about it. Cant wait to play another. Honestly, i couldnt put my tablette back down and just wanted more of it
B008476HBM|4.0|I liked the added narration. It put extra oomph into a conversational novel short on action, a good thing on an 8-hour flight!
0345803485|5.0|This book made me remember how good a new love interest can make you feel.  I feel the passion is so escalating it makes you feel YOUR emotions building for Mr. Grey. I would and have been recommending this book to all my friends. Totally worth the purchase. Opens you up to being a Sexual Goddess free to enjoy all your passionate yearnings. Buy it!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I enjoyed this game.  I wish it would last longer.  I worked on it here and there and it only took me 3 days.  So maybe a total of 4 hours.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|Mine is defective. It only barely amplified for a couple of days. Now it is completely dead. Not even a good a paperweight. I'm trying to get it replaced so I guess I'll find out if their customer service is any good, concidering how crappy the product was I'm not holding a lot of hope.<br /><br />UPDATE 21APR: I mailed the device back on 11ARP. USPS tracking says that the package was delivered on 13Apr. No refund, no communication, no nothing. My $20 is down the drain.<br />I wish I could give them a rating of zero.<br />I advise people to not waste their money with this company.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|I know that this guy has been behind quite a few movies, apparently very popular.  After the first, of which I only remember being very dark and violent, I've avoided all others with his handprint.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, as good old fashioned entertainment.  A western, with action, interesting characters, a good story line and dialogue, that didn't take itself too seriously.  Loved his short cameo appearance too.  This was a B+.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I ha e every album that John has ever created and every one gets better and this one is wonderful in that he is showing that is personally growing and the music reflects this.
0385528752|5.0|I expect this review to be lost in the crowd of better written enthusiastic reviews by everyone else who read this book!  This book was fun to read, impressively organized and useful.  I bought multiple copies to give to friends, coworkers and management.  I even pre-ordered their next book, &#34;Decisive&#34; without hesitation!<br /><br />Practical, insightful advice that will change/improve your life and business!
B008Y6TE5O|4.0|Good concept on the story line and was a very enjoyable, entertaining movie to watch.  Arnold has not gone wrong yet.
B008518MOW|5.0|This is first of all the best MIB move of all of them.  In addition, the 3D is phenomenal in this particular movie.  I recent watched The Hobbit in 3-D and it caused me a headache.  This worked and looked perfect!
B0009VPFSW|5.0|My FANUC 21i-MB reads this card with a PCMCIA adapter without a problem. The control has a total for 4 MB of internal memory so, for doing complex parts, this card is crucial.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I do not normally read books this long but I must say it went quick. I loved the premise for the book and I wasn't disappointed by the content. I have always been a big Stephen King fan and I enjoy when he does the unexpected.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sooooooo good. It was an amazing conclusion to the story and the kindle store delivered it to my ipad right away.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|the latest from one of new jersey's best bands the boys play with such raw energy which is why they are so popular
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Absolutely love these games. Nice graphics. Easy way to pass some time but totally addicting. I definitely suggest buying all the sequels. It will not be a waste of money.
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|What the hell ever happened to Sam Raimi's involvement in a fourth Evil Dead movie? Here's the answer... In crisp HD with ten times the production values and marketing budget of the original. Was this remake necessary other than to fill Sam Raimi's and Bruce Campbell's coffers? No, but... It will accomplish one of two things: (1) set the stage for a sequel that reintroduces Ash (or an Ash-like character) or (2) finance a fourth Evil Dead movie. How many new \\"Dead\\" movies did George Romero make after the successful \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" remake? That's right, three. I hope that Sam Raimi follows suit... I'll take that \\"Freddy VS Jason VS Ash\\" mashup at this point, thank you very much.<br /><br />The previews give away A LOT. As does the poster. Is this \\"The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience?\\" Not by a long shot. For myself, this movie ranks somewhere in between the lackluster [[ASIN:B0070Z4LLW The Thing (2011)]] prequel and the new [[ASIN:B0047SF41G Predators]] installment. The latter franchise must have been an inspiration to the director as the Deadites of this movie make the Predator \\"creaking\\" sounds, which is both strange and out-of-place. What did this movie do better than the original? It did a better take on the fruit cellar scene, that's about it. The levitating bodies, stop-motion animation, and oatmeal brains have been replaced with an overabundance of fake blood and Ring-like Special FX.<br /><br />What about Ash you ask? He's not here. Ash and his campy sense of humor is nowhere to be found. There's no iota of comedy in this movie, and worst of all, it's not even that scary--the original being both scary and funny. Ok, ok, what about the chainsaw? The new director did about as good of a job weaving it into this story as did the director of [[ASIN:B002LB13SE The Last House on the Left (Unrated)]] remake with his ridiculous microwave ending that blew the whole movie. Bruce Campbell has to return as Ash. I don't care how much HGH, liposuction, or hair dye it's going to take. It must go down.ir dye it's going to take. It must go down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great game. it works really good. I love solitaire and this is a perfect way to play
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is action packed. Its hard to watch in the way you don't want to see any kids die but you root for your favorite. Even though they are there to kill each other there are times of human compassion and making things right. I love this movie and cant wait to see the next one. I never read the books and I don't feel I need to after seeing the show and enjoying it so much. This is a movie you will love.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Mindless fun...a bit addictive and not as easy as it looks!  Try it and see if you like it.  Made the old grey cells work a bit...

B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much better than Temple run. I don't know how it could get any greater. It's totally rad and cool people.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Downton Abbey's just a fabulous ensemle period piece. It ranks with the best that tv's ever produced - Sopranos, Deadwood, The Wire.<br />It's got the lot: realistic drama, comedy, wonderful dialogue and a great insight into those times.
B00AO2TREY|5.0|Thank you Hurts for this beautiful album.  It's a masterpiece.  I hope you play for us in Denver, Colorado someday.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers because you get to unlock new characters and its fun.On Subway Surfers you can get keys and when you die you can press save me and you will go back to the game and that's how much I love Subway Surfers.
0143119680|1.0|I'm almost 100 pages in and I'm still not hooked.  I don't understand why this book is so popular.  I was hoping for a page turner, and honestly it's very researchy and the charcters are bland.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|very useful for my catering business.  runs a little slow on my kindle fire but all in all an exceptional app.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game, keeps your  attention, great mini games, clear pictures in hidden object scenes. I like the guide that comes with game, all in all lots of fun.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved this show but I wanted more of the story!!  Really great! i recommend this show to anyone that likes horror shows.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I became attached to the characters and enjoyed the story.  My frustration was that sometimes the main character did things (like walk toward an obviously scary situation unaware) that didn't seem realistic- actually reminded me of the scary movie spoofs a little where it's so obvious that there's danger but it's not acknowledged appropriately (IMO). That said, I really did like the book and have no regrets reading it.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|After reading the first several reviews of the Sorcerer's Ring series, it sounded like it might be a decent read. I really should have read a few more reviews.  If you like George R.R. Martin, John Scalzi, Lynn Flewelling, or Robin Hobb, DO NOT BUY THESE BOOKS! It probably doesn't quite deserve one star, but I felt I had to only give it that much to try to offset if only a little all of the 4-5 star ratings. I'm guessing that most of the \\"Loved it!\\" reviews were written by 12 year-olds, which is fitting as the book reads like it was written by one. I had a bad feeling about A Quest for Heroes about halfway through the first chapter, and it only got worse from there.  And oh yeah: Argon? Really? That's the name Rice came up with for the wizard who shows Thor (very original as well) that he is capable of magic?  An element? Why not Selenium? Or Beryllium maybe?  Apparently Allegra Skye, (bestselling author of Saved) thought that the Rice books reminded her \\"of the best of J.K. Rowling, George RR Martin, Rick Riordan, Christopher Paolini, and JRR Tolkien\\", and that she \\"couldn't put it down.\\"  Note to self: never, ever, EVER buy anything written by Allegra Skye.  Her words comparing Morgan Rice to those great authors is true blasphemy. The Sorcerer's Ring has been expunged from my Kindle, and a refund has been applied.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I purchased this product to use in conjunction with my photo booth. When I first received it, I learned that it was not compatible with Windows 7. I REALLY needed this button to work as I had no other options, so I went to Griffin Technology's website and downloaded the PowerMate for Windows, version 1.5.3 for XP drivers. I was so thankful that it worked, even with Windows 7. So if you do decide to purchase this, keep this in mind if you have trouble with the drivers.<br /><br />The button itself is heavy and seems well-built. I like that it came with an \\"extension cord.\\" The software was easy to configure with my photo booth software (NKRemote Pro). I am glad I purchased this and was able to get it to work. It saved my photo booth AND my laptop as I did not want people to have access to anything but a single button for operation.
B0054N73EY|4.0|This is the first Album without Frusciante (Spelling ?), the guitarist, since One Hot Minute which featured Dave Navarro. Like before RHCP are driven by Kedis and Flea, and the Guitar matches whatever they ask for. I loved the songs &#34;Warped&#34; and &#34;Aeroplane&#34; from Minute, and I love songs here like &#34;Factory Faith&#34; and &#34;Look Around&#34;. There's still the trademark funk and rock fusion that Kedis and Co. have perfected since Blood Sugar Sex Magic. I am satisfied with this as a sequel to songs like &#34;Hump De Bump&#34;, and &#34;Tell Me Baby&#34;, but also has some smooth slow stuff like  the title song to Stadium Arcadium, &#34;Torture Me&#34; and &#34; Make You Feel Better&#34;.<br /><br />If you love RHCP's trademark sound this is right up your alley!
B000FM38SO|5.0|There are unsung hero's everywhere. This is a dvd worth watching because it brings to life the conflicts and stress<br />we bring about to the animal kingdom. Only through the example of a few can we ever learn to protect those animals<br />that deserve a place on the planet to live in peace. Hopefully some compassionate individuals like those in the movie<br />can bring about some reasonable change in a hostel world. Trying and failing is one thing, but not trying at all, is the<br />reason for this continuing extinction of these fine creatures. Just do something, no matter how small.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|This is no follow up to some of his better works like Night Fly and others. but some of you may like it. Not what I was looking for and was hoping it would be as good as earlier works.....enough said.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this daily. I'm obsessed. Thank you for changing it up and keeping me entertained. I try really hard to get all the characters. This is the best game I've played. Thank you.
B005LAIHZE|1.0|No one's time should be wasted on this crap movie. I have never in my life seen a poorer book turned movie. This only vaguely has some of the aspects of the awesome book. The characters in no way resemble their book counterparts. The book attempted to be historically close to Lincoln's actual life.  It cleverly wove together his remarkable life with the added fictional aspects of vampire hunting. The movie reverts back to traditional vampire lore (when convenient) and completely twists people's motives and personalities.  I understand when movie's attempts to portray a book can't fit in the details because of time limits causing it to feel rushed, but this completely in no way resembles the book. It is utterly baffling that producers, directors and actors would partake is such a horrible, painful piece of crap. I hope they all lost money and somebody comes behind them and does it right.
B003HO0RG8|5.0|Although Refused's previous albums contained some fine, fine music, none were as essential as The Shape of Punk to Come. Littered with jazzy breaks, electronic interludes, and spoken word bits, it is unpredictable, yet cohesive. One could argue that other bands from both America and Europe were doing similar experiments before, but none had completely transcended their societal boundaries as Refused did. They were highly influential to both continental scenes, and still are today. This brilliant reissue by Epitaph contains the original album as recorded (not the 2004 version), a live performance from 1998, and the documentary \\"Refused Are F'in Dead,\\" which details the band's last year before disbanding. All in all, this is one of the best reissues I've ever had the pleasure to experience in recent years; the fact that the original album hasn't been tampered with in any way and the way it is presented make this a prime example of how to do a reissue.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A little sci-fi, drama, humor and even philosophy makes this book and the characters in it so enjoyable. Really a quick, easy read that was actually fun from beginning to end. Book lovers will really enjoy this.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another Grisham book that gives a look into the world of lawyers on both sides of ethics. Definately worth the read
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The format made for a good read through most of the book. The last few &#34;chapters&#34; we're not as good but the book concluded well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting! If you love or like temple run, then you will love this game. You try to get away from the inspector by running on rail rode tracks. Great for kids like me and great for eating up your time. You should get this right away!!!!!!!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Hurray for an honest and real movie with realistic characters and emotion! LOVED IT! My boyfriend and I were blown away with the graphic nature which was wholly appropriate. This film makes you think about life and what it means to live and love. :)

B00AJLHULW|4.0|Hey guys... this is a different type of Robben Ford offering.  Personally, I find it a pleasure to have a variety of listening experiences from a true artist.  The first thing I noticed about this CD was the audio quality... It plays beautifully in the car.  Great tone...  That being said this isn't Jing Chi, which I also love for different reasons. After my initial first week \\"overplaying\\" it in the van, I put it aside.  A couple days ago I put it back in and I found that there is more going on than I first thought. The album is mostly covers with one original... but with any great artist, they never select covers that don't have some kind of soulful reason for being there. I really love it. I have a diverse collection of music.  I go for the very sophisticated progressive stuff & many things in between that and ambient music.  I'm excited about this musical offering now... very classy and soulful.
1446301583|5.0|Tilda's Studio is jam packed full of fresh and fun projects. Plus you get to see Tone's studio - bonus!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Yes its true the truth hurts sometimes but gaining the knowledge to create the body you've always wanted doesnt have to.....This book helps you build a clear, concise roadmap to your goals.. Backed by loads of research yet laid out in a simple no frills , easy to follow manner, you are sure to see quick & lasting results...One of my years best purchases!...Big ups to the author
B0095P33IW|4.0|Entertaining although not totally believable.  Good for younger viewers, ages 10 - 40.  Ending is amusing but not very satisfying...
B000002IR7|5.0|My boyfriend was talking about this one day when I was browsing Amazon.  I went back another day and bought it for him.  He loves it--great gift!!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is just a Christmas tradition with me. I can't make it through the season without watching it (along with &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34;). Obviously how you will feel about it depends on you. For me this movie is tied to many fond memories. One thing for sure -- This version is much, much, much better than the remake!.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|if you liked samurai vs zombies before you. are in for a treat.  multi player option J's great.  love this game
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is just a Christmas tradition with me. I can't make it through the season without watching it (along with &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34;). Obviously how you will feel about it depends on you. For me this movie is tied to many fond memories.
B0074VA2T2|1.0|The game is kind of boring and I think any child will not last long playing this game.I do not recommend this game.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I'll admit, not the best script or acting. But shows our great warriors and specifically the navy SEALs in real life training at what they do to protect our country. Great tribute to dedicated Americans.
B00BP29SAA|4.0|My child loves this game and has learned a lot of food, shopping, etc. We definitely got our $2 worth out of this app.
B003YCI1PM|3.0|There were some song on this album my daughter liked, but she said there were other songs of Selena' she wished were included. It was not her favorite CD.
B004SIP71M|5.0|Doubt is a multilayered, subtle, yet devastating movie. The cast of Hoffman, Adams and Streep will leave your mind returning again and again to their interplay and the relationship of their situation to the world we live in. Viola Davis deserved the Oscar for a short but powerful performance. Doubt ranks among my favorite movies ever.
B004478GN8|4.0|This was just a random Lego set purchase for my son. He had never asked for it, but still liked it just the same. It was a fun set for him to work on and play with.
B005P39GOI|5.0|My friends kept recommending this album to me but I didn't listen. Then I heard a track on Pandora and loved it so bought the album and it is now possibly my favorite album of all time. Great music and a great, posititve message.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book.  From the first page I couldn't put it down.  I just had to know what happened.  I would recommend this to all of my sci-fi fan friends.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|It's a blast running a helo. Behaves well enough. Haven't gotten to far into it so don't know how hard the higher levels are. I enjoyed it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|the graphics to the game are good. has a great storyline but always ask you to rate the game. the game isn't really free and that's the worse thing about iy
6305882592|5.0|Years ago I didn't know what to expect and now years later I can truly appreciate this flick.  The nuances are clearer now that I'm older and time has past and this is really a must see again for anyone who was on the receiving end when first was shown.
B00B69UQJY|4.0|Priests of electronic pop, Depeche Mode have practiced the genre for ages, flirting with industrial music, hinting at perverted gospel, sinking into electro goth, while maintaining a brooding blues soul beneath the latest cutting edge beats and synths. It's a potent alchemy.<br /><br />For fans of DM, its a religion that may have started with Black Celebration and culminated in Songs of Faith & Devotion.  In Delta Machine, principal songwriter Martin Gore invites us behind the curtain.  He welcomes us to his world, his own little universe, telling us that he likes it slow in bed. It's a seductive trip, if not a little creepy, considering these guys are pushing 50.  But if Mick Jagger can pull off being a sly old guy, so can Dave Gahan.<br /><br />If this album comes across as a rehash of oft-used DM themes, the requisite  technological solutions are in there. DM has surrounded themselves with talented wizards - engineers, programmers, and production staff to add fresh ingredients.  Mark 'Flood' Ellis, who co-produced their massive hit album Violator, is credited with mixing Delta Machine.<br /><br />One still misses Alan Wilder who had the extraordinary musical sensibilities to take Gore's raw ideas and arrange them into pop gems.  He had the knack for making the circuitry sound less like window dressing to the picture underneath and more like etchings on the glass, crucial to the song.<br /><br />There are grand attempts on this record.  Gore adds the singles 'Heaven' and 'Soothe My Soul' to the DM canon.  Like all high priests, Gore leaves some of the ceremony to Gahan, who pens three of the tracks with Kurt Uenala, who worked extensively on Gahan's solid solo effort, 'Hourglass'. Their song, Broken is arguably the strongest on the album.  Musically, it is the best representation of lyrical maturity and DM's perennial knack for blending synthetic music with heartfelt vocals.<br /><br />The last Gahan/Uenala track, Should Be Higher has an instant classic DM lyric -\\"your lies are more attractive than the truth\\" but otherwise maxes out the creep-ometer with \\"Your arms are infected/they're holding the truth/oh stop all your crying/this one you'll lose.\\"  Sounds like a date gone terribly wrong.<br /><br />The album closer 'Goodbye' features a guitar loop that gives the track the familiar DM pseudo-western groove.  It also has a chorus that sounds surprisingly like it was devised by The Flaming Lips.  It's one of the few new elements on an album that delivers what DM fans yearn for - soulful lust with kinetic beats and organic electronica.<br /><br />It's a great effort even if the themes are a bit rehashed and overblown. If this is your first time at the DM rodeo, I suggest Music for the Masses as your starting point.  Take in that album as well as Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion. If you find yourself yearning for more, Delta Machine will give you that ol' time DM fix.
B000HKYNQ0|4.0|I used to watch this on tv after school back in the 70's. It still is some of the best Sci-Fi I've ever watched. May it live long in reruns and continue to prosper in the movie franchises.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like it.Very real but I don't recommend it for boys. I love the unicorn and zebra horses. I wish there were more choices for tournaments it would be even more fun.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Sci-Fi tv of the past doesn't get any better than this. I would recommend this to all my friends... or at least any who haven't heard of it... which is highly unlikely.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|Admittedly, I only watched a few of the episode of Season !.  There was no way I could ever &#34;connect&#34; to the characters in this series.  They have no redeeming quallities whatsoever.  You may even find yourself rooting for the bad guys.  The main cop in this mess is a sadistic rogue cop who greatly resembles Brian Urlacker of the Chicago Bears, but without the charm.  A far better series is The Closer, which has humor and characters that are at times endearing.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Another solid movie in the long running running franchise. I didn't expect it to end the way it did though. Can't wait to see how the new &#34;M&#34; and DC as Bond work together on the next adventure -I think it'll be #24.
0446547603|5.0|A story that brings every emotion to life. Believing in the human race shows that love conquers all! Entertaining, funny, sad and beautiful!
B0000844I8|5.0|Stargate leads me out of reality with tightly written plausibility. I had not seen it for years, but the story and grand scale have not been topped. It's one of those movies I'm glad to have added to my library.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|whenever someone is on the computer i can just turn on my tablet and get on youtube and watch whatever i want
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The makers of this game aren't stupid. They built this game so that you have to buy gems etc in order to finish the game. During the instructions, Spike will tell you to use a gem to speed thing up, don't do it ever. Gems are really hard to get as well as hearts.<br /><br /> You will have to have a friend in order to earn hearts. if you don't, you will never have enough to finish the tasks. This is just one more way the makers have rigged the game so that you have to get someone else to play it.<br /><br />Elements of harmony which must be collected take a ton of time to collect. The game seems to know which one you need and then slows down how many you get.<br /><br />I think the only reason this game has so many stars is because it asks you to rate it before you figure this all out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If I'm on my kindle and I have nothing to do, I usually play this game. It's so much fun! I love how they're doing the world tour thing. It's overall just a fun game. :)
B006GKHE6G|5.0|This is a great game. Here are some cool things about it...<br />It is played on water<br />Great graphics<br />Lots of options like...have a hot race by yourself or a championship where you race in multiple races and try to beat your opponent.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Really enjoyed the book. If you follow the series it's normal Reacher. Have read all of the books in the series it was good to see Reacher's Army history. I would recommend to Jack Reacher fans.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|A book that you can't put down. Inspiring story and definitely worth the time. I will say it can be a difficult read at times because it's narrated by a five year old boy and his perspectives.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love horses and have ALWAYS wanted to own one and this may be the closest I will ever get to feel like having one. I love this app!!! Its seems almost as real as it can get without the money it takes to take care of one......thank you
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I enjoy the challenges. With the different levels and seemingly countless solutions, it's like playing a constantly different puzzle game.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great colors and awesome 3d! I was looking for a good choice to use with my 3d TV. This movie did not disappoint me
B002SJIO4A|1.0|Although I was very intrigued by the premise, I was completely disappointed and, well, just plain bored with the lack of any \\"real\\" or redeeming characters. Other than the first 20 minutes of plot introduction, there is no mystery, no intrigue, no thought-provoking aspects like a good sci-fi novel would present. Instead, this movie devolved into a blood bath, filled with gratuitous violence and, for me, stomach-turning cruelty.<br /><br />And then come the plot holes, especially concerning the main character who suddenly knows how to fly an alien ship and operate alien weaponry, all with no explanation as to why...totally unbelievable to me.<br /><br />I want sci-fi to make me think and stretch my ideas of what is possible, especially on the \\"positive\\" side of the spectrum. So, if you're an old-school science fiction lover like me, I highly recommend one of my favorite sci-fi movies that makes me think and wonder and ponder: [[ASIN:B000UYX4Q8 Jerome Bixby's The Man from Earth]] (no action, just dialog)
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Holy cow. That was crazy good. I immediately tested my sister and told her about this book. Loved the main character and all the twists in this book. The ending rocked!
B0018RC7QE|2.0|I saw this movie and feeling that Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep are two of the best actors in this time, sat down to watch it. Unfortunately it is dull and the chemistry is just not believable. Couldn't make it to the end of the movie.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Max Brook's style was unique, magnetic, and insightful.  The messages of warring strategies were very interesting.  Brooks made me think; this is usually not a requirement of this genre.  Millions of zombie books focus on the zombie; this book fought the good war and won.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Very well done, Mr. Affleck!  The gripping pace and spot-on accuracy reflected in this movie took me right back to the disgraceful, disgusting last half of the Carter Administration, which was enough to make you shake your fists in agonized frustration.<br /><br />I had a large kernel of resentment toward Ben Affleck after he allowed himself to be used so badly in that awful, botched production of Tom Clancy's \\"Sum of All Fears\\" movie, but now I realize that he's actually capable of doing excellent work after all!  This review won't \\"sway\\" anyone's opinion one way or the other, but trust me -- if you were alive when all this criminally-negligent horror went on in Iran, you will feel like you've been put in a time machine and taken right straight back there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|oh my gosh. This is soooooo awesome!!!! I love how the game travels all over the world and the trains and officer always change. Its much more easy to play than temple run because you don't have to tilt it!
B00BI73CVI|2.0|russell crowe was wrong pick for his role.  the storyline was hard to follow and not believable at all.  I'm very disappointed considering the attention and awards this movie received.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I thought the first book was better although the ending on this one has me wanting to read the third installment.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Great CD, love this music, package arrived safely, didn't realize how much I remembered of Audrey Hepburn, so glad I also purchased the movie.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all times. The DVD comes with a documentary (over an hour) that tells the inside stories of how the movie was made, the best &#34;Extra&#34; feature ever. Highly recommend it.
B004UPAIDK|4.0|Came straight home from seeing the remake and watched this movie. Big fan of the original. Loved the bigger laughs in this one, especially the scene where the entire room starts laughing. But Amazon really needs to work on the video player because I got tons of lag and loading screens.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it very challenge I got because I seen someone else with it and I was intrigue I search until I find it and download to my kindle.(
B0022W6L6G|2.0|i don,t like it<br />i don,t want this item greatest hits fleet wood mac becose not neeret any more  bye bye tank you  i need to return this purchase because i do not need it and also i have this very expensive price thanks for everything see you later
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Interesting book that keeps you from putting it down. The ending was not predictable and was clever. Definitely would recommend this book.
0007444397|3.0|This book Is Very Detailed as Their Life in the Band of One Direction. I Give this book three Stars. I like How they talk about their lives. But needs to be careful, of what they are talking about in the book. DON'T BLAME OTHERS for the mistakes, You have done, in your life. I Do like this book a lot. I didn't expect to see some pictures with nudity in it. I'm sure Some Parents might agree with this review. Parents Please be careful of what your kids are reading, and the pictures that goes along with it. I'm just a Concerned Citizen of America, giving this review.

B004EPZ034|5.0|My son (age 4) is going on a cruise this year and he loves the chipmunks and loves to watch them on the ship because he gets so excited for his own trip. He also loves the Chipmunks and this is a cute movie for kids.
B003O86CJS|5.0|Teenage Dream [Clean] by Katy Perry.  Arrived quickly.  Decent price.  This will be a gift.  So no opinions on anything else.
0307719774|5.0|I dont normally keep a journal, but this Q and A journal is great.  It is very easy. I just keep it by my bed and when I wake up I just fill it in. Some of the questions are very simple but I can't wait to see how my answer s changes over the years.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved the whole series and can't wait to order Season 4 as soon as it comes out.  I have recommended this wonderful series to my family and all my friends.  They, too, are completely hooked on Downton Abbey.  At first my husband didn't want to watch it as he thought it would be a \\"chick flick\\" but half way through the first episode he, too, was hooked.  We loved the way the stories about the various characters evolved.  We discussed the characters as though they were friends.  That was fun as my husband only likes action and science fiction.  Unfortunately I saw on the PBS site about a major character dying and told him I was unhappy that I knew a character would be gone.  He guessed wrong.  When the scene occurred where it night happen I burst into tears and boy, was my husband shocked.  So everyone, if you don't want to know the end, don't let any spoilers spoil the show for you.  I've told all my friends to please watch the show in sequence and don't let anyone tell you anything.<br /><br />The acting is superb.  If you have a chance, read up on the family who lives in the castle.  Pretty interesting stuff.
B001NA6096|1.0|i felt like it was hard for the actors to keep the conversation moving, and it was like watching two people struggle on a first date...they should have found two intellectuals who in real life were brilliant conversationalists, but this wasnt that.  i think ethan hawke is a good actor and probably pretty intellectual but this was...the worst...
B009E9R1IM|5.0|I love the convenience of digital, but vinyl is still the best medium for listening to music!  This collection is absolutely worth the purchase.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is truly inspiring, I think it helps everyone understand what the world is like. It's amazing and my all time favirote :)
B007885IJU|5.0|Such a great album. I bought this for my boyfriend but I really enjoy listening to this as well!!! :)
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I think that this is the most fun game I have ever played in my entire life and I would recommend this for everyone
1449410243|5.0|Doesn't take very long to read but it had me laughing through the entire thing!! Would buy from this author again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Action packed and riveting. There's always something unexpected, especially at the end of each chapter.  You are never prepared for what happens next!
B000092T6M|5.0|I believe this is the best Robin Hood movie ever created. I love the way they got the medieval theme perfect, the nature is absolutely beautiful and the people they cast couldn't have been better. They should have seriously stopped with creating any more versions of Robin Hood. They got it perfect with this version. I especially love the extended version because it shows more scenes that make the movie that much more better.<br />Overall, this is the best movie ever.<br />One thing I wish they would have kept on this copy is the Original Bryan Adams video of Everything I Do, I Do It For You, where he's in the forest with a piano, singing and clips of the movie are going perfectly with the song.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|fun!!!!!!! my. brother told me to get that game becaues it is fun but any one can get it becauesut is free
0446604844|5.0|It's the first book I read by him.  The book has no dull spots and moves fast.  I'll be reading more of his books.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Hello George Lucas,<br /><br />When will you arrive in the 21st century and put your films on Kindle and iPad?  I've been waiting for some time and my patience grows thin.  I have no problem with repurchasing the films and would appreciate your recognition that many videos are now viewed on portable media.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My two year old and five year old kids can't get enough of this game and neither can I!  Easy and entertaining and nice to keep handy on phone and kindle.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is exceptionally written. Sometimes I was caught up in the seriousness portrayed by Charlie's writings and then found myself giggling at his next musings. I found myself liking Charlie and wishing I could be his friend when he needed to know he wasn't alone.
B007UW9WOQ|3.0|I wanted to go to this restaurant and dine; the sushi looks amazing.  In viewing the story, there seems to be more left out than put in.  Where is Jiro's wife, his daughters-in-law, his grandchildren?  I missed their faces and perspectives.  No genius reaches the apex by themselves.  Where are the people in his personal life who helped him?  On a more ominous note, I heard time and again from all the seafood purveyors how specific fish stocks are declining; this is not a good omen for fish, or for us.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It was a very interesting movie, it kept our interest. I must have been asleep in history class because this was very informing about Lincoln  and what went on the last 4 months of his life and what went on passing the 13th amendment. I'm glad we saw it. Thanks
B00AFEXRME|2.0|I like Denzel Washington and in this story he shows he's a star with the heart of a character actor, but I didn't like the character he played, who became a criminal to me as soon as he took cocaine before heading out to fly a plane full of passengers.  I was not impressed with the character's flying abilities and I blamed him for the plane crash, though the story showed that there were mechanical problems with the plane.  Had he not been high, he may have done his walk around (the plane) properly before the flight and discovered the mechanical problem or he may have turned the plane around when he initially encountered the storm.  I think the storytellers also made a mistake suggesting the co-pilot was green - the audience, most of us having no idea how to fly a plane, had to rely on the co-pilot as he was the only non-impaired pilot in the cockpit and the co-pilot showed very clearly the captain was off the rails (though the audience already knew this as we witness his cocaine use and drinking on the job).  Had the audience been given a medium level experienced co-pilot, perhaps we wouldn't have seen the Denzel Washington character as bizzarly as the co-pilot obviously did.  Anyway, a more experienced co-pilot would have helped serve the audience better, in my opinion, than a greenish one; would have helped us understand more clearly that the captain, even impaired, had a huge flying talent - that would have been a better story strategy; it would have helped us see the captain as something more than just a negligent drunk, though he obviously was both negligent and a drunk.  A more experienced pilot would have helped us see the Denzel Washington character's genius; I think that was what the storytellers were aiming for, but they missed the mark, sticking the audience with a green co-pilot.  Also, there were four people who knew the pilot was not capable of flying the plane; the pilot, the co-pilot, and two of the stewardesses, none of those four people stepped up.The pilot was deranged from coke and alcohol, but the stewardesses and co-pilot were not impaired and risked their lives and the lives of all the passengers, why?  Didn't like how the Denzel Washington character tampered with witnesses in a federal investigation, and got away with it - also not believable that he would have gotten away with it.  The only thing I liked that the character did was confess he was an alcoholic, and that was nearly at the end of the film, so I spent the entire film with a character I disliked, ugh.  What I did like was the flight crash sequence, seriously scary, had me shaking.  All the actors were good, nice to see John Goodman.  Two and half stars.
0060594888|5.0|This book not only motivate but show you the path for Change. Excellent addition to any reader. looks big but a compact Life bible.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Often the author goes into too much detail, such as in the beginning, I learned way too much abut the three toed sloth.  Now the tiger and boy in the lifeboat.  I'm almost hoping for the boat to sink. I don't need to read another word about the way the tiger eats etither.  Not my favorite read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very interesting turns and twists. Makes you think of what you would do in their shoes. Good read! Highly recommended.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|These films are a must see, and the price for all six films in one box is too low not to purchase. Packaging is streamlined and handsome enough to speak to the legacy of the films.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Slow going but a fun challenge.  Give it a try yourself.  Don't lose patience.  Mulitiplayer mode is great fun.  Collect everything!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Kicks my as s every time! I love that she counts down the circuits, so you know how much longer you have to endure the pain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app inspired me to get my own horse and ride him/her every day. I would recommend this game to horse lover's.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Parents beware some of the animal scenes are not good for small children. Otherwise a memorable movie. We liked it.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|This book, Forever, is a great read that keeps you constantly on the tips of your toes. You don't ever want to put the book down. Although the plot, characters, and the potential reality of the love between grace and Sam is so advanced and well put-together, the ending makes you want more. You don't want it to end.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Came in great shape, and on time...Great CD, thanks :) Love all Maroon 5 has to offer on every track.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is like totally amazing. I love it. If I could discride it in one word it would be fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I like how it always changes and gives new challenges. It glitches some times when you die but I like the graphics as well.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I have been in love with this music  Never had the chance to see it on stage to my sorrow.  This film has knocked me out.  The new technique of filming the singing live and not in a studio has and will change the way they will make musicals in the future.  You get a chance to really feel, I mean really feel the characters emotions.  You can tell the difference the first song of Jean Valjean's.  You see the facial feeling the most.  To me that is a big part of this success.  When someone is lip singing the actor is not into it as much..  You put the track down month's before in a studio and there is were you put your emotions really into it.  In he case of duets you may not have even done the song together in the studio depending on the director and the knowledge of the sound editor.  Here it is face to face live looking at each other like on stage or if you want to go there as in real life.  How many people prefer seeing and talking to someone face to face instead of over phone or Skype, whatever new found electrical way of communication.<br /><br />Will update review later.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|This is a wonderful season!  I loved it! Matt Smith is wonderful as the Doctor.  I would recommend this to anyone!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A great read that reminds me of classic stories with scientific challenges and solutions. Think of the early Asimov robot stories where the engineers are solving their problems with logic and the laws of robotics.  Only in this case, its chemistry, physics, biology, and other scientific principles.  As for the style, Wier pulls off the 'diary/log' format very well, and switches back and forth with other perspectives without awkwardness.  This is absolutely worth your time and delivers far more entertainment that you'd expect for 99 cents.
B003DS9ECQ|1.0|We LOVE this movie so we rented it through amazon.com instant streaming. It froze about every 15 minutes for a few minutes at a time SO FRUSTRATING!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great!! I DO NOT HAVE ALL THE WORDS YOU WANT ME TO WRITE.... COME ON. THIS IS A JOKE. YOU ARE KIDDING RIGHT.
B007BVOEPI|1.0|One expects medieval shows to be more barbaric than modern life, but this was absolutely disgusting. There were simply no redeeming qualities in the episode, and certainly nothing to warrant watching a second.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is really fun. The graphics and sound quality are great! I'm almost 16 and I enjoy this game :) Add me as your neighbor 0d9877.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well I don't know were to start it's a never-ending game and it is so much fun you guys should do more like that go with the the state's do one that has Texas in it and all the other states in different games of subway surfers
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|It's a decent enough movie. But you never really get adequate explanations for a lot of things. And the never ending fight scenes are boring after a while. Roger Ebert said this movie is the love child of &#34;Twilight&#34; formula with &#34;Michael Bay&#34; formula. That's this movie in a nutshell.
1451695195|5.0|I read this book .  It's ok.  I will buy books again if  I see one that I like or need.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. It is the best GAME EVER in the whole wide world. It is so much fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It was very good has a lot of fun games in it and it's fun to have challenges and this game does have some challenges.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Hard to put down wants you get the hang of it. Love the effects of the lights and sounds. Have my co-workers hooked.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much. It's very fun and addicting. If never gets old like a lot of games do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and if u get the upgrade once, it automatically upgrades it again every time they upgrade it. Every year near Easter they will have u find eggs and u can  find things to get a.prize!!!!!
0321701763|2.0|Photoshop is a very powerful program with a large number of menus and capabilities.  A new user will certainly have to refer to several books and articles before he/she can feel somewhat comfortable with navigating the program. Having said that, in my opinion, this is not a good book to start with since the author does not explain at all why he/she makes the selections of the individual settings, or why a given menu option is selected, or what the recommended changes are actually doing. The reader is mainly following instructions without knowing the reasons behind them. I personally got more from \\"Photoshop CS5 - Restoration and Retouching of Digital Photography\\" by Mark Fitzgerald.
B00BLCHL4Y|1.0|Hi my name is Jacob. When Pawn Shop isn't on sometimes I watch this boring show. I like how they're always whispering in this very serious voice all the time that's how you can tell how dark and serious it is!! And the grey filter lets you know it all takes place a long time ago :) overall this is the best show ever.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Inspiring, interesting, and well written. I learned so much while enjoying a thoroughly wonderful story. I recommend this book to anybody who runs, wishes to run, and even to those who do not. It will grant you the motivation to get out there!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|We got the 3-D version.  Although the 3-D was not spectacular, it did give depth to the film.  The story, special effects and acting were all wonderful.
B005GSZZ1A|2.0|The Story of Camp 14 and the escape comprises only a small part of this book, and is somewhat interesting, even if poorly written. The references to history and other comparable situations seems to be the the majority of the book, and is thoroughly uninteresting. The book is worth no where near it's costs.
B00005ABTT|2.0|dvd is a standard not used in the US. The quality is grainy, definition is poor, sound track is ok. I got it on time and the box was in good condition. I will have to purchase a different blueray or dvd.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Everyone must love this musical. All of the players do a superb job of acting and the choreography is A-1.<br />Natalie Wood was one super actress!
B00B23O96A|5.0|many people think Layla was the best thing Eric Clapton ever did, but they seem to forget that when he made it he was strung out on dope, and in love with his best friends wife,  it took a while but he did survive and found some happiness with his wife and daughters, and he is showing that happiness in his music, so the recorded music is sappy, so what, the man can still take your breath away on stage, And if he is happy and wants to show on his albums then so be it, the man has had more sorrow then most, and has found happiness so if you dont like sappy put on the plug-in layla and shut up
B008BWFP2W|5.0|Julliete is always brilliant but this is a very interesting movie with superb acting that I'd recommend to anyone but the most extreme prude
B00ATSS73U|5.0|This CD album has got to be one of the best for Darlene. I much prefer Darlene leading praise and worship than singing contemporary Christian songs. I have all of the Hillsong praise and worship albums so even though this is not being labeled under the church's \\"Hillsong label\\", I'm putting it in the same class.  I really liked the early stuff Hillsongs did much better than the later stuff and I guess that's because Darlene sang on more songs then and less now.  I GUESS THAT'S WHY I LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH... BECAUSE SHE LEADS ALL THE SONGS.  Her voice is smooth, elegant, worshipful and vibrant.  Here 's why I love this album so much:<br /><br />1.  All the songs are Jesus centered and truly lend to revealing more of his love and life. There will be many songs that will be sung in many churches from this album.<br />2.  The CD has a great flow of the music. Lots of great high energy praise and very moving worship songs.<br />3.  Israel Houghton produced it and co-authored over half of the songs on this album.  I like everything he puts his hands to.  Things are always top notch when he's involved.<br />4.  This may be Darlene's LAST live album.... buy it.  you won't regret this awesome worship experience.<br /><br />Do I recommend:  HIGHLY.. HIGHLY...HIGHLY  The 365 day devotional book that come with the CD is awesome too. You can get the CD together with devotional or by itself.
B000VBP382|5.0|This version of &#34;Pride&#34; is very different from the previous Colin Firth story. But it is an excellent rendition, with a flair for showing life as it was then a little better than its predessor.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Just made the swap from the old bulb to this upgrade, i have 3 mag light AA and thus is the second one that i have upgraded with nite ize. The first upgrade was with nite ize I. This upgrade was with the nite ize II. It works so well I'm going to get another one for my other light. I am used to using a pelican pm6 3320 that uses lithium photo batteries and this upgrade is just as bright, even with those dead batteries you have in the bottom of your junk drawer
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Review  for Compound Effect  -- D Hardy  March 2013<br /> I wanted a good non-fiction book to review, while looking for good advice, as I embarked on a 3rd or 4th career.<br />His advice is not trite, but is “back to basics,” short of blunt. I still liked it—sort of…<br />He passes down some stern fatherly advice. He reminds us how to tackle a marathon or large or expensive project—just divide it into smaller tasks.<br />He admits his own career was a rebound to expansion. He helped revive Success Magazine, a 110-yr old classic, or Relic, now very contemporary.<br />Good timing for me (in between careers) and a reminder of the simple things that help success, but may appear unimportant if we get too busy, or self-centered, when we may be earning big money for a time…<br />It is a worthwhile reminder to be able to postpone our goals and gratification--very often the “compound effect” doesn’t pay off for a longtime.<br />He divides the book logically:  Choices,  habits, influences,  and momentum—leads to the payoff!<br />He offers free online tools to assess oneself objectively how you are improving your care of body and soul.<br />4 1/2 stars  Alan N Hunt
B00BI745AA|2.0|I didn't think it would be as much singing in the movie.  It was not my type of movie.  Unless you are really into these types of movies, save your money.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|When my 22-year-old son asked for this game for Christmas, I had never heard of it before.  It turns out that the whole family can play for hours, with each person using a different  strategy.  Every time you play the board can be arranged in a different way, holding the players' interest.
B003E8P9G0|2.0|I liked this book a lot and it was very des adoptive and I would love to read the rest of the series .I also love Rick Riodran.<br />I loved how he always describes things . I would love to read more of his books.I think that because I read the percy Jackson books I will love these books to.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is probably the most horse i could ever handle. i love the interaction with my horse and with the other stables.
B004OR199G|4.0|This book is very inspiring, with a lot of beautiful recipes. It makes you want to be a better person.
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|What a boring derivative album hyped out of sight as a radical musical statement from an icon of the C20th. Everything seemed cribbed from his past material;  I'm sure the production and the music is earth shattering but I just thought it was derivative self referential nonsense . Guess my ears aren't as acid saturated or my nose so powdered these days but where is the great music Bowie could and has produced in the past ?<br />Nice plastic surgery though David. Why don't you team up with David Gilmore and produce some really imaginative and cutting edge music ? Hated it, should have listened to it first before I bought it ! Incidentally why wait  10 years before producing this nonsense ?
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is a must have for any Les Mis lover.  Alfie Boe is amazing and gives an outstanding performance as Jean Valjean on par with the great Valjean's of the past.  In my opinion, he is one of the best if not the best.  Everyone in the cast is great particularly, Boe, Norm Lewis as Javert and Ramin Karimloo as Enjoras, the student leader.  The one flaw is Nick Jonas as Marius.  He is nowhere near the same level of quality in both singing voice and acting performance as the rest of the cast.  If you can look past that it is really great, mostly because of Alfie Boe.  I would recommend this to anybody who enjoys great muscial theater.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|go into the waters of the ocean to eat fish and other creatures to stay alive a d level up in size to try and get to the next shark from a reef shark to the biggest the great whiteand it is awesome and I use the control pad because to me it is easier
0307591549|5.0|This is a great start for someone who is looking to research and adapt these skills. Would highly recommend this a a reading group book to promote discussion and debate!
B00AIBZJLG|3.0|This Circus Du Solell was just ok to me.I was exspected a video of one of there shows. This DVD was done more as a movie format. Although interesting I whatched it once,once will be enough.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Showed Lincoln as a very endearing man with a great sense of humor. History is alot more interesting as an adult than as a child
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina is funny; we all know that. But I was pleasantly surprised that her writing, while it often made me laugh out loud, was also thought provoking, especially in regards to women in comedy.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|A couple of friends recommended Picoult to me and this was the first one I read. It was ok, but not great. The story was a little too far-fetched for me to get hooked.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I am so happy with leps world. I heard of it from a friend and she was right,it is completely fun and challenging but not to challenging you can't play it. Leps world rocks!!!!!!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|One of the worse movies I have ever watched. It has way too much cussing, dumb plot.  I am very disappointed.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What's not to like? I have followed the series on PBS and purchased this as a Christmas gift for a friend who had not seen it. She watched both series in two days, just before the third season was presented in January 2013!!
0307341550|4.0|This book is between 3.5-4.  But more of a 5 in some ways and a 1 in others.  My review is a bit schizophrenic but so is this book.<br /><br />The bad--> reads like a first time author.  Not subtle at all-- the whole town is depressing with no redeeming qualities.  Almost every single character is one or more of: an alcoholic, cutter, drug addict, animal abuser, child abuser, petty, gossipy,  bullies, weak and bullied, poor and tacky, rich and tacky, slutty...<br /><br />Ok-- we get it!!!!!! small towns can breed nasty people with dirty secrets.<br /><br />The author needs to give depth and complexity to her characters.<br /><br />The great--> gory, violent, suspenseful, you will not put it down. Interesting and exciting. Pyschologically suspenseful. Grips your attention and pulls you in and you like the (very) flawed main character despite her weakness and stupidity.<br /><br />If you love the author's other 2 GREAT books (Sharp Objets and Gone Girl) you should read this just to see how she has grown as an author-- but also- it is similar in style.  If you love her others, you will like this.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Such a well written book. Great story and you really get attached to the characters. I can't wait to read the next one and find out what's going to happen next.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is a hard genre to describe.  It isn't really a murder mystery, it is kind of a relationship book, but not exactly.  I guess it is a woman's journey and self-discovery, but not corny and not preachy.  Pretty violent and suspensful.<br /><br />Masterful and beautiful -- will keep you up at night and you will think about it long after.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of those rare stories that rings true. If anything, it's this generation's Catcher in the Rye. The movie is wonderful. We know people who are in the 60s and young teens who loved this story.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I liked the style of this book.  It is not the average murder mystery/ legal thriller-- although it is that.  It is also about family, love, relationships.<br />Great book.  I don't want to say too much-- there are too many spoilers given in these reviews.  just- read it!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|The was the greatest movie ever!  I really loved it.  I was watching it on a long plane ride and had to use closed caption because it was so loud in the plane.  Worked well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I find this game extremely calming and fun to play. It also helps me to challenge my speed, eye and hand coordination. I recommend this game to anyone of all ages.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|The singing was excellent in the movie.  The story line was sad but true to life at that time.  I really enjoyed the movie.
0765325950|5.0|Mixed emotions when this came out and I read it - was excited that it came out, but sad that it's the final book because I have enjoyed the series so much! I also want to thank you Brandon Sanderson for finishing up the series after Robert Jordan passed away.
B009MYAQK4|4.0|I found this book very enlightening like reading a religious text. However, I found the story confusing and incomplete. The book has some wonderful teachings though.
B0037RDPEG|1.0|This the worst book I have ever read.<br />It had no depth, very little story and quite frankly it was one of the most boring and non eventful  books I have ever read.
B00AWD4KFQ|5.0|Loved the special effects reflecting magic.  A must see if you enjoy magic.  I feel there should be a sequel, but as of yet no joy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great way to pass time when your looking for simple fun. Easy enough to let your kids play, only down side is some things cost actual money.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|What can I say about this movie besides how AWESOME it was.  I loved everything about it.  Will be adding it to my movie library.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Another good book by Lee Child. Jack Reacher is my favorite book character and I couldn't wait to read A Wanted Man. I couldn't put it down.
1476712042|3.0|This is definitely more of a teen book. I felt that the relationships were very unrealistic and did not like the obsessive power/control that he had over her. I did not even finish reading the book.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My entire family loves this movie. Highly entertaining with brilliant animation. We can all identify with the characters.  Would recommend for ALL age groups.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Excelente price and quality.<br /><br />I felt a little lost because there were no page numbers, but locations. But everything else was cool.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|A &#34;must see&#34; for all Tinker Bell fans. Without a doubt my personal favorite of the Tinker Bell movies. My 8 year old daughter watches it over and over....and never seems to tire of it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This book simply shows another side of Jack Reacher, the thinking side.  Yes, there is no violence every 30 pages, how refreshing.  It seems some of the reviewers want Jack to constantly be fighting someone for the book to be to their liking, which is why they did not enjoy this one as much and gave it low ratings.  But I loved the way it was a mind game this time, he led us through the mystery as he figured things out in his head.  Lots of humor too this time which I really enjoyed.  It gave Jack a more rounded out personality...and no he didn't get the girl this time.  More realistic actually.  He finally gets to kill many bad guys at the end for those readers that need that thrill.  It's still a 'can't put it down' book, so enjoy the ride.
B004IWF64Q|4.0|My family loves Pocahontas and we watch it still on family movie nights. The sequel was great. It will also be added to our family movie library.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|My daughter is in photography, and loves to store all her pics on her IPad. It works great she doesn't complain about it. She really likes using it and says its easy to use. She has not had a problem with the camera connection kit.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another Harry Bosch masterpiece!<br />Cannot wait for the next one but take time and write another Greg book on Bosch.
030758836X|5.0|I'd like to give it more stars! Best book I've read in quite a while! Intriguing twists and turns as the story is told in alternating chapters by husband and wife. One of those that stayed in my mind even when I had to close the book.<br /><br />I've read many reviews that criticize the ending. That worried me - I was afraid that I'd be glued to 400 great pages and the ending would ruin the experience for me. Not so! I found it to be quite the psychological puzzle from beginning to end. I'm recommending it to every reader I know!
B009GESJH2|5.0|Saw them last time they came to town and enjoyed them just as much this time, except for the crummy seats we got from ticketmaster.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|It was somewhat of a predictable ending,  but there weren't too many loose ends.  I was glad to have closure in the series.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Thought I already did this one. I wasn't  as impressed with this book as the first. It just didn't hold my interest as much. 8^)
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|We read this book out loud as a family and our children really<br /> Enjoyed it. It is full of humor and adventures. Tom, buck and Becky seem real.
B00BF123WG|2.0|This movie could have easily been told in a hour and a half, but it just drags on for over two hours.  Even when you get to the end they shoot Bin Laden, it is over in two seconds.  Save your money, wait to see it for free on TV.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this mouse after my g9x started to act weird, this mouse is much better in almost every-way. Mouse buttons have a good quality feel, quick to click. Everything about this mouse is almost ideal for me the only issues I have are that the dpi lights are far to bright for night gaming, colored in with a marker and fixed the issue. And I do wish that the side mouse buttons were positioned a bit farther back.. that is something I can adjust to and no fault of the mouse for personal preference.<br /><br /> The software is simple to use and works well i will likely never use all the buttons on the mouse but its nice to know they are there if needed.<br /><br /> Over all I love the mouse and would suggest anyone to buy it that is looking for a good mouse with a great company backing it up. They actually take time to make sure the customer is happy that is a rare find today; people should support these type of company's... MANY times have I bought something and been SOL if it broke. With anker you do not have that issue.<br /> ( cant wait for a matching keyboard )
006220629X|2.0|The Shadow of the Wind was the first book I encountered by Carlos Ruiz Zafon. After reading the opening passage, it quickly became one of my favorite reads of all time. The image of the Cemetery of Lost Books is one that I find both poignant and resonate. How often do we relinquish stories to unforgotten corners of our communities? Part of the brilliance of that novel is that through relationships with those we love, we weave into our identity the stories that make us who we are.<br /><br />As I read The Prisoner of Heaven, I was not equally taken. I found the plot to ramble around; it lacked focus. I am not certain what the tension within the story was supposed to be. From time to time, Ruiz Zafon surprises us with a noir character and ominous insinuation. Yet, they remain surface throughout the story. For most of the novel, I found myself bored.<br /><br />Bordom is the last thing we long for when picking up a book, whether taken from a forgotten shelf in the library or from the bestseller's table in the bookstore. I wanted to be transported and transformed by Ruiz Zafon's imagination. This time, I closed the book disappointed.
B00BESJYAY|1.0|Very poor video quality, had to turn-off after 10 minutes of viewing. Unlike Netflix....Amazon video streaming is pathetic and totally avoidable.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|I bought this for my son for Easter. He is 2. He loves this garage. I glued the ramps down with wood glue as I read this in another review, and I'm very glad I did. It works very well, otherwise they would've just leaned against the garage, and I'm sure they would've been knocked down constantly. I have to agree with other reviews in which the gas pumps are difficult to use. I think a design for the pumps could've been done a little differently. He loves the car wash. He uses this with all of his matchbox cars, however many do not fit into the elevator, but he doesn't see this as a problem. I  love the quality, very nicely made.
0439882826|5.0|I purchased this for my grandson who absolutely all of Star Wars.  It is one of his favorite treasures.  He keeps it in his treasures box.
B00000G3PA|5.0|If you like Sif-fi you will like this movie. With reacent events of the metor in Russia how long before this is real?
B0028O9VB0|5.0|Haven't been able to find it in the stores.  My kids studied Chris Van Allsburg at school, so this was a great gift for them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is such a fun game I love it! My 5 year old loves it too he loves feeding the horse!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A good solid end to the trilogy. It is not a cookie cutter ending, which is what I like the best about it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is south fun I play all the time and I am so addictive to this it is AWESOME!!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is awesomebut there is way to much facebook like faebook this or post this or do that way to much!!!!!!!!!

B007M45PMU|5.0|This is one of the easiest albums to listen to. Catchy songs, great fun (and clean) lyrics, good sound, overall one of my favorites.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I really enjoy this movie.  It's a very good adaptation taking a more realistic view of the Bennet family than you usually see.  But . . . well there's this other version that I really like more with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.
0374533571|3.0|I read this book while riding in a car on a long road trip.  It is an easy read and help to pass the hours away.  I didn't find this to be book that I didn't want to end, but I did enjoy it.
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|This music sets you in the mood for love, relaxing by a fireplace or simply while you drive. Beautiful!!!<br /><br />looking forward to the next album.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I picked this book for my book club based on the reviews alone.  Normally my book club readers do not see eye-to-eye on the books we read but this one was an exception - we all loved it.  It speaks to the realities of relationships: the things that bring us together and tear us apart, the things we say to each other and the things we fail to say, the people who identify with us and those who can never identify with us.  It is an insightful book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|All the weather information is there with lots of color and multimedia content.  AccuWeather puts out a fine product in a well thought out package.
B0084P9202|5.0|This is a very beautifully produced album. The sound is characteristic of sigur ros and will not disappoint. Great relaxing music, I use in my yoga studio.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I just finished re-reading the book and this movie uses a very large amount of dialog strait from the book.  It improves what little it changes.  I also have the original videocassette version of this movie.  The DVD version is much better, of course.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|It is a good product. You can turn it too read in many angle.  I will rec command I recommend this product.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The Celtic Women have a great sound.  Very soft and pure.  Hope to see them on their US tour this year.<br />Also, it proves that you really can find good entertainment on PBS
B001P9EQH8|3.0|I bought this to boost the volume from my iPhone 4 into my Bose Overear headphones.  It only boosted the volume slightly so for $20 I would say just save your money and put up with the lower volume.  It is small but it's just a hassle to have everything clunking around in my pocket.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This one is the best I have found to work with the kindle HD so far.  Looks and acts a lot like the original facebook for the computer.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was a great book. It kept me reading, I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to see the movie, even though the books are always better.
B00AEFZ2DG|5.0|Sahara is one of my ll time fun movies to watch.  Love the characters and the swashbuckling adventure feel of the movie.  Watched it many times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a great game and you should play it if you want a horse or if you have one and if you get it and do not like it then fine you can hate me if you want but I love it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I am very disappointed there aren't any more books in the series as I zipped through all three of them very quickly.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|One of the best TV series I have ever watched. I am anxiously waiting for the 4th season to begin!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very addictive and a lot of fun and I can't put it down especially with all the features this game adds on every now and then! :-)
0071762345|5.0|Very good read. Focused and good resource for getting involved with Social Media! Look forward to putting this into reality,
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The standing case is well constructed, is attractive in fabric appearance, and its strong contrasting black elastic band keeps the case closed when not using the Kindle.
0205313426|5.0|Any writer needs this small manual. It is the VERY BEST wordsmith writing guide for the English language anywhere. I have used it for years, and would not write without it at hand.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Great game, fast without being twitchy. Graphics are clean and crisp.  Download is very fast.  What else do you need?<br />And of course the price is right.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|interesting, well written, first time to read Sparks book,  I will look for more of his books to read soon.

1612130283|5.0|My review of this series in written after the third book, shown above.  I highly recommend this trilogy - enjoyed them a great deal.
1439152802|3.0|The Secret Keeper was my first time reading Kate Morton. This book had all of my favorite elements; a bit of history, a story within a story, complex characters and a mystery as the cherry on the top of the cake.<br /><br />Right from the start, I was easily transported back to the early 1960's in rural England. The countryside opened up and drew me in. Then as fast as I got comfortable, I was sent back to 1941 during Blitz in in WWII.<br /><br />Although the storyline and the mystery kept me turning pages, there was something missing for me. I wanted to know more about the sisters. I still am not sure why they were even necessary to the book. Certainly they were not integral to the plot development or involved in solving the mystery. I wanted to know more about Laurel.  Aside from knowing she was this famous actress, you learn nothing more. Did she really have nothing else in her life besides that and this mystery carried from her youth? It just seemed strange to me never to get a glimpse into her world and to really know her.<br /><br />I also struggled at two points in the story in which one Laurel came to a conclusion which I couldn't figure out how she got to. I even went back in the book looking for it and couldn't locate it.  Another involved Dr. Rufus. Not sure if any other readers picked up on this.  I found this a bit sloppy for a mystery read where making deductions and coming to conclusions is critical.<br /><br />I found it improbable a sixteen year old could witness the crime she did involving her own Mother and not have a more visceral reaction and then go on to lie to the police and her entire family.  Perhaps if she had been younger when this happened it would have worked better.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the read and was surprised when the final mystery unfolded.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I did not enjoy reading this book. But I also couldn't give up on it! It was so well-written. And though the subject matter is really dark, the father's love is beautifully presented. Bravo! I think I'd like to read more from this author. Hopefully his other books are not as depressing.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I play it everyday. My niece's love to watch me play it. It gets so fast it's hard to keep up, the only thing that upsets me is when I had to reset my kindle fire HD I lost my surfers and boards that I earned and bought. My standing stayed the same...
1612130585|5.0|See above review, as it includes all three books.  I highly recommend this series of books, which I have read several times.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Amazing! A very interesting read! I couldn't put it down! Loved the writing style. Keeps you guessing til the very end.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|\\"Oz The Great and Powerful\\" is not a bad movie or wrongfully wrote. I never read the books, therefore I'm going with the \\"Wizard Of Oz\\" movie. However I do research, and what I found stated that \\"L. Frank Baum himself wrote from an in-universe standpoint, many fans of the series treat the books as if they were true, known among the fans as the \\"Oz as History\\" standpoint. Any confusion or contradiction between the different versions of their histories is said to be the fault of the historian making an honest mistake, of the editors for removing parts which they did not consider suitable for the child audience, of the characters involved who reported the incidents in question back to the historian, or explained by the concept that many alternate versions of Oz exist simultaneously.\\"<br /><br />This prequel, \\"Oz The Great and Powerful\\" fits perfectly as can be expected. By this I mean, everyone is dead and gone that had anything to do with the \\"Wizard Of Oz movie.\\" Besides that, I believe no one can do the old films respect, as they rely on special effects more than story.<br /><br />The production starts out in black and white as the original film and switches to color. A magician (James Franco) is swept away in the manner one expects, to the enchanted land of Oz and is forced into a power struggle between three witches (some good some bad). Its theme shows how deceit and the empty promise of love can mar and undo people. This can certainly give something for teens to talk about, or for parents with their teenage children.<br /><br />As for the actors? They did a fine job. I found nothing wrong with casting or the acting.<br /><br />I had a very critical and old friend with me who believed, \\"...the movie was fantastically produced and directed. The sound score and special effects captured your imagination without breaking the splendor of the previous film.\\"<br /><br />The only two items either of us wondered about was:<br /><br />1) \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\" the Wizard refuses to grant their wishes (as he cannot/no real power) but after Toto accidentally exposes him as a normal old man with no real magical powers, he tries to make up for this. He gives the Scarecrow a diploma, Lion a medal and Tin Man a heart-shaped clock. He decides to fly Dorothy home in his hot air balloon, but it accidentally takes off without her. Glinda arrives and tells Dorothy that she has always had the power to go back to Kansas; the ruby slippers will take her back. She previously did not tell Dorothy this because Dorothy had to realize for herself that \\"There's no place like home\\".  After saying her goodbyes, Dorothy clicks her heels three times and awakens back home in her bed, surrounded by family, the three farmhands and Professor Marvel. She claims the farmhands and Professor Marvel were in Oz, though it is implied Dorothy's visit to Oz was simply a dream.<br /><br />A dream?<br /><br />Yet in Oz The Great and Powerful\\" it is shown not to be a dream. Nothing either of us noted even implies this.<br />Why?<br />For it is obviously a parallel reality of some sort. Hence why some people are similar on Oz to those on Earth.<br />A stretch?<br />No. Magic is just a way people explain away things they do not comprehend as science.<br />If, on the other hand, you wish to believe Oz is an enchanted land, then did Oz die? Is this an after life or brief dream before death? I prefer a parallel world. If you want to see the lands, look-up this: Oz and surrounding countries.<br /><br />2) Why would the Wizard Of Oz want to leave? (Feeling guilty or not for Dorthy). He and Glinda (Michelle Williams) were becoming serious, and by Dorthies time they should have had children. Since many years obviously passed between this prequel and the old well known \\"Wizard Of Oz\\"  we wished they would have covered this issue or otherwise never established a romantic relationship between Oz and Glinda.<br /><br />In any event, the movie is well worth buying if you are a Oz fan. I have no issues with the paying for my ticket. And I will be purchasing the DVD when it comes out. So that should say something too.e no issues with the paying for my ticket. And I will be purchasing the DVD when it comes out. So that should say something too.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I now have most of her workout videos. They are exceptional. I hate the gym and could never be consistent or excited about working out until these videos. She is sharp, funny, times her encouragement correctly, but most importantly of course, the workouts are great. They are not so hard that you can't do them, but really do give you an excellent workout. Since I have a number of the videos I change them up so it never gets boring.<br /><br />I am not sure what sparked me to buy her video (I don't watch The Biggest Loser), but I am so happy that I did and have since purchased her other workout videos. I feel great, feel my body changing, and I am so much happier.<br /><br />I like that you only need hand weights and a mat, as opposed to P90X (I injured myself in a ludicrously absurd way) and the Brazilian Butt Lift video (the instructor comes off like an idiot and the workouts are boring). Some of her videos are 20 minute workouts (I have 2 kids so this is a plus), but even these make you sweat and really work hard.
B003L20IJM|5.0|We enjoyed this movie, very much. My little nephews got a great kick out of it!  Just as entertaining as the original Nanny McPhee, and will definitely watch it again!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I LOVED THIS APP.I think it could have been longer for the price but liked it anyway.Great graphics and story line.
0345803507|5.0|I came away from this series of books with a great deal of respect for Ms. James' ability to write a book which includes the sexual areas of sadism/masochism and dominance/submission in such a way as to not offend or horrify the many readers who are not familiar with those subject areas.  I suspect that some readers were offended or horrified and did not finish the book, but judging from the success of the trilogy, there were not many.<br /><br />I myself knew little about these areas of sexuality, but found that I could accept and value Mr. Christian Grey because of the way she presented him.  He is a man who would be attractive to many women, but he had flaws which resulted in his need for those kinds of sexuality and lifestyle.  Outside of that, he was tall, handsome, wealthy, brilliant, and very much attracted to Ms. Anastasia Steele.  Women could identify with her in terms of her innocence about the lifestyle he wanted her to participate in.  Her strongly negative reaction to the first time he caused her pain, was probably how many of us would feel about it happening to us, no matter who the perpetrator was.  She left him, and rightly so, which caused him to realize how much he cared for her, and needed her in his life.  The crux of the matter came here, in that he (with the help of his therapist) realized that he wanted Anastasia, and would work on changing many aspects of his lifestyle that she (and ultimately, he) found unacceptable.  So, from that, many of us have given ourselves permission to read and love the rest of the story.<br /><br />Eye rolling and lip biting aside, this may not be Pulitzer prize winning literature, but it is a well written story with some wonderful descriptions of their sexual encounters.  There is also humor in their e-mails to each other, and  the antics of what she called her inner goddess, all of which I enjoyed.  The criticism of some reviewers were things I'd noticed, but they didn't bother me to the extent I would toss the book.  In fact, I highly recommend it.ook.  In fact, I highly recommend it.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I have been a George R R fan for many years - from way back when he was writing short stories for various science fiction magazines and when the first of the Ice and Fire series was published, I leapt on it without hesitation.<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed the series over the years and my first reaction to the making of a mini series was \\"Oh Gawd, this going to be an unholy mess\\"!<br />Wasn't I in for a surprise - not only was it not an uholy mess but has been to me, the most riveting, \\"can't get enough\\"  mini series since \\"Carnivale\\".<br />The story follows the original tale with accuracy and the young, mostly unknown actors are impeccably cast. It's gratifying also to see the smattering of familiar faces, mostly from various British TV dramas.<br />A triumph indeed!
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|The story was interesting.  The plot was believable and the relationship were cute.  Characters and the world seems to be 2D and lacked the depth to really draw the reader in.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|My family really enjoyed this movie!  The story maintained everyone's interest, and the visual was spectacular!!!  I definitely recommend this for your next family movie night!
B0084IG7KC|3.0|The main movie is great but for the price I wish it came with special features. It seems like so many BDs are skimpy in the special features department.
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|Iron Maiden's latest CD is the long awaited re-release of the 1988 Birmingham NEC concerts entitled Maiden England '88 and is a must for all fans of Iron Maiden.<br />Some people are still whining about Iron Maiden releasing \\"yet another live album\\" but it was in concert where Maiden's true colors are shown. Maiden England had been out of print from video for years but in 2013 (25 years after it was first recorded), the concert is re-released on CD, limited 2-LP, DVD and Blu-Ray. The Maiden England concert sees Iron Maiden (at the time consisted of Bruce Dickinson on vocals; guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith (this was Smith's last shows with the band until his 1999 return); bass player Steve Harris and drummer Nicko McBrain) perform at the tail end of the tour to support its Seventh Son Of a Seventh Son Tour. Brilliantly recorded by Martin Birch (now retired), this captures the band as they finished the Seventh Son Tour before Adrian Smith would leave the band in 1989 for ten years and one of the best Maiden performances ever (as I found out back in late 1993 after I stole the VHS from an ex-buddy).<br />We begin things with \\"Moonchild\\" which seamlessly goes from the intro from the record into a blazing live version. Next is a stellar \\"The Evil That Men Do\\". Next is a track (not performed live at the time since 1982) \\"The Prisoner\\" and a stellar version. Next is \\"Still Life\\" which was an awesome deep track performed live. Next is a stellar live version of \\"Infinite Dreams\\" which is superior to the studio version. We follow with a great version of \\"Killers\\". Next is \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" and still my favorite version of the track (this was excised from the CD that came with the Maiden England video in the 1990s)! Next is \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" and is superior to its studio counterpart by a longshot (plus the best live version of the track still). We close the first CD with a killer live version of \\"Wasted Years\\" which is still the best version of the track!<br />Disc two begins with the live version of \\"The Clairvoyant\\" which just burns. Next is the title cut to Seventh Son Of a Seventh Son and this is better than the studio version IMHO. Superb version of this classic track, especially the instrumental at the end with the band playing as if it were playing its last gig. Next is the brilliant version of \\"The Number of the Beast\\" (only the versions on Live After Death, Beast Over Hammersmith and 2012's En Vivo give it a run for the money). Next is \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" (which too was excised from the European CD/VHS combo pack issue of the album in the 1990s) and is a brilliant version of this track. We close the show with the band's theme song \\"Iron Maiden\\" and a great live version it is. It's one of the best I heard (my favorite was still Dortmund 1983 when Eddie (the band's mascot) got his \\"just desserts\\")! Now on the CD/LP/DVD/Blu-Ray, you get three songs not on the original concert film which were the encores (mixed specially for this re-issue by Kevin Shirley). First is a spirited \\"Run to the Hills\\". Then a stellar version of \\"Running Free\\". We close proceedings with the live version of \\"Sanctuary\\" and is just a stellar ending to a phenomenal concert!<br />Iron Maiden's Maiden England '88 is a stellar live album/concert film. I ranked the live recordings with Live After Death, Maiden England '88 and Rock in Rio tied for first, En Vivo and Beast Over Hammersmith (second), Flight 666 (third), Death On the Road (fourth), A Real Dead One (fifth), A Real Live One (sixth) and last was Live in Donnington 1992. If one needs to have any live Maiden album, get this one (along with Rio, Live After Death and En Vivo).<br />Highly recommended!>Disc two begins with the live version of \\"The Clairvoyant\\" which just burns.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|This compelling series continues on from the first outstanding season with nary a complaint from me. I have been reading the books of the Ice and Fire series for years and except for occasional small changes to the original tale,the TV series is pretty much spot on. The (to me) unfamiliar young actors all play their roles to perfection and it's good to see so many familiar faces amongst the older cast members if like me, one is an avid viewer of British drama.<br />To all involved, you've done yourselves proud and I can't wait for series three to become available.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|No instructions on how to play.  Must always purchase something to continue playing.  Unlike other games, once you purchase the game you can play as long as you want.  With Bingo Blitz once you use up an item needed for playing such as &#34;B&#34; tokens you must purchase more in order to continue playing. It seems impossible to earn the tokens needed to continue playing.

0545123291|4.0|I read through Linger pretty quickly.  I liked the development of Grace and Sam's relationship and the addition of the cocky, messy, Cole St. Clair into the mix. The use of poetry and imagery is elegant and well placed. Without giving too much away I also liked the switch that happened in this segment.  As I read, the leisurely pace had me feeling as though I too was waiting for the thaw to once again gaze on the face of my beloved. I'm looking forward to seeing how this all ends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I don't know how I came across this game..and not really sure why I downloaded it either cuz I'm not a very big horse person but I actually really like this game a lot... I highly suggest playing.......just try anyway I mean its free what do you have to lose

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started to watch this series thinking it may be one of those dry period pieces, but was very pleasantly surprised to LOVE it and am now left wanting more!  I really am fascinated by history, particularly English history around the turn of the century.  It is a bit of a soap opera, but it has me hooked!  It also has my husband hooked, and he ID NOT want to watch it in the first place!!!  :)

B0089OBLDO|4.0|I ordered this for a PC game and it connects but for some reason it did not work for the PC game. It does however work for Xbox, and PS3 so I am not out any money. It came with simple instructions so I thought I must have loaded everything right, but I am not a computer genius so I took it to one and they still could not get it to work. It does say it will work on a PC, but we could not get it to work on either of ours.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Action never stops. Ties into the original Bond movies. Big screen Blu-ray quality keeps you riveted.  Craig's portrayal of Bond is getting closer and closer to Fleming's description of Bond in his books and he is truly the next best Bond, after Connery of course.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best app ever! very fun it is definately the best app in the kindle app store. have found many diamonds
B0071LLHO4|5.0|I have read lots posts on concerns about the sound of this collection. I think both discs sound great. I already have the DARE/LOVE & DANCING version but picked this up for the Fascination EP and some of the bonus tracks. The collection still gets 5 Stars. Cool box with some cardboard sleeves inside. The * comes into play on my 5 star review because, I would have liked to have seen Virgin put out the Fascination EP with the tracks in the order as they appeared on the original EP; with the bonus stuff not on the original EP at the end. Not a big deal, but for people that had the original vinyl or cassette when it came out- that's how our brains remember it and it would be fun to revisit this the way we remembered the songs appearing. I also noticed that the \\"Hard times\\" that appeared on the oroginal EP is not on this CD. I have it on a Love Action 3\\", and I believe it is on the rarities CD that came out a few years ago, but would have loved to see it on this Fascination EP. The \\"Fascination\\" disc comes in its own sleeve as if it is the original Fascination EP, but it is not. All in all a great collection to have- and it is recommended for old fans and a good starting point for new fans. I became a fan when the fascination EP came out and went backwards to DARE, and then followed the band's releases up to Octopus.
B00136NYR6|5.0|The many moods of Bob Dylan's inner dwelling between folk and rock collided here.

0802130208|1.0|Does anyone over five years of age actually laugh hysterically at the sight of a circus clown? No. But why?? They have silly clothes! And...and....they slipped on a banana peel and fell down on their butts! Isn't that the most witty and hysterical thing you have ever seen?<br /><br />Thus is the &#34;comedy&#34; of the wildly overrated A Confederacy of Dunces. Ignatius is &#34;funny&#34; because he wears silly clothes that aren't stylish. And he is &#34;hysterically funny&#34; because he takes himself too serious and is a pseudo-intellectual.<br /><br />&#34;Look! He is speaking very, very formally and says the word Fortuna a lot like he is someone special when, you know, he really isn't. That is, like, so incredibly hysterical! If you don't think that's funny then clearly the humor is too sophisticated for you.&#34;<br /><br />There are, apparently, many people who think watching someone get hit in the face with a banana cream pie is the funniest thing they have ever seen or read. If you picked up A Confederacy of Dunces expecting something like Dorothy Parker or Oscar Wilde you'll be wildly, WILDLY disappointed. If you though Adam Sandler's movie &#34;Jack and Jill&#34; was funny....you will love this book. And then if people don't think seeing someone slip on a banana peel is THE FUNNIEST THING EVER then those who do will say to you that you must not be smart enough to &#34;get the humor.&#34; So forewarned.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|This book inexplicably (to me at the time) appeared on several lists of the greatest fantasy novels of all times.  To me, fantasy literature was Tolkien, Lieber, Moorcock, etc, not a book about ordinary rabbits, but my daughter was assigned to read this book. for school, so since it was on hand, I decided to read it and see what the fuss was all about.<br /><br />After reading it, I can say I honestly was as engaged and thrilled at reading about the adventures of Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver and the others as any heroic fantasy book I have ever read.  The very fact that the &#34;heroes&#34; were rabbits, timid and weak, yet found ways with their abilities and wits to face great dangers and not just survive but triumph was the most engaging part.  I would heartily and without reservations recommend this book and now I understand why it made the list of best fantasy books of all time.
0062112430|4.0|Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales.<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: An enticing and alluring dystopian about love with the right amount of romance.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: It has been sixty-four years since the president and the Consortium identified love as a disease, and forty-three since the scientists perfected a cure.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />I'm really late in reading Delirium by Lauren Oliver, a story where love is a disease and is forbidden. In this dystopian society, Oliver brings out the beautiful and ugly side of emotions, feelings, and simply, about love. But I'm glad that I was late, because after this story ended, I would have died in agony. What would I do after the proverbial \\"The End\\" appears on the page? Oliver showed me her talent and definitely lured me in.<br /><br />Delirium is set in Portland, Maine, where this world considers love, amor deliria nervosa, a serious and dangerous disease. \\"It affects your mind so that you cannot think clearly, or make rational decisions about your own well-being. When citizens turn eighteen, they undergo a surgical procedure removing a part of the brain to cure them of the disease. They are also interviewed and matched to their ideal mate. Lena is on the cusp of the age, eager to rid herself of the disease. She remembers what it did to her mother, as well as her father. Everything changes for Lena when she meets Alex. Her world is challenged and her views questioned. Lena questions who she is as a person and falls deeply for this boy.<br /><br />Lena is a well-rounded character. I saw Lena evolve throughout the span of Delirium. Oliver writes fantastic characters on paper. Seeing the world through Lena's point of view brought the same emotions that she felt. I found Lena to be naive and innocent, accepting things at face value. But as time passed, I saw how Lena changed. I appreciated the shortcomings of her character because it brought out strengths later on.<br /><br />I can't really talk about Alex, only because it would spoil several things. I adored him and his tenacity, loving him even more for his passion. Oliver wrote this swoony boy well, providing the perfect plot device. The love story seemed genuine and I thought it manifested in a realistic and timely manner. I loved these two characters together and apart.<br /><br />The world set in Delirium is different, attempting at an utopian society where love is taken out of the equation. Oliver's world is developed, vibrant, and rich, always providing the perfect setting for any of the given scenes. The characters are riveting and unique, each with their own personality in a world where emotions are null and void. I felt a disconnect to some of the characters, but I think it was how I related to them. I found myself wishing that they could be a different way, or think in another. But I will tell you this: despite my feelings for the characters, I was still hooked to the story.<br /><br />Oliver writes beautifully, bringing a unique prose to the mix of young adult stories. While Delirium can be fast-paced at times, I never found it to be too much, too fast. I enjoyed the pace and devoured each word that she produced.

I adored him and his tenacity, loving him even more for his passion. Oliver wrote this swoony boy well, providing the perfect plot device. The love story seemed genuine and I thought it manifested in a realistic and timely manner. I loved these two characters together and apart.<br /><br />The world set in Delirium is different, attempting at an utopian society where love is taken out of the equation. Oliver's world is developed, vibrant, and rich, always providing the perfect setting for any of the given scenes. The characters are riveting and unique, each with their own personality in a world where emotions are null and void. I felt a disconnect to some of the characters, but I think it was how I related to them. I found myself wishing that they could be a different way, or think in another. But I will tell you this: despite my feelings for the characters, I was still hooked to the story.<br /><br />Oliver writes beautifully, bringing a unique prose to the mix of young adult stories. While Delirium can be fast-paced at times, I never found it to be too much, too fast. I enjoyed the pace and devoured each word that she produced.

B0033AI41G|5.0|I read the Sylvia Nasar book and was happy when this film was first released. Now I am delighted to see the film in HD on blu-ray.<br />Ron Howard directed A Beautiful Mind and Russell Crowe, a native of New Zealand, gave an excellent portrayal of a West Virginia mathematician. Jennifer Connally and Ed Harris are fine supporting actors.<br />This role for Russell Crowe, which came early in his movie career, was atypical for Crowe, who is best known as the Gladiator. Crowe was outstanding in a very different role in L.A. Confidential. A recent film by Crowe is The Next Three Days.<br />Enjoy A Beautiful Mind. It may be his best performance.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book a lot more details were left out of the movie. Can't wait to read the next book.
B0060D2PFY|5.0|This film was a perfect synthesis of cinematography, music, acting and direction. I fail to understand why it was not a commercial success, but it is clear to everyone who has seen it why it was nominated for 7 Academy Awards. Pacino and Crowe are as marvelous as ever! It is a well paced film that, even at 2.5 hours, held my attention for the duration.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|This is a great version of the movie.  Everything looks great, except the scenes they needed chromakey (green/blue screen) for because they couldn't make that as clean as everything else.  However, some of the sound is a little silly.  Mainly, I think I'm hearing newly inserted digital effects that are crisp and clear over the old analog music and voice and the sound quality just doesn't match.  Gun shots and their echoing booms sound different from the rest of the movie.  The gun shots from Arnold's laser-sighted hand gun also have been completely changed and sound cheesy for what it is...like something out of Star Wars that isn't necessarily even a weapon.  Even the future scenes have weapons that sound more like something out of Star Wars or even Tron.

0062014536|3.0|Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales.<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: A series ending that left me wanting much more than what was written.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: I've started dreaming of Portland again.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />The last installment in Lauren Oliver's Delirium trilogy is Requiem. After the cliffhanger from Pandemonium, I would have probably died waiting a year to read this book. Luckily, I read the series after the release of Requiem. I don't know how many fans did it, but I'm just glad I didn't have to endure the wait.<br /><br />But I think my expectations were set really high for this book. Delirium introduced me to a wonderful and unique story that I fell in love with. Pandemonium brought me to the point of intense infatuation. But with Requiem, I loved it until I didn't. I will try my best to keep this review spoiler free, but there maybe a moment or two that it will be impossible to do so while proving a point. Also, if you're reading this review, I'm going to assume that you have read Pandemonium and know what has happened so far.<br /><br />Told in a dual point-of-view storyline, Requiem follows the lives of Lena and Hana. Lena is in the Wilds, after a surviving captivity in the tunnels. She is learning to live in a different and altered version of the Wilds. Lena's outlook is different, a little more jaded, and definitely numb. Julian shows his affections for Lena, but she doesn't know what her heart wants. Alex coming back to the picture has changed everything for the better and worse. Hana on the other hand, is cured, about to be married, and living the life that her mother wanted for her. Hana's life isn't all that was promised. She still finds herself questioning things, and with the upcoming nuptials to her husband, she must make sure to keep these emotions in check.<br /><br />Lena changes a lot in Requiem. There are choices that Lena must make, that will change her future. There's a large love triangle that sticks out and I wish it was handled differently. There is so much pain all around, for the characters and the reader, that I wish it wasn't so angsty. There is also Lena's new outlook about the Wilds. She doesn't seem to appreciate it now as she did then. I think the fantasized version of her freedom and escape has been broken into this harsh reality that she's not so sure of. I feel bad for her most of the time. It's like she had doubts and second guesses on her life. I didn't connect with her in Requiem. I didn't think she made the choices I would have made or done things that I would have. Where I previously thought she was unique and fierce is now muddled through my emotions of longing. She blends into the scenes, and it broke my heart.<br /><br />I appreciated Hana's point of view, but often found myself wondering why it was in the book. I assume that Oliver wanted the reader to see the other side of the symbolic fence. Hana's life was perfect on paper, but on the inside it was anything but. But what I loved most about Hana was her determination. It was refreshing to see true rebellion, to do something dangerous and against society, to help someone she cared for. Hana definitely put herself into danger, another thing I didn't expect.<br /><br />Oliver brings a lot of death, decay, and demise in Requiem. Where Delirium was perfect and untouched, and Pandemonium was eye opening and honest, Requiem brings a darker side to the story. I expected teenage angst and romantic drama, but it was much more than that. The story talks about the harsh realities of the Wilds and not the previously thought impression that it was about living life in a freeing way.<br /><br />Oliver writes about the negative effects in this romanticized way that flows like poetry. She makes it easy to accept what is happening in Lena's world, all with a swift breeze. The direction that Requiem took was drastic, at least for me. I thought that the plot devices were a little predictable and the scenarios drastic.In the end, I was a little confused at the events that took place. I wanted more and felt cheated of an ending. It wasn't what I expected, given my feelings for the previous two books. The ending was bold enough, but left me without resolutions.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: HarperTeen provided me with a copy of Requiem.

0790729407|5.0|This is a classic, directed by Neil Jordan, starring Liam Neeson and an excellent supporting cast.<br />It was released in 1996. I think it's time for a blu-ray upgrade.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I could've enjoyed a return visit to Middle Earth for this prequel to the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;, but am totally cheesed about the wallet-driven decision to break the story into three parts.  I won't pin this on the DVD itself, which is okay as plastic discs go, but I think the studio has been smoking Old Toby.  (Hey, they went there, so why can't I?)  Indulging themselves with oh, potentially SEVEN extra hours to tell a story many of us know verbatim, they digress and extrapolate and amuse themselves to a degree that so removes them from the original tale that it is all but unrecognizable.  Martin Freeman would have made a fine Bilbo, if only they'd have given him a worthy script.  Hie thee to the library, instead.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I am 65 years old and I have watched this movie now 4 times. I am enchanted by the fact that the idea was planted by the author's daughter asking if the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus know each other.<br /><br />Life is better at any age and at all ages if you believe in stories of hope and goodness and if you pass that on to others.<br /><br />You can \\"believe in\\" nightmares but just not be afraid of them.<br /><br />This movie is so full of joy - I had to own it so I can watch it over and over again!
0345027507|4.0|Good light reading.  Considering when this book was written (a world with two billion people?) and what was envisioned of the future at the time, Arthur C. Clarke proves once again why he's one of the best authors in science fiction.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone in a flash. Very quick, page-turning, beach read that will have you on the edge of your chair all the way through.
B00BRR66SA|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I like Justin Timberlake, but this album is not that great. This album is too long and in some songs, he says the samething over and over, not letting the finish. Lucky for me, I like SOME songs including Suit & Tie, Tunnel Vision and Mirrors. JT said something about a 'second half' to The 20/20 Experience and I'm hoping that's better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It stores the information I have collected on the net allowing me unlimited options and topics and organizes it all in a simple yet effect way.  Best of all I can share with others AND discover what they have collected to share with me, saving me a great deal of time and effort.<br />It is an awesome resourse for anything I want to know.  It also gives me a sense of community, I feel I have a place to go to connect with like-minded people.  Thank you Pinterest!
0316228532|4.0|Rowling has a great eye for characters and social dynamics, but little can prepare a Potter fan for this dark tale of small town ambitions.  UK is different, but sadly, it is too much the same, as well.  It would be naive to say it's shocking, but this is NOT for young readers; it's probably fine for 14+, if they're interested.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Delta Machine is a strong, confident, mature album that is also harsh-sounding and sparse at times as well. The band were serious about exploring the blues. A few songs have genuine blues riffs, and the others have the stripped-down feel and religious/sexual imagery that are common in the blues. This often minimal, raw sound is causing lots of folks to call for Alan Wilder, who has not recorded with the band for 20 years. Wilder had a deft touch with production, and I love DM from that era, but I think some points are being missed.<br /><br />Gore (and now Gahan) writes the songs. According to interviews, Gore's demos are usually pretty detailed, and were for this album, too. Wilder was good with sounds and arrangement, but the band have said that on Music for the Masses, for example, they were basically just re-playing Gore's demos. With a notable exception being Enjoy the Silence, I think folks are putting too much weight on how Wilder affected the songs themselves. No question he brought more atmosphere. But there was always a co-producer, too.<br /><br />The last Recoil studio album was deeply rooted in...that's right, the blues! Wilder hooked up with an old-timer folk-blues singer. And the sounds and programs he was using, though still highly atmospheric, had not really changed since the early-'90s. Yeah, it sounded a bit dated, hate to say...<br /><br />Depeche Mode are just not in the phase where they use much sampling any more. Instead they are into modular / analog synths and guitar. And Gore just does not write the instrumental hooks he used to, for whatever reason. Precious is the closest he has come.<br /><br />Ben Hillier gets a lot of blame. But listen to his work with Blur, Doves, Elbow, etc... He does not automatically bring noise and stripped-down production. He tends to like choppy drum sounds, yes, but he has produced some very warm, atmospheric music. There is not that big a jump in sound from Ultra/Exciter to the last few albums. I think Gore and Gahan are more responsible for the album's overall sound and feel than the producer. They have spent years in studios and know how it works.<br /><br />Taking all this into account, Delta Machine gets stronger with each listen. It has moments of real beauty juxtaposed against the noise. It throbs more than any DM album has. Also, Soothe My Soul is the most flat-out Fun song DM have done since Personal Jesus. They are not trying to reinvent themselves, but they have made it clear they don't want to. At the same time, Heaven sounds like nothing else they've done.<br /><br />Depeche are just at a point in their career where it's hard to separate the current material from the context of the music a lot of their fans grew up on. Take that step, and Delta Machine is very good indeed.
0307346609|3.0|An evil undead rip-off of Studs Terkel.  The book is a series of short stories in an \\"interview with survivors\\" format which just falls flat.  The only chapter I found somewhat moving was on the role of dogs in the zombie war.  Max Brooks started out with solid, entirely made-up ideas (zombie virus originating in China, anti-zombie military strategy, worldwide anti-zombie campaign) but just doesn't have the witting skills to pull it off.  A few chapters, especially the two awful ones dealing with Japan, consist entirely of unimaginative, cynical, lame stereotypes and should have ended up in the dust bin.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is very fun, &amp; quite addictive! Its more then just match 3, tho that is the basic idea of the game. Besides matching you also put together a puzzle piece.  It gets more tricky with each level.  What with walls, frozen pieces, locked pieces, etc. Its a game you can play for just a few minutes, or hours! It has not asked, nor have I ever needed to pay for anything extra. Its really fun, &amp; once you start playing time slips away
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I guess you can still call it an album?! Thats what we called them back when Bon Jovi first came out anyway!  This one is just as good as all the others. I have been listening to it in the car with my four year old son who loves one particular song.  My personal favorite is Because We Can. I'd reccommend it to anyone who loves Bon Jovi.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|the director did a good job of shedding new light on what is blind love and what is evil as we perceive it.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|I have tried a few times to get into this album but it is unfortunately still a hodge-podge of uninspired, derivative, and not very good songs. Too bad, considering how interesting and pioneering their earlier work was.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Season Two was my favorite.  I spent a weekend watching it without stopping.  This is the best way to watch television.
0061438294|4.0|This is for anyone who wants tips on reading what people do subconsciously.  If you are content with going through life walking with your face buried in your iphone then this is not the book for you.<br /><br />I have learned so much from reading this book.  I now catch myself noticing body language without consciously trying.  The book goes into quite a bit of detail and stresses the weaknesses of using the techniques so you know what to expect before using them which I really appreciate.  I personally wish the book had more content.  I still loved the book, but found myself wanting to learn more that what was presented.  Still, it gets four stars for the great content and how easy it is to digest.
B0061S073A|5.0|I have only been using this app 1 day on both my kindle fire and galaxy phone. my kids were buying things without me knowing it. I tried to make a purchase while logged in through this app and it did not allow me. so grateful for this!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|You don't have to buy points or acorns. you can still progress in the game. It has cute mini games you can play.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is a great product and combination.  The headset is clear and works even in my convertible on the highway!  The case is PHENOMENAL!  The charge on the case will charge the headset about 4 times before you have to recharge the case again.  Lights on the case show you how much power is left.<br /><br />The case is great for protecting and story the headset.  Easy to put in your briefcase, backpack or just to throw in your car.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
B00BQUUH7E|2.0|Bought this game thought it would be fun Multi player for my four and seven year old.  There is no Multi player option when purchased on kindle fire, single player,options,and credits all that is offered.  Would have been a great game to play with the kids otherwise. Please fix this!
B00A83075M|5.0|Good entertainment for the entire family.  Our grandkids were focused on the movie.  Reilly is always good, even if only his voice
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|I thought the plot was interesting and the characters actually had some depth which was surprising.  I really can't think of anything bad to say about it.  My kids (6 & 7) saw it and I don't recall anything that required parental guidance and I am really strict about movies.  I would not really want to see it again so it gets 3 stars.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Amazingly engaging and  brilliantly written..his descriptions bring the story to life...you feel you are experiencing everything right in the lifeboat with Pi
B0083SBMBM|3.0|Most of us have either read the comics, or watched the cartoons.  This film was very slow and the plot captured from hundreds of other movies and cartoons.  It involves all the super heros doing their own things and the film shows the lessons that if we work together as a team we come out ahead of the game.  First part introduces the heros and their powers. Middle preaches all the bad things they do as individuals working with a group.  The last part is when they kick ass as heros.  If your are smart and already know the heros use the library and borrow it with out cost to watch the last part of the movie.<br /><br />Hey it could have been worse...one of the last of the Superman movies or Batman movies.
0307346617|5.0|After reading the book you might truly believe there had been a zombie world war.  I liked the approach that the author took of doing historical interviews.  The subtle political satire was well done.
B00BGD07KS|4.0|Mariah's single is great, of course, but the mp3 quality is only 256kbps, not 320kbps as I was expecting.  I don't know who is responsible for this downgrade, but I'm disappointed that there was no prior notification (as far as I can tell).<br /><br />I admit I don't have a golden ear, but on Amazon Cloud Player the mp3 sounds adequate.  We'll see...
B007MCTTHY|1.0|Could not use on the iPad so I was unhappy that I downloaded this app!  I will pay attention to the apps more in the future!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This is by far the best Bond movie so far, although I must say I think a younger Bond might be needed in a few years.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Fiction but not fantasy, this could really happen 30 years out.  This author knows a lot about the workings of NASA.  A great read!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I've read several books by Baldacci and have enjoyed every one of them. \\"Zero Day\\" is one of the better books of his with a great sense of pace and terrific character development. You just have to like John Puller. If you're looking for a great read and enjoy a good mystery then this is your book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is very addicting but it is awesome.I reccomend that people download this game.Get this game!!!!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Dark Shadows was fun, But it was a real dissapointment.Johnny Depps Role as Barnabas Collins was not one of his most memorable one's. The storyline must have been written by a teenager. Actually I think that the only people who would sincerely enjoy this film would be Teens. It really was just plain bad.  I think that there could have been more thought put into this movie. I am of the age when the orginal Dark Shadows was very popular and this by no means would ever be considered anything near the orginal. The comedy bits were ok, but hardly humorous. I would not want to see it again. I would not reccomend this movie to any of my friends. It left me feeling that i just wasted two hours of my time. Dont buy this DVD. It would be a waste of your Money .
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is ok I was just wanting the points you get for voting. I really don't vote often but for points I will.
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|Spoiler so don't read more if you don't want to know.  This one is definitely for anyone who likes gore.<br /><br />We love horror flicks, but this one had enough slow parts in it to actually put me to sleep.  Yes, I know this is a horror movie, but I am so tired of movies that are downers where the main characters die.  Hey, Hollywood!  Try taking some tips from Hitchcock.  It is possible to make a scary, suspenseful movie without the graphic images.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is a great deal, DVD, Blue Ray, and the digital copy to put it on your ipad or iphone. Great quality and ships fast.
B00947N6D8|5.0|This movie was a defining moment in entertaining with a message. I showed it during a birthday party and kids and adults liked it, afterwards we all discussed the way they gave meaning to each character so the kids could understand. Loved it, great for family.
B00009P1MP|5.0|Super quick delivery and product is as described. I will deal again. All I wanted was The Day The Music Died, but the whole album is great.
B000022TSY|5.0|movie arrived on time and as discribed. Now I get to watch it with my friends and family. Great Purchase
B009Z5975A|5.0|Tons of value versus a very low cost. I would recommend this product to all of my friends and family.
B0036T31YY|2.0|This one is a suspense movie with an interesting concept, but got very repetitive (which was the point) and boring to watch even though more was revealed in each repetition.  Blah.  I actually had to read the movie description again to remember what it was about if that tells you anything.  Snoozer.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|this is one car toy my baby loves alot. its a must have for all our trips. would totally recommend.
B004AKCME8|5.0|This is a good movie I watched it with my Grandsons, and they took it to school for  movie time, everyone loved it. great movie.
B00000FC5H|5.0|This CD take me back to when this first came out. I love Earth Wind and Fire. WOW! And SUPER!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|it works pretty well for the weather and all but the alarm I set for 6am didn't go off and I was late for school
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I wanted to give this five stars until the last chapter, which was just ludicrous.  It seems that no one can come up with a plausible  ending these days. Also, there was dialogue which seemed condescending and prejudicial, so I didn't feel right about going ahead with that.<br /><br />This was a charming little book, with some chilling scenes that will disgust most people, and rightfully so, concerning factual situations and practices that were abominable. The book was at times compelling, funny, poignant and bitterly brutal.  It brings forth an entire range of emotions.  The characters are diverse, believable (if a little stereotypical) and she captures the delightful lilting language of the people - of the North that is.  However, the fortune teller from the South is painted with a sour, perhaps superior brush.  This was the most stereotypical character of the lot, not to mention another cliche -  the high praise for non-Catholic - meaning Protestant - women, who were described as more industrious than their Catholic sisters.<br /><br />This was just aggravating, even if out of the mouth of a likable and Catholic character. Also, the actual historical nuns were demonized - and some of them deserved it, but there were also many institutions and orphanages at the time that were kind and charitable, and were responsible for the care and education of many unfortunates.<br /><br />The last few pages of the last chapter are just silly.  What a shame - there were no typos that I could see and no grammatical errors except those that were purposely used to set the scene and advance the story and make it seem authentic.<br /><br />I will look for other books from this author though because of the writing style, and the ability to tell a story;  the writer has talent, a bit raw, but certainly there.
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|If you are looking for something that at least compares to the first movie then I don't recommend this.  The lines are terrible and the plot predictable.  I couldn't stand to finish watching it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|First of all, everyone quit whining, because if you do something else with your life for a bit, you will get more energy. You do not have to buy it.<br /><br />Anyway, I love this game! I downloaded it to just play while I couldn't fall asleep and next thing I know, it's 2am. Definitely a great little picture find game.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Wasn't sure I would ever use on my phone because it is so much smaller than my actual Kindle.  I was really glad to have it when I went for an appointment that required waiting for a couple of hours, and I had left my Kindle at home.  It was worth having then!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book follows the others in that I can not stop reading, wanting to know what's next , can't wait toy read tyhe next book
0345522478|1.0|(Disclosure: My sense of humor is pretty shot.)<br /><br />So the main character is a druid, interacting with ye olde ancient gods. He is also a self-described sexy redhead with green eyes and great musculature. And tattoos that perfectly compliment his toned body. [Ominous burp here.] I don't think I'm taking such a wild guess when I say that I suspect the target audience is pagan women. I mean, that's not the only audience but that seems to be what the book was honed for. Within the first chapter the book is derogatory towards all gods not Gaelic* and makes a pretty chauvinistic stand towards women. And some unpleasant noise about dogs, just for good measure. I used to not be all that sensitive towards that stuff, but Laurel K. Hamilton cured me of my tolerance for pointlessly naked women a long time ago and after reading Cassandra Clare, I no longer have any patience for people that let their religious squabbles into their writing in any blatant way. (Jibs and jabs here and there are fine, but calling the penultimate god of a pantheon in an expletive-laden term crosses the line.)<br /><br />Before I even got to the fourth chapter it seems like this guy is dead set on alienating anyone that isn't a single, wiccan female witch with too many cats at home (And I'm pretty sure this book alienates all three of them that fit that stereotype.) I tried very hard to overlook this and continue with reading, but in the second chapter the author took to stabbing himself in his own foot when he made a supposedly all-powerful deity into a comedic moment. After putting his chosen gods on a pedestal, he immediately started tearing them down. [Second ominous burp.] The book, for me completely unraveled in chapter two. It's pretty obvious that the author Did Not Do the Research because* Gaelic gods are described as Celtic in the book, which is confusing because Celtic gods encompasses a much larger pantheon and also, he has a mythical medieval battle seemingly occurring after the entirety of the crusades, which were fought much later.<br /><br />Finally, the main character reminds me of a guy I worked for who thought that he was The Dude, but was in fact, was The Jerk. I couldn't help but get completely nauseated by the idea of spending anytime in a fantasy world where he got to be a hero. [Drooling away now.] The movie was playing, I could see everything and all I wanted to do was leave the mental theatre. So I did. This is a story and world I won't return to because it makes me feel like mentally throwing up.
B0011EU0NG|3.0|Musical numbers forgettable; child actors --  especially the boy -- pretty bad.  Car can't hold a candle to Herbie.  Few laughs.  Derivative.  Re-watch Mary Poppins instead.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This story really keeps you wanting more adventure and adventure it has. Author makes you feel as though you're one with the main characters. It's a fun and exciting &#34;read&#34; and its a love story too. Got a little of everything thrown in this story.

0670024813|2.0|Tedious, turgid, boring, repetitive, reiterative... If I can think of any other descriptions I'll be sure to add them once I finish trudging through this book. At age 75 Diamond is still an intellect to be reckoned with, but perhaps not to be respected for pooling his own life experiences (okay, other selected anthropological observations as well) into a jumble of poorly-fitting conclusions, many of which are unjustified. Devoting 8 (Kindle) pages to a 3-hour brush with danger when he was 21 in order to illustrate the eternal wisdom of \\"constructive paranoia\\"....? Some glaring errors, too, as when he describes the survival strategies of the Shoshones as if they were still primarily hunter-gatherers. I wish I could return my Kindle version.
B009L6UDUG|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Sean Connery Bond movies and like the Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig movies.  The rest are not up to the Bond standard.<br /><br />I had to have &#34;Tomorrow Never Dies&#34; because the opening is the best of all Bond movies.  The moment when Bond flies the jet through the cruise missile explosion is exhilarating!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game it keeps my mind clear and helps me to relax very fun game  played the first one also
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Sadly, the network shelved it before it had a chance to fully develop.  With the popularity lag that occurs in todays entertainment cycle, the networks aren't waiting long enough to determine what is being appreciated verses what isn't.  As a result many good shows are being cancelled before MOST people are even aware of them.  THIS show is golden.  So much so that the fans actually brought it back from the dead with a fan based temporary reboot:  The result of which is the film &#34;Serenity&#34;, which was as fantastic as the series.  This is well worth a space on your home library shelf as a &#34;keeper&#34;.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderful....couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend....Will have to read more by this author.  Good story and characters.  Simply wonderful book
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great game for people who like games for taking down foe after foe in waves. Add fairies, a wide variety of enemies, skills, wide variety of weapons and armor, and you got a big fat slayer cake with lizard man sprinkles and bloody whipped cream.<br />All I have to say now is great job Gameloft great job.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A very solid book.  A real look at what warriors go through.  He made a difference then, and we should all remember him now.
B009LT1YZ6|2.0|It's a bit hard to navigate... and after a bit it gets boring.<br />The game doesn't show any sign of new types of gameplay.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|Wasn't something I like to play just wanted to try it out I did and didn't like it oh well
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Haven't found a group I have liked in years. This is it<br />Fun is wonderful! Enjoying every minute of it!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Finally a show my boyfriend and I can agree on. We're officially hooked and can't wait to see how the show ends. The DVDs were in excellent condition, no scratches or problems of any kind.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|to much fun to put down,  a must of you like match three games and have a lot of time to waste playing games on your phone.
0142420891|5.0|Read the first book in a day and am extremely excited to get this one read! I recommend this series to any teen/young adult looking for a good read.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|If you get this game, you should play it with headphones. The music is great. The gameplay is a bit redundant, but I still find it fun.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|i really like this. i am able to seek ideas from this social news magazine. thanks alot. I had a friend who told me about this.
B008EKON56|5.0|I got this line out dock to use with my bluetooth and fm radio car adapters.  It works well with the addition of an in-line volume control for the bluetooth headphone adaptor.  It also allows you to charge and transfer data to/from your ipod (mine is a touch v4) via a mini usb cable instead of the ipod cable
B009VA1FN6|5.0|What a fantastic twist at the end I usually see them coming but not this one! I will be looking out for another Kate Morton book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|and it's not even close.  Keeps you guessing and glued to the screen throughout.  It just keeps getting better and better.  Cannot wait for next season.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone girl started great but ended terrible.  No spoilers sorry!  Very well written, graphic, and I couldn't put it down.  Gillian Flynn delivers the unexpected literally.  Too bad I hated the unexpected.
0525953728|5.0|It's comforting to read the truth about what went down while killing that monster.  You can never find that out with Washington D.C. telling the story.  Most of them are liars and deceptive while representing us in government.  We should send many of the Washington and media elite to Pakastin instead of real Americans and see how they do.  They probably would fit right in with the goverment of that counrty very well.  Many government officals are great at deception.  Trust me!!!!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|i really like this. i am able to follow the youtube and find all the songs and funny sites that i can. thanks
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is cool. The only problem is that there is no refund button if you buy a game you don't want. Other than that it is a cool game.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|wonderful book deep and meaningful so much better than the movie.<br />Glad I read the book first. I recommend the book to anyone who has seen the movie, if you loved the movie you will absolutely love this book.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock was just plain perfect.  This was a very entertaining movie.  Oh boy I hate having to add extra words.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing. It makes me feel as if I am taking care of my own horse and training it on my tablet.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|I have a ROKU 2 XS and ordered HD version and it wouldn't play. IT's the first HD video of many channels where I had an issue of playback. Disappointed in this from a Big Player like Amazon. I have ATT Uverse 12 mbps speed and enough head room to handle the load...I don't get it.
B0067R0APK|1.0|The old version was User friendly. Wish it was still an option.  If you have vision issues this is not a good app. The hourly graph is so tiny you need a magnifer to read it as it doesn't expand.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|But it wouldn't clear my Gigabyte mid-tower case (missed by abt .040&#34;). Also, the cantilever of such a large unit off the mobo without any supplementary support of the unit top made me quite nervous due to the potential of damage during any but the most gentle handling/moving of the computer. Performance reviews on the 'net seem mixed, likely due to poor control of thermal-paste application. I'll sit on this one 'til I have an appropriate application; I'm using its 100 mm &#34;little brother&#34;, running in push-pull, with my AMD A8 CPU, idling in the low-30's and maxing out in the high-50s. I suspect that this unit would do slightly better, but the mechanical hassles of case clearance and supplementary cooler support just aren't worth it to me.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I watched both parts of this rock-doc and thought it was great.  I think people forget that rock band members are human just like the rest of us, intra band personality conflcts and all.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I called Amazon and was forwarded to the kindle store and told them my cord plastic was coming off, they immediately replaced it at no charge what great service
0307596885|4.0|Alice Munro writes so well that I almost forget I am reading as I turn the pages and devour each one of her short stories.<br />I skipped the last part, which were described as short, less developed pieces, because I have very little patience as a reader, and a brief perusal persuaded me they should not have been included at all. Otherwise, highly recommended reading by this very talented Canadian writer.
