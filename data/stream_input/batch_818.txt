B000AYQJ3I|3.0|The biggest disappointment was the forgotten lyrics on \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" and \\"Something\\".  It's really embarrassing.<br /><br />Also disappointing was the picture quality.  There is lots of grain in the picture. The technology was lacking at the time, so this is probably as good as can be expected.  You could save a good bit of money buying this on VHS and not lose much in the way of picture quality, but you wouldn't get the extras on the second disk.<br /><br />There are also 3 rehearsal performances included, but they didn't bother to restore the film for those so you see lots of scratches on the film.  I would have also preferred to watch these at the beginning of the movie.  Instead you have to put in the second disk and select each of the 3 rehearsals individually.<br /><br />The camera work was annoying at times especially on \\"Something\\", where the camera keeps zooming in and out and the picture is out of focus.  Looks like someone let their kid use the camera for the first time.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />While My Guitar Gently Weeps - Really enjoyed the dueling guitars between George Harrison and Eric Clapton.<br /><br />Here Comes the Sun - Excellent acoustic version with George Harrison and Pete Ham.<br /><br />My Sweet Lord - This version is predominantly George Harrison's acoustic guitar and Eric Clapton's electric guitar.  You can really distinguish the guitars and the vocals as opposed to the album version.<br /><br />Backup vocalist and Horn section -  I thought they really added to the production value of the performances.<br /><br />Low Points:<br /><br />Indian Music -  I found it really boring and fast forwarded through most of it.<br /><br />Eric Clapton - He didn't perform any of his songs.<br /><br />Bad Finger - They didn't perform any of their songs.
B001CVCB9O|5.0|Calexico = California + Mexico in case you didn't know.  So, what is Calexico?  I'd call them a roots group, but the duo of Arizonans Joey Burns and John Convertino has been dubbed folk, pop, and country.  Their music has a feel of the West, an authentic blend of the Anglo and Hispanic music that formed it.      \\"Inspiracion\\" sung in Spanish is a heavy Latino beat with trumpets and drums.      \\"House of Valpraiso\\" makes me think of Dire Straits intense grooves with a Mexican trumpet backing.     Just listen to \\"Two Silver Trees.\\"  You'll see the imagery in the sound.  \\"Fractured Air\\" is another song that conjures up the green skies and sharp winds of a plains cyclone.      If you want 'different', Calexico is definitely a group you are going to want to hear.  I'd call them a blend of the best of both worlds and this CD is their finest so far.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The movie was worth the wait. I have been a fan since childhood and it's great to see Batman mature over the years on big screen with the exception of Batman & Robin. Just be prepared to sit for two hours. The joy of owning your own copy is the pause button. Get it! You won't regret it and the one bad review...he must have been on drugs! Don't hate ...appreciate!
B001E95ZNI|4.0|First, the guys look great.  Harris and Mortensen look the part and convey the confident lethality of the for-hire lawmen/gunmen they portray.  These actors can convey the authority that allows you to believe these tough and grizzled characters.  Second, the look of the film--wind-blown, dusty, quaintly authentic in its hard-scrabble town and ranch--is terrific.  Third, the violence when it comes is quick and explosive and underplayed in a more naturalistic, non-exploitive, fashion...giving it a semi-realistic consequence.  Lastly, the by-play between the two leads is relaxed and convincing.    The story thread is fairly simple, the outsider lawmen going against the powerful rancher.  Complications are introduced with the Renee Zellweger character upsetting the bond of the two partners, and some nice twists of plot are provided along the way.    A nifty Western with some decided differences, this is not an action movie, but a rather subtle examination of male friendship changed by the desire and need for the female, the need for and price of law and order, and the upholding and exploitation of community.  Ed Harris has done a nice job in delivering a Western that might be a bit too laid-back and laconic for some, but has very good acting and terse and salty dialogue and a terrific look to recommend it.

0385340540|3.0|Joel Backman, a Washington power broker with a dangerous secret, goes to jail to stay alive.  Unexpectedly pardoned by a discredited lame-duck President, he finds himself in Italy with a new identity and a new kind of prison, where he doesn't know who is watching him or why. As he uses his wits and his political skills to stay alive, his survival becomes entangled in the interagency rivalry of the FBI and the CIA, and draws the attention of  Chinese, Israeli and Saudi intelligence.  John Grisham still knows how to write a suspense story, complete with a high-speed chase and high-stakes international intrigue.  Unfortunately, as Backman studies Italian and learns the local customs, Grisham finds it necessary to describe everything from grandfathers to toilet paper in both languages and linger over the menus in trattorie and elegant restaurants. There are even lectures on the major tourist attractions of  Bologna.  That the Asinelli Tower was built in the 12th century and is 97.2 metres tall has nothing to do with who is following Backman or why.  If Grisham had omitted the difference between tortellini and tortelloni, this would be a better suspense story-and at least 50 pages shorter.
B0019OP0GU|4.0|This is a nice movie for a family to watch. Emma's character is well played as are the other two girls. However, Emma's character is another Hermonie in another time. She is bright clever and wholesome. A trend I hope she continues.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|To describe this album with letter grades, I'm not sure if I think it's  a B+/A- effort or if I give it four stars because it's a C album after three D-/F albums.    After losing any semblance of unique style and creativity following the black album, this album is a welcome sigh of relief.  I personally see it as a mix of Justice and the last three albums; the sound is like the last three albums but the music is better written and has been mastered in such a way that it sounds a lot like Justice.    One of the things you should be aware of with this album is that it is very loud.  Loud as in the volume at which the tracks were recorded and mastered.  While this means you don't have to crank your stereo as high, it also means that there's a lot of distortion and clipping.  One song in particular (The Day That Never Comes) is particularly bad.  It upset me the first few times I heard it, but I've since settled down and generally like it.  It's just a disappointment that the band chose to abandon the quality it used to demand from all of its releases.    The album's worthy of your hard earned money.  Listen to the tracks online and decide for yourself if you agree.  The sounds will almost bring you back to the good old days of Metallica.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|In summers that are now filled with super heroes vying for cinematic dollars, Iron Man climbs to the top of the mountain, with the human side of the story not being overwhelmed by high-tech gadgetry.<br /><br />With a neat twist to the comic book top gun, Robert Downey Jr. portrays industrialist Tony Stark, who creates the power armor that ultimately becomes the Iron Man power suit while being held captive by terrorists. Stark is assisted in the task by the ill-fated captive Dr. Yinsen (Shaun Toub). The plot then takes a roller-coaster ride of betrayal, redemption and avenging the death of his fellow captive, while building up to something called the \\"Avenger Initiative\\".<br /><br />This character may become a surprising franchise in the crowded marketplace of super heroes in the contemporary settings of war and politics. The 2-disc Blu-ray edition is an outstanding way to start on the adventure or to see it again....for the very first time.
B0013ND30W|5.0|Walt Disney released his greatest artistic masterpiece \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" in February of 1959. After spending 6 million dollars and 8 years in the making of this masterpiece, Sleeping Beauty managed to gross 5.3 million at the box office, certainly not enough for Disney to break even on his greatest artistic achievement in animation. Disney spared no expense on Sleeping Beauty, as he used Technicolor and Technirama 70. Technirama 70 was a special system of film running through the camera horizontally, exposing two 35mm frames simultaneously. This unusual film is then printed normally on standard 35mm film and shown with an anamorphic lens for the widescreen, extra dimension effect.<br /><br />Unlike Disney's earlier box office successful films of \\"Snow White\\" and \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" lacked the music and characters that younger children love. There are no fun songs like \\"Heigh Ho\\" or \\"Cinderelly\\" and no adorable little mice like Jacques and Gus. This movie is definitely for a little older audience that appreciates the greatest art ever created for a full length animated movie. To say it is Disney's artistic masterpiece is an understatement! I saw Sleeping Beauty when it premiered in the winter of 1959, and even though I was a small child, it was then and is still now my absolute favorite Disney movie of all time!<br /><br />This new blu-ray version of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" made me feel as though I was seeing it again in 1959! This is the widest version I have ever seen and when you add hi-def 1080p and the all new digital restoration to it, it's like seeing it for the first time ever! Everything is so colorful, super wide, sharper, brighter than you can imagine! You can see every crack in every brick and stone! I am keeping my fingers crossed, that they treat more of the other great old Disney films with this same blu-ray restoration, as it's like seeing the film like you've never seen it before!<br /><br />\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" may not be known for it's songs, like in \\"Snow White\\" or it's cute characters in \\"Cinderella\\", but it is known for the most fantastic hand drawn art that will never be surpassed by anyone ever again. Every scene is pure art in it's highest form due to the fantastic work of the best Disney artists of the time. This blu-ray dvd has a Bonus Feature disc that features many of the artists that contributed to this masterpiece. Seeing Eyvind Earle, who was given complete control of every artistic aspect of the film, along with other artists Marc Davis, Mary Blair, Ken Anderson and others is a real treat!<br /><br />This bonus disc also features the beautiful Mary Costa, whose looks and gorgeous voice made Princess Aurora come to life. We also get to see Bill Shirley, the voice of Prince Phillip, Eleanor Audley, the voice of Maleficent as well as the wicked stepmother in Cinderella (She is the best villainess voice of any in animation!) and of course the three good fairies Verna Felton the voice of Flora, Barbara Jo Allen the voice of Fauna and Barbara Luddy the voice of Merryweather. This is so great as Disney shows how the people whose voices played the characters look so much like the characters! Of course they show how the film looks like Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty music seems to have been written for this Disney masterpiece, instead of the other way around!<br /><br />More Bonus features include a Maleficent game, learning to waltz, an all new dragon encounter and a never before seen alternate opening. The best bonus feature for me is the Sleeping Beauty Castle Walkthrough. This is unbelievable, to be able to take a digitally re-created 3-D tour of Sleeping Beauty's Castle, just as it was in 1957 and 1958 (two years before the movie premiered)in Disneyland in California! What a treat! If you don't have a blu-ray player, now is the time to get one to enjoy the most breathtaking Disney masterpiece ever created! Sleeping Beauty is pure art in every way one can imagine from it's Tchaikovsky music to it'sfairy tale of how good always conquers evil, but mainly for the opulent, gorgeous art dominated by the talents of Eyvind Earle's scenery and Marc Davis' characters- it's a rare treat for the senses and one you don't want to miss!w good always conquers evil, but mainly for the opulent, gorgeous art dominated by the talents of Eyvind Earle's scenery and Marc Davis' characters- it's a rare treat for the senses and one you don't want to miss!
B00004S5RK|5.0|In a brilliant parody of the anti-hero, Michael Douglas portrays the faceless, pseudo-white collar employee - William \\"Bill\\" Foster/D-Fens - who finally reaches his limit in he boiling summer heat of a gridlocked Los Angeles freeway.<br /><br />With his adventures in revenge taking him the urban streets to suburbia, Douglas aptly juxtaposes the insanity of the soul and the bizarre fabric of society, no matter the setting. Robert Duvall perfectly plays Detective Martin Prendergast, who is ultimately on a collision course with trying to bring Foster's wave of terror to an end.<br /><br />It is a solid punch into the midsection of the morals, racism and sickening traps in the human rat race. Foster cries out for many when he exclaims, \\"I'm the bad guy? How did that happen?\\"
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Afterglow is exceptional. Sarah has a beautiful voice and is one of the very best Jazz vocalists. This album is very good and a great pleasure to listen to.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|I have been an enigma fan since 1992 - and I await every 4 years a new CD. And I buy all of Michael Cretu solo CDs. I have to say Enigma 5 and 6 were a little disappointing but this new CD is AMAZING!!! All songs are fantastic - but especially Encounters, Seven Lives,and Ja T'aime Till My Dying Day. I do miss the Gregorian Chants - this album maybe different but it is definitley as good as the first three Enigma CD. I wait with bait breathe for four more years for Enigma 8!!!!!
B001CLG6RC|3.0|Like an uneven Stephen King novel or Ridley Scott film, Michael Cretu has yet to make a five star recording. A recording that, when you are done listening, knocks you off your feet. Each Enigma cd has one magnificent song surrounded, more or less, by average and downright boring songs. \\"Seven Lives Many Faces\\", Enigma's seventh studio cd is no different.<br /><br />Michael Cretu incorporates a more urban feel to this new disc, and he has one truly ingenious moment on the second track \\"Seven Lives\\". That could be a hit. It's catchy and memorable and contemporary. Great song, and one I'd put on any Enigma compilation. The rest, well, is average at best. The other reasonably good songs are \\"Touchness, \\"The Same Parents\\", \\"La Puerta Del Cielo\\", \\"Je T'aime Till My Dying Day\\", \\"Deja Vu\\" and \\"The Language Of Sound\\". The rest is utterly forgettable album filler.<br /><br />At that's my point. Michael Cretu is talented at what he does, but he doesn't quite push the envelope far enough. Others in his field, like Mike Oldfield and Deep Forest have been more experimental--the very thing Michael Cretu avoids. Cretu mildly blends the latest musical trends into each Enigma cd, but it just isn't enough. I prefer Enigma to have female vocalists, but Cretu seems to have minimalized this.<br /><br />I want something fresh and original from Enigma. Surprise me, please, I'm dying here. What is the purpose in carrying on for another seven cds if you aren't going to do something different? Three stars for another average cd. Not terrible, not great, just ho-hum.
0060558121|3.0|Just finished American Gods, by Neil Gaiman.  I am a huge fan of Neil Gaiman having loved Stardust, Neverwhere, Anansi Boys, and Fragile Things.  I am not sure exactly what I expected with this novel, but I do know that I expected a bit more.  There were some very bright spots towards the end, including the unlikely and unexpected resolution to a mystery, that saved the book for me.  I had a difficult time warming up to many of the characters.  I certainly can't complain about the writing; however, as Gaiman is a true wordsmith in every sense of the word.  The character of Shadow was interesting but not as compelling as I would have liked for the main character.  This is a difficult book to class, but if you are into Science Fiction and fantasy, this is probably worth your while.
B00005JPO1|1.0|Are you an Indy fan? Then avoid this movie! I love the original 3 films, this last one was disgraceful! Raiders of the Lost Ark dealt with the Ark of the Covenant, heavily based in magic and myth. Temple of Doom (originally the weakest of the 1st 3 films) dealt with the Thuggee cult also based heavily in magic and Hindu myth. The Last Crusade dealt with the Holy Grail, you bet, heavily based in magic and myth. The Crystal Skull...aliens?!?! Come on! I admit, the film gave the series an ending, but Shia LaBeouf's character was hollow and totally unbelievable. Indy was named after the dog, so Shia's name is \\"Mutt\\". There were a number of scenes with Indy and Mutt that was reminiscent of Indy and his dad from \\"Crusade\\", but it wasn't enough to make it a good film. Once again George Lucas took his classic and ruined it (i.e. Episodes I,II and III)

0743289412|2.0|Stephen King is the master of characterization with contemporary American characters. I read his books for that, I don't buy the supernatural part, but enjoy them anyway. Not LISEY'S STORY. Lisey is a dud. Even though she is reliving her life with her dead husband, Scott, two years after he died, she displays no other interests in her entire life BUT Scott.  This is not normal or believable, and makes her irretrievably dull.  King skillfully peels back petal after petal of flashbacks about their lives together, naturally still vivid as she grieves. But other than having a family saturated with mental illness she must come to the rescue of regularly, she's not a fully rounded character.  And what is with the baby talk?  Smucking for Pete's sake. Along with other silly and annoying terms supposedly coined by Scott.  Everyone knows what she means by smucking, so King should have her use the \\"f\\" word or nothing--as most adults born after the 1950s often do, especially in books; and forget this dopey made-up language. Scott also has a family shot through with mental illness, maybe Scott, too, depending on whether you believe his little excursions into cookoo land, though that is supposed to be the supernatural part.  I gave up on the book maybe a quarter through and skimmed the ending. Disappointing from such a consummately skilled writer.

This book definitely lived up to the expectation of being a page turner.  Suzanne Collin's writing style is sharp, biting, vivid & illustrative. the premise is also interesting.  set in the future, food is a scarcity, the government uses a tactic to suppress rebellion:  the hunger games.  one boy and one girl (from ages 12-18) are chosen from each district to fight to the death.  the reward is life and also retribution and glory for their district.  i was hooked from the beginning and i can't wait for the next book!!
6304712936|4.0|This thoroughly enjoyable, pneumatic movie tells the story of Mozart's rise-and-fall on the music scene in 18th-century Austria. Told in flashback form from the point of view of musical rival Antonio Salieri, it covers with a broad hand the more salient points of Mozart's life, and dispenses with historical accuracy for a more expressive and emotionally communicative feel.    The acting's of a very high standard, with F. Murray Abraham giving a committed, layered and impressive performance as the jealous Salieri - not overshadowed by Tom Hulce's flashy, deceptively superficial turn as Mozart - which is a big deal, considering Hulce's performance is one of those show-stopping, scene-stealing turns that you don't really see anymore. If Abraham won the Oscar for this, then Hulce, for his part, is fantastic at portraying the decadence and the fevered genius behind the screenplay's reading of Mozart's character, but also gives the man impressive depth and pathos, when necessary. These two principal actors are more than amply supported by the excellent Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's plagued wife Constanze, Jeffrey Jones as Emperor Joseph II and a very young Simon Callow as Mozart's friend-and-colleague Emanuel Schikaneder. Also, a pre-pre-pre \\"Sex and the City\\" Cynthia Nixon does an excellent job in her tiny role as the Mozart family maid.    The behind-the-camera talents of director Milos Forman, art director Karel Cerny and cinematographer Miroslav Ondricek are the real stars of \\"Amadeus\\", though - the film's style is as operatic and fantastical as its treatment of Mozart's biography, and the tone and pacing of the sumptuous visuals lend a very palpable sense of doomed-genius-reaching-critical-mass to the film. There are no slow points, nothing is visually flat, and every detail and flourish imaginable has been crammed in - like the painted fantasies of Mozart's opera sets, \\"Amadeus\\", works beautifully as a baroque spectacle, and, 24 years after its original release, remains a testament to the creative genius of its crew. Mozart's operas are staged with a wisely underplayed sense of drama, furthering the viewer's connection with the more important driving forces behind their creation - the lives of those involved - and the visual feel of the movie is that of floating haphazardly through a chaotic swirl of decadence, art and high-octane drama.     I'm no big fan of classical music, and remain unconverted - but as an exercise in storytelling, \\"Amadeus\\" is a treat for any and all fans of solid, gripping films. It hits home runs on all the fronts it chooses to show you, and, while not an exhaustive or particularly accurate account, is a deeply engaging and thoroughly enjoyable piece of cinema. Highly recommended!
B000G8NXYG|5.0|You've watched films like The Lord of the Rings and The Matrix and you think they are some of the most brilliant, epic and artistic films you might have seen. But I have a question to ask you, have you seen Seven Samurai?    If you haven't, then you have yet to know the true meanings of EPIC or cinema ART. Do yourself a favor and watch this breath-taking film! The story is rather simple - a village becomes threatened by a swarm of Bandits and the farmers decide to hire Samurai to help defend their village as the Bandits begin their assault. But the depth of the film, is astonishing! What then becomes in the first hour, a great structure of story and character building, when finally the remaining hour is filled with breath-taking action sequences that you've never quite seen before in a movie. Not to mention the fantastic music. This is a movie I can watch over and over, because this is a great example of a REAL movie!    Hands-down one of the greatest films ever made. A true film about honor, bravery and sacrifice.
B00006IU73|3.0|3 1/2    I was always more a fan of the band's slower, spacious textures, as opposed to their equally indulged hard rock side. The former seems to be able to breathe and penetrate the listener while the latter just seemed to provide relative clunky, plodding contrast. Even so, PT sound committed to putting out \\"full\\" albums that feel like worthwhile investments for fans; even when songwriting becomes predictable, production breadth never misses sight of treating users to whole experiences.

0340766166|3.0|I really looked forward to reading this book for months, so I brought it with me on a trip to Japan and read it in the first ten days of my trip.<br /><br />As the other reviewers have pointed out, this work of fiction contains very detailed character descriptions.  Some of the details are superfluous (the excessive talk of men's 'lavish yangs', the Japanese women speaking of said men's yangs and pillow toys, silly conversations and daydreams, distracted mental wanderings of various characters, the repetition of the word \\"karma\\", etc.) and having just finished I wish I had stuck with the movie or found an abridged version of the book.  At points tedium drove me to speedreading.<br /><br />Aside from the few grammatical mistakes in the English narration (the use of compound verbs) there are some bizarre language conventions the author incorporates in the text.<br /><br />Spanish:<br />If it's intended to be Spanish (and not Portuguese), then \\"&iexcl;Qu&eacute; va! should be written as such, the rules of Spanish grammar being written in 1493, so not much should have changed since the time period of the narrative.  However, the vernacular of that time was different from the 20th century when the book was written, so terms like \\"Qu&eacute; va!\\" and \\"Leche\\" while used in Spain today, may not have been so common five centuries ago.  Moreover, sailor's have their own speech which is often quite different from the language of landlubbers.<br /><br />English:<br /><br />Grog is an incorrect term for what the sailors drank or wanted to drink in the book, as grog wasn't conceived of until the 1700s or perhaps even the mid 1600s.<br /><br />Ropes.  There are no \\"ropes\\" on boats.  Sailors use \\"lines\\".<br /><br />Bosun can be written, but since the author used terms like Captain (instead of \\"Cap'n\\") perhaps it would have been more uniform to use \\"Boatswain\\".<br /><br />Japanese:<br /><br />Seppuku means \\"cut stomach\\", so to refer to it as a woman's suicide act is absolutely incorrect since female samurai slit their throats (jigai) and men cut their stomach (seppuku).  \\"Jigai\\" is a preferable term for suicide for females in Japanese language instead of \\"seppuku\\".<br /><br />The term \\"pillowing\\" is not correct.  A translation such as \\"sharing the pillow\\" is more appropriate.  There are also some odd spelling conventions (Yedo instead of Edo, Kwampaku instead of Kampaku, Kwanto instead of Kanto).  My wife and mother-in-law had a hard time figuring out some of the other Japanese translations.<br /><br />The terms samurai and ninja are used frequently in the novel.  Why is ninja always italicized but not samurai?  It's odd.<br /><br />Another historical inconsistency: The village \\"Yokohama\\" was called \\"Yokohama Mura\\" up until the end of the Edo period (the 1800s).<br /><br />The author uses Japanese, but as my wife and mother-in-law point out, the Japanese in the book is not appropriate for the time period.  It would be better to just use English rather than to mislead readers into thinking they're using some correct historical Japanese.  For example, try reading Shakespeare: it is still English, but the morphology and lexicon is different than modern English; languages change over time.<br /><br />Italian: Little used in the text, but what's there looks fine.<br /><br />Latin: The \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\" bit is very sappy and wearing in Sh&oacute;gun.  The subject pronoun \\"Tu\\" (translated \\"thou\\" or \\"you\\") was not, and still is not, commonly used in Latin, just as \\"kimi\\" and \\"anata\\" or any subject pronouns are NOT used in everyday Japanese speech.  \\"Te\\" (\\"thee\\") may have been used more commonly in informal speech in the 1600s, as is even used informally today in various Italian dialects descended from Latin.<br /><br />It would have been rare (and even insulting) for a woman to learn Latin as the Lady Mariko did.  Latin was a language for educated men, but since Mariko was special, and it is fiction we can give the author a pass here....<br /><br />Ultimately, this is the sort of soap opera fiction with a thousand convenient coincidences (like in Harry Potter stories, the Kite Runner, Tom Clancy [who presents plenty of research in his novels], Ayn Rand [whom Clavell greatly admired], and so on) that I enjoyed as a teen but now would just prefer to get over with in a two or three hour movie.  It was really disingenuous all the writing about how disgusting the women found the Anjin-san.  As soon as I started reading that it was just a matter of counting pages until you knew the women would end up in bed with him. Then there were the penitential periods and well-timed earthquakes.  In one soundbyte: Ugh.<br /><br />If I'm going to \\"suspend belief\\" for fiction, I prefer like the action to be on the big screen for a movie like Star Wars or LOTR.  This book is VERY highly fictionalized, but there are still some interesting and accurate cultural tidbits in the book that make it worth reading (the women keeping a hesokuri and maintaining responsibility for household finances, the Japanese not necessarily being inhibited by nudity, the importance of cleanliness in Japan, Shinto in Japan, etc.).  Sadly, many readers will not be able to distinguish between stereotypes, the author's impression of Japan based on his experiences as a POW, and the realities of Japanese culture (both past and present).  The author's experience as a POW during WWII no-doubt gave him some interesting impressions of Japanese culture which are clearly reflected in the text, though this does not pass for accurate historical research.  I'm curious who edited his book and how/why certain inaccuracies were left in place.<br /><br />There is no plethora of likable characters in the book, which would be OK if the characters showed some growth in the end.  Toranaga, the anjin-san and most of the samurai are petulant creeps.  Toranaga uses people as some sort of wannabe Machiavellian prince.  The big difference between Toranaga and Machiavelli is that the latter always acted for the benefit of the people, seeking to unify the Italian peninsula for the benefit of all; Toranaga is petty, self-serving, and neurotic.  At the end of the novel Toranaga says he'll never admit to having a friend... and then calls the anjin his friend.  Whaaaaat?  At that point, Clavell sums up a few future events and mercifully ends the story.  Perhaps Clavell was just fatigued after writing 1100+ pages and missed the contradiction?

Enjoy the book!nts plenty of research in his novels], Ayn Rand [whom Clavell greatly admired], and so on) that I enjoyed as a teen but now would just prefer to get over with in a two or three hour movie.  It was really disingenuous all the writing about how disgusting the women found the Anjin-san.  As soon as I started reading that it was just a matter of counting pages until you knew the women would end up in bed with him. Then there were the penitential periods and well-timed earthquakes.  In one soundbyte: Ugh.      If I'm going to \\"suspend belief\\" for fiction, I prefer like the action to be on the big screen for a movie like Star Wars or LOTR.   This book is VERY highly fictionalized, but there are still some interesting and accurate cultural tidbits in the book that make it worth reading (the women keeping a hesokuri and maintaining responsibility for household finances, the Japanese not necessarily being inhibited by nudity, the importance of cleanliness in Japan, Shinto in Japan, etc.).  Sadly, many readers will not be able to distinguish between stereotypes, the author's impression of Japan based on his experiences as a POW, and the realities of Japanese culture (both past and present).  The author's experience as a POW during WWII no-doubt gave him some interesting impressions of Japanese culture which are clearly reflected in the text, though this does not pass for accurate historical research.  I'm curious who edited his book and how/why certain inaccuracies were left in place.    There is no plethora of likable characters in the book, which would be OK if the characters showed some growth in the end.  Toranaga, the anjin-san and most of the samurai are petulant creeps.  Toranaga uses people as some sort of wannabe Machiavellian prince.  The big difference between Toranaga and Machiavelli is that the latter always acted for the benefit of the people, seeking to unify the Italian peninsula for the benefit of all; Toranaga is petty, self-serving, and neurotic.  At the end of the novel Toranaga says he'll never admit to having a friend... and then calls the anjin his friend.  Whaaaaat?   At that point, Clavell sums up a few future events and mercifully ends the story.  Perhaps Clavell was just fatigued after writing 1100+ pages and missed the contradiction?  In any case, Toranaga regresses, Blackthorne submits to his situation and Alvito also ends up in submission not just to the Church, but also to Toranaga.

B00008MJ8H|2.0|This movie was totally different from what we expected.  Much explicit violence and sex. Parents be ware.  I did enjoy the historic nature of the movie.  The cars and advertising, politics of the time.
B001DMJ9R4|3.0|I will admit I enjoyed the live show, they all sounded good and I found it interesting how they would trade off singing between the parts where lyrical switch overs were too close to cleanly transition. But the additional new songs they had on the CD... I wasn't impressed with any of them really, Until the end was semi-enjoyable but none of the rest really stood out. It just seems like those songs were probably left over choices from their recent self titled album that for whatever reason didn't make the cut. I hope whenever their next full-length album comes out that it does the band better justice.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'll be honest: I've always moderately liked The Beatles, but never really got into them.  Hearing this album changed that.  I can now call myself a Beatles fan.  First of all, the way the songs are mixed together into a musical collage of sorts creates a fresh approach to these classics that easily hooks you.  Second, the clarity of the original remastered recordings is astounding.  I've never heard any Beatles song (or any other song from the 60s, for that matter) sound so clear.  The album almost sounds like it could have been recorded recently.  Both of these have made Love such an amazing compilation that by \\"Eleanor Rigby / Julia\\", I knew this album would quickly become one of my favorites.    Simply put, Love will take you for a ride, whether you are already a Beatles fan or not.  I can't recommend this album strongly enough.
0143038583|5.0|Probably the most important book about the state of food in this country, and maybe the world.  Michael Pollan's calm voice is the call to tune in, wake up and choose the food you consume rather than give in to corporate and government default as we have been conditioned to do for the last 5 decades.  We don't have many ways to \\"vote\\" these days except with our money.  Buy and eat locally.  Its a more important choice than we know.  Thanks, Mr. Pollan for your informative look at how we can regain our food autonomy.
0143038583|5.0|[[ASIN:0978721322 Healing the Rift: Merging Science and Spirituality]]<br /><br />As a scientist and biotechnology executive I was intimately involved in the food industry for over a decade and visited agricultural sites in over a dozen countries on four continents. I applaud Pollan's expose' of  of modern agriculture's cost.<br /><br />Michael Pollan exposes the high price we pay for industrialization of food production. The fact that the majority of deaths are caused by the Western diet and many of the major diseases are a result of how and what we eat is incalculable in economic terms. The damage to the environment from industrialized farming is staggering. The sacrifice to food quality and nutritional benefits are explained by Pollan.<br /><br />A must read!

B00127RAJY|5.0|My normal exercise routine consists of a Mon., Wed., Fri. run of 3-4 miles and a Tues., Thurs. video toning workout.  I was pessimistic of this particular video due to its short 20 min. length.  I didn't think I would get anything out of it.  Boy was I wrong!  There are three 20 minute workout options (all challenging), and each workout consists of three, INTENSE strength, cardio, and ab circuits.  I wanted to cry by the end!!!  It is a great, quick workout that you can feel like you've accomplished a lot.  I was dripping with sweat when I was done.
B001CC7PPI|5.0|Restorers' Error    What the restorers of Rear Window don't know is that there exist two dream sequences in the first part of the movie.    The first takes place after Grace Kelly leaves, and James Stewart has heard the scream from across the courtyard. Thelma Ritter, Grace Kelly, and the courtyard are shown while dialogue from Thelma Ritter's argument with Stewart about Lisa, and Lisa's argument with Stewart, are heard with an echo. The composer's new song is heard.    The second takes place after Stewart has waked up and noticed the salesman taking a suitcase out during the rain, coming back, and taking the suitcase out again. The composer's song is heard over the image which shows the salesman arguing with his wife, the artist neighbor telling the salesman he is giving the plants too much water, Thelma Ritter saying \\"I've got a nose for trouble, I can smell it ten miles away.\\" Then Ritter says, \\"I can smell trouble right in this apartment. First you break your leg, then you start looking out the window, seeing things you shouldn't see,\\" while we see the wife catching the salesman in the other room talking to his girlfriend on the phone, then Ritter saying \\"We've become a race of Peeping Toms, what we ought to do is get outside ourselves and look in once in a while. The New York sentence for a Peeping Tom is six months in the workhouse. There are no windows in the workhouse. You know, in the old days they used to put people's eyes out with a red-hot poker. Any of those worth a red-hot poker?\\" as we see the salesman carrying the suitcase out into the rain.    When Stewart wakes up the apartment complex is dark, the shades are drawn. He sees Miss Torso come home from her evening out. Then he sits up as he sees the salesman coming back for a second time with the suitcase.    Each sequence is introduced by a rippling of the image of Stewart's sleeping face, and his face is superimposed over the dream images.    These dream sequences articulate the major themes of themovie: the dubious morality of voyeurism, Stewart's sexual ambivalence about Grace Kelly and his interest in other women, the salesman's conflict with his wife, Thelma Ritter's attempts to persuade Stewart to come back to a normal way of living. The salesman's problems with his wife are an analog to Stewart's problems with Grace Kelly. The core of voyeurism is sexuality, and this is shown over and over again in the movie. The motive for the salesman's murder of his wife is another woman. Miss Lonelyhearts' attempted suicide is because of her failed relationships with men. Miss Torso is fighting off suitors and trying to save herself for her husband, who, in a comic moment at the end of the movie, returns from military service more interested in food than in his sensual wife. The newlyweds keep their shades drawn because they are making love.    The restorers should have researched the film more carefully. Neither restored transfer includes these dream sequences as \\"deleted scenes.\\"

0316143472|4.0|\\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\" is David Sedaris' fifth full-length collection of humorous essays.  I've long been a fan of his writing, which for the uninitiated tends to focus on the more skewed aspects of his family and life.  His collections usually include a variety of stories from various epochs of his life - as a child and teenager with his hilarious family, in his twenties (when he did drugs and had a variety of bizarre jobs), and with his boyfriend, Hugh, in Europe.<br /><br />Most of my favorite stories involve his family, especially stories from his youth.  He adds one such gem here - \\"The Understudy,\\" which features one of the worst babysitters in history, the corpulent and itchy, Mrs. Peacock.  This story has more laugh-out-loud moments than anything I've read since....well since Sedaris' last book.  I tend to enjoy less his essays about his years when he was an active drug user, although \\"All the Beauty You Will Ever Need\\" is one of the better of this genre.<br /><br />Alas, this collection is a bit thin on stories about his family; perhaps as he gets older he will focus more on recent events filtered through his observational humor style; \\"Crybaby\\" is a good example from this collection.  The longest section of the book details his attempt to stop smoking in Tokyo, which is not the strongest ending to this otherwise solid collection.  Overall, \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\" is average work for Sedaris; not as good \\"Naked\\" but still likely to keep his fans entertained and better than most humor essayists.
0618918248|2.0|Dawkins is at his best when using the tools that he has mastered over his lifetime of academia: biology and bio-chemistry, evolutionary biology. Anyone who has read his \\"The Ancestor's Tale\\" can have little doubt about this.     However, as an Atheist myself, I find myself unconvinced by his forays into religious talk. Sure he can destroy arguments against Creationism/Intelligent Design, this is where he shines.     However, he brings nothing new to the table of discourse, no new arguments for the Athiestic position are raised, no new ways of thinking about the problem(s) are presented - 1 star. I will add another simply because Dawkins can write, and write rather well, in my own opinion. Thus 2 stars.     I do think that Dawkins does a serious disservice to Atheists and Atheism in that he advocates it as a \\"belief that god does not exist\\"... [this taken right from the little flash video right here on the book's site at Amazon]. Immediately, my thinking antennae starts to twitch. Why haven't men such as Dawkins and Hitchins addressed this fundamental point? I can only assume that they haven't thought the notion of a 'belief that god(s) do not exist' all the way through. With Dawkins advocating such a 'belief' it does nothing in addressing the true nature of Atheism, precisely 'no god-belief' or to put it more directly, to lack god knowledge. In this we Atheists are not alone as no person on earth has any god knowledge or knowledge of god - they may say they do but in the court of reason and thought, god knowledge evaporates (scriptural authority and personal experience lack the qualifications of reasoned knowledge, but as a review it would take a bundle of lines to detail. Besides, it is not the rationale behind this review) - Atheists are the most vocal group who admit to such lack of god knowledge and proclaim it as part of their system of conclusions that there is no good reason to have a belief in god; there may be 'reasons' (not to be confused with rational thought, thinking, agnosticism) to believe in god(s) but there are no 'good reasons' to believe in god and perhaps 'good reasons' NOT to believe in god.    I do sincerely hope that Dawkins and the like of conversion-minded Atheists who have sprung up recently, at some point, address this inconsistancy in their mis-represented (misunderstood?) definition and thus outlook of Atheism but I suspect that until someone can show them the flaw in their statements that directly pertain to a 'belief that there is no god(s)', this will only add to the inflammatory subject of Atheism vs. Theism(s). It has been rightly pointed out many times that a belief that something doesn't exist takes almost as much or just as much time, energy,and thought as a belief that something does exist. To lack belief removes the Atheist from the equation of 'belief' all together and can properly set the debate on its thoughtful course: the rational from the non-rational to the irrational, to the true from the false to the neither true nor false, to the reasoned and unreasoned, to the claims of religion and religious 'belief' and their truthfulness and falsity/falsifiability.    I'm sure that my comments will be unconvincing to many and may even appear as symmantical, but having thought through the problem, nature, language and its offhanded and mis-use in language (i.e. \\"I 'believe' that it will be sunny tomorrow') of 'belief', I hope that Atheists can move to a more complete Atheistic understanding and perhaps move the argument into the necessary arena of persuasion and convincing debate that so far has not taken hold because the ideas espoused by the likes of Dawkins are rarely persuasive to the believer. Once we can move effectively into that necessary human and psychological domain of persuasion through right/correct argument then we might see some practically understood applications of how we can use and constrain religion instead of being used and constrained by religion (i.e. the entire political process and views drip with religious bias and need to be thought out in the absence of religion, as should science).
B001BNFR6W|5.0|To have the entire series of Will and Grace in one perfectly put together boxed set is awesome.  The packaging of this box set is great.

0060555661|5.0|Graham's approach is aimed at minimizing the odds of irreversible losses and maximizing the chances of sustainable gains.  (Many dot-com and telecom stocks lost 95% of their value by the end of 2002, requiring a 1,900% gain to get it back.  That illustrates why Graham constantly emphasizes the importance of avoiding losses.)  Unfortunately, Graham died over 30 years ago, and thus his material and examples are dated; the good news is that Jason Zweig provides an update for each chapter.<br /><br />Familiarity with a stock (eg. one's own employer) breeds complacency that should not be allowed.  The importance of diversification is illustrated by the fact that the average net worth of a 1982 Forbes 400 member was $230 million - staying on the list until 2002 required only 4.5%/year growth (less than bank accounts), but only 16% made it.<br /><br />Large funds, with large amounts to invest, frequently end up owning the same large stocks (only a limited # can handle the volume), thus creating an overvalue situation.<br /><br />Portfolios should be viewed over a 10-30 year investment horizon.  The most lucrative sector of any given year often turns out to be among the worst performers of the following year.  Buffett and graham both praise low-fee (.75% for taxable and municipal bond funds, 1.25% for small stocks, 1.5% for foreign stocks, and 1.0% for the rest) index funds a best for individual investors.<br /><br />Graham believes five elements are key to determining P:E ratios:  1)Long-term prospects.  (Watch out for serial acquirers\\" - an average of over 2-3 acquisitions/year suggests limited faith in its own opportunities.  Also those relying on a small # of customers.)  2)Pluses include a strong brand identity (eg. Harley-Davidson), economies of scale, resistance to substitution (eg. electricity).  3)Consider the potential flood of newly exercised shares via options.  4)Rapid growth companies are vulnerable to eventual decline in their growth rates.<br /><br />Accounting abuses include pro forma reports (had not . . .), book revenues early, capitalizing expenses, overly optimistic pension-fund investment returns.<br /><br />Steer clear of companies with capitalization less than $2 billion, current assets &lt; 2Xcurrent liabilities, lacking earnings for at least 10 years, failing to increase EPS at least 1/3 over the last ten years, P/E greater than 15.d not . . .), book revenues early, capitalizing expenses, overly optimistic pension-fund investment returns.

B0013527I4|5.0|One question though: I noticed that one or two of the skits are repeated in two of the episodes (on Disc 1 anyway) Rowlf and Fozzie singing \\"An Actor's Life for Me\\" and the Chickens playing the chimes.  Maybe one of the episodes was a UK release?
0375826726|2.0|I read the author's notes at the back of the book before I started and that's where I learned that this book would have been much longer had not an editor worked with Paolini to trim it down.    Time to fire that editor and hire one who will actually do the job.    Paolini's writing and the attendant lack of a competent editor remind me of what happened with Tom Clancy's books:  A halfway decent story gets buried in all sorts of bad writing.  If it's not the minutiae of how a sword is made (reminded me of one of Clancy's little side-trips in how to make a submarine quiet), it's the endless repetition of information that has already been introduced and death-by-hackneyed-phrases.  Really, a simple search and delete of the overused phrase \\"waking dream\\" and oft-repeated references to the trial of long blades will likely reduce this book by about 50 pages.  Then cut out the gratuitous meandering into useless subplots (such as the cult execution scene at the beginning, dwarf politics, Roran's integration into the Varden warriers, three paragraphs of description every time Saphira needs to poke her head into something small) and Paolini could have hit the salient plot points *and* finished this epic all within 350 pages.    It's a ponderously long and winded tale that doesn't add significantly to what was already known, and then snatches away the payoff by needing another 700-page tome to finish the tale.  None of this would be as bothersome if the writing were actually good.    When I first read Eragon and criticized it for these same failings, my friends said, \\"He's a young author and this is a great achievement for someone in his teens.\\"  OK, I'll buy that.  But it's been six years since Eragon was published. One would think the boy wonder had actually learned better writing and story telling skills in the intervening years.  If nothing else, some one at Knopf should have assigned a competent editor to rein in the ceaseless blather.
B0000630YA|5.0|Alice Cooper is arguably the most underrated and influential frontman in rock history.  He's a household name and everybody knows at least one of his songs, but how often does he get his due, really?  He has been destroying stages and releasing classic album after classic album since the late 60's, has heavily influenced every era of hard rock, single-handedly invented rock music as horror theater, rocks on to this day, and has one of the most unique voices ever to grace a microphone and yet he remains uninducted into the fraudulently-named \\"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\".  But Madonna gets in no problem.  WTF, much?  Folks like [[ASIN:B0002ZMJ70 Marilyn Manson]], [[ASIN:B0000AVBDS Rob Zombie]], [[ASIN:B00006GFAB KISS]], and even [[ASIN:B000084U3P Ozzy Osbourne]] owe him their very careers.  He opened the door and married horror themes, theatrics, and rock music while taking the brunt of the conservative media backlash; everybody else just walked on through and built on the foundation Cooper laid for them all nice and neat.  Well, this Halloween season I'm giving Alice's best album the love it deserves.  \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\": tag, you're it!<br /><br />After a string of staggering classic rock albums with the legendary line-up of the [[ASIN:B000056W0F Alice Cooper band]], visionary frontman Vincent Furnier took on the name himself and hired his own ego-free backup band to truly explore the merger of his two passions: horror and music.  The result is a masterpiece that can never be duplicated.  It's original, hard-rocking, grooving, psychedelic, ambitious, and just plain brilliant.  The variety and theatricality of the music itself is something that never would have been done in the Alice Cooper band with their focus on classic rock stylings and individual instrumental prowess; but stripped of the band's democratic process, Cooper was free to explore as freely as he chose.  And he chose well. I love this album so much that I'm going to take you through it track by wonderful track.<br /><br />Right away, the listener is greeted with a creepy and evocative psychedelic jazz number that is unlike anything else I've ever heard.  \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" is Cooper's statement that the asylum doors have opened and he's about to take you on a trip into his world.  \\"Devil's Food\\" is a unique and memorable little tune (\\"I knew your precious life/ and I know your death\\") that primarily serves as an intro to \\"The Black Widow\\".  At this point we are greeted with a catastrophically awesome performance by my favorite horror icon, [[ASIN:B000SK5ZFM Vincent Price]], who plays a madman leading a tour through a spider exhibit. \\"If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy, I feel that man has ruled this world as a stumbling demented child-king long enough!\\", he rants, espousing the virtues of the treacherous spider as a fitting successor.  That man was a true genius.  \\"The Black Widow\\" is a rocking number that envisions a world where the evolved arachnid has brainwashed and enslaved humanity.  \\"Some Folks\\" is another left turn for Alice Cooper and resembles some sort of old Broadway show or revue.  In fact, Cooper used to bring out a parade of dancing creatures -including a line of synchronized kicking skeletons- onstage during performances of this number.  One of my favorites.  \\"Only Women Bleed\\" is probably the best known song on this album and is far from the macho chest-thumping anthem the title would lead you to believe.  It is a tender ballad about an abused woman trying to share her feelings with her callous husband. Classic.<br /><br />Alice Cooper has always been among the most underrated and flexible songwriters in rock music and this album displays that fact on nearly every track.  His ability to change gears from the horrific to childish humor or genuine emotional vulnerability and back again from song to song is on full display.  \\"Department of Youth\\" is Cooper showcasing the kid in him, leading a child chorus rebellion against the old order.  It's a goofy song, but catchy as can be.  \\"Cold Ethyl\\", however, is the funniest song on the album; a [[ASIN:B0015TZKPA Nekromantik]] tale of a girlfriend on ice filled with killer guitar work and darkly humorous lyrics.  Try not to laugh when Alice exclaims \\"Cold Ethyl, I'm stuck on you!\\"  Next comes the album's magnum-opus: the three-song horror opera consisting of \\"Years Ago\\", \\"Steven\\", and \\"The Awakening\\".  The story is a first-person exploration of a child killer's dual-personality and his descent into madness as the two sides fight over a young child's life.  It is the most chilling thing I've ever heard and is as bold, black, and evocative as music gets.  Some of the music brings to mind horror classics like [[ASIN:B000RIWAVW Halloween]] and [[ASIN:B0000524CY The Exorcist]] and also features what sounds like creepy carousel music.  This show-stopping display should have ended the album, but Cooper decided to let us off on a high note so \\"Escape\\" follows.  It's a light-hearted rocker with a catchy riff and lyrics about music, horror, and performance as a way to deal with the true horrors of the world at large.  Escapism, in other words.  I can truly relate.  It's a great song, but it seems out of place after the devastating intensity of the story in front of it.  But then again, Cooper is a light-hearted guy who wouldn't want to leave us in a depression, so I understand his intent.<br /><br />\\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" is my favorite horror/rock album and I am sure you'll love it.

I'm glad he did because I went straight to the record store the next day and copped it.  Haven't regretted it since. The improvisations, which Miles really dug from his musicians, was really hittin' on all cylinders. Some jazz fans may view this recording as rather bizarre, but this was around the time when Miles was kind of going in a different direction with his music. I would recommend this title for all jazz lovers.

They edited this some, which includes the cursing was gone and replaced those words with other cleaner versions of it.<br />You can probably buy this version as well but I'm not sure how one could compare them.
B000002LSV|1.0|ZZ Top you hate em or you love em. I dont hate these guys but i just honestly dont like really any of the songs on this album except three, Sharp Dressed Man, LA Garange, and Tush. Every other song on here i really hate ecsepcially, \\"Planet Of Woman\\", or \\"Legs\\". ZZ Top all they do is sing about hot women and getting some. Thats there whole basis for there band thats it every song thats what they sing about. Arrggg whats next Journey, \\"Be Good To Yourself\\", come on people pick up Dark Side Of The Moon instead of this shameless music
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This original BBC UK version narrated by David Attenborough includes footage that was edited out in the US version that was narrated by Sigourney Weaver that aired on Discovery.  This is a definite must have for any Bluray collection.  The cinematography is mindblowing.  Definitely gives you an appreciation for the beauty of this planet & the things living in it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles 1 is a one CD collection spanning The Beatles entire carerr on 27 tracks, all the songs on here were singles and all went too number one at one time. A pretty good collection good for anyone starting out on the beatles but i dont think it covers all the good beatles songs. For instance there is no songs from Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club band it is missing a lot of songs but still its pretty good
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and being a computer generated movie, it was even better watching it on Bluray.  The picture quality is awesome, you can almost feel the texture of the perfectly rendered surfaces & objects in the movie.  The character artists & voice actors have captured the personalities of each character so perfectly in this movie.  The story is very entertaining & not overly geared towards children so adults will enjoy this movie too.  Any fan of animated movies will definitely want this in their collection.  Get it on Bluray, it's definitely worth it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|They should have shipped all PS3 with these from the start. Controller is noticeably heavier than the Six Axis, but it still feels good.
B000RZGIQ8|3.0|One of my alltime favorite movies, I was hoping it would be worth having on Bluray, but as in most cases with films not just made there really is no big difference between the DVD & Bluray versions (at least, not so far as what I've come across).    The movie's a definite must have for any collection, but get it on DVD if you can find it cheaper.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|The girls are back and achieve an amazing task.  Bringing a televison show to the big screen rarely works well and here it far surpasses all expectation.  Scenery - amazing, clothes - amazing, dialogue - amazing.  The plot is inventive and fully worthy of full screen treatment.  All the girls shine and have their moments.  Whoever is your favorite, you will be happy with the results.  We also have the addition of Jennifer Hudson here and a great addition she is.  She fits in admirably and shows her full versatility beyond DREAMGIRLS.<br /><br />The movie will make you laugh and cry.  It is big and extravagant - exactly what you would expect.  Sometimes it does seem like an extended episode of the show but that is a good thing.  It just shows how much it is staying true to itself.<br /><br />They say another one could be in the making and I cannot wait.  Grab a drink, your friends and have a GREAT time !!!
B0013ND30M|4.0|For a fifty year old animated movie, Sleeping Beauty holds up exceptionally well for the modern viewer.  While a bit light on story (evil queen threatens new born princess with curse of death, fairies cause the curse to be limited to slumber, fairies raise princess as a peasant to protect her from curse, curse strikes, etc), Sleeping Beauty tells that story quite well without relying too heavily on over-the-top musical numbers.  Visually, Sleeping Beauty is one of the stronger works of from Disney with a striking Maleficent, contrasts between light and darkness, and one incredibly creepy castle for the evil queen.  Outside of the fairies, the good side is a bit boring, but the three fairies carry the story and breath life into Sleeping Beauty.  Of course, the movie relies on a bit of stupidity on the part of the fairies to actually have a story, but beyond that, the movie works.  This one truly is a classic.<br /><br />This is the two disc \\"Platinum Edition\\", however, and there is an abundance of special features.  This set has a commentary track and a trivia track that are each, unfortunately, buried in the bonus features menu on Disc 1.  Rather than having those two features which are designed to play along with the feature be on the main menu, they are each tucked away and easily missed.  The only other features on disc one are a music video from Emily Osment singing the signature song \\"Once Upon a Dream\\",<br /><br />The second disc has the bulk of the special features and this is broken into \\"Cottage\\" and \\"Castle\\".  \\"Cottage\\" is designed for the younger viewers with a poorly designed dancing game and a language game so horribly narrated that it is best avoided.  The good stuff (for adults) is in \\"Castle\\" with a making of, alternate scenes, a 30 minute video with visuals of the Grand Canyon set to music, the original broadcast of a Disney documentary, and all told, if you're looking for bonus footage, this is the disc to get.<br /><br />On the strength of the art, the fairies, and Maleficent, Sleeping Beauty is a Disney masterpiece.

B000UR9T8W|2.0|This DVD Trilogy box contains the two-disc editions of SM 1&2 and the single-disc edition of Spidey 3. However, 1 and 3 are available separately in 3-disc sets, and I'd be surprised if 2 wasn't given the 3-disc treatment right before Christmas. So, when the 3-disc editions of all 3 movies are available in one box (think Ultimate Matrix Collection), then that will be the one to buy. This box can be skipped.
B000001EXR|4.0|OK...WHY IS IT..THAT WHEN A BAND GET'S HEAVY EVERYONE SAYS THEIR ATTEMPTING GRUNGE? That is totally not it..and I'm sure if you ask the band they were not aiming to go \\"Grunge\\" Get over yourselves people! This is straight forward metal. I think it's their heaviest at the time of this release. All you \\"Grunge\\" know it all's need to get over it!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Finally, Metallica is BACK!  Yeah!    The thrash metal geniuses of the 80's have come ROARING back with this fantastic release, after a nearly 19 year wait!  Yes my friends, it was 1989 when Metallica released their last \\"true\\" thrash/speed metal album, and for a bunch of musicians approaching 50 years old (I would assume so anyway) you can't expect anything better than this.  You really can't!    In 1989, it was the first day of second grade for me, and the thoughts of And Justice for All were brand spankin' new.  On the night before the first day of school, I threw up 8 times all over my house, because of a bad batch of corn, and combined with my nervous fears with the first day of school approaching, you can BET I wasn't going through happy times.  But you know, with the release of And Justice for All, everything was all right in the end.  I had Metallica in my life to help me with my childhood problems.  Of course I would soon have more problems, and Metallica choosing to go a more commercial route wasn't exactly making my life easier!    I've waited ALL this time for Metallica to make me feel alright again, and they finally did it.  It took until 2008, but hey, it finally happened.  My second grade teacher would be proud (nah not really, she didn't like kids much, let alone hard rock music).    Anyway, the PERFECT way to start an album is right here folks- \\"That Was Just Your Life\\".  THAT is a perfect Metallica song.  Thrashy guitar riffs, speedy guitar solo, exciting and memorable vocals... this is exactly why we loved Metallica back in the 80's.  EXACTLY!  Probably not *quite* as good as the best stuff from Master of Puppets, but hey, not much IS at that level of quality anyway!    One thing I want to mention is how Death Magnetic is probably the best Metallica album for melodic guitar solos.  Seriously, I can remember them easily, in nearly every song, because you can practically sing along with them!  Great job!    The guitar riffs are fantastic.  In fact,\\"Suicide and Redemption\\" is 10 whole MINUTES of guitar riffs changing and shifting around, and it's really good.  Where was THIS Metallica all this time?  THIS is the band we've wanted for 19 years!  Don't tell me otherwise!    \\"The Unforgiven III\\" is pretty decent, with some pretty good vocals making it a glorious gem.  Not as good as the other \\"Unforgivens\\" from the past, but a nice continuation.    I LOVE the vocals on \\"All Nightmare Long\\".  Great song, that one is.  The guitar playing at the end of \\"End of the Line\\" will absolutely rock your melodic little world.  Oh yes it will!    Overall, THIS album is proof that Metallica still has, and always had, lots of talent.  For the band to come back and release something THIS heavy, and THIS memorable... they deserve a lot of credit.
0452289963|1.0|Nauseating New Age pablum for the porridge-brained.  It was a gift from a clueless and flakey acquaintance so I tried to read it but it was just terrible.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds.  This is where the group's mastery of the technical came to the forefront like never before.  There are so many vocal layers, and such a rich symphonic sound that by this point it was clear, the Beach Boys had something pretty special happening.  However, it has all been said before.  And my guess is you're probably pretty sick of hearing about it.  Pet Sounds is a classic so universally recognized that it seems silly for me to even bother reviewing it.  But the fact remains, some of the Boy's greatest tunes adorn this album.  Also, some of the most sweetly naive and almost childlike lyrics on Pet Sounds color this period of the sixties permanently with the heartbreak of a nation's collective loss of innocence.  \\"Wouldn't it Be Nice\\", \\"Don't Talk\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", \\"Caroline No\\"...These have all become part of the American musical landscape of the twentieth century, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't still be appreciated for their almost hymnal beauty.  And \\"God Only Knows\\" still stands as probably the greatest achievment in Brian Wilson's storied career.  Even though many contemporary musicians claim that the Beach Boys were a major influence on their music, I believe albums like Sunflower and Surf's up actually sound more like modern pop than Pet Sounds does.  The influence of the spirit of the late 60s Beach Boys though, and their interminable drive to push the musical envelope was great indeed.  The Beach Boys of this period pretty much perfected pure pop, so unless the spirit of the music is once again channeled, today's groups are just retreading old ground...and I'm not interested.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|You think you've got someone figured out, and then you're proven wrong. I thought Dreamworks was only capable of Shreks and Madagascars (Bee Movie didn't help either). And then they release this visually stunning, captivating and ambitious movie - truly one of THE animated movies of 2008. It really is an incredible anomaly, and one that reinstated my hope in big-budget animated movies. It remains one of the few movies that I've ever seen twice in the cinema, and that is saying something.<br /><br />The plot is thus; Po, a dreamy but awkward panda bear, hopes to become a kung fu warrior. His dream, however, appears a reality away as he whiles away his days co-running his dad's noodle house. But Po's life changes drastically when he is surprisingly chosen as the 'dragon warrior' by mysterious kung fu master Oogway. Po's new master, Shifu, and his co-students the Furious Five are less than taken with Po to say the least. But as the threat of escaped convict and kung fu master Tai Lung threatens Po's home town, he learns that a little belief in yourself despite all opposition can go a long way. A strong plot with an important and well-delivered message, and fortunately the movie doesn't drag on and on but is frontal and to the point. There's lots of serious moments as well as humorous ones, and as thus it scores highly for integrity.<br /><br />As an animation enthusiast, however, I feel the visual style alone is the main reason to see this film. The opening sequence is 2-D, and my what a 2-D sequence it is! Personally, that's my favourite part of the film; an almost storybook-esque sequence and still so breathtakingly fluid and full of life, living Po's dream of his possible life as a warrior. The 3-D animation which dominates most of the film is very good, too; clear and brisk, yet cartoony enough. In particular the prison scenes are fabulous. The credit sequence mirrors the opening sequence, and I can tell you that both times when I saw the movie in the cinema, I was one of the few who stayed until the very end just watching it.<br /><br />In a day and age when so many mediocre 3-D movies are made, Kung Fu Panda stands out of the bunch. It's a milestone in the life of 3-D animated movies, and reminds us that animated movies have a lasting charm just waiting to be captured. In conclusion, a truly inspiring movie, finely balanced between artistic integrity and a humour/action flick. Two thumbs WAY up!one of the few who stayed until the very end just watching it.<br /><br />In a day and age when so many mediocre 3-D movies are made, Kung Fu Panda stands out of the bunch.

B0017MO10U|1.0|I love Stargate but both movies have been average at best,Continuum is just not very engaging the actors all seem like they would rather be someplace else, the core cast is woefully under used and the pacing as with The Ark Of Truth is completely off,  worst of all the storyline has been done before and better in the series.
B000FSME1A|3.0|I gave \\"Apocalypse Now\\" 3 stars based on Robert Duval's wonderful performance, alone.  He captures the wild and reckless nature of certain officers in Vietnam, perfectly.  He rides into battle in helicopters blaring 'Ride of the Valkyries' because 'It scares Hell out of the Slopes.'  The war is a beach party in La Jolla.  'I love the smell of napalm in the morning....\\"  On the lips of anyone else, this line would have been unremarkable even foolish.  Duval, however, makes it the truth.<br /><br />Other than that, the movie is forgettable.  Increasingly surreal, with pointless combat and unconvincing firepower, we venture into the 'heart of darkness' to meet Kurtz, a man who is synonymous with warfare for the sake of nonending combat.  Interestingly, I met the fellow on which Kurtz was reportedly styled. He waged something of a private war against the North Vietnamese using Montagnard guerillas.  Unlike the madman, Kurtz, of 'Apocalypse', he seems to have integrated quite successfully into peacetime tranquility.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels,--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico

0061547832|5.0|Wow - what a breath of fresh air - I love it!    This book is unexpectedly fun, readable, and direct.    It is oddly not about money really at all - it is about how to manage situations, sometimes financial, mostly people related. I love Trump's code of honor, so to speak - what is acceptable vs what is absolutely not tolerable and how to handle it directly.  He has a 'quiz' at the end that is a remarkable way to 'see' yourself, to look at the way you may label, and thereby, limit yourself, especially financially. And in this quiz, he clearly offers another way to look at the same issue, the way he might handle it - this is what I mean by a breath of fresh air.  His way of seeing problems is like a quantum shift in perspective, he does not seem to have the considerations that limit most of us in our actions and decisions.  I highly recommend this book. I also highly recommend Ariel and Shya Kane's books, [[ASIN:0071601082 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: The 3 Simple Ideas That Can Instantaneously Transform Your Life]] and [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]. They are exceptional - their way of seeing things/situations that confront all of us is an equally quantum shift in perspective on life, relationship, and well-being.  What I respect most about Mr. Trump and the Kane's is, in fact, their willingness to share their astonishingly unique perspectives - Thank You!

0316042994|5.0|I first read this book over 30 years ago but wanted to return to it because of the quality of Evelyn Waugh's writing.  There is enough detail to get a clear picture of each character, scene and location but it still moves along well and keeps ones interest page to page.  I will always remember the prayer, \\"O God, if there is a God, forgive this man his sins, if there is such a thing as sin.\\"  I have used that many times with friends and co-workers since it covers a wealth of beliefs or un-beliefs.  I highly recommend this work.
0316067601|5.0|Lone Survivor should be a must read for every American. I bought 3 more books for friends to read. The sacrifice, discipline and attitude of the Navy Seal in the book really made me realize how lucky we are to have people like him serving our Country. His first hand account of how hard it is to get through Seal training as well as the hardships in Afghanistan was a real eye opener. It would be an honor just to shake his hand.
B000244EMO|5.0|all together this is a dynamic dvd set {must have}   the documentry of how the film was made back in 87 w/ behind the scenes commentary  makes it all the more worth wild!!!   especially the lay out on the Predator costume as well   the interviews w/ john mctiernan are also good in Mexico      just would have been great if a few yrs back when the scond one was done if they had arnold of course back in the Jungle setting!!!!
B0018M6J90|4.0|I really liked this movie and found it to have some very interesting little twists that made it even better.  First, Miss Pettigrew who was the center of the film had very few lines and actually didn't drive the action -- instead she was the catalyst for the action.  Then when it came time to make her into a \\"butterfly\\" ala Pygmalion she really didn't change into Cinderella that you would expect but turned into a mature woman dressed appropriately.  Yes -- the film takes place all in a 24 hour period and thus is filled with some very unlikely character intercessions but it was fun and really unlifting.  There are some good lines but no belly laughs, the screen play is well written and the cting excellent.  If you are looking for a fun film with no bad launguage, no explosions, no car crashes, no nudity, and no drugs -- this is the one.  It is a thoroughly delightful film.

B0019CSXAM|5.0|My husband and I have been watching the show from the start and of course we buy up the DVD sets so that we can continually watch our favorite episodes. I think that Season 3 was just as strong as the previous 2 seasons and am now pleased that it is on DVD so that I can delete the \\"Rebound Bro\\" episode from our DVR, thus freeing up the space for the new season!  The writing and acting on that episode can't get any better, Will Forte's character \\"Randy\\" brings tears to my eyes from laughing so hard.  Slapsgiving and Sandcastles in the Sand are also favorites from this season.

Delving comparatively into the backgrounds of Abe's rivals for the nomination for President, the author simultaneously draws the reader into the world that Abe inhabited and makes clear what strokes of genius brought him the nomination.  Many of the brilliant moments leading up to it and from it therefore make total sense.  What a wonderful book.

B000W4D94I|1.0|People, if it ain't remastered, it's only going to be a moderate improvement, compared to standard def, unless it animation or shot in high def already. You wanna' see spectacular, get Blade Runner special edition in Blue Ray...OMG...now that's something to see and WORTH!!!!! my dollars. I've yet to see anything made more than ten years ago come even close to that title. Twister is one of my all time favs that can be watched at least twice a year. I may get this in BR; but, that's an exception. As far as I'm concerned, the movie industry is only porting most of their products in to BR, without much concern about quality, to get more money in their pocket, knowing full well that the end result could be much...much better if they took the time to remaster each and EVERY title to maximize the end result. For what they are charging we fans, this should be standard practice.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The Dark Knight is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The story line is superb, the cast is amazing (Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar for his performance as Joker), and the action is breathtaking. The Dark Knight takes place immediately after Batman Begins. Batman is starting to make Gotham City peaceful and safe, until the Joker comes in and creates chaos for Batman. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is amazing and terrifying. Ledger shows that Joker is sadistic, homicidal, insane, and of course, funny in a horrifying way. Heath Ledger will forever be remembered as the greatest comic villain ever. I highly recommend The Dark Knight  to anyone who wants to experience a thrilling action movie!!!
0446579939|3.0|After seeing this book was #2 on the NYT bestseller's list, I read the jacket and dove in. The book starts extremely well with a modern and interesting narrative. The flashback scenes are well done and at no time lose the reader.    About 2/3's of the way into the book, the characters become well defined and start to gain a mild complexity. Unfortunately that is where the development stops. In an attempt to create a dramatic ending the book takes on a sit com like aspect. The characters become one dimensional, the story line predictable and you feel the author racing to create a tidy ending.    If the author had further developed the auxiliary characters and ending, it could of been on par with similar books in this genre like \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\".
031606792X|5.0|Ok so my sissy got me hooked on the twilight series and I am so in love with them. When I was going to buy the 4th book I was reading the reviews and was very disappointed when everyone was bashing the book as terrible. It is in no way terrible it is awesome! It was how it was suppose to end a true happy ending. People say that Bella wasn't suppose to get everything that she wanted (handsome husband, child, best friend, money, immortal,beauty, great sex, etc.) that life isn't that way but people, remember that this is FICTION as well as a YOUNG ADULT series. Would we really have wanted to see something bad happen to Bella, Edward, Jacob, the Cullens? The answer is NO. OH and give it a rest with the literary BS that some people are talking about like plot, character development, etc. GET OVER YOURSELF! If you want literary masterpieces then read the classics and steer away from Young Adult sections. This is an amazing book with great resolution at the end. A true twilight fan will love that all is well in the vampire world. Don't let the other crappy reviews taint your opinion. Yes the book is sappy and all matters are resolved a true fairy-tale ending.

1591841666|3.0|The book is quick and easy read, but doesn't really say much. It is much more lucrative to be the \\"cream of the crop\\" than a middler, no matter which profession you pick. Seth argues for careful deliberation when seeking out opportunities, and a willingness to change course. Quitting should be a rational decision, even planned ahead of time if possible. Overall, he argues that to best utilize your potential, you should seek out a job you will be challenged on, can grow in, and can be the best in the world. Once you've done that, stick it out without being disheartened by the time it takes to become an expert a.k.a. \\"the dip\\", because that's just what it takes, and its worth it.    I'm usually a big fan of Seth's work, and agree with the content of the book, it just wasn't very insightful or enlightening for me.
1400082773|4.0|This amazingly frank memoir bares the soul of a confused and deprived, then ambitious and determined, man of his times.  The multi-racial, multi-cultural, migratory experience of Barack Obama both reflects and defines the post-modern secular society that the United States has become in the 21st century.  This masterfully told tale transcends the senator's own life to illustrate the trials and pain of the racial divide that persist both here and abroad.  It portrays the chronically sad consequences of tribal and colonial history for Africans, Europeans and Americans.     By turns troubling yet hopeful, morose yet humourous, depressing yet inspiring, this book probes your emotions and challenges your worldview.  Obama weaves an incredible tapestry of characters, places and moods with language more befitting a poet than a politician.  His look inside himself is as deep and penetrating as his thoughts about the human condition.  Although not everyone will agree with his conclusions, no one can deny his convictions.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Christopher Nolan has a vision. And whether you agree with it or not, he undeniably completes it in \\"The Dark Knight\\"--a vicious, engrossing, overwhelming, intelligent event- film that re-defines 'comic-book-flicks'. In Nolan's grim, dark-depiction of Gotham-City (the crime-ridden hell protected by legendary superhero Batman), the director strives to make everything real (something he began in the well-received \\"Batman Begins\\"). He makes it plausible, possible. And yet there's more to it: just as 'Begins' was a dissection of myth, the nature of symbols and heroes, 'Knight' is the escalation of that notion. It's a biblical- confrontation of 'good-and-evil', yet as 'good-and-evil' really exist: a conflict of ideals, something that can't be purely-defined but that is relative to a viewpoint. In Nolan's world, the line of villainy and heroism isn't crossed... it's non-existent. The bad-guys don't see themselves as bad-guys, and as such something so unnervingly-real comes across it might fly past some people's minds (no insult to anybody, it's just common that people don't look deep into 'popcorn-flicks'): the battle is a complete ambiguity.<br /><br />The film runs at nearly 2.5-hours, yet never ceases to lose interest or momentum. It doesn't waste a scene or moment; every event is utilized and necessary. 'The Dark Knight' tells a story worth telling and it takes the proper amount of time to tell it. Action-sequences are frantic, old-school, eye-grabbing stunts (vastly superior to 'Begins') and in their chaotic intensity we see that they serve purpose to the story, yet more interesting are not played for pure entertainment-value: we are meant to watch, petrified, simply hoping that the outcome will go the hero's way. Attention is never lost because we are immersed in a breathtaking, almost completely-unpredictable story (it packs many a shock), that makes us think and more importantly gains our emotional-investment. We come to care for the characters, because they are believable, developed, and personified fully.<br /><br />Everyone has great-chemistry together. Maggie Gyllenhal is a more mature Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes. Morgan Freeman provides his authoritative presence to the role of bad- gadget-inventor/Wayne-Enterprise CEO Lucius Fox, and under anyone else's portrayal, the part would be less-memorable. Gary Oldman underplays his world-wearied lawman with such honest-nobility, you never feel for a second any of its forced-acting. The irreplaceable Michael Caine makes a gentle, reassuring, father-like presence as Alfred, and the movie would surely fail without his strong-presence and interjected-moments of light-humor.<br /><br />And while everyone (rightfully) pours the praise unto Bale and Ledger, I think most are glancing-over Knight's breakout-performance. As Harvey Dent, Aaron Eckhart does more than hold himself in the company of such a renowned-cast. He makes his presence known, whether he's playing on the easy-going charisma of Gotham's 'White-Knight' or the broken and damaged, twisted-soul of Two-Face. He achieves a full-impact with the tragedy that comes unto his character, and so closely connects with Dent, that he makes his pain tangible for us: we sympathize even as we become terrified. He captures both facets of each personality flawlessly.<br /><br />Now, some people cite that 'Knight' has a potential fatal-flaw in the supposedly wooden- acting of Christian Bale. Admittedly, his development is not as grand as in 'Begins' (yet that film gave us such a good psychoanalysis of Wayne, we hardly need more), yet what Bale pulls off is admirable. Wayne is not an eccentric personality. He is a disillusioned man who can hardly find any joy in having no family, giving up his love-interest and spending his life fighting a battle that may never end. He's dark and conflicted, and Bale plays up on that brooding-mood by making Wayne look as though a thousand dark-things were on his mind. He's not wooden...he's a humorless, quiet individual. Even when Wayne is acting as a frivolous playboy for the public, every now and then Bale offers us a powerful glance that reminds us its all a façade; that deep down, something more disturbed irks him. Occasionally he offers a broken-smile when exchanging banter with Alfred, letting us know that beyond the dour depression of the Caped-Crusader lies a damaged human-being. It is only in the guise of a growling masked-man, that he can unleash his true, ferocious personality.<br /><br />Finally, who could forget Heath Ledger. Now, when he was first-announced for the part, I was (along with many other people) asking myself: \\"Why?\\". Mr. Ledger had proved with 'Brokeback Mountain' he could deliver a potent performance. But he hadn't before. It is only, after seeing this film, that I know the answer to 'why?': I see the significance of his loss.<br /><br />When Heath appears in this movie, he is completely unrecognizable. His voice is distinctly-altered; a near-whiny, pedophile-like tone that sends shivers down the spine. His face is completely splattered with makeup that renders him both freakishly-nightmarish and strangely-funny. And when you see him, you don't think it's him. In this, his final performance, Ledger proved he was a chameleon. His two iconic performances in this, and 'Brokeback', could not be more different. I am convinced he could have been anything in his career. He commits so intensely to character that the line of actor/portrayal dies. His every tick and gesture only further-enhances his character. Heath never hams the role up or goes for something cheap: he delivers a fully-immersed display of psychotic madness...or do we just label him that to feel safer? The movie writes the character brilliantly; blending terrifying truth into his every social-accusation, and making us question why we laugh at his sick-jokes.<br /><br />'The Dark Knight' has had an incredible-amount of hype running for it, from the get-go, mounting ever-higher, until Heath Ledger's too-soon death. And the finished-product does more than exceed all of the near-impossible expectations placed on it. It becomes something much richer than a super-hero-franchise-saga. Christopher Nolan has opened a new door in cinema: allowing action-flicks to become more serious, capable of intelligence. He has transformed this into a piece of artwork, full of beauty, terror, moral-conundrums. This movie has changed things...forever.<br /><br />There's no going back. 10/10is acting as a frivolous playboy for the public, every now and then Bale offers us a powerful glance that reminds us its all a façade; that deep down, something more disturbed irks him.

B001F7MSFW|4.0|You know you're not watching a formulaic comic book film when one of the highlights is a drunken rendition of \\"Can't Smile Without You\\" by Hellboy and Abe Sapien. \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a more confident, assured outing than the first film and while it does not draw from Mignola's comics for its plot it is perhaps better off for it, lacking the usual burden of comparison and expectations. \\"The Golden Army\\" is more fantastical than the first film and is less sci-fi oriented but this is the sort of thing Del Toro does exceptionally well as a writer. He never lets the fantasy become the focus of the film, instead concentrating on characters and delivering action scenes that can only be described as, forgive the crass immaturity, kickass.<br /><br />As entertaining as many comic book-to-film adaptations are it is a rare event when one can call one of these films a true artistic achievement. I am convinced without a shadow of a doubt that Guillermo Del Toro's entire career has been leading up to this film, particularly regarding his work as screenwriter here. The comedy feels less forced and is worked incredibly well into the script here, so much so that it doesn't feel remotely unnatural when the scene of comic drunken singing leads directly without a break into one of the film's most intensely dramatic sequences. Del Toro's handling of character has never been better, not even with \\"The Devil's Backbone\\", which is still my favorite of his films, and his sheer skill and ability when it comes to telling a fairytale-esquire fantasy is astonishing, as proved in the prologue to this film. In short this is Del Toro at the top of his game and providing artistry the likes of which we rarely if ever see in summer blockbusters. It's only fair that an astonishingly brilliant comic like \\"Hellboy\\" by an astonishingly brilliant artist like Mike Mignola is adapted this well and by someone as talented at what they do as he is.<br /><br />How refreshing it is, a week after the release of \\"Hancock\\", which to me epitomizes everything wrong with action film-making today, that we get \\"The Golden Army\\" which features hands down some of the finest action scenes we have ever seen in this sort of film. Just stunningly beautiful, well-shot, well-crafted, the sort of thing that leaves one wondering how much time and effort went into it and endlessly thankful that some really talented people went to the trouble of making the film.<br /><br />The film is generally just superb on a technical level. Why am I even saying this? Of course it is. Danny Elfman composing, Guillermo Navarro serving as cinematographer, top-notch editors, fantastic special effects wizards. It's a world-class crew that made this film. I shouldn't be surprised at its quality but \\"The Golden Army\\" really just floored and astonished me with how good it is. The cast is also excellent, proving once again that you don't need 'big names' to carry a movie. Just about everyone here is excellent, particularly Perlman with another excellent turn as Hellboy and the underrated Selma Blair as Liz Sherman.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" provides essentially everything a Del Toro or Mignola fan would want. I imagine it will entertain and charm many outside those circles as well with its fantastic action sequences, engaging characters, and wonderful sense of humor. I would personally go as far as calling \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" one of the top five or so comic book movies ever made.cock\\", which to me epitomizes everything wrong with action film-making today, that we get \\"The Golden Army\\" which features hands down some of the finest action scenes we have ever seen in this sort of film.

1857151720|5.0|A perfect delight. Long did I search for this novel: long did I search for Waugh! When I first picked it up (I call it fate), it was only a matter of moments before I knew in my heart that we were old friends. It has the sensational richness and deepness of European aristocratic life, and an unparalleled portrayal of early century Oxford. Just delicious. I couldn't put it down, and when I did I felt a regular beast, and picked it up again. Everything I love about literature was preparing me for this novel. Read it. Of course Waugh's a staunch Catholic, and that (God love him!) only sharpens his mind for what is vice and folly. But you get goodness and beauty, too.
B000HF0IIC|3.0|WARNING: SPOILER FOR BATMAN (1989).<br /><br />Note: I saw this movie yesterday with XFinity On Demand in HD.<br /><br />I originally gave this movie a 5 star review when I first saw it several years ago, and I regret I did. This movie is so NOT faithful to the comics, as Mr. Nolan's excellent Batman trilogy is. However, compared to the first two films in the series directed by Burton, it's a slightly better effort. There's a bit more serious story here than in Batman (1989) and Batman Returns, with a bit more of Bruce's backstory explored along with a Clark Kent/Superman-type romance situation, and to its credit, the sexual innuendo has been dialed down considerably, present in one scene only. Nicole Kidman and Chris O'Donnell are a welcome addition to the franchise. There's a good scene with Dick going out and fighting some wackos in the Batmobile.<br /><br />So much for the pros. Now for the cons.<br /><br />The two villains in the film are horribly miscast...Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face & Jim Carrey as The Riddler. Bad choice, Schumacher. Two-Face was more like a spoilt child whenever something didn't go his way. Carrey really hammed it up, and not in a good way. He was virtually not funny. And what the hell was with the anatomically correct superhero suits? Why didn't you just add in a p---- while you're at it? (that last question was pure sarcasm). Drew Barrymore was absolutely wasted in this film (as was Vivica A. Fox in the horrific Batman & Robin). And what exactly was the significance of the red book in Bruce's flashback? Why bother throwing that in if it wasn't going to be significant to the plot? Two-Face's makeup was also really bad. There could have been more to Dick Grayson's story, and a three-way romance between Batman/Bruce, Dr. Meridian & Dick/Robin. There was also a sense of goofiness/serious drama thing going on here, which was exactly the problem with the first two movies. Batman & Robin just went off into total goofiness. And also, why not just use the flashbacks from Batman (1989) in this film for Bruce's memory of the murder of his parents? It didn't make sense, as the first film clearly established that The Joker killed Thomas & Martha Wayne, whereas in this movie, the killer is never shown.<br /><br />As with the first two and the last film in this series, the characters have just been taken from the comics and run through the paper shredder.<br /><br />View Christopher Nolan's Bat-tastic trilogy instead.use the flashbacks from Batman (1989) in this film for Bruce's memory of the murder of his parents?

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The world is divided into people who get Firefly and people who don't. In this series Joss Whedon created one of the most realistic post-war visions of the future ever committed to tape, that at the same time spoke about yesterday and today. Maybe a little too much today for its own good.<br /><br />The series is anti-corporate, anti-government and, while it takes the stand that some things are worth fighting for, it is largely anti-war. No wonder FOX did everything in its power to kill it off, including airing episodes out of order, skipping weeks after airing only three eps and, inevitably canceling the show without even airing episodes 12, 13 and 14 (out of 15). This was particularly damaging, as Firefly had a greater sense of ongoing plot than any other Whedon series in its first year. Viewers were left wondering, on more than one occasion, when a character would reference something we hadn't seen yet.<br /><br />The backstage dramatics aside, Firefly is intelligent and, like Buffy, mythic - except this time Whedon is dealing with the myth of America: the Frontier, the Civil War, the rise of the Corporation, etc . . .<br /><br />Firefly is a demanding show. It asks its audience to appreciate the shades of Grey in its characters' moral scale. The villains are not comfortingly dressed as an alien race. In 500 years mankind will still be its own worst enemy. Technology will be in the hands of a privileged few, and others will in \\"The Black\\" - Whedon's frontier third world - where it is possible to exist without the interference (or benefit) of civilization and government. Things will be dirty, and used. Firefly creates a universe that almost totally opposes that of (that bastion of television sci-fi) Star Trek: its Federation-like central power (the Alliance) is interpreted as being oppressive and dystopic. We are on the side of those who resisted (like the Maqui) and lost.<br /><br />The acting is strong, the writing as excellent, funny and moving as on any Whedon show, and the effects and sets create a consistent, believable world. It is a shame the series didn't have a more hospitable environment in which to grow and become all it could have been.create a consistent, believable world.

B001C4AFP8|4.0|You really have to admire Ridley Scott's moxie.<br /><br />Even though the 70-year-old director has long established himself as one of Hollywood's best and most durable directors; having helmed some of the most entertaining films of all time, in virtually every genre (including sci-fi classics like Alien and Blade Runner); and having been nominated no less than three times for the Best Director Oscar (Thelma & Louise, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down), to decide to take on theme that has produced exactly zero blockbusters thus far - the Middle East and terrorism - takes an incredible amount of chutzpah.<br /><br />But it does help if you have the help of two of the biggest actors in Hollywood at the moment, those being Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe (who has worked with Scott on two previous films, Gladiator and A Good Year). It's ironic to think that the last time these two actors shared the screen was back in 1995, with the clich&eacute;d-but-entertaining oater The Quick and the Dead. Of course, at the time, Crowe was a complete unknown and DiCaprio was a 21-year-old newcomer with only a couple of notable titles under his belt. But oh, how that's all changed now.<br /><br />It's not easy to describe the plot of Body of Lies without giving too much away. DiCaprio plays CIA operative Roger Ferris, who is trying to flush out a terrorist leader named Al-Saleem in Jordan. He gets his orders from Ed Hoffman (Crowe), a man for whom results are the only satisfactory outcome, delivered with a fair amount of arrogance and a cocky Southern drawl. Ed plays the situation like a kid playing a video game, and has the resources to change the rules anytime he feels like it, dispensing his orders from his office, from his backyard, from his daughter's soccer game, for Pete's sake! This, of course, infuriates Ferris to no end, because he is the one who is in the trenches, chasing the bad guys, dodging bullets, ducking explosions, and procuring the badly-needed intelligence that Hoffman needs. Ferris is also trying to build a productive working relationship with the head of Jordanian Intelligence, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), a relationship that is made even more tenuous by Hoffman's double-dealings and hidden agendas.<br /><br />There are so many ways that Scott could have screwed this up. A lesser director might have chosen to ramp up the action, sacrificing intelligence for entertainment. A lesser director could have taken this story of espionage and twisted it into a convoluted and indecipherable Gordian knot. A lesser director would have gotten less convincing performances from his lead actors.<br /><br />But Ridley Scott is not a lesser director. Though the plot is indeed complex, with many layers and sub-layers, deceit and treachery, Scott never lets you lose sight of the overall picture. He tells a solid, wonderfully entertaining story, without the need to drive home its message with sledgehammer subtlety (after all, very few things are black and white). And most of all, he gets electric performances from Crowe and DiCaprio, whose symbiotic relationship with a thinly-veiled veneer of mutual contempt is a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />I don't know if Body of Lies will end up breaking through the barrier that every movie in this genre couldn't; but for what it's worth, I hope it does. One thing's for sure... if anybody can, Ridley Scott can.g to build a productive working relationship with the head of Jordanian Intelligence, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), a relationship that is made even more tenuous by Hoffman's double-dealings and hidden agendas.

B001C08RHA|4.0|There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flick...let's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.<br /><br />Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out back story. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.<br /><br />The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, \\"no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can.\\" I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic Lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liaison, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show \\"Dinner for Five\\" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.<br /><br />One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.<br /><br />Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the back story and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.<br /><br />I was laughing, smiling, and guffawing at Po, the main protagonist (voiced by Jack Black) and his misadventures at becoming a Kung Fu expert. This was certainly a flawed character, one that a lot of people can relate to because he dreams, he's funny, and he can laugh at himself. Also, the story was pretty clear and easy to follow because the storytelling was well crafted, and the animation was paired well with characters brought vividly to life by some of the most famous names in Hollywood.<br /><br />Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are downright excellent as the main characters, and Ian McShane as the bad dude gave it the right fearful presence. Other big name stars don't shine as much, but that's because their roles are rather limited in the film. But that's still okay because the animators should be given equal credit (if not more) for delivering the funny, action and heart elements of this movie in an effective, amazing and (I've got to use this) AWESOME manner. Visually, this movie is stunning (notice all those scenic shots of the Chinese mountains, bodies of water, and the bridge scene; not to mention the action animation version of \\"The Matrix\\" with slow-mo)... simply a delight to watch.<br /><br />It's clear that Dreamworks has gotten back in the animation game with Kung Fu Panda, after slight ho-hums in Shrek 3 and Bee Movie (call me crazy, but I liked Over The Hedge more than those two). Hopefully, it should earn well over $500M worldwide because it is so good.<br /><br />This movie rightfully belongs in the top animation movies of all time (okay, let's not include the classic fairy tales of old; let's begin with the 90's onwards), alongside my faves \\"The Incredibles\\" \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Beauty & The Beast.\\" Has the makings of being a classic.<br /><br />Enjoy!s), alongside my faves \\"The Incredibles\\" \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Beauty & The Beast.\\" Has the makings of being a classic.

Because there are no words, children can set the pace to \\"read\\" this book.  The conversational opportunities are endless.
6305161992|5.0|Macho B-movie madness at its sublime best, this crazy action quickie is about as brain dead as you can get: wooden acting, a terrible story and a script that truly sucks. But with all the mindless violence who really cares. Gun battles, martial arts, Samurai sword slashing and gory deaths are the order of the day, not to mention plenty of beautiful ladies treated like playthings and shedding clothes at every opportunity. Despite the women and guns, there is some kind of story: Kenner (Lundgren) is on a mission of vengeance. His parents were killed when he was little by crazy Yakuza thug Yoshida (Tagawa), an ice-cool super-villain now specializing in drug dealing and generally looking mean. Kenner, adept in the Samurai ways, grows to be a law-abiding copper who's now right on his tail. Male bonding ensues when policeman Johnny Murata (Lee, in his US debut), a hip-talking dude with street credentials, is assigned as Kenner's partner in crime, and all hell simply breaks loose. You could say that there's an artistic angle to all this fighting, shooting and banging, but then that would be a lie - Showdown in Little Tokyo is a classic in a completely different sense of the word.
0316776963|5.0|Before reading this book, I very much thought from the title (and because at the time I did not know who David Sedaris is)that it would be a \\"heart wrenching tale\\" about some child who is physically unable to speak or doesn't have access to a decent education.  It was one of those books I meant to get to someday, but probably never would.  Finally someone clued me in.  I read it in a day.  Sedaris's short stories are the funniest I've ever read.  He draws on recollections of his own family to give us realistic visions of family and personal life in all their \\"rolling on the floor laughing\\" complexity.  If I were ever to write a book, this is exactly like what I hope I would write.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Although the miniseries title and episodes focus on the life of John Adams, the strength of the film lies in the exceptional ensemble cast. It was impressive to see such giants as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, as well as the lesser known individuals, truly inhabited by the actors.<br /><br />The challenge of the series was to breathe life into those stories and lives we know so well. The filmmakers worked closely to David McCullough's outstanding book for the details, along with the human side of the story captured in the voluminous correspondence of John and Abigail Adams. The political, military, and personal issues were all thoughtfully brought to life. The design values of the film were also superb. Nothing looked stagy or stilted in the sets and costumes, which provided an unusual authenticity of period style for television drama. With each appearance of George Washington (David Morse), it was hard not to gasp due to the believability of his character.<br /><br />The drama of America's breaking from England for independence was an improbable story and one dependent on the courage and idealism of the individuals portrayed in this film. The personalities of these great figures make this program an accessible and rewarding experience for the entire family. For the patient viewer, what emerges from the John Adams miniseries is not merely a history lesson, but a drama with great relevance today. Simply put, we need more people in our country right now just like John and Abigail Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Washington, Knox, and, above all, the ordinary human beings heroically portrayed in this fine film!

B000MZHW40|4.0|'Blood Diamond' is a very Hollywood film but at the same time it stays very true to the facts. Zwick does not overload the viewer with its 'Hollywoodness'. There are bombs exploding and lots of shooting and killing but it's not overdone like in other flicks. The enigmatic African landscape is stunningly captured (even though it wasn't specifically filmed in Sierra Leone) and the score is both mesmerizing and haunting. The cinematography is superb as it gives the film a slick feel and also gives the landscape a role of its own.<br /><br />Though the story is somewhat predictable it does not effect the film in a negative way. Zwick refrains from using clich&eacute;s like putting a sex scene (which would have only deviated from the main plot line) or a conventional happy ending. The slick execution makes 'Blood Diamond' entertaining, gripping and moving. It moves at a steady pace. Rosenblum's editing is good and Leavitt's screenplay is solid and engaging. The characters are well written and the insanity of the blood thirsty rebels is well depicted in a few scenes and the sequence where they brainwash the children turning them into immediate murderers, is chilling. While many seem to disagree, I thought the problem of conflict diamond is effectively presented in this movie.<br /><br />I never thought Leonardo Dicaprio would ever reach the heights he did with his acting in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' (which I considered his best work). He's been good in many films (like 'Catch Me If You Can') and bad in some (like 'Titanic', 'The Man In The Iron Mask' but I can say that his performance in both 'Gilbert Grape' and 'Blood Diamond' are his career best (though I have yet to see 'The Aviator'). In my opinion, they surpass the overrated 'The Departed'. I've always liked Djimon Hounsou's acting (especially in films like 'Amistad' and 'In America') and here he does not disappoint one bit. The actor skillfully underplays his part and is only explosive when required. The scenes between him and Dicaprio are a treat to watch. Then there's the radiant Jennifer Connelly, another actor who's performances never let down. She has a comparatively smaller role but makes the best of it. All three actors form an interesting and entertaining trio. The supporting cast do well.<br /><br />While the 'Hollywoodness' gives it an entertaining quality, I think it takes away some of the rawness and that slightly hinders the film from being more hard-hitting (like 'Hotel Rwanda'). But it is pretty much an either - or situation and I still think the issues are presented well enough to balance the effectiveness of the real problem and entertainment.<br /><br />Overall, Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is an excellent gripping drama thriller that showcases the talents of actors Hounsou and Dicaprio, writer Leavitt, music director Newton Howard and director of photography Serra.io are a treat to watch.

B000YAA68C|5.0|Adorable-made me want to go to Ireland.  I watched this movie 4 times the first week I got it...
B00005JPO1|1.0|Personal sadness and disappointment here: what a great franchise this was, what a lovable character, now destroyed by pure Lucasian incompetence. I'd really loved all the first three movies, because in my opinion, they were perfect examples for timeless adventure classics and movie magic extraordinaire, each in its own style. Indy himself was one of my childhood heroes ... heck, I even loved the TV series (well, mostly), but when I saw this one, I almost puked my guts out. Honestly, I wanted to like it badly, but this flick is so incredibly stupid, so inconsistent and amazingly badly written, it's plain unbearable. All things which made the other movies so great are missing: the excitement of discovery, the thrilling adventure, the enjoyable character relations, the sarcastic yet charming humor, the over-the-top but still believable action scenes - all gone. What remains is this brainless, soulless, uninspired load of junk that (sadly) will score at the box office anyway, just because it's Indy - sort of. But worst of all, as you can clearly see in almost every take, the love is gone from the franchise. Even Harrison Ford looks mostly like he's just going through the motions. For my part, I blame it all on the ABSOLUTELY CRAPPY AND THOROUGHLY DUMB SCRIPT that 1) DENIES THE ACTORS ALMOST EVERY POSSIBILITY TO ACT (Karen Allen being the worst example) and 2) has literally everything that also made the star wars prequels fail: the ham-fisted dialogue, the completely ridiculous \\"storytelling\\", forced character development and relations, plot holes one could fly the death star through, overused CGI effects, the lamest humor imaginable ... the list goes on and on. So thanks, George Lucas, for ruining just another childhood love of mine - you couldn't have made it worse by introducing Steven Seagal as Indys long lost brother. But probably, that's what you were up to anyway and Spielberg just talked you out of it.<br /><br />Bottom line: 20 years of waiting in vain ... excuse me now, but I think I'll go hiding in the basement and cry a little., but I think I'll go hiding in the basement and cry a little.
B0018CMJSU|2.0|I absolutely agree, word for word, with unluckyfrank's review.    I too purchased the standard DVD set of 'The Coppola Restoration' and it is bad - not worth the money bad. I found myself CONSTANTLY turning up the brightness, turning down the brightness, turning up the color, turning down the color. It is unbearable!    Worst of all, I found myself yearning to watch the original release right in the middle of viewing my brand new 'Coppola Restoration'.    I was expecting James Bond quality restos, this is not even in the ballpark. The James Bond restorations and the Alfred Hitchcock restorations are stunning in their quality, the Godftaher should 'whack' the studio boss for this one!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Just out of college, Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is recruited by Arvin Sloan (Ron Rifkin) to be part of a globe-trotting secret government spy agency known as SD-6. When tragic events occur Sydney realizes that SD-6 is not what it seems and joins up with her father (Victor Garber) at the CIA as a double agent to bring Sloan down with the help of her undercover handler and future lover Vaughn (Michael Vartan) and her partner Dixon (Carl Lumbly). Meanwhile, Sloan races to uncover the artifacts of an ancient profit known as Rambaldi, the possessor of all of them will become so powerful that they could become immortal and rule the world.<br /><br />ABC was unusually good to \\"Alias\\". While they gave the show an opportunity to bring its 5-year story toward a satisfying conclusion, the show went through so many changes in the meantime it is hard to talk about it as one entity. Creator J.J. Abrams starts out keeping things very simple. Season 1 is like a run-and-gun video game where in episode after episode Sydney sneaks into a secret facility in a fantastic disguise, steals or downloads something for the CIA under the cover of SD-6 and then runs, kicks and punches her way out. Part \\"La Femme Nikkita\\", part \\"Mission: Impossible\\", it is a light and sound show.<br /><br />In a rare example of positive network and creative collaboration Abrams got a call to reinvent the fledgling series (5th place will make a network start to get religion). What came out of the meeting was a complete dismantling of the series as we knew it and the establishment of something better. The show ditched the head-scratching cliffhanger endings for more self-contained episodes, but Abrams was given the freedom to continue his story arcs and flesh out the character relationships into what will ultimately be a tangled web of familial soap opera drama involving Syd's mother (Lena Olina) and Sloan's daughter.<br /><br />Mid-way though the 2nd season and into the 3rd , \\"Alias\\" hits its stride. In a series filled with stupendous action sequences, a 2-hour finale that culminates in a rollicking, all-out brawl between Sydney and an evil duplicate of her roommate (just watch) that rips their apartment to splintered shreds ranks as one of the coolest scenes in modern TV for me. It is also here when the look of the show is expanded to a gorgeous cinematic scope it will have to the end. I could just drink up the colors and cinematography of this show. In addition to a perfectly short and sweet intro, Micahel Giacchino's on-target original score is laced with sound-alike Bernard Hermann violin riffs that beautifully puts a classic Hitchcock spy thriller spin on things.<br /><br />Abrams has wrapped his core cast so tight with indispensable characters - including a show-stealing Kevin Weisman as computer ace Marshall (a 4th season bit where Marshall goes in the field, and must pass a retinal scanner, is classic) - that he has little room for twists and suspense. Unlike 2001's \\"24\\", we know that all of the \\"Alias\\" characters must stay safe to keep the story moving. He compensates by bringing in one long lost family member after another. Mothers, sisters, aunts and stepfathers all are revealed to be a close part of Sydney's universe. Some will find it a convoluted overkill, others will find it giving everyone more depth and resonance.<br /><br />At the center of it all is Garner, who gamely goes for all the network's guilty pleasure requirements to put her in skimpy bikinis and lingerie. Strikingly beautiful, she has two modes as an actress (fighting and crying), but fills the heels of our kick-butt heroine perfectly - commanding the show and the audience around her just as a great hero should. Garber is an ever-present force of dignity and credibility. The show's fuel is arguably Rifkin who makes such a classically nasty villain and yet give him a vulnerability that, despite his pension for murder, makes you want to believe him.<br /><br />Now, here's the problem with \\"Alias\\" and Abrams' writing style. Abrams spends a lot of time, for lack of a better word, stalling. Several episodes go by with nothing being revealed and wrenches being thrown into the gears of the story for no other purpose than to artificially drag out the over-arching plot until the end of the season, end of the series or maybe even until Abrams can finally settle on an endgame. Like many of the HBO serials, there is a lot of pointless running in place here.<br /><br />Delivering a kick-butt girl-power action hero, a few David E. Kelley music-over-dialog montages and a focus on fashion and exotic locations mixed with some fierce violence, smashing guy-movie car chases and creativity in the gadgets and story lines that most women won't appreciate, \\"Alias\\" may have suffered a bit of gender confusion with the viewing public. I'm not sure if Abrams set out to create the ultimate gay man's spy series, but here it is. The big difference between \\"Alias\\" and the other spy shows is the endless imagination Abrams and his crew infuse it with. Tiny details like the inventive array of gadgets and weapons (like DNA replicating masks and microwave bombs) keep us enthralled.<br /><br />Sure there are quite a few cracks in cinematically polished armor, but \\"Alias\\" is an overall solid, action-packed, visually vibrant piece of popcorn entertainment. Recommended for those that want something a little different and are willing to indulge its contrivances and trust that it actually might be going somewhere. The modern spy series given a little twist - Abrams gives it a refreshing imagination, Garner gives it strength, Garber credibility, and Rifkin a force to be reckoned with.lot of time, for lack of a better word, stalling.

B0000844IT|4.0|Originally released in Spring, 1993, ARMY OF DARKNESS only lasted for a week and a half in theaters--not enough to creep into box-office success. After a few years in the back of the shelves, the film has attained \\"cult status\\" and had acquired a permanent spot in the books of popular culture. The \\"Boomstick\\" Dvd edition has both the 81 minute theatrical cut and the 96 minute director's cut in two discs, both anamorphically enhanced for HDTVs. Sam Raimi`s \\"Army of Darkness\\" is one of the most brilliant, campy and awesome Horror-comedies that ever got into my personal collection.<br /><br />The film picks up after the events of Evil Dead 2; Ash (Bruce Campbell) is a hapless house wares clerk is time-warped back to the Dark Ages (or Med-Evil times) by the power of the demonic book \\"Necronomicon\\". Now armed only with a `73 Oldsmobile, a chainsaw and a 12-gauge double-barreled S-mart shotgun, our knucklehead hero must battle vicious witches, ghouls, a diabolical doppelganger and the relentless hordes of the evil dead...<br /><br />Raimi's mid-budget, 111 day production time  \\"Army of Darkness\\" exudes pure fun entertainment. The film is absolutely hilarious, and is a successful blend of horror elements and satire. The screenplay is full of gems throughout and the dialogue has that very sharp wit. The film has also given birth to some of the most \\"iconic\\" scenes in cinema. The windmill scene, the bad-azz vs. good-azz sequence, the cemetery when bones abused Ash in a way that the \\"Three Stooges\\" would, acrobatic ghouls that throw punches like Sugar Ray Leonard--the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Accompanied with Raimi's fantastic camerawork which is both inventive and nostalgic, with extreme close-ups and perspective shots that show the stunt-laden scenes, the film is clever and very sharp. The effects in the film is a combination of people in rubber suits, animatronic puppets and stop-motion animation that is definitely campy but none can deny that it fits the film's style--intentionally done with clever \\"cheesiness\\". A pathology professor even asked Raimi if he could use his skeletal shots for his lecture. The set designs and cinematography are also quite fitting to its atmosphere that almost looks like a comic book. (no wonder Raimi was so successful in Spider-man 1 and 2) The Matte paintings and studio sets are so campy that it adds to its own humorous genius.<br /><br />The film is action-packed and full of stunts and explosions. The assault on the castle and the battle between science and magic is so much fun to watch. What is also so clever is that it effectively blends humorous dialogue and the action. While some films use dialogue and camp to delay a film's proceedings, this film definitely uses every bit of its nicely placed humor as character development. Now, the film does have its share of goofs in the screenplay when Ash went to retrieve the Necronomicon, but the film is just so much fun that you'll more than likely to not notice.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell does an outstanding job as with the supporting cast. Campbell is very charismatic as our awkward hero and should be credited with certain unforgettable catch phrases such as \\"Give me some sugar, Baby..\\" and \\"Groovy\\". The dialogue is just brilliant, full of humorous one-liners delivered by Campbell. The guy is definitely the right actor for the job as he does show enough witty attitude to keep the audience entertained. The cast is definitely having fun with this film and I do think there were times that Sam Raimi probably let them loose to act as they wished. Of course, no film of this nature would be complete without a beautiful leading lady. Embeth Davidtz has that classic leading lady look and fit's the role of Sheila.<br /><br />The director's cut has more than 15 minutes of additional footage. The extended cut has subtle bits of added action, dialogue and the famous (or infamous?) alternate apocalyptic ending. The additional scenes can be spotted because the scenes do have more grain than the others. I personally like the director's cut better although the theatrical cut may have more inherent \\"coolness\\" and faster-paced.<br /><br />ARMY OF DARKNESS is one of those films that should be a part of any film fan's movie library.<br />The movie is just so much fun to watch. If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and give it a spin. The film is just loads of fun to watch and has near-infinite replay value.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

0439023483|5.0|The blurb originally piqued my interest for this book and after reading the first chapter through Amazon it was clear to me that it would be very worth while for me to buy it. I live in Australia (where it has not been published yet) and those 2 weeks of waiting for this book really were tough for me.<br /><br />The plot is simple and brutal and really made me feel for the self-sacraficing and authentically careing main character (which is not often for me with girl protagonists) and in more than a few ways reminded me of John Mardsen's books in the Tomorrow Series. However the part of this book that really kept me intrigued was the sadistic 'Game' aspect that allows the readers to really conect with the characters (especially Katiniss) in the feelings towards the Capitol and in turn the need for her to survive... oh and i guess the interest in the relationship with the Bakers Son: Peeta.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins was able to hold my interest throughout the book with the relationships formed and broken as well as the mystery behind the 'Game' in which i could never could quite tell what made so uneasy about it (apart from of course the mallicious nature of forcing children to kill each other for a nation's entertainment). The promise of more books to come is intriguing and i am certain i want to be one of the first to find out what happens next.<br /><br />Like i said before, if you liked John Marsdens, Tomorrow Series mixed in with a little romance and a good handfull of heartache then this is a book you will deffinitely want to check out soon.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I learned alot watching this video. Like how screwed up The United States is when dealing with Health Care. Mr. Moore makes alot of valid points about what is wrong with our Health Care system, and why other countries manage theirs so well. Very enlightening.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I have listened to Enya's Music since Watermark and I love every Album she has come out with. Amarantine is a wonderful piece of Art, making up a new language is the coolest part of this album. Not to be mean to others, but there are wrong when they say that this her worest album yet!!!
0553383663|1.0|There is absolutely no substance, organization, or just plain good writing in this book. I was forced to read it for a book club and it is honestly the worst book I have ever read.  I'm certain the editor didn't even open the book, betting that anything with Google on it would sell. And they were right.    If you are looking for information on Google, look somewhere else.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I have never been one for l*o*n*g board games and was hooked the first time I played this.    Just ordered a bunch to give to family members as an extra Christmas gift.    VERY easy to learn and if you are playing with older players, fast moving.  Younger children seem to get stumped a little faster, where older player begin looking for moves as soon as their last turn is over.  Honestly, one of the funnest games ever!!!
B000AP04FG|2.0|Everyone I talked to seemed to really like this film.  I may be more likely to dislike it because I was so skeptical from the start that I would only watch it when it came on cable.  Overall, the film was boring, not very funny, and even the acting fell flat.    In the end, this represents what I think are actually the worst movies: the lower level of mediocrity.  It wasn't bad enough to make it campy and funny, and it wasn't good enough to truly entertain me.  However, I will give it credit for being better than Crank.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|At first I thought the parts stronger than the sum. In other words, each song had elements that were captivating both lyrically and melodically but the songs as a whole didn't seem to work. Then at some point after repeated listens, everything started to bake into the cake it was meant to be. Now I can't get the damn thing of out the CD player and consequently out of my head. The band is a strange mix of all that has come before it, weather it be CSN, Beach Boys, Appalachia, and even some sort of strange nod to 50's white bread harmonies, a la the Fleetwoods. Whatever it is, it is totally captivating. I love having a favorite CD, and this year it will be Fleet Foxes.
B00005R24K|5.0|In order to enjoy this movie, you simply cannot take it seriously.  If you watch it expecting to be scared or enlightened, you will be severely disappointed.  However, if you're just looking for a brainless good time, you need look no further.  The bad special effects and overdone acting make for a wonderfully campy and hilarious combination.
0143038419|5.0|While this book does sometimes bog down in her descriptions it offers a way of dealing with things that affect many women and their choices/decisions today...I only suggest you don't worry about understanding everything or believing everything she says...the important parts will jump out at you and stay with you.....\\"See, now that's your problem. You're wishin' too much, baby. You gotta stop wearing your wishbone where your backbone oughtta be.\\"  Gotta love Richard from Texas' logic....
B000002O96|5.0|I can't believe how this album could have had any negative reviews on it.  I can't think of another album off the top of my head that has three masters of their genres getting together and jamming.  The people that wrote the negative reviews must have been expecting songs that were written together and rehearsed, but I don't think the project would have worked if they took more than one day.  As legendary as these guys are, we should just be thankful that ego didn't prevent them from getting together just for one day and having a good time jamming.  And that's what this album is: a document of a day that three geniuses got together and had a great time doing what they love, playing the blues.      So no, these songs aren't tightly written and rehearsed.  These songs are somewhat long, freeform jams that these three titans of the blues just got together one day and jammed on with no preparation.  There's \\"hooting and hollaring\\" and joking around, and they're all having a good time and giving each other a good natured ribbing from time to time.  But they seem to still be respectful of each other so no one really seems to try to jump out and steal the show.  Just jamming and having a good time playing the blues like only they know how.  Just understand that, and if you're still interested in hearing what happened that one day that the planets aligned *just right* and got these guys together (despite the well known rivalry between a couple of them), plunk down the roughly seven bucks this gem can be found for.  Its a *steal*!    Oh!  Did I mention Hubert Sumlin (legendary blues guitarist and one of Jimi Hendrix's favorite guitarists) and Otis Spann (legendary blues piano player) are in on this jam session?  C'mon people...  Who's writing a negative review on this?!  Appreciate things for what they are, not what you expect them to be!
B000TM1CL0|5.0|Loved \\"Shark\\"!  CBS--YOU SUCK--not only did you cancel \\"Moonlight\\" you canceled \\"Shark\\".  What were you thinking--never mind, you obviously don't think.    \\"Shark\\" was so entertaining and James Wood made it a hit--he has a strength few actors have and an heir of warmth!  Got bless you James Wood, you are a fantastic actor!!!  The public wants \\"Shark\\" back.  Now CBS has totally bored me by cutting their best--new management is definitely needed there.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Wow... Guitar Solos.. Singing..and Screaming. Not what I expected from a slipknot album. This stuff is way better musically than the old stuff, sorry hardcore fans, but this is much better music!
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow was such a delightful movie.  I've had the movie for years and about every two years I play it again--it's that entertaining.  You would think Hollywood would take the hint and had sequels to this movie.  I feel this way about Clash of the Titans also--still playing it every so often since the 80's!  Anyway, Val Kilmer was great and the little folks stole the show!  We need more--come on Hollywood, start growing some smarts!
B000NJVWUA|5.0|Ammonia Avenue was the Project's seventh studio album. It peaked at #15 on the charts & was the last Project album that cracked the Top 20. It had more charting singles than any other Project album. The songs that charted: \\"You Don't Believe\\" (#54 Hot 100), \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" (#15 Top 200), \\"Don't Answer Me\\" (#15 Hot 100) & \\"Prime Time\\" (#34 Hot 100). Ammonia Avenue could be considered the last album of Parsons early or classic era or it could be considered the transitional album before the late era. It's certainly the dividing line for the Project's impact on album or singles charts. Most of the usual suspects are here as lead vocalists: Eric Woolfson, Lenny Zakatek, Chris Rainbow & Colin Blunstone. surprisingly, there isn't a lead vocal by the bassist, David Paton.    Ammonia Avenue has a lot of good tracks, comes close to being the equal of Eye in the Sky. The album opens with \\"Prime Time\\", a very good song. It was unusual for the Project to open an album with a song that wasn't an instrumental. This changed with Ammonia Avenue. \\"Let Me Go Home\\" is about as close as the Project came to rocking out on a song. It's not what one would call hard rock but for the Project it is. Ian Bairnson provides an excellent solo proving, once again, he's an underrated guitarist. \\"One Good Reason\\" is another very good song. \\"One Good Reason\\" is a song that hints at the future direction the Project would embark upon. \\"Since the Last Goodbye\\" is a nice ballad but it might be the weakest song on the original album. That's not saying it's a bad song, it's not, it's just surrounded by so many good songs. \\"Don't Answer Me\\" has a pop sound, it's typical Parsons but that isn't a bad thing. There's a great sax solo in it performed by Mel Collins. \\"Dancing On a Highwire\\" is an adventurous song. Bairnson performs a very tasteful solo. \\"You Don't Believe\\" is one of the two best songs on the album, it has one of the catchiest choruses I've ever heard. \\"Pipeline\\" is the only instrumental on the original album. It's not the same \\"Pipeline\\" recorded way back in the sixties but Parsons is acknowledging a group that has been largely forgotten. But as far as instrumentals go, this isn't on the level as \\"I Robot\\" or \\"Sirius\\" but it has another great sax solo by Collins. \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" is reminiscent of \\"Silence & I\\" from Eye in the Sky. Woolfson's voice is particularly suited to this type of song.     There are eight bonus tracks included in the remastered version of Ammonia Avenue. There's an early rough mix of \\"Don't Answer Me\\", there's even a false start included at the beginning of the track. Next is the demo version of \\"You Don't Believe\\" that's much shorter than the final version. This version is an instrumental & it would have worked well that way also. \\"Since the Last Goodbye\\" is only 29 seconds long & has only the vocal overdubs by Chris Rainbow. The rough mix of \\"Since the Last Goodbye\\" follows, this version has a guide vocal by Woolfson. This is a case that shows why Rainbow did the vocal for the final version. Woolfson has a fine voice for certain songs but this is a case where it isn't suitable. The next track is an instrumental version of \\"You Don't Believe\\". In the credits it's listed as an instrumental tribute to the Shadows (get it? \\"Pipeline\\"). This is another song that would have worked well as an instrumental. Parsons was never crazy about this version but I found it to be interesting. The next bonus track is \\"Dancing On a Highwire/Spotlight\\" which is listed as a work in progress & this version is definitely that. The vocal is very rough & incomplete, the drumming isn't even on time. There are parts where one can hear voice directions for the musicians. \\"Ammonia Avenue Part\\" is next & is a rough mix with a vocal by Woolfson which wasn't used. On this version Woolfson had yet to complete the lyrics so some of the vocals are only syllable phrasing. This is more typical of songs in their early stages than most people realize. The final bonus track is \\"Ammonia Avenue\\"  that is only orchestral overdubs, kind of like the Naked versions on some of the remastered albums but without the length.    This is one of the Project's three best albums & the remastering is GREAT! The booklet has a lot of information but isn't deep. This one is really worth the money, even the early versions of songs are mostly interesting. I highly recommend that Project fans get this edition. The long wait is over!
0385339100|5.0|I couldn't put the book down once I started reading.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B000NJVWU0|3.0|This rating is for the first nine tracks of the original album.  ***** The Remastering rating is five star, nothing short of excellent.   Eve was the Project's fourth studio album. It peaked at #13 on the charts & had there weren't any charting singles from it. Eve was never an album that impressed me much. Some of this might be that the original concept for the album had to be scrapped & a more general idea used pertaining to the fairer form of the human race.     The album opens in typical fashion with the instrumental \\"Lucifer\\". Unlike many of the Project's previous albums where the opening instrumental jumped out & made you take notice, \\"Lucifer\\" doesn't come close to doing this. The next song, \\"You Lie Down with Dogs\\", is one of the two best songs on the album. It has a definite pop feel to it with a good groove. \\"I'd Rather Be a Man\\" is an average song that opens with programmed synths but never delivers. \\"You Won't Be There\\" is a slow tempo song, Bairnson does provide a melodic lead solo. \\"Winding Me Up\\" is a slight improvement but still nothing more than average. It does a catchy chorus that'll have you singing along but it's, oh, so commercial. \\"Damned If I Do\\" falls into the pop category also but doesn't go anywhere. It does have a driving set of brass & some strings. Bairnson provides us with a solid lead solo. \\"Don't Hold Back\\" follows & is way into the commercial end of things; for the first time we get a female doing a lead vocal on a Project track. By this time I'm disappointed in the album with so many average tracks. What follows is the other good song on the album, \\"Secret Garden\\" which should've been the opening number. David Paton provides an interesting bass riff in this instrumental. \\"If I Could Change Your Mind\\" is the album's closing track. This one also has a female lead vocal but the song is the weakest of the album. Knowing what the album's theme is, this song then is the female's reply to that theme.     The remastering has the album sounding better than before. Eve, to my ears, was the Project's second worst sounding album. Only Pyramid had worse sound dynamics than Eve. The new disc has a total of seven bonus tracks. I was really looking forward to a track entitled \\"The Naked Eve\\" (no joke intended) that had a menagerie of tracks put together like Parsons did for I Robot, Vulture Culture & Eye in the Sky. I feel like Eve has some interesting orchestral & musical themes that could've been explored in this manner.    The first bonus track, \\"Elsie's Theme from the Sicilian Defence (The Project That Never Was)\\" is an unreleased track from a project that Parsons scrapped well before completion. It's a Woolfson composed song that's basically a piano demo. It's pleasant enough but not anything special. There's a demo version of \\"Lucifer\\" that's close to the final version. \\"Secret Garden\\" & \\"Damned If I Do\\" are rough mixes. \\"Don't Hold Back\\" is a rough mix also. Then there's another version of \\"Lucifer\\" that's an early rough mix that's somewhat different than the final version. \\"If I Could Change Your Mind\\" is another rough mix but the lead vocal is buried in the mix; you can hear it but it's not prominent.    Eve definitely has a better sound now but the bonus tracks don't add much enlightenment. The previously unreleased track is a nice bonus. The demos & rough mixes give us an indication of some thought processes behind the music but is the casual fan really interested in that? that's a decision for you to make but just from the standpoint of the remastering I would give a good recommendation.
0452289963|5.0|This is a great book and I highly recomment it.  I read it in one day and gave it to my sister-in-law to read.  She agrees with me that everybody should read this book.
630469654X|5.0|You know that it is a beautifully written movie if it will make a guy tear up, and the main theme song alone does that to me. The story is very personal, meaning that if you have ever been in love, you can relate to any character on the movie. The score for the film is a little dated, but it doesn't stop it from being fantastic. Like I said, it makes me tear up every time I hear the theme. The movie itself is wonderful to look at. The scenery is amazing. Overall, an amazing film.
0802136834|5.0|I found this book enlightening, easy-to-read, and quick to finish. It starts off with Henry as quite the affable young man, and even handsome. He is a catch for any lady, especially Princess Catherine, his first wife, but all of that changes as the years progress and he becomes more and more paranoid. In fact, as the book went on I found myself wondering why no one ever tried to assassinate him. He was a threat to powerful nobles, to his wives, to former friends... I felt terribly sorry for all of his wives, but especially Catherine.
B001C4AFP8|4.0|I found Body of Lies to be in the middle of the pack of all the great Ridley Scott films, but that's not to say it isn't very good, it really is. This is not a movie your going to want to watch more than once or twice, but it's never boring and features some impressive acting performances. Leonardo DiCaprio just gets better and better with age. He was great in The Departed and Blood Diamond, so it's no surprise he turns in yet another layered acting showcase. Russell Crowe dives stomach first into his supporting role with 50 plus pounds of weight gain for the part. You'll love to hate this guy. Mark Strong really caught me off guard. His acting easily measured up to the two headliners.<br /><br />The story jumps all around the world and various countries, but it is never hard to follow. The action scenes are few and far between, but they are realistic and well done.<br /><br />Body of Lies is a smart film that features very good acting and some important issues. If your in the mood to be entertained and think a little at the same time, check it out in theaters. It really is an impressive looking film.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) military/industrial weapons mogul just finished demonstrating his newest rocket in the Middle East, when he is purloined by ruthless locals with dirty faces and a penchant for power. Who could be behind the dastardly deed? Of course everyone knows it is the last person you would suspect as in any good mystery.<br /><br />Well as luck would have it, in Starks efforts to escape he invents the fundamental technology for, you guessed it, Ironman. In the process he inadvertently gives the world a new weapon. How can he correct his faux pax?<br /><br />In his quest for the answers he solicits the help of his very efficient and devoted assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow.)<br /><br />For those enthralled in the Ironman comics, nothing has changed; except maybe the storyline. O.K the era in which how superhero exists. Well maybe a tad more gratuities sex. O.K. I guess I could go on for a few more paragraphs but you get the picture that we can not rely on the comic book character to be anymore than an inspiration for this movie.<br /><br />For people that are more music orientated, among the popular background songs they included the original theme from the animated series.<br /><br />It has all the formula and characters for today's super hero movies. By not making it a period piece we get to incorporate all the latest technology and social attitudes.<br /><br />Only saw the Blu-Ray version. Had the standard extras and flexibility. I am pretty sure future versions will add more insight or at least more footage.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0006IIPIK Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005OCMR Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000OPPBEQ The Ultimate Matrix Collection [Blu-ray]]]
B000002MUW|4.0|Most of the songs are good, a few of them [survival, secret, human nature, and take a bow] are just excellent!  However, there are a few songs that are just filler songs, something to make a complete CD.  Take a bow is a really sad song and it is good. It is the last song so don't skip over it by mistake or you will miss out.  The rest of the good or excellent songs, you better be ready to dance when you listen.     Even the album cover is quite nice, adding to the overall product quality. Many photos and lyrics in the inlay booklet.     Seems there are many copies for less tha $1. Even with S&H, this CD is well worth it. Don't forgo this one. You won't be disappointed.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I like Bob Dylan's music somewhat, but I would be far from being a real fan.  I also understand his general place in pop culture and the history of music.  So I decided to watch this.    I am so happy I did, it is an incredible movie down by Scorsese.  Many things I did not know (though fans may have already known) and it was put together beautifully.      An engaging look at the man and the legend surrounding him during a time I did not know much about.    Highly recommended for any music fan.
0345501292|4.0|THE COMPLETE MAKING OF INDIANA JONES is a marvelous, in-depth, well-illustrated guide to the four movies featuring everyone's favorite action-adventure hero. The cover of the book modestly proclaims it to be \\"the definitive story behind all four films.\\" I don't know I agree with that statement but J. W. Rinzler and Laurent Bouzerea's book certainly sets a standard for future volumes on moviemaking.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the book is brimming with photos, artwork, storyboards, etc. that give the reader an unparalleled look at the four films. Likewise the behind-the-camera material gives one an education in why and how movies are made. And all for only $35.00.<br /><br />Having said that, I'd like to throw out the following for what they're worth. As the book progressed, I got a feeling that the narrative was rushed. The coverage given Indy II, III and IV seemed more and more perfunctory. Also, I wondered about the book being a Lucasfilm production. According to the book: (1) everyone loved everyone else on all four films; (2) Steven Spielberg is just about the greatest thing since sliced bread; (3) things like egos, temper tantrums, etc. never intruded in the Indiana Jones film-making; etc. Maybe I'm being cynical but things seemed sanitized(?). Finally, after finishing the book, I still haven't a clue what the authors FELT about the films. They briefly summarize box office and critical reactions but you never find out if, for example, they loved Indy I, were disappointed by Indy II's shallowness and shrillness, felt Sean Connery deserved an Oscar for his ABSOLUTELY CHARMING turn in Indy III, etc. But then, if Lucasfilm is paying the check...<br /><br />In any case, Indiana Jones' fans will want to add this book to their collection. Whatever my reservations, it's a great piece of work on some of the most entertaining - and profitable - films made in the past three decades. Recommended.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|yes jessica alba is half naked in this movie but that is not the only reason why its a good movie.  there is suspense and action but never to the point of a \\"diehard\\" movie.  other than the fact that paul walker can hold his breathe for ten minutes the movie is not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Jim Sheridan has been called as a master storyteller, most popular for his direction of critically-lauded films such as \\"My Left Foot\\" and \\"In The Name of the Father\\" and his latest effort is no exception.  \\"In America\\" tells a very personal story, one that is loosely based on Sheridan's own family.  With a script co-written by his daughters Kirsten and Naomi, \\"In America\\" is a semi-autobiographical film that will incite joy, sadness, heartache and hope a hundred times over.<br /><br />The film tells the story of an Irish family moving to America for a clean slate after the death of their son Frankie.  Due to their limited means, they rent an apartment in the heart of Hell's Kitchen, the building a refuge for prostitution, drug trafficking and just plain strange denizens and happenings.  Johnny (Considine) is an aspiring actor but he can't seem to muster the feeling he needs to nail down a part - his emotional core has been numbed by Frankie's passing and it affects his ability to keep a job as well as his relationship with his wife Sarah (Morton) and their two daughters.  Everyone deals with their pain in their own way - Christy (Sarah Bolger) makes new memories among the old with her cherished camcorder and has one-way conversations with her brother to ease the pain of his absence.  Johnny chooses not to feel anything while Sarah puts on a brave face even though she is dying inside.  What no one expects to deal with is the arrival of yet another child, one that endangers Sarah's life.  Johnny beseeches her to sacrifice the baby for their well-being, not wanting their family to deal with another tragedy whilst Sarah is instantly attached to the new life inside of her, seeing it as the potential for the healing they all so desperately need.<br /><br />While they toil with their new way of life and the great change to come about it with the birth of a fourth child, Christy and her younger sister Ariel (Emma Bolger) go knocking about the building on Halloween and one of their strangest and most intimidating neighbors named Mateo (Hounsou) opens the door to them, much to their surprise.  They hold their breath as Mateo stares them down, not knowing what to make of him after having heard his agonizing screams behind his closed door the very day they moved in, the words \\"KEEP OUT\\" emblazoned in large hand-painted letters.  Instead, he is instantly charmed by Ariel's gregarious and boisterous nature and invites them in.  It is the start of a dynamic and beautiful friendship for all involved, one that makes them realize that tragedy travels in large circles and cannot be avoided no matter how far they move to escape it.  In the end, everyone learns to face their grief head on, their lives fresh with emotional wounds but also the wherewithal to remedy them.<br /><br />\\"In America\\" contains bravado performances from every actor in its small and intimate cast.  Morton and Considine are quiet powerhouses, both of them flexing a dramatic muscle that needs no performance enhancement.  Hounsou doles a memorable turn as well as the tortured Mateo, a man who finds himself sustained by the strong and vibrant lifeforce of Johnny's family while his own ebbs away.  Sarah and Emma Bolger, real-life siblings, are the genuine article of child actors - nothing they give feels forced and that can be attributed to their natural abilities as well as Sheridan's superb direction.<br /><br />Hell's Kitchen is depicted much as Sheridan himself lived it, warts and all, the family's apartment one of the worst ever seen.  Of particular delight is Johnny's trek across several city blocks with an air conditioning unit to combat the sweltering summer temperatures, only to short circuit the entire building the moment he plugs it in.  Sheridan's small cast of characters is beautifully depicted as being poor in capital but rich in spirit.<br /><br />Bottom line: One of the best films you've never watched, \\"In America\\" will bring a tear to your eye and a warmth to your heart unlike any drama out there.  It is proof that a film's personal touches are what successfully manage to touch someone personally.It is proof that a film's personal touches are what successfully manage to touch someone personally.
B0012Q732O|3.0|dub the language, install subtitles but do not make people sit through this crap.  the conversations in this movie had \\"gooder\\" vocab skills than myself.  raise the rating, lose the talk, lose the clothes, up the violence and call me back.  only the mammoths get three stars!!!!
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|First of, I haven't read the book. So you won't be seeing me complaining about the differences between the two.    Boleyn Girl is a pretty movie. From the actors, to the setting and the cinematography, everything is put together in a way that pleases the eye.  But aesthetics isn't quite enough, and it doesn't make up for blatant flaws like the bad accents, the over the top story that resembles a soap opera and the script that manages to be uninteresting although dealing with a subject that can appeal to most audiences: two sisters on luxurious dresses and living in a castle fight for the same man, who happens to be a king. Deny it if you will, but everyone loves a little intrigue and cat fight especially if it comes from the absurdly beautiful main actresses.     Speaking of which, they both use to full extent their amazing acting skills, although not at all times. Portman manages to be stunning while acting alongside with Scarlett, which is quite an accomplish on her side.     Overall, the movie has a flawed script that isn't made up by the talented main actresses or the beauty of the movie itself. What amazes me about it is not what it is, but what could have been. With such a cast and story, it could have easily become one of the best period movie of the last few years. It didn't.     Too bad.

B000E6G4VY|4.0|These Stones role doobies! This album should suck, and for the longest time, I thought I did. Ah, but I learned my lesson. For those who honestly don't know, this is the group's psychedelic album. A lot of people view it as a cheap shot at Sgt. Pepper, but that's pretty far from the truth. To me, it sounds like the Stones just took a bunch of everything that was going on in '67 and mashed it together in a big melting pot.<br /><br />So you've got your loud, fantastically catchy acid-rock a la Jimi Hendrix (\\"Citadel\\"), your universalist marching band anthems a la just about everyone back then (\\"Sing This Song Together\\"), your creepy, dissonant space freakouts a la Pink Floyd (\\"2000 Light Years from Home\\"), some druggy folk a la Traffic (\\"The Lantern,\\" \\"2000 Man\\"), and even some world music inspired jamming a la nobody else at the time (\\"Gomper,\\" \\"Sing This Song Together (See What Happens)\\". For fear of being hated by everyone, I am going to come out right now and say I like all of \\"Sing This Song Together (See What Happens)\\". It's unlike anything else you'll ever hear - a chaotic combination of free jazz and world music, with a \\"sex part\\" thrown in just for good measure. Even the album's defenders tend to crap all over it, but I think it's a really enjoyable, if odd, jam.<br /><br />Actually, I pretty much enjoy every song on this album. Only two are true classics, and \\"On with the Show\\" is a pathetic attempt to send us all home laughing. And it's not like this can compete with Are You Experienced? or Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. But it's cool! \\"The Lantern\\" is one of the grooviest things in history, with rumbling piano and blues guitar licks. Bill Wyman's \\"In Another Land,\\" with hazy \\"underwater\\" vocals and a catchy harpsichord line, must be about an acid trip or something. And it is quite good! \\"Gomper\\" proves that no Brit could play bizarre instruments like Brian Jones.<br /><br />\\"2000 Light Years from Home\\" is my favorite. The mellotron is so spooky! The rumbling bass vamp is so cool! And the piano-bashing intro rules! And despite its uncanny similarity to the Beatles, \\"She's a Rainbow\\" is a fantastic little pop song, with a brilliant string arrangement from future Zeppelin member John Paul Jones.<br /><br /> This album shouldn't work at all, but it does. It does very well. Why? Because the early Rolling Stones could do anything, that's why. Oh, and you know why record companies suck? I'll tell you why. The trippy, brass-and-harmony fortified \\"We Love You\\" and the gently psychedelic \\"Dandelion\\" somehow missed the final cut on this album! They're both great songs, but they were only put out as a single. Why? I'm just guessing it has something to do with those stupid UK single separated from album practices, practices that make no sense to me.is so cool! And the piano-bashing intro rules!

B000XCZGVI|5.0|[[ASIN:B000XCZGVI Zodiac (Two-Disc Director's Cut) [HD DVD]]]    This review refers to HD-DVD 2-disc edition set. Movie is sort of documentary type trying to accurately portray Zodiac killings from late '60s. It is pretty long at 2:42 minutes and somewhat boring. Killings occur within first hour while speculation and bogus theories continue until the end. Movie is based on the book Zodiac written by Robert Graysmith, cartoonist who worked at the time of killings at SF Chronicle newspaper. His findings about Zodiac are completely bogus pointing into wrong direction. After his book was published, police compared handwriting, DNA sample and fingerprints with Graysmith's main suspect Arthur Leigh Allen and conclusively find that he wasn't Zodiac.    Regardless of Graysmith's hallucinations, Fincher's movie is really good. Excellent directing not leaving a single detail untouched with gorgeous HD picture and very nice special effects that brought 70's back to the screen in fullest are worth watching. Thanks to being based on poorly written book I wouldn't give this movie more than 3 stars but the second disc with 3 and a half hours of extras including interviews with two survivors of Zodiac killings and other real life participants make this set superb recap of Zodiac killings worth watching for everyone interested in serial killers. That is why I gave 5 stars to this movie.    What people more want to know is who really Zodiac was. There hasn't been offered a single valid theory that would explain his killings and the man behind them. Only four killings were officially assigned as Zodiac's while the rest are unconfirmed.    1. David Arthur Faraday, 17, and Betty Lou Jensen, 16: Shot and killed on December 20, 1968, on Lake Herman Road just within the city limits of Benicia.    2. Michael Renault Mageau, 19, and Darlene Elizabeth Ferrin, 22: Shot on July 4, 1969, at the Blue Rock Springs Golf Course parking lot on the outskirts of Vallejo; Darlene was DOA at Kaiser Foundation Hospital, while Michael survived.    3. Bryan Calvin Hartnell, 20, and Cecelia Ann Shepard, 22: Stabbed on September 27, 1969 at Lake Berryessa in Napa County. Hartnell survived six stab wounds to the back, but Shepard died of her injuries two days later.    4. Paul Lee Stine, 29: Shot and killed on October 11, 1969, in Presidio Heights in San Francisco.    The key of finding Zodiac is the fourth killing where pattern of killing love couples in rural areas around San Francisco has been broken. I made some research and find out that fourth killing occurred exactly one year after shooting and killing of Michael Bunch, 19-year-old anti-war serviceman while trying to escape Presidio military base. He was confined for being AWOL and imprisoned together with other anti-war servicemen. It is strange that no one noticed this detail. Who is the killer and why?    Killer called himself Zodiac which is a circular or elliptical diagram representing this belt, and usually containing pictures of the animals, human figures, etc., that are associated with the constellations and signs. Duration of one cycle is one year and if you check out his killings you will see that all of them happened between October 11th, 1968 and October 11th, 1969. Motive is most obviously revenge for Bunch's killing and culprit according to Zodiac is society itself. He is most likely left-wing anti-war radical who wanted to change society by killings and terror. From details released by the police he was a GI probably working at Presidio or other military base. The best search for him would be to question all anti-war GIs stationed in San Francisco at that time, particularly group known as Nine4Peace that used to protest by chaining themselves to priests in churches in San Francisco Area in July of 1968.    Sign used by Zodiac is actually Celtic cross which might explain why he used it if we know that GIs protested at churches. It has nothing to do with Zodiac brand of watches and represents sun cross. Zodiac was clearly inspired by religion and mythology in his first deciphered letter when he mentioned his victims becoming his slaves to serve him in paradise. The most difficult part is how did he choose his killing dates? These dates actually reveal true message of Zodiac while cyphered letters were just a decoy.    Zodiac message is Nine4Justice Presidio. First killings were under Sagittarius which is ninth sign of Zodiac, second one were under Cancer which is fourth sign of Zodiac, third one were under Libra which is number seven but stands for justice and final killing was on the anniversary of killing of Michael Bunch. It happened on Presidio Heights and then after killing he went straight to Presidio military base.    If you examine mythology of these astral signs you can find out that Sagittarius is associated with Satyr who represents sex drive. That's why he killed love couples in the first place. Cancer is associated with hydra which represents corrupt society that needs to be cut and sealed by fire to prevent it from further corruption. That's why he kills not talk or try to convince others in his ideas. Libra as already mentioned represents justice. Some also wondered about why Zodiac uses two stamps. All numbers divided by 2 are called even. Since he is done all those killings as a revenge to get EVEN for killing of Michael Bunch then it makes perfect sense to use two stamps to point this out.    I intentionally wrote this review on 40th anniversary of killing of Michael Bunch that started Zodiac killings. I sincerely hope that he will be caught or if dead, his identity revealed to bring back some peace to the victims of his gruesome killings.
B001FEA9QU|2.0|With the current crop of musicians pulling off tens of riffs in a song, Metallica is content to give you a few over and over and they stretch it out over eight minutes.  Only a select few moments hark back to old day albums.  I wanted them to pull it out and thrive, but this product is so lackluster that this is the last time I will ever actively seek out this band.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|this is a great movie. the power of greed is exposed for the destroying machine that it is. upton sinclair would be proud. daniel day-lewis lies and cheats and drinks and kills everything that he touches because he is empty inside and no amount of money can fill the void where his soul should be. this is a magnificently powerful film that compromises nothing and is an essential portrayal of the history of America. you won't be disappointed. the power of unbridled greed and its inherent evil has never been portrayed better.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Totally absorbing, consuming and full of visual candy of all sorts. This show is a symphony of perfect pitch in every sense.

B001C08RHA|4.0|I've heard both good and not so great comments about Iron Man. Let me toss in mine. Tony Stark is a Mcgyverish, haunted James Bond. If you can picture that blend, great, if not, think highly intelligent and handy with whatever is lying around playboy who has a bit of a heart change after facing death and barely cheating it.<br /><br />From a female point of view, the machines, effects and equipment were cool and not overly technical to the point I lost interest. Techie geeks may have issues with the details, so read a techie focused review if you fit that category. The film clipped along at a fast, tense pace. Plenty of humor, a little love, sarcasm and some skin are tossed in.<br /><br />The language is pretty clean. I either missed some or was caught up enough into the story that it didn't grate against my ears. Downey plays an anti/super-hero like he was born to play it. The film felt comic booky with sharp visuals and colors, and should appeal to the lovers of the comic book films. Bridges gets kudos for his portrayal, as well.<br /><br />Sensitive parents may want to take note of the playboy Stark who has a quick, not too subtle romp with a female reporter. Iron Man is not as squeaky clean as the traditional superhero films (think Peter Parker). Violence isn't gory as much as shoot-em-up. Kids in danger might be frightening for some children and a scene in the car with soldiers is sad and might bother some who have soldiers currently serving.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|This is a good album.The guitars are great, the drumming good, the vocals ok but not were they once were. BUT, where is the bass guitar hiding? It sounds like a 90s alternative album. They need the heavy riffing of Burton or at least Newstead and this would have been a great album. So the production decision making is poor, as a fine album gets derailed and comes off as \\"Alternica\\". Bring back the heavy bass guitar riffs and you will get some serious respect, if not they will still make money but be an \\"also ran\\" group. Compare the riffs of this with thier Ride the Lightning album (especially For whom the Bell Tolls) and you can hear the massive difference the bass is making.
B0017I1FNK|4.0|This is a geat albumn.  Does tend to be on the sad side as far as song content.  Emmylou does a wonderful rendition of Merle Haggard's Kern River.  Overall, I am enjoying the music and, as always, Emmylou's voice reaches to my soul.    KMccall
B0018OAPAW|5.0|I've been listening to The Offspring all my life. Ever since Smash, I have been a fan. While Conspiracy Of One and Splinter were decent, they weren't quite up to par with the Offspring I had come to know. This marks a major return to themselves. With songs like \\"Trust In You\\" and \\"Hammerhead\\" harkening back to the raw days of Ixnay and Smash, and \\"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\\" and \\"Stuff Is Messed Up\\" sounding like the more playful album Americana, the album still shows progress in a new direction. \\"Half-Truism\\", \\"Nothingtown\\", and \\"Takes Me Nowhere\\" showing a newer, cleaner, sound. \\"Let's Hear It For Rock Bottom\\" shows the influence of the ska-punk band, The Police, in The Offspring.    The album also shows signs of more mature music in songs like \\"Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?\\" and \\"Fix You\\". They sound more like alternative hits than the punk we've come to know. While they aren't bad, they are strange, but the quality of the rest of the album well makes up for these two misplaced tracks.    This leaves two tracks unmentioned. \\"A Lot Like Me\\" and \\"Rise And Fall\\". Both are decent songs, but you can't help but hearing Linkin Park and Green Day sounds in the songs, respectively.    While there are a few weak points, for the most part, the album is amazing, and is another solid Offspring release.
0575081406|5.0|He's a humble inn-keeper--despite his red hair. Or so he tells the world. But Chronicler knows better. Kote was once Kvothe, a mage and hero. With monsters on the prowl again, the world may need Kvote the hero rather than Kote the innkeeper. But first, he's got to awaken himself--and maybe telling his history is a good start. The bulk of the story in THE NAME OF THE WIND is just that--Kote recalling his life for Chronicler.<br /><br />Kvothe has had an interesting life--starting with his childhood in an acting troop, his studies under a mage, the destruction of his dreams by forces supposedly out of fairy tales, his living on the streets of Tarbean, and finally his attempt to gain admission and success at the University and its famous archives.<br /><br />Author Patrick Rothfuss delivers really strong world-building and a fascinating story of a young man's attempts to survive and to find his place in the world. With a full range of mythology, a host of monstrous creatures, plenty of plants that pay off through the story, and a consistent magic system, I had a hard time doing anything but read this story.<br /><br />Although THE NAME OF THE WIND makes fascinating reading, in many ways it feels like a prequel. We know that Kvothe is the Kingkiller, but we don't actually get to see him deal with any kings. That, perhaps, is reserved for the follow-up volume. Also, although telling the story from the standpoint of the older and more cynical adult Kvothe adds poignancy and sets up a powerful scene at the end, I really wanted to know more about why we needed the hero Kvothe back--and why he refuses to emerge from the shell he's created for himself. Finally, while Rothfuss did an excellent job with his male characters, his female characters seem one-dimensional.<br /><br />I'm amazed that Rothfuss was able to pull off such a complex and compelling piece of story-telling in his first novel. I'll definitely be looking for the sequel--with the confident hope that it'll provide a great payoff for all of the (wonderfully written) setup through THE NAME OF THE WIND.(wonderfully written) setup through THE NAME OF THE WIND.
B0018M6J90|4.0|Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) has hit rock bottom.  She has lost her job, has no home, money, or food.  Things are tight in London in the 30's so she has to stoop to a little subterfuge in order to become social secretary to American actress wannabe Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams).  As a vicar's daughter, Miss Pettigrew is totally unprepared for the world that she is entering as Delysia tries to balance her relationship with three different men.  Miss Pettigrew chooses her favorite suitor among the three and tries to influence Delysia to look for love, not money or fame.  Meanwhile a friend of Delysia's tries to blackmail Miss Pettigrew into talking her ex-fiance, Joe, into reconciling with her.  When Miss Pettigrew talks to Joe, the results are not quite what the friend had in mind.    This is a delightful movie with great costumes and music which are reminiscent of the 30's.  Remembering back to Frances McDormand's wonderful performance as the hardy North Dakota policewoman in \\"Fargo\\" and then seeing her as the proper vicar's daughter with a perfect English accent shows what great range this delightful actress has.

006082543X|4.0|Upon moving into her new home, inquisitive young Coraline finds more than just eccentric neighbors and a lot of new places to explore....She finds a mysterious door, with a bricked-up passageway to the empty apartment next door behind it.      But it's only a bricked-up passageway sometimes......     Other times, it leads to a bizarre mirror-image of her new home, complete with \\"Others\\".. ...perfect duplicates of her real parents and neighbors....except for the long, sharp fingernails, and the black buttons sewn in place of their eyes......And they don't want Coraline to leave. They want her to stay with them, forever......Forever and ever and ever.     CORALINE is the new graphic novel adaptation of the Neil Gaiman novel of the same name, adapted and illustrated by the legendary P. Craig Russell. Russell has collaborated with Gaiman on four other projects before CORALINE, and his art is a perfect fit for this story. He can do mundane details of everyday life every bit as well as he can portray the more fantastic elements of the often-disturbing tale. The thing that struck me most while reading the book was how much Coraline herself looks like a real little girl. As an avid comic-book fan, I can tell you with some degree of certainty that 99% of comic artists can't draw a realistic-looking child to save their life. They usually look like shrunken adults, or oddly-formed midgets. Coraline not only looks right, but Russel also gives her all the quirks and tics a restless young girl would have in real-life. Just check out page 49, where Coraline is standing on one leg, holding the other leg up behind her....Brilliant little touches like that are everywhere, and the story is much richer for them. Gaiman's story itself is, ostensibly, for children, but it's works equally as well for adults. It's truly a timeless, ageless piece that could be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates a nice, dark bedtime story.  Highly recommended, especially for Gaiman fans who may not have dipped their feet into the world of comic-books yet.
B000065AU2|5.0|Accept was a German metal band that sounded like a cross between Judas Priest and AC/DC with a troll as lead singer who resembled an over-the-top mesh of Bon Scott and Brian Johnson.<br /><br />Accept released ten studio albums during their career; most cite \\"Restless & Wild\\" (1983) and \\"Balls to the Wall\\" (1984) as their best recordings. This is true but I feel 1986's \\"Russian Roulette\\" stands on a par with these two earlier releases.<br /><br />Here's a run down of the songs on \\"Russian Roulette:\\"<br /><br />1.) T.V. WAR (3/5 Stars): This is an energetic and fun metal rocker reminiscent of \\"Fast as a Shark\\" but not as good.<br /><br />2.) MONSTERMAN (5/5 Stars): \\"Monsterman\\" is brief at a mere 3:24, but it's catchy as heck. The bridge is melodically potent and the chorus is uniquely inspired. You'll never hear anything else like it. Who knows what the lyrics are about, who cares?<br /><br />3.) RUSSIAN ROULETTE (4/5 Stars): The titular song eerily starts off with a militaristic drone and riff before kicking into a mid-paced slice of 80's non-hair-band metal. In light of the chorus one wonders why they didn't call the song \\"Wargames.\\"<br /><br />4.) IT'S HARD TO FIND A WAY (4.5/5 Stars): This is a catchy pop rocker with an incredibly hook-laden chorus. It should have been a hit on the radio. Some cried \\"Sell out!\\" but, come on, it's just ONE song.<br /><br />5.) AIMING HIGH (3/5 Stars): This isn't a bad piece of filler between the better songs.<br /><br />6.) HEAVEN IS HELL (5/5 Stars): This is the second masterpiece of the album. It's structure is very reminiscent of \\"Balls to the Wall,\\" although it doesn't sound like that song. The lyrics are an intriguing commentary on religion and religious people with the conclusion that we experience (or make our own) heaven or hell during our life on this earth. I strongly agree with some of their points and disagree with others but, regardless, the lyrics are not presented in an offensive way. Here's one stanza that I wholeheartedly agree with:<br /><br />I'm sure we all know them<br />Those perverts, they're everywhere<br />Mmm, we're talking straight about facts<br />You know deep inside what's right or wrong<br />And the world stinks, and the paradise is now a sewer<br />And they sell sh*t for gold<br />And you have to take what you've got<br /><br />As you can see the words are honest, overt, slightly ambiguous and completely brilliant all at the same time.<br /><br />7.) ANOTHER SECOND TO BE (3/5 Stars): Another brief enjoyable ditty.<br /><br />8.) WALKING IN THE SHADOW (4/5 Stars): Emotionally potent and intriguing tune that deals with a person struggling to live on in face of the 58,000 that died during the Vietnam conflict. Whether the guilt is over one combat victim or all 58,000 is unclear.<br /><br />9.) MAN ENOUGH TO CRY (4.5/5 Stars): Great short piece! The title somewhat reveals the mature subject matter, but the lyrics maintain an esoteric element.<br /><br />10.) STAND TIGHT (5/5 Stars): This is a creative and aggressive number with a melodic bridge and ultra-catchy chorus with cool backgound vocals. It has militaristic vibe and is the third masterpiece of the album.<br /><br />Some have criticized that Accept were trying to go pop rock on this album but nothing could be further from the truth. \\"Russian Roulette\\" features the same diverse song-writing of both \\"Restless & Wild\\" and \\"Balls to the Wall.\\" Yeah, one or two songs would've fit well on the radio, so what?<br /><br />One thing this CD proves is that Accept had perhaps the best background vocals in all of metal at the time and even to this day (!).<br /><br />\\"Russian Roulette\\" is quite a bit better than the good-but-not-great \\"Metal Heart,\\" which was released in 1985. The song-writing on \\"Metal Heart\\" just wasn't as good, plus Udo (the singer) went overkill with his irritating screaming, which no doubt turned off potential life-long fans. In addition, as another reviewer rightly points out, by 1986 Accept's style of metal had passed its expiration date; more extreme forms of the genre had usurped the hearts of fans. Don't get me wrong, Accept were excellent at what they did, but they refused to deviate from their basic style (nothing wrong with that -- \\"to thine own self be true\\"). Hence, when \\"Russian Roulette\\" was released the next year not many took notice. They should have.ere excellent at what they did, but they refused to deviate from their basic style (nothing wrong with that -- \\"to thine own self be true\\"). Hence, when \\"Russian Roulette\\" was released the next year not many took notice. They should have.

I'd seen every one of his films before this (except for the latest Batman) and thought I had witnessed his best performances but no - this is his greatest.  I am a complete and total CB fan.  I hate movies like Batman and The Terminator, but I will see them now because I want to make certain I don't miss one of his performances.  I hope he gets all the perks he deserves for working so darned hard.  The talent, the dedication he brings to his work are phenomenal.  I'm in awe.

1582701709|2.0|A friend of mine bought me this book for my birthday, explaining that it was a best selling spiritual read, so I was looking forward to what it had to say. I can honestly say I was unimpressed from the start. There was this build to this huge life changing 'secret' and it was like waiting for a huge explosion that never actually went off.    This whole Secret is based on wishful, dillusional thnking. It claims that if you want to have money, believe that you will have money and it will come to you. If you want to lose weight, believe that you're losing weight and it will happen. It rarely ever mentions that you have to put work in for these things to happen. In a good way this book does allow people to focus on what they want in life and to focus on the positive, but having a good life, having money and having good relationships requires some work on our part, not just repeating something in our heads and hoping the Universe will deliver. That's just lazy thinking. I gained a lot more from listening to Anthony Robbins CD's then I did from this book. And yes, I'm aware that he's in it for the money too.    This book also spent a lot of time advertising the film version, so there are a lot of people making getting rich from this book. Unfortunately it won't be the readers.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|...through my whole analysis of Slipknot this was the album I was most curious about...most of the fans stated that this was the album that Slipknot \\"sold out\\" on and I'm aware of many bands that have sold out...they abandon their old ideas and move on to something more mainstream to please the crowd...in my opinion Slipknot needed a change...their work was ok but seemed to become repetitive and sloppy after over playing the downtuned guitar riffs and very quick power chords...young naieve people would love it...but a change was needed...    ...and so we have their 3rd album...and of course to music it brings nothing new...but to Slipknot's formula it definetely adds more of a variation...    Prelude 8/10: Is this possibly another short intro track? It seems that way at first with random sounds...but of course it turns into a nice eerie ACCOUSTIC guitar riff...Corey's singing sounds very dark and muffled which is a nice change...the whole song starts slow and depressing and I like the mood they create with it...no random \\"I'm going in full blast it would be ever so polite if you listen\\" the whole track progresses...even the guitars...I'm proud to say that it seems like Slipknot's music is maturing...    The Blister Exists 7/10: Returning to their old style of \\"I'm going in full blast it would be ever so polite if you listen\\" yet again...a 2 note guitar riff with Corey shouting annoyingly...his lyrical themes are more bareable this time round which is very very good to hear...but besides that it seems like they're just doing what they've already done...going head first into a riff completely saved by the astounding drumming...on the plus side they do add some nice guitar fills...there's also some nice military like drumming in the middle...    Three Nil 7/10: Another one...yet again repetitive at the very beginning with really annoying low riffs (not downtuned this time though)...they have two guitarists and yet most of the time they both play the exact same thing inthis song...it's somewhat irritating to see Mick and Jim wasted that way...they seem to have more control in tempo this time though...random bleepy noises (Mr. Gasmask) are present...Corey talks annoyingly...he didn't mean to leave the stain right here...    Duality ?/10: I can't give this a rating due to when I was 14 seeing the video and being instantly disgusted that I changed the channel as soon as I saw Corey's mask assuming he took it from a corpse for some pathetic reason...now the song is average...Corey talks a lot and the guitars go from quick alternate picking to kind of powerchord to whiney high pitched note...it goes on like this and carries on the trend in the break...nothing particularly interesting but it's a single from a mainstream band...what do you expect?    Opium of the people 8/10: Starts with some high pitched guitars which are pretty impressive change...but yet again I can see the comparison from Converge's \\"Saddest Day\\" main guitar riff...the melody in the chorus is surprisingly well constructed with the guitars going down a scale...overall this song is very well thought out and I'm surprised...their musicianship has vastly improved...I don't even care about the overuse of the downtuned low riff as they have shoved more variety in SEE SLIPKNOT!! Variety is good...    Circle 8/10: Starts off with random noise and turns into some nice accoustic music that is rather bass dominant...WELL DONE BASS!!! Corey's voice comes in quite nicely if a tad mainstream and simple...but oh well...you can't have it perfect...uses some string instruments such as violins which is also a nice change...I like that they're adding more variety now because most of the time when bands do that they seem to fall smack on their face (poor poor Muse)...they also add another drum track over it...very very nice...    Welcome 7/10: Heavy heavy heavy random low riffs...good drums...annoying talky shouty vocals...yada yada yada...nothing new...for those slipknot fans that like mindless and pointless songs...WAIT!!! Is that? A GUITAR SOLO OF INTERSTING DEGREE!!!? They actually had a guitar solo...oh they're so getting a 7 out of 10 for that...    Vermillion 9/10: To all the harcore old slipknot fans that hate this song...why? I like the atmosphere it creates and the guitar progression is very good...the lyrics are metaphorical...the drums aren't half sloppy either...do you hate it because it sounds more emo? Are you an emophobe? Oh you poor poor people are missing out on alot...the solo here is also average but works well...listen to it and ignore all those fans that say \\"That's not slipknot...where am I? WHO AM I!!? I'm a maggot blah blah blah\\"...because they're wrong...you should decide whether this song is good or bad...    Pulse of the Maggots 9/10: Starts with a weird siren and Corey saying some \\"Life and society hates you somehow don't make me explain it\\" stuff until it turns into a song of some sort...the guitars go from a synchopated rhythm to a very zig zaggy riff...you'd think this is all to it but no...guess what? Yes...another solo...this time though it's much more interesting...it's nothing not done before (if you're new to music think of raining blood solo because you've heard nothing else have you not?) but yes...it's a nice combo...and that's why it gets...a 9...just wish corey was more intelligent in his anti political ramblings because I know he's clever...    Before I forget 8/10: Yes the one off guitar hero...no the bridge isn't that hard to play in real life it was drastically exagerated....the song consists of the same downtuned riff combined with fast power chords in the verse...a few whiney notes...the drumming is very impressive in this track and so is the bridge to this song for the melodic instruments as the descending minor scale was a nice modulation to make...and when Corey tries to sing and the bass comes in it's a very strong harmony...but of course they end with the riff in section A...I wish they'd end with harmony more often...they're very good when they do...    Vermillion pt 2 10/10: Yeah that's right...a 10 for the accoustic song...you know why? Because it's different and more subtle to everything else they've done...oh I bet the gasmask man was so bored during this song...it's a nice resolve to the first Vermillion and...it's just fantastically rich as a melody...I don't like stone sour because they're really shallow...far too shallow to even give a try...but I like this song...maybe I just have too many emo tendencies...but yeah the lyrics are still kind of cheesy in this song...    Nameless 10/10: Another song that I really felt clicked with me...a somewhat technical part with Corey talking in a kind of annoyed voice...but they somehow transend into this beautiful melodic section which gives this song another layer...like someone with split personalities going in and out of his darkness into a melancholic happiness...the two pulses of the separate sections gradually combine together to fit the puzzle together...however...I only like this song because I'm open minded with combining melody with heaviness...if you like your heaviness separate you may hate this...    Virus of life 8/10: Starts off with some nice awkward percussion...the bass enters with Corey whispering...it then starts to build up some power chords...Corey tries to sound like he's ill but I see through it (Sopor Aeternus does it so much better)...he says wait no randomly...yada yada yada...it's a nice creepy song but because I've heard people do it better it's just not interesting enough for me...at least they try though...that's why they get an 8...    Danger-Keep Away 8/10: And so the album ends here...some nice calm guitar sounds with corey slowly breathing his voice...a random woman singing is added...and corey now sings in a nice calm sing song way...the guitars are added for a nice accoustic affect...unfortunately I'm reminded of Stone Sour in this track...to whom I dislike quite alot...but as far as an ending goes it's the second best so far...below Scissors and above IOWA (that mess of 15 minutes)...    Overall:    Drumming: Heard less of but what I did hear was amazing...    Bass: Is starting to disapear...needs more bass dominant tracks...    Guitars: Vast improvement...better melodic harmonies and interesting dissonant solos with technical intelligence...if they improve in the next album it should be amazing...    Vocals: Much better real singing...the shouting is starting to lose its bite though...the lyrics have improved since IOWA...keep it up Corey...    ...overall this is their most melodic and therefore their least acessible to the anti-accessible...if you thought you'd like Slipknot for their heaviness and want no mushiness or variety to it...then I think IOWA or their Debut will be more up your street...    ...one more album to go for subject A...apparently it has thrash influences...will it be an interesting change or fail miserably?

B0006Z2LCE|4.0|Well, I wanted remastered Donna Summer disco music, so I ordered the \\"Gold\\" two-disc set.  I am happy that disc one is entirely 1970s Summer!  But, by the end of disc two, I had a headache!  So, I probably won't even listen to disc two (at least beyond the first few songs) on a regular basis.  I think the music lost me around 1983/4.  Anyway, the collection sounds terrific, despite my complaint.  It is a very thorough compilation of songs from Donna Summer's career in music.  I noticed in the cd booklet that about 6 cds have been released from the '70s disco period.  I might look into those albums to get more of the Donna Summer that I love.  Overall, this is not a bad buy.  I would just hope that others would have a greater appreciation for the dance club music that followed the original disco.  I find it annoying, but I've said enough.  Disc One RULES!!!
0307269752|2.0|Whew!  This book took me forever to get through!  It became a chore and then a challenge, then it actually became interesting...then it fell flat.<br /><br />The story begins very slowly with a cryptic storyline about large scale financial crime and the journalist who tries to expose it.  There are lots of names of, presumably, local publications, European businesses, and other institutions that Europeans are apparently familiar with.  This meant nothing to me and made it hard to trudge through.<br /><br />However, silly me, the book isn't about mobsters and Swedish mafia.  It's about something else.  Hmmm... It takes over 1/4 of the book to actually get to the main story line.  Hmmm...<br /><br />Interesting characters are introduced in great detail and then they disappear from the story.  Story lines are started and abandoned.  There is an inordinate amount of detail about meaningless things--the inside of a cabin, how someone is dressed, a character's apartment even though this has no bearing on the story, etc.--and yet much of this detail ends in dead end tangent after dead end tangent. It was frustrating and hard to make sense of.  After 100 pages, it became downright boring.<br /><br />Based on the statistics quoted at the beginning of each chapter, the book is centered on the theme of women being used and abused by men.  It's a great set up for a story, and yet, the theme is so lost in the details that I had a hard time remembering this.<br /><br />The main character, Mikael Blomqvist, is an investigative journalist and all around good guy.  If the book is supposed to be about men who are hatefully aggressive towards women, Blomqvist is played as the direct opposite.  He seems to be played as the kind and gentle, but hapless sex toy of strong women throughout the book.  His role with women is to be kind and conversational, to respond to their sexual advances with mild surprise, a conjuring of the appropriate physical response, and because he's such a nice guy, he has sex with them, each and every one, over and over.  What a guy!  Like Sheriff Andy Taylor on Viagra...  Thankfully, the detailed descriptions stop short of the bedroom scenes.<br /><br />Finally, at the halfway point, the true story line appears and it's a good story.  Mikael Blomqvist proves to be intelligent and dedicated to the job at hand. The mystery surrounding a young woman who disappeared without a trace back in the 60's is Blomqvist's adventure, shared with a skinny goth girl with a serious emotional disability, a photographic memory and an aptitude for hacking computers.  It's a good mystery and it plays out extremely well.  I enjoyed this part of the book.  The mystery, the suspects, the new evidence emerging after 35 years, the hunt, the chase, the rescue.  It's all there.  Very well done.<br /><br />Once the mystery is solved, however, the original story line is picked up again and the book crawls to a feeble and flat ending.  After wading through the first half of the book, I was rewarded with a terrific mystery, only to be let down again at the end.  It felt like it was supposed to go somewhere, but there was no where to go.  Did the author die before finishing?  Honestly, this book could have been 250 pages long, rather than 465, and it would have been glorious.  As is stands, I'm left confused as to why this book was declared a blockbuster in Europe.  I'd like to believe that something was lost in the translation from Swedish to English.  I was so glad to be finished that I couldn't bring myself to care about the information on the author.  Hopefully this isn't the best this author has to offer.every one, over and over.  What a guy!  Like Sheriff Andy Taylor on Viagra...

After wading through the first half of the book, I was rewarded with a terrific mystery, only to be let down again at the end.  It felt like it was supposed to go somewhere, but there was no where to go.  Did the author die before finishing?  Honestly, this book could have been 250 pages long, rather than 465, and it would have been glorious.  As is stands, I'm left confused as to why this book was declared a blockbuster in Europe.  I'd like to believe that something was lost in the translation from Swedish to English.  I was so glad to be finished that I couldn't bring myself to care about the information on the author.  Hopefully this isn't the best this author has to offer.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|No it isn't the X-Files as another reviewer brought up, but that has already been done.  This is a unique show with twisted plot lines and stories.  I personally love this new show.  I think it is different but not so far out there as one might think.  The characters are so different from each other yet have so much in common that you're never really sure what is going to happen.  I hope this show stays around for a long time.  Hope Season One DVD will be released as soon as possible.
B0001I55OC|2.0|There's some cool scenes of a nighttime siege on a castle with flaming projectiles flying back and forth and some interesting glimpses of Medieval warfare--some really well-done historical recreation in that department--but the rest of the movie is just plain silly, and some of the acting is pretty bad, and a lot of the acting is really bad, and obviously the director is pretty sad if he just let slide so much bad. Probably a movie for teenage boys. I probably would have liked it when I was a teenager and lacked an age-earned discriminating eye. For teenage girls? Well, that's for a woman to say. There's a cute, although preposterous, romance mixed in. Medievalists might like owning a copy for the recreations. My copy's going to the used bookstore if they'll give me a buck for it.
0321146530|5.0|Excellent book, well paced and informative. You should really go through the examples as you read those sections (part 2), even if they feel a little obvious, because if you are new to TDD you will pick up some insights. I particularly liked the Patterns section (Part 3), as it introduced some new patterns as well as talked about familiar patterns in the light of TDD.<br /><br />If you are a software developer, you must put this powerful tool (TDD) in your toolbox.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Mad Men blew me away last summer when it burst upon the scene. In an era when scripted entertainment had been written off as all but moribund, Mad Men changed the rules and brought in the kind of quality you don't normally see on American television. This DVD anthology is worth every penny, as much for the series as for the extras. And, hey, anyone ever seen a more novel package than a replica of a Zippo? Mad Men is an original that has revitalized episodic TV itself. May its quality never slip!
0375826726|4.0|A great contiuation of the series. We see all the old characters developed more and the introduction of a few more. I love getting inside the dwarven politics as the elect a new king. I also enjoy reading from Saphira's point of view more as she and Eragon spend time apart.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|The first 75% of this movie was FANTASTIC !!!   Then the director decided to \\"extend\\" the movie with a stupid \\"sub-plot\\", i.e., the \\"Blame Game\\" - who is the villain ??? Is the Joker the villian ?      Is Harvey Dent the 'bad guy' ? Is Batman the 'criminal' ? Etc., etc., and so on.   Give me a break !!!
031606792X|4.0|I like books 1 & 2, didn't like Eclipse too well.     *** Spoilers***  I thought Meyer did an excellent job of tying up loose ends in Breaking Dawn. There are a few things that bothered me...I did not like Jake imprinting on the baby, although I saw it coming as the book progressed. Why not Leah?? Couldn't he just want to protect Nessie because she is half human, that half being from the woman he loved? I also hated the name Reneesme...please?! And i did feel some compassion for Rose..    For those that love the other books, I don't think you will be disappointed. If you were barely holding on with Eclipse, then some of what goes down in this installment will probably have you rolling your eyes..a LOT.

B001DHXT6G|4.0|I purchased this ecologically wasteful and poor quality set in 2009 (DVD) ALL disc are DVD 18's (double sided) and are MADE  IN MEXICO. and shipped in bulk to the USA by Paramount/CBS; When arrived, I waded thru every disc to make sure they all played-they DID; A couple -three years passed, and I noticed that some discs had to be coaxed to play-ie: load and reload several times; finally in the past year i have several discs, some watched only once since arrival-that simply will not load no matter how many times you close the tray. Same if I play it on my computer; All my other US or EU discs i have load 100% of the time, so it cannot be my player. This is kind of like Laser rot which plagued some laserdiscs back in that era-but we were assured the there would be no such thing as &#34;DVD rot&#34; Again, all discs are pristine and some have been played only once; used a 3M laser cleaner, and shot a jet or 2 of air inside; I paid $150 for the set. And after 5 years nobody will take them back of course; In 2014, CBS rereleased the sets in more standard box sets-i have no idea what kind of discs; The cheapest i could get the set was $96 incl postage.  I had read that the UK set was on standard 1 sided DVD-9's (rereleased in 2014 also) and was able to get them for a whopping.......$60 post included-and they are in an all-in-one box and are indeed single sided DVD-9's; Paramount USA just LOVES to milk the consumer!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Christopher Nolan has created before our eyes the dark world of Gotham City.  Despair, fear, anguish and undeniable hope weave through the film like dark swirling smoke of emotion.  With the Dark Knight we are drawn further into characters we have come to love or hate.  Christian Bale once again lights up the screen. The truly tortured soul of a hero caught between vigilance for his beloved city and life that he cannot truly live.  Michael Caine is flawless as the loyal staunch servant standing beside the one in which he believes.  Gary Oldman portrays a man standing in the dark seeking good and is willing to fight for it.  And don't let us forget Morgan Freeman. Brilliant and undaunting he works with Batman to free Gotham of chains long rusted.    AH!  But don't forget the Joker!  Heath Ledger has given us the TRUE Joker.  In this character no one ever has nor ever will give us such a deep look into a man lost beyond redemption.  He handed us a blood soaked, violent, angry, tormented, evil, sadistic, uncaring villain.  With blood and sadistic fear he laughs his way toward his goal of complete anarchy .  Prepared to make Gotham suffer Joker gleefully lets loose malicious terror that will destroy everyone and everything in its path.  And he is most happy to do so. After viewing the Dark Knight, many times, I can truly say that Heath Ledger's Joker is magnificently evil. A memorable and cruel villain that slashed his way toward anarchy and destruction. Leaving us wishing for one more glance into the personification of chaos.  Heath Ledger will be sorely missed, a gifted and vibrant young man gone long before his time.
B000006UNF|5.0|I was in England when this album was released. I bought it because I liked the cover.  I was completely blown away but it.  I also went to the first concert in Ipswich, England and bought a couple of friends with me.  This is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  I call it Genesis on steriods.  Please buy it, you won't be dissapointed.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I learned about the show Firefly on an online forum for Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles and then watch the TV series on Hulu. I loved the show so decided to get the movie. WOW, this is just like the TV show but 100 times better. Best Scifi movie of the new century.
B00005ABX0|5.0|Brian Wilson's obsession with taking the Beach Boy's sound to another  level, like the Beatle's had done with Revolver & Rubber Soul, gave us  Pet Sounds and would later bring about the Good Vibration sessions and  the aborted Smile project, but for my money Wild Honey is the masterpiece  that Brian was trying to make, by accident or by design, this album was  everything that Rubber Soul was, every song stands out by itself, there  is continuity, the songs flow together in a fashion that nothing on  Pet Sounds or the patchwork bits & pieces that made up Smile every could.  Let's face it, Smile is overrated, too much filler, the musical textures  and structures are brilliant, but Van Dyke Parks lyrics are annoying and  not up to the high standard set by the music, Wild Honey had at least 3  songs that should have been top 20, Aren't you Glad(with a Motown beat)   Let The Wind Blow(Lennon & McCartney didn't compose anything better than  this)and even the cover of I Was Made To Love Her should have charted,  that Capitol ignored this album and did not push these songs is criminal,  it was 1967 and Brian Wilson was still king.
0743270754|5.0|It is simple and easy to follow language. Life of Lincoln is excellently portrayed in a chronology of events.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over    If you like the Eagles at all then you must purchase this DVD. The sound and quality are excellent.  Closest thing to being there in person.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase. If you have surround sound even better.  Enjoy!
B00005QDW5|4.0|This really has all the hits that the casual fan would desire on a convenient double CD. I can see that die-hards would be upset with the way some songs have been edited. Well they can stick to their original collection and stop whingeing as far as I'm concerned. There has been a lot of talk about how Gilmour and Waters have put their differences aside to select the songs. And that means that Barrett songs have been magnanimously  included which improves  this collection even though these songs have quite a different, \\"happier\\" feel. However it seems to me that Gilmour and Waters insisted on some of their very \\"special\\" songs to be included just to be difficult leading to inclusions of forgettable songs like Flether Memorial, When the tigers..., Keep talking. These spaces could have been filled by better songs. For a band that IMHO has quite a few duds on their studio albums they have managed to concentrate the good Pink Floyd songs onto a very worthwhile double CD.
B0012BTBQU|5.0|Mistborn, Final Empire is the first of three Mistborn books.  There are three books, but (as is occasionally the case with the first volume of a trilogy) this volume stands very nicely on its own.    This first volume is Brandon Sanderson's second published work, and it is a phenomenal early work.  It is a strong, excellent work.    Sanderson prides himself on the creation of new and unique magic systems.  He also likes to write magic systems with strong rules;  as he says, it gives the work a \\"grittier\\" feel.  \\"Grittier\\" is definitely an appropriate word to use.      Yet, unlike some \\"grittier\\" fantasy, it didn't come across as obsessively gory or profane.  (Think George R. R. Martin)    The magic system in Mistborn is very unique, and very well thought out.  Magic can participate in the plot in a very important way, and yet it is entirely understandable and believable -- because of how well-crafted the magic system is and how well the reader can understand it.    The plot reveals a few of the bones of the underlying archetype, yes, but it puts some interesting \\"meat\\" on them.    My biggest complaint is that sometimes the characters are too precise in their self-analysis.  Yes, I understand that some of the characters are very introspective.  Actually, most of the time it's wonderful.  But every once-in-a-while, one of the characters (usually Vin) thinks just a bit too clearly about her own motivations.  When this happens, it feels like Sanderson himself stepping into the novel and telling us something directly, and a few times it pulled me out of the story for a moment.    I still give this entry the full 5 stars, and I heartily recommend that you buy and read it.    Afterward, visit Sanderson's website, because he has \\"bonus features\\" on his website for the book.  He includes a few \\"deleted scenes\\" and annotations for every chapter.  They tell you what he was thinking as he wrote, what he was trying to accomplish, and sometimes lets you read multiple versions ofa passage that came from earlier drafts.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Retired CIA agent, Bryan (Liam Neeson) must call on all of his past job skills when his teenaged daughter (Maggie Grace) and her friend are kidnapped by people traffickers, while on vacation in France.    I really enjoyed \\"Taken\\". It is a really dumb film with \\"violence solves everything\\" as its central message (and the incongruously heavy themes of drugs, prostitution and slavery, but lets not dwell on those), but in spite of these things (or perhaps because of them), it was exciting, fast-moving and a really fun movie to watch. Although starting to look a bit on the old side, Neeson does a commendable job as a former spy called back into action and surprisingly he makes this piece of far-fetched fluff seem somewhat believable...somewhat.     The script of \\"Taken\\" is co-written by Luc Besson, who is among my favourite writers, and although not of the calibre of \\"Leon - The Professional\\", or even \\"Taxi\\",  Besson is still a better writer than most action film writers out there and as a results, this film is well worth your time and money.
B00000IP2L|3.0|This album is pretty excellent, and Zakk Wylde is definitely a guitar master.  Still, I'm not a fan of the harmonics as they get repetitive very fast.  This album rocks hard though, \\"The Beginning...At Last\\" actually reminds me of some of Queens of the Stone Age harder songs.  Overall the album has pounding guitar parts that never let up.  And on a softer album \\"Spoke In The Wheel\\" has a \\"Simple Man\\" kind of feel in the best way.    Good for those who like guitars to thud.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|It was great that I could find this product on amazon. Good price and delivered immediately. Wonderful job.
B00003CXXP|4.0|The story is completely unfeasible, but is still a good one and very moving in parts.    The artificial child David is created to have human emotion, in particular the ability to love. But it is an unrealistic and programmed love directed only at one person and not of the human kind. No real boy would have this everlasting and overpowering love for a miserable mother that abandoned him in the woods to die or fend for himself.     David's unrequited love is moving and pathetic. In the tear-jerking ending where David's \\"mother\\" spends one glorious last day with him and tells him that she has always loved him, she and her words are just the fabrication of the beings that recreated her for him. His mother did not love him.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|Excellent blue ray movie transfer along with a great movie itself. I would recommend this movie to all horror buffs.
B00005MP58|5.0|Of the four versions of Pride and Prejudice that I have viewed, this is by far the best, not only in superior acting (from the main characters down to the bit players), quality of filming, and superb costumes, but also in the authenticity of the film as true to the book.      My second choice would be the Greer Garson version from the 40's; while not as accurate to the book, it is still an enjoyable movie to watch, even if Lizzy is a bit too caustic with her wit in that version.    My third choice is the BBC version from the 80's, which though accurate is rather dull in acting and filming.      The worst I have seen is the 2005 version which reduces this story to a romance only and has poor acting in the supporting roles.
B001GZ6QDS|3.0|Well I guess we never will see Batman the way he was intended. Forget about all the \\"layered\\" stuff we keep reading about. In the long run he is a disappointment. Batman has always been a guy that could go toe to toe with Sherlock Holmes. A genius really. A driven genius. This is the second movie now where he gets other people to do his thinking for him. Lucious Fox for instance, and the Batmobile? It is nothing but a glorified tank. A military vehicle? The Batman I know designed and built all his own stuff. Then there is the lousy voice. It just has to go. I like Bale as an actor but can't they come up with a better voice than that?<br />  Then there is the Batsuit. He now looks like (and even kind of acts like) a big armored thug. The Batman I always knew was a guy who was vulnerable and not afraid to show it. He didn't have to wear a big clunky suit of armor.<br />  Heath Ledger was fine as the Joker. I still miss the way the REAL Joker looked but I can buy him. He does manage to do some very Joker like things in the film.<br />  Maybe the best Character and best acting job in the film though was Harvey Dent/Two Face. Trouble is that there just wasn't enough room for him. The film was too crowded. Just like they always do. Why not throw in 2 or 3 villans when one would do? Two Face needed more time to develop. He also LOOKED great! The most accurate (along with some refinements etc for the screen) by far. Great job on Two Face.<br />  Funny thing abut this film...... Out of all the characters The Batman ends up being the least interesting and portrayed the most poorly. It's not that I didn't like it at all. I enjoyed much of it but underneath it all I just couldn't shake the thoughts of \\"that just isn't Batman.\\" I guess we still have to wait for his character to be done right. He has endured now for close to 70 years so I guess they have done something right. Too bad the film doesn't portray that. I guess reading the character now for close to 40 years doesn't say much about that though. Sigh.much about that though. Sigh.
B001AEF6CW|5.0|This movie is one of the greats.My whole family loves it.The package is great.All around a great buy!!!!!!!
B000NTPDSW|1.0|I do not want to spend time on analyzing the movie, its a great piece and we know that for decades. These are the reviews of the blu ray version, so I limit my review to that.    This blu ray release is plain cr@p, the worst thing I have seen in HD, in fact this is not even HD. Looks like as if the lens was smeared with vaseline, dull colors, out of focus - horrible blu ray transfer. Waste of money, if you want the film just buy on DVD it might be even better quality at a fraction of the price.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|First off, let me just say I wanted to love this CD. It's great to have Metallica back after \\"St. Anger\\", maybe the worst crap ever to have the name Metallica attached to it. \\"Death Magnetic\\" rocks with a ferocity that has been missing for a long time from this band. I'm still wondering what they were thinking when they did the thing with the symphony orchestra. DM is nothing less than a return to form for a band that really needed it.<br />  That said, WTF is up with the sound quality of this CD? It's so overdriven and distorted that it sounds like my speakers are blown (they aren't). Listen to tracks 3 and 4 in particular. They sound like they were recorded on someone's Radio Shack boombox. The high end totally overwhelms everything else that's happening. Why would any band allow something like this to be released, let alone a major act like Metallica? If this is some kind of creative device, like the pinging drums on St. Anger, I don't like it. It sucks. If I had anything to do with recording, mixing or mastering this thing, I would ask to have my name taken off the package. I feel ripped off by how terrible the CD sounds, thus the 3-star review. Lars, you owe me 9 bucks.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|Great interview by the Hollywood Sign. He's the next great guitarist of this generation.   Great concert split up in three parts. Acoustic, Trio, and John Mayer Band.   The Blu-Ray looks amazing.
0575081406|4.0|It's taken me a while to get around to reading this, but it was worth the wait.<br />Kvothe comes from a travelling troupe, a bit like a mini circus, but his family are slaughtered by the mysterious Chandrian and as a young boy he sets his sites on gaining magical skills and finding out more about the Chandrian.  How do we know this?  Well we are presented to an older Kvothe who is managing a small village inn who is convinced to tell his life story to a biographer.  So we hear how a typical legend of fantasy books came to be that legend and eventually, we presume, we will find out what brought him to a small inn....<br />This is the first part of a trilogy and takes us from Kvothe aged about eight to about sixteen, the majority is spent in 'The University' where he learns skills, makes enemies and finds love, all set against his drive to find out more about the Chandrian.<br />This is original and an engrossing read over about 650 pages.  A good start for those who have not read this kind of stuff, and also good for those of us who have read a great deal of fantasy and want a twist on the usual.<br />It does end abruptly just as you are drawn into Kvothe's life and it is a shame we have to wait until April 09 for the next part of the story...
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I was never into Vampires. I never read Anne Rice, or watched Buffy The Vampire Slayer on a regular basis...exactly as Alan Ball describes himself. Which is probably exactly why and how Alan Ball has gotten me completely wrapped up in this series: True Blood. Yes, it is very graphic, as others have described. It plainly lists every warning before the title roles: Violence, Strong Sexual Content, Nudity, Adult Content, and Adult Language. I have never really been a fan of any of those (graphic attributes) either...however...this series is amazing!     A friend of mine mentioned True Blood after the first 2 episodes aired. I had seen the white HBO poster with the lips and blood, and still...it did NOT entice me to view. Then I had too much spare time because of a back injury and I flipped through On Demand. Ironically, I had never used that particular feature of my DVR either. But there it was...True Blood...and the enthusiasm my friend had gushed about this show rang in my ears. I flipped on the first episode...and didn't stop watching until all 5 had been consumed with my pure, complete fascination. The characters are complete living, breathing full-faceted individuals (except for the vampires...remove breathing with enticing)...*wink. The relationship of Sookie and Bill are great! Kudos to Stephen Moyer as the HOT `hero' Vampire. Needless to say, I have now watched the 5 first episodes TWICE...and I cannot wait until episode 6 airs this Sunday...I am on pins and needles to see how they handle the death of (I won't spoil it).    I am sure the books are different, as the readers of the series have pointed out. Book series are always better than the translation to television or film; nobody will ever be able to live up to our own imagination. Because of that, Charlaine Harris will also be getting my money...I have ordered all 8 of her `Southern Vampire' novels. That is what happens when a brilliant writer creates fascinating characters. I can't wait until True Blood comes out on DVD! So, everyone will be getting my money from this series...ha!     Hey, HBO...there are 8 novels...so I hope that means you will be letting us consume 8 seasons of this delicious series!
0790729644|4.0|As far as grandiose Westerns go, this is about my favorite - along with McCabe and Mrs. Miller.  It's a story of two old retired gunfighters, long reformed in their ways, stepping back into the ring for one last hurrah of badness - assassination for hire.  The movie builds tension wonderfully, creates a magical vibe of reality (minus the rather cheesy acting of the young guy who plays the \\"Scofield Kid\\"), is full of flesh-and-blood, fallible characters with whom you can empathize and whom you can hate - or be sickened by, or root for...  And best of all this movie has QUITE the payoff.  It WORKS.  Mostly Hollywood stinks.  Not here.  And frankly, Clint Eastwood rocks.  He plays his part to the T.<br /><br />Okay, two more little criticisms:<br /><br />1) The scene where Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood discuss sex and masturbation came out of left field and deflated the reality of the moment.  So cheesy.  Morgan to Clint, set in 1880:  \\"Do you use your hand?\\"  WHATEVER!<br /><br />2) The violence at points went a bit far for me.  Yes, it added to the drama and reality of the movie, but how many times does a guy need to get kicked in the bloody face?
0896760839|4.0|This book although rather cumbersome in shape and difficult to read without the aid of a table to lay it up on, it is very through in its content and the patterns are great the amount of work the writer must have done to collect the information is mind blowing, however I would have liked to see a few more colored pictures but this does not detract from the information.
B00005JPO1|3.0|First off, I'm actually giving it a 3 1/2 stars, just to get that out of the way. Also, just in case you haven't seen the film, there a few, tiny spoliers.   Now, the Indiana Jones trilogy is one of my (and many others) favorite series out there. The group of Speilberg, Lucas and Ford is amazing. Each movie brings us something new and kinda out there. So does this new one, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls.   Indy 4 takes place about 20 years after The Last Crusade (which is the same time difference between the 2 films in real life). It starts with Indy being captured by Soviets and being forced to find a certain speacial object inside what is now known as Area 51. From there, Indy teams up with Mutt (played by Shia Labeouf)and they rescue Mutt's mother, who just so happens to be Marion Ravenwood (Karren Allen) from Raiders of the Lost Ark.   The action is as usual, nothing way out there, but nothing plain and boring either. It's all good fun. The dialouge is a little cheesey at some points, but after 20 years, I fully expected it to be cheesey. The one complaint that I and most everyone else has is the ending. Lemme just say...ALIENS??? WTF? Aliens and Indy DON'T mix. And for that reason, and that reason alone is why I gave a potential 4/5-er, a 3 1/2.
1878424319|4.0|Excellent book with classic ideals explained in a very understandable manner.These are ideals we have all heard before, in various different presentations. This one make sit easy to buy into an dhelps explain alot of out own issues. A very helpful self help book!!  Transaction was smooth and value was great.
630521610X|3.0|I recently bought the Scream boxset for a very good price. I watched the first one and I was highly disappointed. The references to other movies got annoying and I hated the cast. I prefer 70's and 80's horror to most of the junk in horror today. It had a few good scenes but wasnt too impressed.     I think Wes Craven is overrated. Ive stated this on anther one of his movies, i've even checked out the Interet movie database to see what he has done. Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic and probably his best work. His other movies were decent but nothing could compare to Nightmare on Elm Street. Scream is decent but I wouldnt call it the greatest horror film of the 90's. Im sure someone will answer this.
0375826726|5.0|it is a good continuation to the other books. its only problem is that it is not the last book.
B000A1EBX6|2.0|For dummies like me it should be spelled out in PLAIN English -not tech terms about non-US format & takes a special DVD player to play it in USA. Wasted $ on my part.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|Kill Bill is one of the best movies of all time.  Imaginative, fun, action packed, beautiful photography, captivating story line.  Now I know why for the last 25 years I have been calling my daughters Kiddo.  (Not just because I can't keep their names straight)
0439023483|5.0|Having just finished reading this novel less than an hour ago, I am still processing it. I don't quite know what to say or how to formulate how much i LOVE this book.    I am speechless.... I am awe-struck.... This book is pure genius. It's brilliant and beautiful and haunting and thought-provoking and completely unforgettable.     I can't think of a single decent criticism for this novel. I guess maybe at times it has moments that smack of over-the-top sci-fi that don't completely mesh with the tone of the rest of the story, but it simply doesn't matter. This book is a work of art and I am salivating for the sequel!!     I heard about this book from Stephenie Meyer's website and i think honestly think that \\"The Hunger Games\\" is by far more intelligent and clever and entertaining and believable than the \\"Twilight\\" series. It made me ache and cheer for the characters in a way that I was never able to with the Twilight books.    It is violent & disturbing, though - I've told people it should be called \\"The Killing Games\\". I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone under the ago of 15. But what do i know? Kids play horribly violent video games and watch horribly violent things on TV, so this might be completely tame to the average young teen.    Grade: A+
015206057X|5.0|As an early childhood professional, I am always looking for new books to share with children, their parents & teachers. When I saw this one reviewed in the National Association for the Education of Young Children's magazine, I immediately ordered several copies. I have already used them for teacher training & as baby shower, welcome-to-world new baby & now-you-are-grandparents gifts.     The book includes all of the elements of appropriate books for young children. The story/text is simple and incorporates rhyme, repetition & interesting vocabulary. The illustrations are soft yet colorful & clear, subtly addressing similarities & differences.    The book provides opportunities to initiate discussions about numbers by counting the fingers, toes & babies. It also addresses social/emotional aspects of development by illustrating empathy & caring interpreted through the faces & actions of the characters.     I have yet to see anyone look at this book & not melt into the long \\"awe\\" we often hear when looking at something that truly touches our hearts.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|In this day and age a movie like this is rare, except a few Jane Austen movies. This movie is clean but deeply romantic. All about the importance of living an honororable life. This movie has some \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" under tones. I recomend this movie to someone who  considers themselves a  Jane Austen movie fan. It does have a different kind of plot then Austen movies.So do not expect it to  be the same- but simaliar.   Enjoy!!!!!!!!
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|The album is good. I liked half of the songs, and Amazon's MP3 option was nice to build my own album out of them.     The lead vocal's voice is incredibly strong. When they find the right song, it's magic. However, some of the songs don't sound very tight. They need just a little something to make the vocals and the rest of the band connect. The guitar work is simply amazing, and if you like guitar playing, look no further. They definitely went with more of a hard rock sound, and it's something that I kinda miss.     It sounds like they are trying to find themselves their own sound, and they'll be amazing once they do.
B001DELWZY|5.0|[[ASIN:B001DHE9KG Puccini - La Boheme (The Metropolitan Opera HD Live Series)]]  The opening night of this production at La Scala last year was greeted by controversy that got the star soprano and conductor lustily booed by the angry audience. The Italian papers came up with some speculations as to why that nasty audience response happened. When I first looked at the cover of this DVD, the first thing I noticed was the pretty picture of Angela Gheorghiu ; the next, the names of Ramon Vargas and Roberto Frontali were printed significantly smaller than the names of the soprano and conductor Lorin Maazel. I thought it was in bad taste and slighted the other two principals who are top Verdi singers of this generation with distinguished operatic careers. After listening to the performance on this DVD, I thought I had a better take on the controversy than those Italian papers. My theory is that the soprano and conductor hatched a   scheme to do something on that first night performance that would surely enrage the passionate La Scala audience and make themselves the wronged victims. In a subsequent performance used for this DVD, they performed tremendously, and the guilt-ridden and contrite boo birds apologized with huge ovations for them, which was the object of their plot to sell this DVD. But to further reward the conspirators by printing their names much larger than everyone else is going too far. Having said that, the performance here is superb.    Despite some negative comments in the papers about the 20-yr old production sets used here, I prefer it to the Met's Zeffirelli production with its extremes and some garishness particularly in Act2. It's a relief to see Violetta in her last moments in a modest but decent surroundings, not in some dilapidated warehouse. All principals are in top form. As noted earlier, Vargas and Frontali are preeminent Verdi singers and great choice as the Germonts. Gheorghiu is not a typical or traditional Verdi soprano (the likes of Tebaldi, Freni or even Moffo) but she has a beautiful, expressive voice with dark shades for a wide range of expressions and is a very convincing actress. With sensitive and generous partners in Vargas, Frontali and Maazel, she can be a marvelous Violetta as demonstrated on this disc. My little complaint is the stage direction and coaching that let Vargas do a lot of distracting things while singing his one aria in Act2 - looking for cup and saucer, pouring his coffee, and singing his one-verse O Mio Rimorso while lugging a suitcase and rummaging through some unmentionables looking for a document. Miraculously, he did not miss a beat and sang with his customary elegance and vibrancy in rich and burnished tones. For the most part, the singing and acting of the three principals, the contributions of everyone, comprimarios, dancers, chorus, orchestra and , of course, the crafty Maazel throughout the opera - all make this brilliant DVD a must have and worthy addition to everyone's collection of this wonderful opera.
0307269752|5.0|I read a lot of thriller/mysteries, and I consider this book one of the best.  It was coincidental that part of the plot line focused on financial corruption and accountability, considering the current financial meltdown in the U.S.  The book touched upon various subjects: financial journalism, libel, feminism, nazis, hate crimes, family sagas, business ventures and disappearances. The point of a mystery is to draw you in as a reader and keep you guessing as you fervently turn the pages.  The novel exceeded my expectations and I look forward to the second novel in this trilogy.
B00004U2EZ|4.0|i have wathced the musical \\"Notre Dame de Paris\\" may be 8-10 times. Of course the main reason was the spectacular songs. And then i bought it Soundtrack CD. While listening i feel as if was watching the DVD..    i can't speak French but i wondered the meaning of the lyrics. i translate them on internet. Then i liked the songs one more time. Not only for their melody and compositions but also for meaninf of their lyrics. shortly you wont regret if you have this album.
B001E75QGG|3.0|What can I say... this movie amounts to the raping of Indiana Jones.  It reduced the once beloved character to a money making whore.  The plot for those that have not seen the movie takes a turn that is not even based in reality leaving a sour taste.  It doesn't take a realistic or even plausible stance on the mission Indiana is on.  For those who love the old movies or even the young Indiana Jones Chronicles the charm of those movies/shows were that there was a semblance of reality.  You sat there and said: \\"This could really happen\\" or \\"Wow, I wonder if there really was a secret plot like that by the Nazis.\\"<br /><br />The updated foe, the Russians works fine because the story had to advance 20+ years but you really never get that feeling like they are out for that one piece of lore that will give them that final piece for world domination.  It rests on development or lack thereof of the villains.<br /><br />The introduction of Shia Labeouf is a smart choice but how and who he ends up being is a questionable choice.  Not to ruin who he is to everyone involved, it is his back-story that leaves me wondering are they trying to go the route of Bourne or the new Bond films; reducing him to the newbie or raw agent type, who uses his street smarts and fists before he uses his brain.  Shia's character is a drop out which takes the sequel options in another direction because the charm of the old movies was that Indy was an academic first and an adventure second.  Being an academic drove Indy and I think Shia's character has a long way to go if there are to be sequels.<br /><br />But even with the negatives which there are many; the movie is fun.  The ending is disappointing but the ride there is pure popcorn fun.  Suspend your desire for your parents' Indy (old movies) and welcome in Indy 2008: CGI and aliens.<br /><br />Let's hope that the next one and there will be a next one brings the franchise back to its roots so that Shia can take over an awesome franchise that hasn't forgotten what made it great.t.
0375826726|5.0|'Brisingr\\" is MUCH better written than 'Eldest'.  Although I still feel that 'Eldest' was a good read, I felt 'Eldest' was written more by the editors, than by Paolini, so therefore, less of Paolini's \\"soul\\" came through.  I was almost tempted to not buy 'Brisingr', but I decided to take the chance that Paolini would come into his own.  I'm glad I did, because this book, 'Brisingr', seems to have MUCH more of Paolini's \\"soul\\", because it \\"flows\\" so much more like 'Eragon'.  Way to go Paolini, for standing up for what you believe to be more creative writing!  I'm proud of you!  I'm really looking forward to your 4th book in this series!  =)

0393061310|5.0|It took me a while to open this book, as I was absolutely convinced that, with a title like Guns, Germs and Steel, the subject could only be war.  Eventually, however, I opened the book, and was absolutely fascinated by it.  The premise of the book is Yali's question.  Yali, a native of New Guinea, has never been out of his country, is \\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\"  The answer to this question takes about 430 pages of very interesting reading, going back to the rise and spread of food production, from food to guns, germs and steel, around the world in 5 chapters.  The writer, Jared Diamond delves into pre-history, how and why the nomadic hunter/gatherers became more stationary, and started to form villages, and what effect that had on their way of life. What is necessary to sustain villages.  The advance of specialisation.  Why some areas were more susceptible to change than others.  The geographic climate that helped or hindered.  As I say, this is a very interesting book, and one that will long live with you.  However, it is perhaps rather hard reading, insofar as it is written probably for college students.  It is not a book that should be read in a hurry, but should be savoured.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|DVD was perfect, no scratches.  The extra footage helped explain a few things and put a little more color into the movie. Loved it.
B00005JPO1|2.0|I'm so dissapointed about it. I love all Indy movies, but this one, is far boring, unoriginal and in some parts, lame and stupid.    I know it's all fiction, but all other films, while still worked around a story that in real life could just not happen, it's so entertaining that you still said \\"why not\\". But on this fourth movie, unreal crossed the line to impossible, and let me resume this thought in the following numbers:    1.- Survive a nuclear blast, even inside a fridge... gimme a break!!!  2.- \\"Loughing desert marsupials\\"???? Weren't the Ewoks enough for lucas on Episode VI? Compleately unfunny and unnecessary  3.- ALIENS!!!!! The story it's all around an alien skull... that, unoriginal idea for a Indy film, just was out of place.  4.- Special effects at the jeeps chase on the jungle... not only I got stressed out about this sequence, but standing on a jeep fighting and not falling at a speed over 60 mph... I guess cazy glue was an important issue here.    Don't get me wrong it entertains, but this is not a type of movie that has no history behind it in order to do just anything. To Spielberg everything circles around aliens, but... come on, not Indy, that was just pushing it to far.    It dissapointed me the fact of the unoriginality for the plot. It could have been a great movie. And everyone was so concerned about Fords age, why bother.

I also think this could be used on my kids bikes once they get older so it is nice to see more bang for my buck!  Great product.
B00127RAJY|5.0|You can't get fit in 20mins without those 20mins being focused and intense. I've spent years \\"phoning it in\\" (a Jillian-ism) at the gym and these workouts are more intense but vastly more productive. This is not your typical workout video. With most workout videos a relatively \\"fit\\" but inactive person (I don't rock climb for fun) will find them generating a small sweat but producing next to zero results. Might as well just climb the stairs a bit and park in the far end of the lot. This is not one of those videos. Want to not take the stairs, park upfront, and see results?  This is the right video.

B000929AJQ|4.0|If his most critically concise work can also be cited as his worst, Reznor can do no wrong.

B00000JGHL|4.0|The film concerns a classic theme. In fact it concerns the theme exploited by Batman, from beginning to end, but in real data and details. The mayor of New York, appreciated and very diligent and dynamic, in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal, yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he pressurizes the judge in his turn to set him free on probation in spite of a negative probation report that disappears but is not destroyed, be it only because of the political value it represents. And what was to happen happens and a few people, including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that  criminal. The city may explode because of it: racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the insecurity such criminals free to roam around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public. Unluckily the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation  of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out. But along the way a few witnesses are killed, and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to retire (the judge), to end their career and life (the contractor or the contractor's go between), a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared probation report, and some shady character after he provides some crucial information. The mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation; But the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case. The political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions. We are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest. We are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision  about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city. That is not typical of New York. That is true in any mayoral office. It is just more significant in quantity and in quality in a big metropolitan area like New York and of course in a city or country where police departments are municipal and are controlled by political imperatives. The young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way, and he derails his ambition to be the governor of New York in order to become the president of the US. The mayor is perfect due to the embodiment Al Pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless. I find the end slightly mushy with the ex-deputy mayor campaigning in his own name. That seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out  of his own way. Hence he is not better than all the others, just still too young in his ambition.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesare not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest.

B001GZ6QDS|1.0|Audience and critics everywhere praise Dark Knight for its multilayer plotline as if it were Richard Wagner's \\"Ring\\" cycle.  I disagree.  People are duped. DK's story and subplots add up to nothing more than a convoluted, unoriginal, non-sensible mess in no better shape than the Joker's face.     The biggest plot problem is that DK fundamentally contradicts Batman Begins (a mediocre effort at best.)  In BB, on his return to Gotham, Bruce Wayne picks Bat as a symbol of hope for his beloved city because a symbol can not be corrupted.  In DK Bruce takes a 180 degree turn and intends to pass on his legacy to a District Attorney, who has been ridiculed as \\"Two Face\\" in police inner circle even before he turns to the real \\"Two Face.\\"  It is preposterous that Batman would tarnish the Bat symbol to save the DA's \\"good\\" name at the end of the film.    In BB, Batman was well trained in Martial Arts.  He loses his footing so easily when combating the Joker.    Why does Commissioner Gordon fake his death, putting his family thru all the grief? It serves no purpose since it is really the DA pretending as Batman drawing out the Joker (in a long and boring car chase sequence, that has been done to death).    What are the chances of all the mobsters in town use the same Chinese accountant to wash their money?  Would anybody in his right mind dare to move mobs monies without telling them first?  What are the mobs doing in the film anyway?  The Joke does not seem to need them and their monies since he knows about everything about everyone.  The entire mob subplot should have been cut.    This brings me to the Joker.  What's with this Joker.  One moment he wants to kill Batman.  The next, he does not want to, because Batman completes him (what is this, Jerry Maquire?)  In the end, he prides himself for turning the Gotham DA into \\"Two Face.\\"  Is that a such great accomplishment after all the troubles?  If I hear once more \\"do you know how I got the scars?\\" I will cut him myself.    I would forgive and forget all these plot holes and inconsistencies if DK were exciting (like last years Transformers).  DK is as dreadful as a summer blockbuster can get.  I bet that Christopher Nolan has this secret agenda to destroy the grand summer popcorn action film tradition.  Nolan should not be given more than $500,000 budget for a film.  He should return to indie roots where he belongs.    Fellow Amazoners, you can go ahead and vote this review unhelpful if you want to.  I have said my piece.  Unlike Alfred so patronizingly put it that Gotham deserves something better than the Truth, I think you deserve nothing less than the Truth, which is that Dark Knight is a stinker!

0307455378|2.0|Ruiz Zafón tomó el mito de Fausto y lo trasladó a Barcelona en los años 20.  Perdió el ritmo y la originalidad de La Sombra del Viento y escribió un guión de cine. Si todavía existieran los derechos de autor sobre el cuento estaría en problemas serios.    El libro tiene aproximadamente 100 páginas demás y todas son escenas hechas para una película de misterio y acción con efectos especiales. No había ninguna necesidad de contar en tantas páginas la aventura el el teleferio ni el cuento de la bruja del puerto que no tenía ni lugar lógico dentro del trama.     Solo le doy dos estrellas porque tiene algunas partes que pueden llevar el lector a ver que sigue aunque el final es deshibanado, illogico y deja un tremendo sinsabor.    Espero que Ruiz Zafón se tome un tiempo para repensar su camino literario y volver a la calidad de sus trabajos anteriores.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was wary of watching this edition of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" because I was absolutely convinced that it was going to be horrible, either because of the acting, or because it wouldn't stay true to the story as it is presented in the novel. But I definitely ate some humble pie after watching this film because it turned out to be absolutely wonderful, and did Jane Austen's novel adequate justice.<br /><br />While the movie is not as detailed as the novel - or the original BBC series - due to time constraints, the creators of the movie did a good job of choosing the important points of the story to focus on. While you don't want the movie to end when it does, you can at least feel like you've been given a complete and well rounded story before placing the DVD back in its case.<br /><br />The actors selected to portray such timeless literary characters were also well chosen; while I doubted Keira Knightley's ability to pull off the role of Elizabeth, I came away with a new respect for her acting ability after watching this film. The choice of Matthew MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy was also a good one; he played the brooding, but genuinely kind-hearted Mr. Darcy very convincingly. The online chemistry between Knightley and MacFadyen was also evident, enhancing the believability of Elizabeth and Darcy's romance when it was portrayed onscreen.<br /><br />While the cinematography in this movie varied greatly from the original BBC series, it was for the better. Some of the most crucial moments in the book - when Darcy professes his feelings for Elizabeth, and the ending where they meet in the early morning - were beautifully filmed. For those who are not interested in romantic movies, but appreciate good cinematography, watch this movie for that reason alone; you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Though this film was wonderful, if you are comparing it to the book, or are a diehard fan of the original BBC series, you might come away disappointed. But for those who have never read the book, or ever seen the original BBC series, this is definitely a film that you need to add to your must-watch list.original BBC series, this is definitely a film that you need to add to your must-watch list.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|This movie hits home. Should Christians be involved in political issues? Yes! \\"Against slavery? Don't own any. Slavery is the Briton's right to choose. Keep your moral views to yourself...or you're violating the separation of church and state.\\"---were someone to say that, one could well imagine Wilberforce's reaction!<br /><br />Although this movie can be boring and hard to follow at times, it does capture the dilemma faced by Wilberforce: Should he just stick to personal piety, or get involved in the battle against current injustices?<br /><br />He shows compassion even on a fallen horse getting beaten. The movie describes how the slaves were shackled in chains and transported across the ocean under horrible conditions. Those who survived the crossing were tattooed to show that they now belonged to a man, not God.<br /><br />The battle to end slavery wasn't a simple one. It would take many tries. And it had to be done in a manner that would not cause a collapse of the British economy.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Many call this a fairy tale.  I prefer to view it as a parable.  It merely reflects back to the viewer what he or she already knows.  It's a reminder, and a beautiful one at that.    My daughter recommended this one and I was a bit hesitant going in but once I settled into it, my heart, my mind and my ears just opened and I was willing to receive the message.    Ok, so suspension of reality is required at times - though a positive slant is that all that's required is a bit of faith - and it's a bit obvious where the movie is going but y'know what?  Who really cares?  Just sit back, listen and go with it.    It's tough to find movies nowadays that can remind a person that hope and beauty really are all around us and this one is a nice reminder.
B001CD6FKI|1.0|Too bad...I really didn't appreciate the language in this movie.  I wasn't expecting it, so it came as a bit of a shock.    What did the movie in the rest of the way (besides the totaly unnecessary piranha routine) was the worse than lame scenes with the littlest brother.  This movie had some good elements, but was ruined by...what do I even call it?  Watching the boy and monkey spin out of real world into...a pathetic anime attempt?  Is that what it was?  I don't know.  But it totally disrupted the movie's flow and subtracted in general from its likeability...  For me, at least.

0596522347|5.0|It's almost a cliche to complain about how most presentations are horrible.  But fortunately there are a select few books out there that take you beyond the mechanics of creating a presentation.  Nancy Duarte has one of those books that need to be read by every presenter...  slide:ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations.  It's my hope that this book gets a wide reading by all who stand up in front of groups and convey a message.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Introduction; Create a New Slide Ideology; Creating Ideas, Not Slides; Creating Diagrams; Displaying Data; Thinking Like a Designer; Arranging Elements; Using Visual Elements - Background, Color, and Text; Using Visual Elements - Images; Creating Movement; Governing with Templates; Interacting with Slides; Manifesto - The Five Theses of the Power of a Presentation; Reference; Index<br /><br />Duarte leads a design firm that is responsible for shaping the message and images that define a company's message.  In slide:ology, she distills down the important information they use to design slides and presentations that make an impact, both visually and emotionally.  She starts with defining how presentations are meant to convey ideas, not slides.  All too often, presenters use slides as a crutch to hide behind.  If all the information is there, then they don't have to worry about forgetting anything.  Conversely, they also aren't needed as part of the presentation, either.  These text-heavy, multi-bulleted slides are really documents in disguise.  They're meant to be printed off and read, not presented to a group.  After the theory and concepts are presented, she gets into the mechanics of how those impact slides are created, everything from color and font selection to image use and placement.  In many ways, the book is also an example of her work.  Rather than pages and pages of text with standard images, the layout is designed to enhance the message and cement the concepts in the reader's mind.  Although it feels like you're reading a work of literary art, you're also absorbing the message almost without effort.  It's nearly impossible to come away from reading slide:ology without looking at presentations in the same way again.<br /><br />Up to the point of reading slide:ology, I was convinced that Presentation Zen by Garr Reynolds was the only absolute \\"must read\\" for presenters.

0452289963|2.0|I guess I'm one of the people who get absolutely nothing from this book. I purchased this book with high hopes, but after the first four chapters I couldn't convince myself to keep reading. I don't really get how this book is supposed to be revolutionary or life-changing. It better much rehashes things I've already heard before.. I wouldn't wait my money on this book...Sorry
0143038583|5.0|This is an amazing book. It may sound extreme, but the information in this is mindblowing.     Not only is it extremely well written, but it explores the different sides of the same topic, giving you multiple perspectives.    I had started reading my friend's copy on a visit, and had to order the book immediately so that I could continue reading it...and have struggled to put the book down every day since.
B001E95ZNI|4.0|Appaloosa is a cinematographically beautiful Western examining male friendship, and specifically the type of bonding in which one man calls the shots but depends for his strength on a fiercely loyal sidekick. Ed Harris is great in the role of Virgil Cole, the top dog. But it is Viggo Mortensen, in the role of faithful underling Everett Hitch, whose brilliant acting really makes the movie. (His past starring roles have been as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and David Shaw in A Pefect Murder; he was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in Eastern Promises.) This role highlights Mortensen's intelligence; he is a rather eclectic fellow in real life, being a poet, musician, photographer, and painter, in addition to an outspoken opponent of the war in Iraq. His off-screen friendship with director Harris also undoubtedly helped their on-screen energy.<br /><br />Robert B. Parker, who is better known for his prolific crime writing, wrote the novel. Although emotional rather than sexual, the deep bond between the two gunfighters has homosexual undertones; when Virgil's girlfriend comes on to Everett, Everett tells her, \\"No, we're both with him.\\" Parker's sympathetic portrayal of this issue is a theme running through his novels; both of his sons are openly gay.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also excellent: Renee Zellweger as Allison French (the woman who tests their friendship) and Jeremy Irons as the intellectual and well-connected bad guy, rancher Randall Bragg.<br /><br />You don't have to be a fan of Westerns to enjoy this movie; the themes are universal. Watch for the mountain lion in the train scene; it's a breathtaking shot.

B000T9OP7G|3.0|Slow start ... do not think the casting pick for Sara Connor was a particularly a good one ... too much deviation in character from Linda Hamilton.  Lots of eye candy scenes.  All told, DVDs are worth the money if you a person like I am that wass reached the point of being fed up with commercial breaks in TV.  Almost like the audience is treated as a whole as suffering from Adult ADD.

0007189958|4.0|In this excellent, epistolary novel, Alex and Rosie are kept apart by circumstances both within and without their control.  The only reason I'm giving this book four stars rather than five is that one of the \\"reasons\\" keeping them apart was clearly a plot contrivance meant to add another 100 pages to the book, when it was an easily solvable \\"problem\\" in real life.<br /><br />My favorite character in the whole story was the solid, reliable, no-nonsense Ruby, who calls it as she sees it and is correct from the get-go in that Alex and Rosie are mad for each other and just have to face that for themselves.<br /><br />A friend of mine said a couple years ago that \\"love leads us down strange pathways.\\"  This immensely entertaining novel is an apt demonstration of that belief.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy are three of my favorite movies. And, the boxed set I have came in excellent condition. All three movies look great in this DVD package.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|There has been at least one review that highlighted some of the sexual scenes in the film. To respond to that reviewer, the film was rated PG-13, not G or even PG. Furthermore, don't get me started on why foul language/moderately graphic violence or other behaviors are allowed and tolerated in most big budget Hollywood films that ARE aimed at children! After all, this is a review of Iron Man. Most people who didn't 'get' Robert Downey's portrayal of Stark didn't ever read the original comics, or if they did, forgot much of what they read.<br /><br />Let's not forget that Tony Stark was the original rich, womanizing, misogynistic playboy who had an epiphany steering him onto a new course in life. I didn't all of a sudden go from a hard drinking, cigar smoking playboy to a Priest, but he DID change his ways. This was portrayed by Downey almost flawlessly.  To categorize this as a flawless performance would be difficult because movies about superhero characters lend themselves to so much broad interpretation from long time comic fans, to casual readers, to those who dismiss comics as 'kid stuff'.<br /><br />At it's heart, IM was a great movie that happened to be about a superhero. I'm glad that the movie wasn't action top to bottom. This made the action sequences more enjoyable, and highlighted the acting prowess of the great cast (how'd they get Gwyeneth Paltrow to sign on at Potts?!) I for one look forward to IM 2, but I'm less anticipatory of the Avengers...I mean look at the X-Men franchise!<br /><br />Wow! I've just reread this review, and could I have been MORE WRONG about the Avengers!? Oh well, I never said I wrote reviews for a living, and maybe that's a good thing!
1400077915|2.0|I only read the title story, Runaway. I'm not sure what all the hoopla is about surrounding this book - but i wasn't impressed at all.<br /><br />The characters are are neither interesting, nor memorable. You don't really get a clear sense of who they are or what makes them tick, they have no depth, no character, no personality.<br /><br />The storyline was equally uninspiring and uninteresting. I kept expecting something to happen or some kind of epiphany or insight but it never came and when i was done i just thought, \\"huh??!!\\"<br /><br />I've enjoyed many books that don't have such distinct or interseting stories but are so beautifully written the words carry you along, and i've also enjoyed books that have a compelling story but are very simply written. This book was neither style or story driven.<br /><br />Whatever genre this is, i really don't like it!

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Warning: some spoilers ahead.<br /><br />Superhero epics rarely get better than The Dark Knight, a sequel that not only outshines Batman Begins, but completely obliterates it.  Christian Bale returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne, and soon learns that the warning Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) gave him at the end of Batman Begins about escalation was ever so true as the psychotic Joker (the late Heath Ledger, in a brilliant and Oscar worthy performance) makes an impact on Gotham City's criminal underworld.  In his personal life, Bruce also finds his true love Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes) in the arms of new district attorney and Gotham's proclaimed \\"white knight\\" Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who swears to clean up the corruption running rampant in Gotham; no matter the cost.<br /><br />Epic in scope with brilliant direction from Christopher Nolan (whose orchestration of an opening bank heist is nearly flawless), The Dark Knight takes us places that superhero or comic book-based films rarely take us.  It's an intelligent, dark, and surprisingly violent ride that features wonderful performances from nearly everyone involved, and the handling of Dent's tragic descent is as memorable as almost any thing else featured in the film.  However, it is the performance of Heath Ledger that really puts The Dark Knight on such high a plateau.  Ledger's Joker is by and far the best treatment of a villain you will ever find in a comic to film adaptation: he's sickly funny and incredibly frightening in a performance that truly is for the ages.  Bale himself seems more comfortable in the role of Batman, and is by far the best Caped Crusader to grace the screen. Eckhart is fitting as Harvey Dent, and his tragic transformation into Two-Face is, as said before, respectful and believable.  Everyone else, from a returning Michael Caine as trusty butler Alfred and Morgan Freeman as the brilliant Lucius Fox, are small miracles by themselves.<br /><br />All in all, The Dark Knight is certainly the best Batman film to ever see the light of day. So good in fact, that one will wonder just how Christopher Nolan and co. could be able to top it.  With a downbeat ending that sets things in a new and different direction for Batman and his crusade against crime, who knows? The best may still be yet to come.est Batman film to ever see the light of day. So good in fact, that one will wonder just how Christopher Nolan and co. could be able to top it.

159102594X|4.0|The first book in a new series. Probably the most realistic fantasy Book I have read in years. The main characters are Gritty and slimy, easy to like and easier to hate. almost a character study but the action sequences are splendid. If you enjoyed any of the Dave Eddings books you will enjoy These books. The Second book, \\"Before they are Hanged\\" is better in many ways then the first and while the third book is not out yet I have great hopes and even higher expectations. So, I got my copy of \\"last argument of Kings\\" and read it in 1/2 a day. At first I was dissapointed, but then as I thought about it I realized that I really liked it. The characters stay true right up until the end, no last minute repreives or deathbed repentence but solid right to the end. A really good series, not great, but really good.

0345494997|5.0|Frank Lloyd Wright's home and studio in Oak Park is on a spacious street that boasts several of his houses, two blocks from where I grew up.  That street never loses its charm, though I've walked down it many times.  Next door to my family lived a Frank Lloyd Wright impersonator/ expert who would don his black cape and wide-brimmed hat to give talks at some library or historical society.  \\"There goes Frank Lloyd Wright,\\" we would say whenever we saw Mr.Shepherd.<br />  Now I regret that I never took advantage of the opportunity to learn about FLW from my neighbor's lectures, because due to this book, Loving Frank, I have become fascinated.  Why was I never curious before?  Evidence of his genius is all around Oak Park, and geniuses are often obsessive and tempermental and fascinating, aren't they?  Horan bring FLW to life as a sensitive yet arrogant creative genius, basing a lot of FLW's character and dialogue on FlW's actual writings and ideas.<br />  We see him through the eyes of his mistress, Mrs.Cheney.  I was fascinated with her from the start also, curious to learn about her relationship with FLW, how she made that difficult choice to leave her children, and also because I heard about her tragic ending from my dad, when I was telling him that there's a new book about FLW and the mistress Cheney.  He said, \\"Oh, yeah, you know that she-----?\\"  No I didn't; thanks, you spoiler!  But actually, knowing her fate increased my curiosity.<br />  I found her to be a complex character, who had to follow the love of her life, yet felt guilty and missed her children every day.  I couldn't help but sympathize with her as a reader, because we are so much inside her head throughout this book.  Horan portrays her as a gentle intellectual who becomes involved with the feminist movement in order to defend her right to see her children and be treated equally as a divorcee.<br /><br />I loved going through the ups and downs of FLW relationship with her, asking, is it worth it?  The situation was always so precarious, financially, socially, emotionally.  I couldn't put this book down.n was always so precarious, financially, socially, emotionally.

B000MXPE7O|4.0|This is a well made film, unfortunately overlooked despite its star ensemble cast and production. Clocking in at 168 minutes, it probably would have made a better mini series.  Robert DeNiro does a great job directing this.  However the casting of Matt Damon as a man who gives his life up for the CIA was perhaps not the most inspired choice.  I agree it's hard to empathise with him, but I saw that as the limitations of Matt Damon's acting abilities.  Taciturn and not particularly expressive, Matt Damon also hardly ages much across the decades that this film spans - he's too constant and thus never progresses as a character.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the movie is engaging - even though it could have benefitted from more tension.  As it is, the DVD's deleted scenes reveal entire sequences that would've made the movie even longer.  Given the film's multiple subplots, leaving these scenes out didn't hurt.  To sum up, The Good Shepherd plays/ reads like a book, and for those confused about the plot...watch it with subtitles.  The ensemble cast makes it worthwhile - Angelina Jolie does a great job as does William Hurt, John Turturro, Alec Baldwin, and everyone else.<br /><br />DeNiro may have been trying to channel his Cold War version of the Godfather here, but this is a slow burn and Damon is no Pacino.  Still, a sterling movie and monumental effort from a screen legend.
0743486285|5.0|I didn't know I was going to enjoy reading about someone's drug addiction so much! I am not an addict and its not something I ever thought I would read about in this type of forum but I like Motley Crue and Nikki.    I think what makes this book so interesting is that it seems so honest. Nikki didn't hold back (or at least he didn't appear to) on some nasty details about what he was doing. I realize he wrote these journal entries while he was using but he didn't skimp on publishing some of those details.    The second thing that I enjoyed was the things people that were in Nikki's life at the time had to say about him NOW. And then he of course snaps back a few times as well. It's almost as if having people who were there comment on his journal entries provides more backing to the things Nikki had written, it not as if all this stuff was only in Nikki's mind, it really happened.     Anyway, this inspired me to seek other books about bands from the 80s that I like, such as Slash's autobiography (which I highly recommend as well). If reading The Heroin Dairies helps someone with their own addictions that's awesome, and that may have been Nikki's point of publishing his journal entries.

0756404746|4.0|I tend to avoid High Fantasy these days. With a few notable exceptions, I tend not to like it very much at all. When done well, it's a lovely lovely thing. When done badly, it's more tired than tired and hardly entertaining.<br /><br />I picked up The Name of the Wind because it seems to be loved by-- well, by everyone. The book starts with three pages in tiny print of rave reviews, all from very Serious Names in Fantasy. Generally speaking, anything this well hyped disappoints me, but some of those raves were from people I like well enough to give it a try.<br /><br />I'll say one thing for sure, I really enjoyed it. I stayed up all hours reading it and was honestly pretty disappointed to find that the next book isn't due out until April. And that only in hardcover.<br /><br />I don't, however, love it as much as many of its fans seem to do. I found it extremely good, but not great. To me, there were a number of flaws which seriously diminished my experience of the novel.<br /><br />First, the Prologue annoyed the spit out of me, and very nearly caused me to put the book down. Rothfuss is a very rich writer, and it tends to be well done and not overdone in the rest of the book. But the pompous mystery around the three silences was too much-- a much simpler opening would have been better in keeping with the book, I found. As a result, I found myself suspicious and waiting to pounce on any purple prose for the first long section of the book.<br /><br />Second, I did get a little bit tired of Kvothe-the-Prodigy-at-Everything. Although in places this worked very nicely to set us up for genuine humor, in others it merely felt trying. It also didn't play very well together with Kvothe's economic circumstances, of which so much is made during his school days. I had the feeling that Rothfuss had to do some pretty heavy-handed things with the plot (Rich Boys Are Evil!) to explain why someone as talented, musical, etc. etc. as Kvothe can't seem to earn a buck. Prodigies do exist, for sure. However, I think that they're more interesting when their bounty in one area is a study in contrast to what they lack in others.<br /><br />Third, Denna seemed to me to be utterly unappealing. Perhaps this is because I'm a woman, myself. I found her more unreal than affecting-- kind of a fantasy Nadja-- and that made me trust the other characters just that little bit less.<br /><br />These flaws shouldn't talk you out of reading the book. Particularly if you like Epic Fantasy, this is a very good current example of the genre. Rothfuss writes well. I wasn't particularly put off by the length. The outsider-goes-to-academy theme is tried & true, and this is a decent example of same. I'm certainly interested enough to pick up a copy of the next book in the series.<br /><br />I will admit that I'm a little perplexed by all the gushing praise. But different strokes for different folks, right?they're more interesting when their bounty in one area is a study in contrast to what they lack in others.

B001BKG9SK|4.0|This most recent release by David Gilmour and company is both thoughtful and diverse.  This culmination is a derivative of David's 2006 solo tour in support of his latest release, \\"On an Island.\\"  The tour produced two major pieces, \\"Remember That Night\\", a two DVD set of the concert performed at Royal Albert Hall and the most recent release \\"Live in Gdansk\\"<br /><br />Both works are completely different with the former including supporting guests such as Steve DiStanislao, Richard Wright, David Crosby, Grahm Nash, David Bowie and Robert Wyatt.  The later maintained Steve DiStanislao on drums, Richard Wright on keyboards, Dick Perry on Sax, Guy Pratt on Bass, Phil Manzanera on guitar and support from the Baltic Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />Live in Gdansk, as we have come to expect from other Pink Floyd works, has brilliantly integrated old and new, and managed to mix visual arts, politics and history with musical expression.  This piece provides us with a rare glimpse of vintage Pink Floyd performances such as Echoes and Astronomy Domine while sharing new works such as On and Island, Red Sky at Night and The Blue. In between it all there are tid-bits of classic PF music that is sure to bridge the generational divide with the likes of, Comfortably Numb, Shine on You Crazy Diamond, Wearing the Inside Out and High Hopes.<br /><br />The concert managed to supported David's latest solo effort, provide some familiar PF material and most importantly celebrate the anniversary of Solidarity in Poland.  The four disc box set is designed with the fan in mind, providing glimpses of David playing Saxophone along side the Baltic Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, lights, lasers and fog, 5.1 Dolby digital surround sound, 2 CD's, 2 DVD's with live footage from studio sessions, UK Barn Jams, and 10 Audio only songs from the On An Island release. The DVD's also provide behind the scenes footage of the concert, concert preparations and historical views of the area.  David and company also provide free downloads of bonus material accessible through the DVD and your PC.  Another notable is that the CD set and the DVD's are not mere reflections of each other, both have different title selections and track listings.<br /><br />The package is well thought out, customer centric and a must have for David Gilmour and Pink Floyd fans alike.

B001ECE6C6|5.0|Anna Maria's beautiful voice is marvelous throughout this album and the creative interpretation of Pat's and PMG's classic tunes make this a must have for any Pat Metheny fan. Pats' playing on this album is spirited, uplifting and technically marvelous. As a whole the album flows and has nice balance between Pat's and the PMG's tunes reinvented with Polish lyrics and also traditional Polish tunes that are highlighted by Jopek's incredible voice. Now that this album has been released through Pat's and PMG record company, it is available in the US without having to pay for an import album from Poland. In short, this beautiful album is a must have! 3 incredible bonus tracks (1 studio/ 2 live) including 2 Pat solos on nylon string and synth guitar - Simply Awesome! Also a shorter tune with the soprano guitar. Highly recommended!

0307346609|5.0|The book is written as a historical documentary of the war against the zombies, AKA World War Z. It is made up of perhaps 125-150 stories, each focusing on a particular individual. Thruout the individual tales, the larger narrative becomes clear, but because of the manner in which it is told it conveys a sense of realness I've never experienced in any zombie book or movie.    There are numerous individual stories which would make for quite a good movie, but by focusing on some many people of different ages, backgrounds, careers and opinions, it avoids the typical cliches that all zombie movies are forced by design to include. I think this would make an excellent movie but only if it is filmed as a documentary. As I read the book, I was reminded in particular of of the documentaries we've seen in the past few years about 9/11. Some of them have focused on the plane which crashed in PA and the fight of the passengers with the hijackers, but most focus on the day as a whole. The better ones do more then then rehash what happened, with recreations of the terrorists in hotels in Paterson, NJ, they let people tell what they saw, how they felt, and they reacted. It's more about what happened to all of us, then what happened onboard those planes or inside the twin towers.    This is why this book is so successful. Rather then focus on the specific details, we learn how it affected people personally. I would gladly pay $10 to see this movie.
B00154GEFU|4.0|Two points here first:<br /><br />1)  As a young'un I was a huge fan of the first release \\"Asia\\".  It's the biggest reason I got into 70's progressive rock and discovered Yes, ELP, King Crimson, Genesis, UK, etc.  As much as I loved \\"Asia\\" (the album), I admit after discovering the original bands Howe, Wetton, Downes, and Palmer had played in, I realized \\"Asia\\" was a watering-down of their musical abilities.  There was little in any of the music of \\"Asia\\" that taxed their respective talents on a level equal to early Yes, ELP, etc.  BUT, there was a feel and energy with the first album that helped negate the complaints of how \\"de-progged\\" their music had become.  These guys appeared to be enjoying playing together, writing simpler songs, and enjoying the merits of executing them well.<br /><br />2)  For most of the folks pulled into Asia (the band) by their first or second album, the drug-on-too-long, Geoff Downes version wasn't ever really \\"Asia\\".  And that's the simplest reason why they were so easily \\"closed down\\" and replaced with the \\"original\\" line-up.  John Payne (from the Downes-led, new version of the band) must have felt a bit of sting in the announcement that the original line-up was pre-empting his work and use of the Asia name, but I'm sure lots of other folks (including me) didn't care so much.<br /><br />So, I'll mostly look at the CD in comparison to the work from the original line-up.<br /><br />And how is it?  Well, as some review mentioned, it's kind of like meeting up again with an old friend.  They look familiar and sound familiar, but they've aged a bit, slowed a bit, and mellowed a bit as well.  The good news is it DOES sound sort of like the same musicians who made \\"Asia\\" (the CD).  It just sounds like they're not quite as nimble and spry.  The BAD news (for me, maybe not so many other folks), some of the songs have lame lyrics (not a first for Asia) and are obviously-crafted pop tunes (not a first for Asia either).  But, Wetton's voice soundsgood, Howe gets in quite a few licks that sound Howe-ish, Downes gets to use some big bold brassy synth patches, and Palmer keeps a steady beat, not unlike his earlier role in Asia.<br /><br />So the classic Asia elements are there, just in a version diluted a bit from the first Asia album.  As well, the music has been arranged and mixed to focus more on Wetton's voice.  On the first Asia album Wetton's lead and multi-tracked backing vocals were catchy and clear, but the arrangements let the instruments take prominence as well, and there was better balance between vocals and instruments.  On this, the guitar and keys do occasionally come out front, but not as often as I'd like.  Unfortunately, a lot of the keyboard and guitar work seems frequently just complimentary background for the vocals.  Lastly even the recording, mixing and mastering seems \\"nicer\\" and less aggressive than the first CD.<br /><br />As a side note, it's interesting to see that 2 of the songs were written entirely by Steve Howe (no collaboration).  Part of the reason Howe left the band in the early days was he felt the band was getting too commercialized and his music was getting squeezed out for album selection by the more radio-friendly Wetton-Downes tunes.  Appropriately, the 2 less trite, less poppy songs on here are the Howe-penned tunes.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for something with a similar (though not exact) feel to the first couple Asia albums, this definitely delivers.  It just doesn't do so with a boatload of energy.  As for Asia videos let me recommend the \\"Live in Tokyo\\" DVD from the 2007 tour over \\"Live in Moscow\\".  For a group of geriatric rockers, they pull off quite a nice show.
B00005M989|5.0|I agree that Prince has way too many hits to fit onto one CD, but this is a nice collection. Usually there are 1 or 2 songs on a CD that I skip over, but not on this one. I enjoy it from beginning to end.
B00000IL26|1.0|I LOVE the music on this CD.Lee Morgan was fantastic on this album.Unfortunately,I can't listen to this disc or any other that Rudy Van Gelder re-mastered during the later stages of his career.I have a very good 2 channel stereo system(Nad C325BEE integrated amp,NAD C515BEE Cd player and Polk Audio Monitor 70 3-way tower speakers).These speakers are well balanced in tone and VERY neutral and NATURAL sounding.EVERYTHING I have played on this system sounds GREAT except for the two BlueNote cd's I recently purchased that were re-mastered by Rudy Van Gelder.I think he was starting to lose his hearing in this later stage of his life and the ability to hear the higher register sounds is usually the first to go.The cymbals are way TOO BRIGHT just like the horns in the upper registers.Very harsh and grating.It's like someone drawing their nails across a chalk board.I will NEVER buy another CD that was re-mastered by RVG for Bluenote later in his life.Anyone who has a good sound system with revealing speakers should avoid all these later Bluenote discs that were re-mastered by RVG.What a shame!
0684857219|2.0|I have bought many bodybuilding books and this one is not very good. Here is why:  1. It's large and heavy - it's very difficult to keep this book on your lap and read. The only option is to put on the table. If you would like to take this book with you to the gym, or sit comfortably in a chair and read it - forget it, your arm will fall off.  2. Book is filled with photo's - if you enjoy the history of bodybuilding - this could be fine. But I expected photo's just to illustrate the exercises, not the review of American bodybuilding, especially from 20-30 years ago. Better make a dedicated book with photos and instead in this book provide clear examples for exercises.  3. Programs are not easy to adapt if you are starting bodybuilder and there is not enough variety to fit into your needs.  I expected clear and simple programs with variations depending on my particular needs. There is a program and it's hard to figure it out how to properly change it for my needs.  4. Nutrition is a very short chapter at the end. I expected more advice and examples which would make it easier for me to understand and adapt. For example program Body for Life offers very easy instructions for meals and protein drinks etc. As far as easy to understand exercises with good and easy to understand photo's I found that Joe Weider's book is much better (and a bit lighter)...

B000KKPN5C|4.0|This little flash does a great job with even exposures for a Nikon D-40.  Aiming the light up and bouncing it off even 17 foot ceilings will allow for nice soft lighting.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Except for the writers trying to morph Rory into a trollop in her casual beginnings with Logan and the fact that Rory is still something of a whiny, spoiled girl at times, the fifth season was another great one. I have truly missed this show since it went off-air. Since I was only able to purchase the first four seasons a year ago, FINALLY getting my hands on this season was a reminder of why it was such a tragedy that Amy Sherman-Palladino left after the sixth season and the show fizzled in the seventh season. Lots of fun and even more crazy only-the-Gilmores moments fill this season and make it worth watching again (and again).
0132350882|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone that wants to write better code.  I used it on a recent project and another programmer said quote \\"many parts of your code are sophisticated in a manner that makes me admire you.\\"    The extra tools that this book gave me helped my already good code look admirable.
0156029065|4.0|If you like history, here medieval history, historical fiction and Forrest Gump, you'll love Eco's Baudolino.  Young peasant, Italian boy Baudolino stumbles upon Holy Roman Emperor Barbarossa in the forest as the Emperor begins a campaign against Italy.  The Emperor, childless, according to Baudolino, is taken with the lad and more or less adopts him.  Thus begins his great adventure.  This is Baudolino's story as he recounts it to a Byzantine official whom he saves during the sacking of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade.  But is it true?  Maybe.  Unicorns, the kingdom of Prestor John, holy grail, fake relics, the drowning of Barbarossa, Baudolino is everywhere in the late 12th Century.  Consummate liar?  Probably.  But he and Eco weave a hell of a story.  Fun read.  Keeps you entertained from beginning to end.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Eward Norton gives a wonderfully understated performance in this historical romance set in Vienna at the turn of the century. He plays a marvelous magician who has fallen in love with a daughter of the aristocracy intended for marriage to the nasty megalomaniac Crown Prince who regards her as a ripe fruit worth picking and then throwing away. How will he win her? By magic obviously.<br />Norton is backed up by a superb performance by Paul Giamatti as a cynical police chief trying to advance his career without entirely giving up his morals. Jessica Biel as the female lead is innocent and lovely.<br />In some ways, this movie is a harmless piece of wish-fulfillment and fantasy rather than an actual exploration of historical themes. But the acting is so good, the photography (the movie was all filmed in the Czech Republic) so lovely, and the music by Philip Glass so haunting that it somehow all works.<br />At the heart of the movie is a mystery never explained: how does the illusionist work his magic? His feats move beyond conventional illusion into the realm of the supernatural. Yet we accept it because the movie has woven its web so well.<br />First-class entertainment!

B000025AJM|5.0|There is still much confusion as to which CD release has the best sound.  After having researched the various CD issues and re-issues of \\"In the Court of Crimson King\\" I feel I should pass on what I have learned.    The 30th Anniversary Edition (issued 1999) - side two is from an original master tape while side one is from an inferior higher generation tape.    The Original Master Edition (issued 2004+) - both album sides are from original master tapes.    \\"The original masters - with splicing tape still present between the various songs, and crossfade between I Talk To The Wind and Epitaph yet to be created - were discovered in the Virgin archives in 2003.\\"    \\"The word I've heard is that the master tapes were basically rolled for the new Original Master Edition (OME) without any tinkering at all.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Though there have been some exceptional movies so far this year there but there have been few which I would call a classic. With WALL-E, things have just changed. WALL-E isn't only the best film of 2008 so far, it is a pure masterpiece. From start to finish, the film wraps you in utterly delightful charm and humanity. WALL-E is a piece of inventive beauty and wonder unlike any other that you will see at the cinema this summer. I absolutely guarantee it.<br /><br />WALL-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is the last operating robot on Earth. As for the human race, they left 700 years ago, when the huge amounts of self-produced trash caught up with them. WALL-E's task is to clean up the planet for the return of the humans. However, after being left on his own for so long, WALL-E has developed a personality. He is curious about many of the items that he finds whilst compacting trash, such as an old tape of the musical \\"Hello Dolly!\\" But he is also becoming lonely, which is understandable for someone who only has a friendly cockroach for company.<br /><br />However, all of this changes with the arrival of EVE (voiced by Elissa Knight). Thought EVE is initially hostile towards WALL-E, this doesn't stop him from becoming smitten with her and trying to connect with her. However, EVE has come to Earth on a classified mission. Once that mission has been completed, EVE shuts down and waits to be taken back from whence she came. When her transport arrives, WALL-E can't bear to lose his friend and sneaks aboard. His search for EVE brings him into contact with the remainder of the human race, who have been taking refuge on a huge spaceship and who have become excessively reliable on machines to supply their every need. They don't even walk. However, WALL-E's arrival sets many events in motion which may help the human race to return to normality...<br /><br />First of all, WALL-E's animation is flawless. However, as with the rest of the film, there is also a sense of risk and bravery which adds extra dimensions to the glorious animation. The first moments in the film, which show us the beauty of the stars before swooping down to gaze upon a barren and deserted Earth, are so detailed and emotionally engaging that you are immediately sucked into the tale without any hesitation. Even when the story becomes more traditional (that is in no way an attack on the film), the creativity and power of the film's visuals never falter.<br /><br />The main focus of the plot is on the growing affection between WALL-E and EVE. This is one of the most moving romantic relationships in years. No, they're not even human. But watching the initial conflict of EVE's determination and WALL-E's innocence slowly mix into love and companionship is magnificent. The scenes between the two characters on Earth are simply wonderful, perfectly paced and confident in the set-up of this unusual couple. However, the best scene comes in the second half, when WALL-E and EVE dance through space together. Everything in this scene is perfect, the comedy of watching WALL-E propel himself through space by use of a fire extinguisher, the lovely visuals, Thomas Newman's marvelous score and the interaction between the two characters. When WALL-E looks likely to float off into space after the fire extinguisher runs out, EVE flies in and scoops him up in her arms. This scene is pure cinematic genius. Overall, there is a humanity and grace of execution in the relationship between WALL-E and EVE which elevates it far beyond the emotional impact of other romantic relationships.<br /><br />The term of \\"cinematic genius\\" can also be applied to the iconic character of WALL-E and the fantastic direction by Finding Nemo director Andrew Staunton. Staunton shows that he is willing to inject some risk into his movie-making if it makes a better film. This decision pays off magnificently here. Staunton has lovingly constructed this film with invention, depth and bravura, and in doing so has crafted a piece of movie making which is likely to go down as at least a family classic. Not only will children be enthralled by the sheer brilliance of this film, but other audiences will also be open to its bewitching magic.<br /><br />As for WALL-E himself, he is one of the most original movie creations in years. Speaking in sequences of robotic speech (bleeps, whirs, etc.) with only small moments of mechanical dialogue, the filmmakers have still managed to create one of the most human characters of the year. By mostly using his eyes, the animators are able to flawlessly display WALL-E's emotions. In one scene, his eyes droop with sadness when EVE calls him Wally. When he panics or is happy, his eyes rise in an outburst of emotion. The life that the filmmakers are able to find in such simple mannerisms is incredible. Even the beeps and whirs, provided masterfully by legendary sound designer Ben Burtt, increase an already rich and lovable character to terrific heights. The character of WALL-E is just superb, as is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />WALL-E has just raised the bar for future animated movies. Pixar Animation Studios has already crafted many animated classics. WALL-E joins them without question. The visuals are compelling, the characters are endlessly endearing and the story is told with beauty, wit, imagination and humanity. I couldn't have asked for more.at least a family classic.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|At first I was little unhappy but after my third time thru the album I was very impressed. I grew up listening to Metallica and was afraid they had lost their touch but I am happily mistaken. The album brings back their grungy metal sound and also shows their maturity as musicians.  Simply put...Metallica is still untouchable.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This is one funny movie. Just when I thought I had seen everything, something new came up. I laughed just as much the second or third time I watched it.
0767847431|5.0|6/5. Definitely the best of the three. The story is coherent (well, almost) for a start. The dialogue and the writing generally are much better than the other two. Clemens was/is actually a good writer. The acting by the blue-eyed Arabs was better: Baker and Law were almost convincing. You felt a bit sorry for Baker, and Sinbad was very noble, and knew how to treat a lady. Good accents: I suppose when they were speaking Arabic they had English accents. The monsters were all great, as usual, and I felt real sympathy for the poor little homunculus. Everything was put together well. We had the gold mask of Agamemnon, the dhows of either the Persian Gulf, or the Suez Canal, Allah was with us, Hindu temples exploded, Buddha smiled, and Kali (actually she looked more like Siva, Lord of the Dance) danced and flashed a lot of scimitars. Finally we ended up at the Fountain of Youth (straight out of Rider Haggard's \\"She\\"), which, blow me down, was in fact centred in the middle of Stonehenge, which in turn was in Aladdin's Cave, populated by fairly small green men, as well as a combination Greek cyclopic centaur. Sinbad got around. There were some good lines. I actually laughed when the idle merchant's son got the shock of his life when he was told he had to work. Through the entire tale there was an extremely tense undercurrent of suspense: was Caroline going to fall out of her bodice before the end, or was she not? No spoilers here. The only bit I didn't understand was how the villainous Tom Baker failed to win the battle when he was both invisible and had regained his youth. Still, there has to be a bit of mystery in this genre.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This album brings back the classic sound of Metallica, while still sounding fresh at the same time.  When I listened to it at first I just partially enjoyed it. I then listened to it a second time later on and found that I just had to get used to a slightly different sound. The Unforgiven III track was the most enjoyable new song for me besides track four. I believe that track four is being played though on the radio already.  All in all this is a good album.  I'm a pretty die-hard fan of Metallica. I've owned all the albums since \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and \\"Ride The Lightning.\\" If you didn't like St. Anger, your not alone. Most didn't either. Don't worry that it might just be another St. Anger Album, it's not. What was missing in their last album is fixed. The Spark has returned.  If you really enjoyed Metallica, and the way that they used to sound, definately get this album.  If your just in the market for something different, but don't know what to get, get this album and you just might find the CD you've been looking for.
B001B1T7BU|4.0|John Hughes'  (\\"Sixteen Candles\\", \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\") live-action remake  (directed by Stephen  Herek) of this beloved Disney animated classic is long on slapstick and other types of physical humor. It's easy to see Glenn Close's portrayal of evil dog-napping Cruella De Vil as a Disney variation of her manipulative, scary (and best-remembered) roles in \\"Fatal Attraction\\" and \\"Dangerous Liaisons.\\"  Glenn Close keeps Cruella close to her original cartoon origins, going deliciously and delightfully over the top. Clearly, Cruella is another Disney Witch.<br />To emphasize this point, there is a scene where Cruella, draped in lion skin, gazes at her reflection and says, \\"Mirror Mirror on the Wall, Who is the Fairest One Of All?\\" Hugh Laurie (of TV's \\"House\\") portrays one of Cruella's criminal cronies. It is great fun to watch assorted animals (dogs, racoons, rabbits, birds, pigs, etc.) rule over evil, but stupid, humans who attempt to kill or abuse them. Joan Plowright (\\"Nanny\\")  and the always dependable Jeff Daniels (\\"Roger Darling\\", human pet of Dalmation Dog Pongo) are  featured as two of the more kind humans.<br />  I'm very glad Disney has released both the original animated and live-action versions  (Which I have wanted for a  LONG time) of \\"101 Dalmations\\" on DVD. If you are a fan of the original animated version, you will likely enjoy the live-action remake as well. The two versions perfectly compliment each other. My favorite line of dialogue here comes towards the end. In the police wagon, Cruella screams at her  three criminal cohorts, \\"Outwitted by a bunch of animals! You three have just one the Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals in the Morons Olympics!!\\" Jasper then asks, \\"Who won the Gold?\\"<br />  The Sequel, \\"102 Dalmations\\", however, should be AVOIDED, by ALL means.

0060557818|1.0|Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors. Unfortunately, he has a little problem; he's got a successful career in multiple mediums, winning awards and selling millions of copies of his novels, comics, and now films. This has led to the translation of EVERY work of his having a planned adaptation into other mediums. Neverwhere was a nice little low-budget BBC miniseries, and it worked well as that. It was basically Sandman-lite, but it had its charm. Now, since Gaiman has proved himself as  a competent author of comics, novels, and scripts, it also HAS to be a book and a comic series. Similarly, Stardust was a nice novel, and it got a great movie. Now, there is a comic adaptation on the way, even though it was already an illustrated novel. WHY?<br />Encouraging his behavior by buying it in multiple forms is going to kill Gaiman artistically: rather than coming up with new material, we will be flooded with translations of the same old work over and over again. Case-in-point: his failed script for a children's cartoon series, Interworld, was published as a half-baked 180-page children's novel, with poor grammar and poor editing, in hardback for $14. Luckily, I borrowed it from a friend, because had I bought it, I would be infuriated.<br />Don't humor Gaiman in his artistic constipation; he's a GREAT author. Sandman, Mirrormask, Good Omens, these are TRUE CLASSICS of their genres, and the man has the potential to change film, comics and literature, if he only continues to create original content. If we allow him to coast in his career by simply cashing in on his already made franchises, he will fail to make an impact. True fans of Gaiman, stay away from this, and all other remakes of his work.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is truly a Guns N' Roses greatest hits collection. It perfectly sums up the band's entire career, with it's core members. There seems to be a problem with the tracks Geffen (record label) chose for this compilation. I noticed more than half the 1-2 star reviews rated so low simply because it didn't contain the tracks THEY wanted it to have. Keep in mind, this is a Greatest Hits package, not a Best Of.. meaning a collection of hits that were at one time released singles by the band launched to radio/MTV by the label. I couldn't agree more with this list, with the slight exception of a song that was a single but ommitted here.     Appetite for Destruction: (1987)  Welcome to the Jungle  Sweet Child O' Mine  Paradise City  *Three singles off that album.--two others off the album include It's So Easy and Nightrain, but were not included due to spacing on the album.*    G N R Lies: (1988)  Patience  You can't expect much attention to an EP on a Greatest Hits album. This was the only release from this album anyway. -and acoustic at that.     Use Your Illusion I: (1991)  Live and Let Die  Don't Cry (Original)  November Rain  *These are 3 singles off that release. There are videos for songs off that album that were not released as singles such as The Garden, Garden of Eden and Dead Horse. That is why those aren't on there.    Use Your Illusion II: (1991)  Civil War - the final track in GNR's career to feature Steven Adler as   the drummer before being replaced by Matt Sorum. There is no video for this single.  You Could Be Mine - notably off The Terminator II  Yesterdays  Knockin On Heaven's Door- though the second single off that album, no video was officially made for it. The song Estranged was another single and video released, but as with the 2 others off Appetite, it was left off due to spacing. Too bad, it personally enjoy that song, as it's one of two of their most progressive tracks. The 2nd being Coma off UYI I.    *For a good Best Of compilation of the two Use Your Illusion albums, check out [[ASIN:B00000DAHK Use Your Illusion]].    The Spaghetti Incident?: (1993)  Since I Don't Have You  Ain't It Fun    *Probably 2 out of 3 songs on here that non-GNR fans may not be familiar with. Though singles, not much airplay these days. Both covers off this cover album. Ain't it Fun didn't have a video, unlike Since I Don't Have You, which is their final video...to date.    Interview With The Vampire Soundtack: (1994)  Sympathy For The Devil - (the 3rd of the 3)    This cover of The Rolling Stones song (1969?) released as a single, the final featuring Slash on lead guitar, was indeed their... final single with Slash.  Released in 1994, it was supposedly the final straw that broke the camels back, so to speak, for Slash. According to Slash, Paul Huge, the backing guitarist, who was Gibly Clark's replacement after Axl fired him, recorded a guitar part over Slash's guitar part without his consent. Slash finally had it, and supposedly quit right after. Congrats Axl!! Huge isn't even in the band anymore. (oh how things work out the way they do) anyway, Axl and other sources claim otherwise... I'm not writing this to discuss the matter even further. Ok, the acutal soundrack is rare to find in stores, so Geffen decided to stick the song as the final track on the album. Listen to the guitar parts and decide for yourself. Back to the compliation.    Other than the removal of those few tracks because of space (Geffen chose to have a single disc release rather than a double one) I have no problem with the songs chosen for this release. They are hits. Sure, as a GNR fan myself, I have my personal favorites and could come up with a Best Of collection, based on personal preference. Doesn't make this album horrible. Horrible enough to rate so poor, unless you hate the tracks themselves.  There are some other poor reviewers who stress the fact that Guns N' Roses were \\"unorginal\\" as more than a third of the singles on here are covers. Well, that may be, and a 5 songs out of the 14 are in fact covers. Knockin' On Heaven's Door (Bob Dylan), Live and Let Die ( Sir Paul McCartney), Ain't It Fun (The Dead Boys), Since I Don't Have You (The Skyliners) and Sympathy For The Devil (The Rolling Stones). Why they were released as singles...they're good covers. But Guns N' Roses have very good original material and were definately more than the average hair/glam metal bands that erupted out of the 80s. The Illusion albums prove this.     Also as mentioned in other reviews, you should purchase this set for one of three reasons.  1. You want a Guns N Roses album but want only one. A non-fan who wishes to expand his or her collection of music. This is perfect for that collection.  2. You are a die-hard fan, like myself (one of my favorite rock/metal groups) and want to support that group by purchasing anything that is released by them, even complilations like this here.  3 You plan to give this as a gift to a non-fan in hopes of him or her becoming one. (A reason already mentioned by a very helpful review on this product.)    In conclusion, I highly recommend this album. I believe it is unfairly given the Explicit Lyrics tag on the title. The only song on the album worthy of this tag would be Ain't It Fun, for its rebellious, carefree lyrics, smaking the \\"C\\" word in the middle of the song. Still recommended though. Unfortunately there is not a lot on the inside, such as band photos (only one on the inside and one on the back both in black and white), no tour pictures, and other extras. Geffen must have used all that for their live compilation [[ASIN:B00003003S Live Era '87-'93]]. All the credit is given, band members, song/lyric writers, for each track, as well as pictures of each album cover by Guns N Roses. Because of this I was tempted to drop the rating a little, but it didn't bother me much (since I own the rest of the albums) but only whole stars are clickable on Amazon, not pieces of stars, therefore it rounds out to a full 5 stars.    Hope you enjoy!!!!!

B001CD6FKS|4.0|the title says it all. i was never a big speed racer fan... i watched and enjoyed it when i was a kid (as well as gigantor and astroboy) but i didn't watch it religiously. that being said it feels just like the show. the star of this blu-ray are the incredible visuals. this is very colorful like dick tracy or johnny depp's version of the chocolate factory. in other words a showcase for your video setup.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is an extraordinary movie, full of small moments and a sweet sense of promise. It manages to convey the growing attraction between the two main characters without delving into the bag of Hollywood cliches. The relationship that develops is realistically complicated, and doesn't take the shopworn path to a happy ending.    The music is also fantastic, and all the more appealing because it was written and performed by the principal players, not in bombastic musical-theater style, but organically within the course of the story.     It's a beautiful film that will stick with you and hold up to repeat viewing.

Reminds me of vintage russian animations (if you've ever seen \\"Masters of Russian Animation\\" it's the same feel.)  An instant classic. Can't wait for my copy!
0375826726|4.0|Compared to P's last 2 books this one is a great improvement. A lot of the boring junk has been slimmed down. Although it could use more fight scenes the ones it does have are great. I'm kind of disappointed in the ending, it really was not what i thought it was going to be but it was still good.    If you've read his  last two books you should read this one.    I can't wait to read his next book just so i can see how much his story telling and writing skills have improved
B000AMPZF8|5.0|A very excellent album. This Muse cd is probably my second favorite Muse album behind Absolution, although in my opinion, you really can't go wrong in buying any of their cds.
B00111N180|3.0|Digital Fortress offers up nail biting suspense but only with characters that could have used greater development. The heroes and villains lack depth and complexity but nevertheless follow a plot line that is interesting and informative and with occasional surprises to make this an overall good read.  Since a lot of thrillers seem to follow this formula I didn't really fault this book too much for the above mentioned defects.
B00005OMTT|5.0|\\"People talk too much for what they have to say, words without meaning... they are fading away.\\"<br /><br />And so, this is music at times invigorating, at times relaxing, but at all times captivating and thought provoking.<br /><br />Good to dance to, drink and read to, make love to and eat to and meditate on.

0375826726|4.0|Okay, after reading the reviews, and writing the below 'review' I finally read the book and guess what - I really enjoyed it!  So I went out and bought it and am looking forward to the final installment. It is true that I wondered how the battle went on pause while Eragon went off to the Dwarves, but all in all, it was a good read. So an old dog can learn a new trick and learn to change the previous opinion. Just shows to go you that one should not allow negative or scathing reviews to sway one overly much. I am glad I gave it the chance and read it because I liked it very much. Good on you, Christoper Paolini! Now get cracking on the final one!!    I think reading the reviews of Brisingr is better than slogging  through the book!  I loved reading the *spoilers* and am very happy to save money by not buying the book!  Many of the reviews were a hoot!  Let's predict what will happen in Book 4:  Eragon goes off with Arya to some eternal life Elf Land; Murtagh will come out from the evil spell Galbatorix put on him and he will once again be 'good' and marry Nasuada.  Maybe Roran will have to be King.  There, now I don't care how long it takes Paolini to write the 4th book.
B001DRF84W|3.0|The special effects in this movie make it a \\"I wanna see it\\" flick. The storyline is ponderous at times and altogether predictable.
0975991477|1.0|I casually bought this book assuming it was based on science...what a mistake!!! The author uses terms such as \\"energy\\" in the loosest and most irresponsible way...He draws lines where in reality there are none, in order to equate \\"wave\\" and \\"quantum\\" energy to mean the \\"healing energy\\" in some alternative medicine therapies.  He further equates quantum physics to \\"mysterious\\" and \\"unexplained\\" paranormal phenomena...not to mention debunked and unverified phenomena! But the efficacy of alternative healing is not even questioned in this book-it is presented as effective and unresearched.  The author expects the reader to make a leap of faith-if you accept quantum physics, then you must also accept alternative healing- based soley on the misuse of terms.  What a joke!
0823023494|4.0|It's valuable to know how a professional approaches character development. I believe that initial hurdle of creation is an obstacle for many artists and this book helps get over that. Working without a model is very intimidating. If you are in this situation, this book will help a lot. There is a reason those animated characters are so appealing and funny. This author tries to tackle that difficult subject. This book is definitely worthy to own. The way you tell a good book is by the knowledge you walk away with and your desire to extend that knowledge in your own way.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Believe what everyone else has said.  The story and the acting (lots of names/faces you'll know) is top notch.  I rate this as some of the BEST television I've ever watched; the other shows being Our Friends in the North and Life on Mars (both also out of the UK).<br /><br />You'll be hard pressed to stop watching till you are done and you'll hate that it is over; however, it is one you can watch a number of times.  Brilliant - TV at its best.
B000TXNK64|5.0|If you love the blues and you've got a turntable, you owe it to yourself to buy this album. Steve Hoffman and Kevin Gray have captured every single \\"whine of the twine\\" in this guitar tour-de-force. The band fills the listening room, meaty and powerful, but all the instrumental textures are clear and beguilingly present. A wonderful job all-around from this extraordinary mastering team--and a little old band from Texas.    Be aware that the \\"worst\\" review applies to a remastered CD issue, not to this treasure. Rest assured that this is the original mix, straight from the analog two-track master, sounding better than it ever has before.

0307387178|5.0|I read this book years ago and picked it up again recently.  What a great read!  It explores youthful restlessness and a describes very accurately the desire many of us have to break free from the shackles of society and \\"live\\" for a little while.  This feeling is a yearning for something dangerous and adventurous (whether climbing a glacier-covered mountain peak alone in Alaska or setting off on a cross-country journey with nothing but the clothes on your back), without worrying about the consequences.  This sentiment is very common in younger people (e.g., Chris McCandless was about 22 when he began his odyssey).  This book is great for anyone looking for a fun book to lose themselves in, and who are either young or young at heart.    I have not seen the movie yet, but the book is great.  I'm interested to see just how accurately the movie tracks the book.
B0009GV9LO|5.0|There are many wonderful recordings of Tosca and you may already own a good selection, but this is worth adding to your collection. Giacomo Aragall is in his prime. Although he had a voice of consummate beauty,a handsome dramatic presence on stage,and sang at all major opera houses, his discography is not as large as he deserved. Eva Marton and Ingvar Wixell are both excellent as is the conducting by Daniel Oren. The production is large scale befitting the Verona Arena. A very satisfying performance.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|As much as I loved the first film that Christopher Nolan directed, \\"Batman Begins\\",\\"The Dark Knight\\" surpasses it in casting (Heath Ledger and Maggie Glylenhaal replacing the wan Katie Holmes) and script!!  Although the late Ledger deserved the rave reviews for his Joker, I believe Aaron Eckhart also should be mentioned for his Harvey Two-Face--talk about the arc in the character!!  His guilt ridden obsessed rage near the climax of the film was as strong as Ledger's performance.  Christian Bale's acting was a little weak compared to Ledger and Eckhart but there is so much to recommend about this film that I'll still get the Blu-ray when it comes out.  Definitely recommended for super-hero fans and non alike!! On a further update to this review, I've rented the Blu-ray edition of this film and it's outstanding, in fact even better the Hi-def version of \\"Batman Begins\\" which was excellent also.  Some of the scenes are in the 1.78 ratio and others are letterboxed in the 2.41 ratio, so please don't be disconcerted by this!!  I intend to buy the Blu-ray version asap!!

B000G8NY4U|5.0|I have been a fan of Yanni for many years and this dvd, like all of his others is excellent. You really get your moneys worth.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is the best movie of 2008 and the best adaptation of a comic or graphic novel ever. Period!  The action and drama start right away and they never end.  The screenplay was excellent. The imagery and cinematography was exceptional, especially considering that this superhero, is mortal and there was little help from CGI.      For the fans of Batman this movie will not only hold it's own but it will engage you and hold you right to the end.  I really does honor and improve upon anything Frank Miller intended for the Dark Knight.  For my wife, brother, friends and all the other non-believers the entire movie captivated them.    I don't believe in giving away the plot, there are enough reviewers that do that.  This movie deserved all of the hype and accolades it received and so does the late Heath Leger.      This is a great movie for anyone who even remotely likes action, drama, psychological thrillers or even horror.  This is the only movie this year that I believe deserves a 5 star rating.

B000Y179KO|3.0|I have been an Eagles fan since they first came out. This is a good album, but it isn't great. Don't expect the same edge and punch as in their '70s work. This is a softer, gentler Eagles, and I was  disappointed. It is a keeper, and I will play it, but not as much as their original works.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Iron Man breathes new life into the Marvel movie universe.While most marvel movies nowadays involve some young hero out trying to find himself while trying to save the city at the same time,Iron man takes a more sophisticated and more adult approach.While there is a considerable amount of time dedicated to Tony Starks's Ingenuity i.e. building suit prototypes,weapons aand ect, good filmaking and an excellent script make this a rather enjoyable process.Any doubts about Robert Downey's acting are put to rest by this movie,as this by far is one of the strongest performances of the year.Very suprising was the lack of sexual content and graphic violence which usually defines movies as \\"good\\" nowadays.Iron Man is a rare breed of action film in many respects,a lack of pointless and graphic material ensures that anyone in the family can enjoy this film and a good script and plot round out any beliefs about this film being yet another hormone driven teenage flop.
B000I0QM0E|4.0|This is a great movie, and it doesn't dissapoint on blu ray.  Tim Burton's cinematography is superb as usual, and Depp and Ricci do excellent jobs, as do the entire cast.  This must have been a blast to work on this movie with all the talent involved.  Buy it and watch it again for Halloween.
0920668372|3.0|I agree with much of what everyone else wrote. It is beautiful and reduced me to hiccuping tears, which is exactly why I didn't read it to my child. I will give it to her when she is old enough to get it and not obsess that I will be getting old and dying someday.   I wasn't bothered by the \\"creepy\\" scene that one reviewer related. I didn't really take that literally, but more figuratively to show the mother's love not abating with time. I know that I will never ever lose the desire to hold and caress my child, no matter how big she gets. I didn't take it as the author suggesting that a mother would sneak into her grown child's home, because she'd failed to cut the apron strings. What normal adult man would allow that? lol!  I think this book does a great job of showing the painful and consuming love that a parent has for her child, and the sweetness of a child's love in return. Maybe the subtle message is that the love we give to our children comes back to us.   I still think it is way too heavy for a child, but I love it for myself.

B00005JPO1|5.0|The first disc starts off with \\"The Return of a Legend.\\" With the final shot of [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)]], Steven Spielberg assumed that he was done with Indiana Jones but five years ago fans started asking about another film. It was Harrison Ford who expressed an interest in revisiting the character and kept after George Lucas and Spielberg. This featurette takes a look at how this new film came together.<br /><br />\\"Pre-Production\\" examines the preparation and planning that went into the project. Spielberg wanted to maintain the same look as the previous films. We see Ford getting outfitted with his iconic gear while Shia LeBeouf says that Spielberg gave him three films from the 1950s to study in order to get a handle on the time period that the film takes place.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with the impressive \\"Production Diary: Making Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\\" It is broken down into six featurettes or can be viewed all together for a feature-length look at principal photography: from the first day to the final one. For Spielberg it felt like no time had passed between films. This is a detailed look at shooting in key locations of the film: New Mexico, Connecticut, Hawaii, and four soundstages in Los Angeles. There is plenty of on-location/on the set footage as we see Spielberg and co. at work.<br /><br />\\"Warrior Makeup\\" takes a look at the make-up job done on the warriors that guard the temple that houses the Crystal Skulls.<br /><br />\\"The Crystal Skulls\\" examines the legend behind them and the mystery of how they were made. Stan Winston and his team created the props for the film and we see how they were constructed.<br /><br />\\"Iconic Props\\" takes a look at some of the gear used in the film - who uses it, when its used, and its source.<br /><br />\\"The Effects of Indy\\" examines the digital photography and matte paintings done in the film. We see the scenes that were enhanced by CGI and how the final product was achieved.<br /><br />\\"Adventures in Post-Production\\" takes a look at editing phase. Spielberg shot and edited on film, the latter of which is rare nowadays. Editor Michael Kahn talk about the challenge of working on this film while Ben Burtt shows how he created some of the sounds used in the film.<br /><br />\\"Closing: Team Indy\\" is a brief montage that pays tribute to the cast and crew of the film.<br /><br />\\"Pre-Visualization Sequences\\" features the rough, CGI footage for three seqeunces from the film that gave the filmmakers an early look at what they would look like.<br /><br />Also included are five galleries of artwork, production stills and behind-the-scenes photographs.<br /><br />Finally, there are three trailers.oduction\\" takes a look at editing phase.

0375826726|4.0|I loved this book, however while I was reading it, I forgot that Brisingr is the third of four books. I thought it was still a trilogy, so I was extremely irritated and dissappointed that the book I had waited so long to read was not the end of Eragon's story. But I enjoyed Brisingr so I look forward to the fourth and final book!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|After three years, months of overwhelming hype, and a tiny dose of scandel, The Dark Knight was finally released in theaters nationwide and open the flood gates for what would become the biggest film since Titanic first sailed into theaters almost eleven years ago. Going far and beyond a simple comic book film, The Dark Knight is a twisty, layered crime drama that delivers on all fronts.<br /><br />Taking place directly after Batman Begins left off, we find the Caped Crusader making quite the impact on the city of Gotham. The once powerful mob has been all but erradicated and slowly the city is now reclaiming its former glory, thanks not only to Batman but also the new district attorny Harvey Dent, who is just as determined to clean up the scum of Gotham, with Bruce's love intrest Rachel Dawes assisting him in his quest, both professional and romantic. The dreams that Bruce Wayne's father once had for the city now becoming reality with every passing day. But alas, in the world of Batman, nothing good last forever. Out from the recesses of Gotham's mean streets come the sadistic and elusive criminal known only as the Joker. Armed with just a pocket full of knives and a devilish sense of humor, he seeks to destroy everything Batman and Dent have tried to build and bring it all crashing to the ground.<br /><br />So what can I possibly say about this film that others have? For starters, I do confirm that the film was definently worth the hype, to a point. While I agree with all the reviewers, my one problem is that, although the movie is good, the whole action and comic book aspect of it all seemed to have been skimmed out compared to the last Batman movie. And like many before this, the film does suffer from what I call 'movie jet lag', and by the last hour or so of the film, you find yourself checking your watch more often then before waiting to see when it might be over. I just feel that Lee Smith (the film's editor) could have cut out about twenty or so minutes worth of film and then it would have truley made the movie very powerfull by the last frame.<br /><br />Other then those few comments, the film, as a whole, is absolutly superb and definently one of the best of the year so far. Christopher Nolan and Jonathon Nolan successfully weave in numerous subplots and characters without feeling convulted or bogged down. Each actor potraying their role to a tee, with the obvious stand out, of course, being the late Heath Ledger's role of the Joker. Completley immersing himself in the role, he makes Jack Nicholson's potrayel to seem buffonish, and thank god for that, cause a villian like the Joker truley desrves a great performance and Ledger delivers on all fronts, from the voice, the twitchy movements, everything just works. Bale is able to hold his own through out the whole film and Maggie Gyllenhaal acts as a pleasant surprise in filling in for Katie Holmes, which by the way I will say that I am one of the rare few who didn't think she did a bad job in the role. But hey, that is just me.<br /><br />No doubt Ledger will be on the short list for Oscar consideration, but who's to stop there? I see no reason why this film should go up for some of the even bigger awards like Best Picture, Directing, and Screenplay, who agrees with me? Cuase lets face it, it has been a long time since we've had a major blockbuster in the forefronts of the Oscar race, the last of which I am referring to being the last Lord of the Rings film.<br /><br />There really is nothing else I can say about the film because, like stated before, everything has already been said and I would basically just be repeating everyone elses words. What you have to do is see for yourself, which by the way if you haven't seen the film yet, where have you been this whole time? Anyway, see the film for yourself and judge for yourself. But one thing is for certain is that you'll be treated to something that is far more then just a comic book movie, but an experiance that comesaround only once in a decade.
1932100660|5.0|This is the best nutrition book I have ever read, and I have read many.
0061537934|5.0|I love fiction like this. Fiction that is this well told, with well developed three dimensional characters, and a story that is thoroughly absorbing.<br /><br />The story is told in the first person. The novel twist is that the first \\"person\\" is a dog named Enzo.  Enzo is an astute observer of his master's life, and has a lot of wisdom to impart, if only someone could hear him.<br /><br />Who knows if dogs really think this deeply, and wax poetic about life's ironies and victories and tragedies? I like to think that they do.<br /><br />Enzo loves his master, Denny, a race car driver, very much. He thinks that Denny is amazing. His loyalty and love color his observations as he watches Denny navigate some enormous life difficulties and personal tragedies.<br /><br />What would your dog say about you if he could speak? How do you know his small gestures aren't an effort to communicate his love and support and insight to you?<br /><br />This is an engrossing and heartfelt book, and makes it onto my list of all time favorites.<br /><br />C.A.Wulff -
B000K4WPCC|2.0|basically its a b movie that was made with a list price.     4 rich guys with super powers contend with some other yuppie who wants their powers. that's about it. nothing else, or even that, is remotely interesting.     the rich warlocks go around using their powers for anything, which btw, every time they use them they grow prematurely older. which perfectly explains why they use them for trivial things, such as lock picking, and car maintenance (which includes front windshield repair.) sure its addictive, but still is nonsense.   reminds me of merlin's shop of horrors.     o the dragon ball energy ball fights were freaking amazing. not good amazing, but i almost fell out my chair laughing amazing.     luckily i bought it from a bargain bin ($5). but its not really worth that price. not memorable, and coasters come in better styles.
B0006399FS|4.0|Though the music is entertaining (see other 1300+ reviews) I am disappointed in that the disc did not contain instructions for dismantling an atomic device. That kept me from rating it 5 stars. I apologize that this is a brief review, but I have the pressing issue of an atomic bomb ticking away in my basement and need to act fast. In retrospect I should not have paid for expedited shipping.
B00004RF97|4.0|Just an old fashioned love story... coming down in multi-harmony. Cary Grant & Katherine Hepburn are the stars but the winner of the Academy Award is James (Jimmy) Stewart (Best Actor). The movie opens with Tracy Lord (Haven at the time)(Kate Hepburn) throwing her husband out of house & home. When she breaks a golf club over her knee, C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) can't take it anymore. He wants to hit her but gives her the 'pie-face', instead!    Tracy Lord is such a snob she can only see the faults in everyone else, not herself. She's set to remarry, this time to to George Kittredge (John Howard). On the eve of the marriage the editor of Spy Magazine, Sidney Kidd (Henry Daniell), sends a reporter, Macauley Connor (James Stewart), & photographer, Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) to do an expose on Tracy's cheating father, Seth Lord (John Halliday).     The dialog is fast & there's quite a few zingers along the way. In the end Tracy gets her comeuppance & gets the man she's always wanted. This film saved the career of Hepburn, made Stewart a star & Grant would still be big.

0307341550|2.0|I hate to give this book a bad review but to me this book is too dark and too weird. The story being about a little girl killed and one gone missing should have given me a clue. Mysteries are my favorite but this just wasn't my cup of tea!
0679720200|5.0|I was told by a really good friend of mine to read this book. Looking in a bookstore on vacation, I came across it. It was cheap so I bought it, not really knowing anything about the story or what I was getting into. But I trust my friend's judgment, so I went ahead and read all of 'The Stranger' this afternoon. WOW is all I can say. The language and storytelling is so simple, so effective, that I got wrapped up in the world that Camus was engaging me in.    It reads like Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye', at least in my opinion. He tells the story so clearly. It's one of the most concise books I've ever read. It is quite depressing, but you oddly feel sorry for, and relate to the main character. I feel an odd sense of hope after reading it, and for people that hated it, I can't see what they're talking about. The story will engulf you and not let go until the end. Highly recommended!
B000E1YVZU|4.0|When I received the movie it seemed to be very well kept...It was like brand new
B001E95ZNI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It introduced three themes and developed each one well: a long-standing friendship that abides in crises, the battle between good and evil, and betrayal.    Ed Harris co-writes, directs and stars. He is Virgil Cole. Viggo Mortensen portrays Everett Hitch. Cole and Hitch hire themselves out to restore order in lawless communities. They are something like (a slow motion) Batman and Robin in western garb. Hitch would be Robin armed with a bazooka-like shotgun and always coming up with the erudite vocabulary that Cole can't quite recall. The Cole-Hitch relationship is the friendship theme, done brilliantly.    A reptilian rancher, Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) resides outside of town. He murders three lawmen in the film's opening scenes and leads a gang of cowboy thugs who terrorize Appaloosa, a thirty-horse town in New Mexico Territory--1882. Cole and Hitch are determined to bring Bragg to justice for the murders. This is the good versus evil part.    The betrayal part features Renee Zellweger as Allison French. French gets off the train at Appaloosa armed with a lot of charm and a single dollar. She quickly captures Cole's heart. She, however, likes to share her affections with the multitude. But, as Cole puts it, she bathes every evening and can play the piano. Enough said.    The cinematography is spectacular. This is big sky country, New Mexico style. The sets have a most authentic feel. Every actor performs with great skill. Even a mountain lion manages to capture a sense of wonder.    I feel that any criticism (yes, the pace is sometimes slow) is nitpicking. This is a great movie.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This workout is great, I did it 3 - 4 days per week for 1 month, but along the way developed horrible left knee pain.  No one move sent me over the edge, it was progressive, I now have an arthritic knee & have great pains with changes in the weather/barometric pressure.  The exercises are simple & remind me of basic gym class moves as a kid.  It is easy to follow with great prompting.  I cannot believe that Jillian's \\"no excuses, there's no modification\\" for many moves, I am 20 pounds overweight, but anyone carrying greater amoounts af weight must really be hurting their knees.  I've given the DVD away, it was just harmful to my knee.

B0001M0A4I|1.0|I loved Genesis back in the day. I heard one of the pieces from this cd tonight on the local classical station. Earthlight. At first I thought, this is okay, kind of lightweight, but okay. Then it began to shift in tone, melody: Vaughn Williams one minute, Claude Debussy the next ... no development, no reason for things to change ... kind of the worst aspect of new age music repeated over and over. I have no idea what Tony Banks involvement with the cd is ... but this music is just a bunch of pretty wanking ...

While I enjoy all forms of classical music, sometimes the sound of a lone piano just sounds right.<br />Others have opined that this is the best complete set of Schubert piano sonatas available. I cannot say that with a certainty because I don't own any others. What I can say with a certainty is that if you order this set, you will not be disappointed. The beauty of music is its ability to soothe, awaken, and transport the listener to a place other worldly - a place that is uniquely his/her own. This piano music does just that - it is the vehicle by which you enter another world. A world that is Schubert, Kempff, and yours. What a great place to go after a tough day at work!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|A classic in every since of the word.  The movie it'self is great and I have introduced this film to my nieces and nephews who love it too.  It's timless and just a good film.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I'm afraid to say I am extremely disappointed with the product, since I can not watch it!!  It will not play in the UK it is an American copy and is not compatible, surly when it was being shipped the sender would have known this   What was the point of sending it??
6305308659|5.0|I know it's kinda leftist and preachy, but I loved it and it touched something inside me.  So I'm a bleeding-heart liberal...whatever.  But the movie does make some great points about the stiff and unrealistic crap the 50's tried to paint everyone into. (80's kid here...but I've seen plenty of 50's TV and I know my history)  I love the idea of this film and how...just as in the real world...as color TV came to be...so did a more open minded world.  I've read some negative reviews and most just complain about the ideals this film portray...but hey...it's a free country for a reason folks.  I do appreciate that most reviewers admit the acting and effects of this film are good...it's just a great film all around IMO and I would recommend it to anyone...regardless of your political ideals.  Try putting those aside while watching.  Either way it will spark a reaction and that is what art is all about.

0142412147|5.0|Jubilee's Christmas Eve is ruined when her parents are put in jail and she is unable to see her perfect boyfriend. After her train wrecks and she is stranded at a Waffle House with 14 cheerleaders, she opts for the lesser of two evils and follows a charming, yet heart-broken, boy home.  Tobin, JP and the Duke find themselves in a race to the Waffle House with Twister before the dastardly Retson twins can spoil their plans. Little does Tobin know, what surprise awaits him when he arrives.  Poor Andie is mourning her loss of her caring boyfriend when an unexpected angel gets her to change her perspective on life.    These three tales were absolutely amazing. I finished this book in 2 days and was very, very happy with it. They had me laughing out loud at some parts, and the stories were intertwined in a way I didn't expect.
B00143WLH2|5.0|Because these reviews are cross-posted this is a review of ISBN: 0517123207, with a cover that was defiantly made to be provocative. It depicts an (ape) allying view of going from all fours to upright. If this is what you are looking for then you need to read \\" 2001: A Space Odyssey\\" by Arthur Charles Clarke.<br /><br />This is a quick review of the book not a dissertation on Darwin or any other subject loosely related. At first I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\" (see my review). I figured the book would be similar. However I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.<br /><br />Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).<br /><br />If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)<br /><br />The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing. If he had more time and space he could prove this and that. Or it looks like this but who can say at this time. Or the same evidence can be interpreted 180 degrees different.<br /><br />In the end it is worth reading and you will never look at life the same way again
B00007K02F|1.0|Here's a clue..the company didn't even see fit to put the two real actors on the cover of the movie!  Why?  Maybe the actors didn't want their faces associated with this dog.    I don't expect a film based on Jane Eyre to be totally true to the book (although, the Timothy Dalton version comes the closest) but I do expect it to at least tell, basically, the same story.  This film does not even come close.    Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) has one expression which never changes throughout the entire movie.  William Hurt is not appealing, in any way, and seems like he decides to marry Jane because he has nothing better to do!  In fact, in the scene in the church, where it is discovered that Mr. Rochester already has a wife, he leaves Jane standing there and takes off for home without a backward glance. But that's ok because she doesn't seem to care either way!    There is absolutely no connection between these two supposedly \\"star struck\\" lovers.  They both seem like they couldn't care less what happens.  Frankly, the viewer doesn't either.  I found it hard to sit through at all.  I kept waiting for something to happen that would draw me in and it never did.    Most of the interesting scenes in the book were totally cut out--not even a hint.  Instead of Jane discovering that she has family that she didn't know about (St. John Rivers and his sisters) they incorporated St. John into a sort of goofy parson on Jane's dead uncle's estate. Why bother with him at all?    If you have read Jane Eyre, you will be shocked that this movie even has the same name as the book.  If you haven't read Jane Eyre and are looking for romantic entertainment (or any entertainment for that matter) don't buy this movie.    If you want a stunning movie with beautiful scenery, awesome music and characters who seem to be living the part, get Masterpiece Theater's version of Jane Eyre with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson.  [[ASIN:B000LPQ6DE Jane Eyre (Masterpiece Theatre, 2006)]] It is the perfect balance between being very accurate to the book but also entertaining and even more romantic than the book; not beyond some humor too.      Remember, this book was originally written by a young woman for young women.  It has some rather ridiculous scenes in it. The Masterpiece version has actually improved on the book in many ways; making it more real and more interesting to adults.    If you want total accuracy to the book, get the film with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  [[ASIN:B000784WMW Jane Eyre (BBC, 1983)]]
0132350882|5.0|Very clear and thoughtful set of practices.  My team began implementing the discipline described in this book, and the resulting code is easier to both maintain and transfer to new developers.      My favorite part: The first few chapters give solid, practical reasons for good coding practices -- great ammunition for swaying other developers to follow practices you intuitively know work.  :)

B0015D3YQI|3.0|This was my second dip into the Argento pool.  I had recently watched \\"Tenebre\\", one of Argento's best from what I can gather.  I was worried about a let down because I enjoyed that film so much.  So I prepared myself.  I read some reviews and took some advice.  The results of my preparation were a mixed bag; some good, some bad.  So, I appropriately lowered my expectations but hoped for the best.  What I learned about Argento from watching \\"Phenomena\\" was that perhaps his biggest weakness is his clumsy story telling.  Let me get to the point, hopefully quicker than \\"Phenomena\\".<br /><br />-IF YOU WANT TO BE IMPORTANT, YOU HAVE TO LOOK IMPORTANT.<br />Argento has a knack for making everything look so important that you are glued to the imagery on the screen.  \\"Phenomena\\" is full of long, stylish, detailed, seemingly important scenes.  Every scene has a sort of leisurely pace to it.  I began to assume that if I didn't pay attention, I would miss something.  Eventually, this became a chore.  After about 70 minutes, there had been 4 fairly unremarkable murders and yet we were no closer to knowing who the killer was.  When it was finally over, I scratched my head and thought, \\"Did I miss something?\\"  So I watched it all again.  It turned out that I hadn't missed a thing. Most of the movie was not nearly as important to the plot as its treatment would have you believe.  The result was an overly arduous, not particularly meaningful journey for a brief and crazy end.<br /><br />-SO, WHICH STORY DID YOU LIKE?<br />Even though most of the movie was treated with overwrought and unwarranted importance, nothing that happened could be declared useless.  But there were so many things that were given importance I wondered which thread of the story was the one that mattered most.  How important was the generous time spent on the entomologist's theories?  What role would the girl's talent with insects play?  Why is the school so important?  Does the hot but nasty teacher hold any significance? Was that time spent at the bank warranted?  It turned out that all of the unique threads had very convoluted and somewhat ludicrous connection to how the film ended.  I was forced to invest effort into all of the deceptive threads resulting in disappointment at their ultimate lack of importance.  The worst part about it was that most of it wasn't particularly exciting or interesting.<br /><br />-AT LEAST THE T-SHIRT IS OK. (Content could be interpreted as spoilers)<br /> So I went through all this effort on stuff that varied in importance because I couldn't be sure what really mattered.  My reward for all of this was an ending that bordered on cheating.  It turns out the murders were committed by someone we never met directly or were never given cause to suspect until they are revealed.  You could not possibly have deduced who it was because no meaningful clues were ever presented.  Luckily, the ending has enough wacked-out moments and lively pacing that at least some satisfaction is achieved.  However, that's only when compared to the rest of the films slogging pace.<br /><br />-JUST BE YOURSELF JENNIFER.<br />Jennifer Connelly and Donald Pleasance are the big attraction here.  Jennifer is very good at acting like Jennifer; a female Harrison Ford.  Donald scrapped his usually wonderful British accent for a nearly undecipherable Scottish accent.  There were other actors I won't mention though they were all capable for the most part.  The chimp (Yes, the chimp) was actually an interesting figure whose function is clumsily jammed into place.<br /><br />-SHE'S BRUSHING HER TEETH; CUE MOTORHEAD.<br />The music was wildly varied in style from scene to scene and just as wildly inappropriate in its placement.  We often get scenes of someone walking slowly with some crazy guitar rock grinding away in the background.  I can't say this had a big impact on me because I had bigger problems than the music to worry about.  It didn't help though.<br /><br />-SAY IT ISN'T SO!!<br />Some might be disappointed that there is no nudity and limited gore in this film.  I don't mind those things but it wasn't a major sticking point with me in \\"Phenomena\\".  I will say that a little more gore and nudity might have distracted me from the sluggish pace of the story.  Yet, I think it would have had limited affect.  Of course, the frenzied ending, which could be considered gratuitous, goes a long way to keep this from being a total loss.<br /><br />-VENUS FLYTRAP.<br />As I stated before, Argento has a talent for giving drama to the most mundane event.  Up to now, I really do like the overall feel of his films.  They have a very inviting visual style.  However, the enticing visuals could not enhance the plodding story enough to keep me interested or entertained throughout.  He almost fooled me into believing that what I was seeing was always important.<br /><br />-THE FLY ON THE WALL.<br />The fly on the wall knows the truth.  In all honestly, I didn't like the way this story was played out.  It was almost as if Argento had an ending in mind and then back-loaded the story to provide him all the pieces to construct his grand finale.  The grand finale was pretty compelling but the back-loaded story was clumsy and those pieces didn't always fit too well.  Why Jennifer's talent with bugs is important, why the chimp matters, why we spend so much time at school or in the bank and everything else was not nearly as important as the attention it was given.  No matter how visually compelling things were, the events taking place just weren't that big a deal most of the time.  Though Argento's talent is evident, the decent acting and visual aspects of this film were not enough to fix the convoluted story.<br /><br />Story.....2 stars<br />Acting...3.5 stars<br />Visuals...4 stars<br />Music....2.5 stars<br /><br />Average..3 starsited gore in this film.

B001BGTWXI|3.0|...judging by the fact that one of the most helpful reviews of this album is a negative one my assumption was either Slipknot went through a big change of style or they just mellowed out so much these supposed \\"maggots\\" just got bored and listened to IOWA all over again...surprisingly what I found was a lot of maturity from this band...they may have lost some of that edge that made them stand out...but in my opinion the style they have adopted now is much more complex if slightly more structured...but it's a very mixed bag...    .execute. 7/10: I tried to find a sample of this track and I got Rick-Rolled...it was hilarious...overall this is your usual bog-standard short Slipknot intro track with lots and lots of random sound effects shoved through a machine...nothing really special at all...besides the drum solo near the end of course...Joey really has grown alot since the debut by retaining his skill...somehow...    Gematria (The Killing Name)8/10: Starts off with another riff...this time not downtuned and much more noticeable...after playing around with the riff until we're bored the drums think \\"HEY!! I'll make it interesting!!\\" And play lots of double bass and then he doesn't stop while Corey sings...his low scream has now turned more into a random low rant...which doesn't have as much power as his previous incarnations...but the rest of the instruments have improved...so it doesn't matter...the guitar solo this time is beyond the average players ability (that being if they were self taught)...but it was surprising...that solo was bizarrely acessible and listenable for Slipknot...I think the people are right...they really are d/evolving...drums fantastic...guitar better...vocals losing interest...    Sulfur 8/10: Starts off with some good drumming and we have yet another riff...this time alternate picked switched between another 2 note riff...Corey is really starting to kill these songs...his vocals are just plain irritating now...which is a shame because the guitars have really evolved this time round...more varieties of sounds and much much more keys...the chorus singing is rather weak too...but I'm starting to slightly like the guitars now...even though they're mainstream and repeat what's already been done...at least they're trying much harder...AAAH!!! TURNTABLE NOISES!!! Silly Mr. Gasmask man...another guitar solo...which is nice to the mainstream ear I assume...just wish Corey would do something interesting...he sounds like he's in Stone Sour...    Psychosocial 8/10: Starts with a somewhat interesting guitar intro with a lot of whiney and lifeless high notes until they revert to a 3 note riff (oooh scary)...Corey's voice is as monotoned as it always was...but I'll admit his singing in the chorus isn't awful at all...but then they return to the verse and Corey goes on again \\"I'm monotoneous you should listen to me because I ate your cat MWAHAHAHAA!!!\\" No Corey...just...no...what follows is another guitar solo that follows the main rules of the previous solos...however...when it modulates to the key of the chorus the melody comes off quite powerfully...however one of the guitarists has the tendency to play as many notes as quickly as he could very boringly (word check)...this is pretty much what this song consists of...    Dead Memories 8/10: Starts with what sounds like an awkwardly familiar guitar riff...which I shall try and remember in due course...but I can honestly say I've heard it before...Corey's singing is a bit of a change after all the random shouting...but with this familiar riff I am reminded of...Stone Sour...the solo particularly...I didn't expect something so much like Stone Sour on this album and it's awkward to listen to...on the plus side the guitars try and stand out and the drums still manage some very nice double bass...but...Stone Sour? Ugh...and the solo is ok...I just wish they'd either be slightly more technical or slightly more melodic...they seem to be in the middle of both in ratings of performance and they should focus more on one or the other...like the solo in pulse of maggots that was randomly attempting to be technical...    Vendetta 7/10: Starts with an alternate picked riff (sound familiar?) the drums trying their all so hardest...keep going Joey...hmm...Corey seems to have attained a new singing style for this song...good? Well it's kind of country-like...so it depends if you really like that kind of singing or not...personally I feel that he's ripped off certain people by singing like that...not to say you can never sing like that without ripping people off...but the melody and the \\"heys\\" are frightfully similar...no guitar solo either...    Butcher's Hook 7/10: A very light hearted guitar riff with Corey guess what? Shouting monotoneously yet again...about nothing in particular...the guitars are trying this time...ow...the chorus is really really cheesy sounding...I can't correlate this song to any of their previous songs...I was hoping for a change but this song seems to go in the wrong direction...I'm pretty sure Slipknot fans don't want Stone Sour...and the guitar solo? Ok if a tad attempting to be noodly and failing as it just remains on the dominant notes of the key...    *Best Song*  Gehenna 8/10: Starts off in a sinister(ish) riff...as they begin to layer this riff...Corey enters in a talky voice...trying to sound weird and depressed again...I'm just so used to hearing people being much more depressed I can't accept him...but it's still a very pleasant sound...there's also a contrast with a very quick section of random shouting...afterwards he sings \\"I can finally be myself\\" and his singing begins...surprisingly switching key when you don't expect it which is a very nice surprise and keeps the listener feeling awkwardly happy...the guitar solo is alot more melodic than usual so I give Mick and Jim a happiness point for that...good work...    The Cold Black 8/10: Starts with a fast hasty guitar riff combined with an awkward synthesised guitar that briefly reminded me of Dream Theater but that quickly disappeared when I realised Corey was sitting on the sofa doing his shouty shouty voice...the drumms are still trying hard to stand out and succeeding very well...seeing as focusing on any of the other instruments at this point requires ten seconds of concentration...do you think Slipknot could play at Pianissimo? That would be interesting...a somewhat technical guitar solo...which is quite impressive this time so the song gets another point...HURRAH!! I haven't given a slipknot song under six out of ten...it's because I'm a pushover...    Wherein Lies Continue 8/10: Fast untoned guitar riffs...Corey's shout is slightly more interesting...maybe just because of the religious undertones...Corey's singing is pretty good...but now I can't stop comparing the singing to Stone Sour...well it's Corey's fault for being brainwashed by his first band...yes...I'm blaming Corey's singing by the band he was in...that's how stupid I am...    Snuff 7/10:...um...oh dear...an accoustic song that isn't interesting? I enjoyed Vermillion pt 2...in fact I gave that 10/10...for some reason...the guitars in this song are ok...Corey's singing is just too Stone Sourish for me...I guess I'm going to be attacked by Stone Sour for this...but I just dislike these really predictable voice tones...I know for a fact hardcore \\"I LOVE EXTREME SLIPKNOT\\" fans will hate this song...the phaser guitar riff has quite a good melody...    *changed my mind this song is better*  All Hope is Gone 9/10: Probably the most technical song on the album...the guitars do a very impressive song and the drums are also very very fast...Corey's voice is even quite bareable...the melody in the chorus is based around the guitars modulating key...which honestly I prefer over Corey's melodic singing in this album...a nice guitar solo fast and technical...overall a good closer...second best closer...for some reason Scissors can't be beaten...and it helped that it was a strong song on an album where most songs sounded the same...    ...now as you can see I gave most songs a high score...so why only three stars? Because no song stood out for me 100%...there were no 10/10 songs and most of the songs followed the same formulas...    Overall:    Drums: Alot more double bass and still amazing to hear...    Guitars: Another great improvement...more guitar solos and varieties on riffs...    Bass:...kind of non-existent on this album...I completely forgot it existed...    Vocals: Really down hill...melodic singing sounds more like Stone Sour and the shouts are much more monotoneous...    ...if you want to hear slipknot for what they're supposedly supposed to be then buy their previous albums as only four of the band memebers can be properly heard on this album...but if you want an album with mainstream vocals and mildly interesting guitar solos...then buy this album...    ...well that concludes my exploration of Slipknot for a while...now I begin to delve in to Nine Inch Nails...
0893860220|5.0|Like many seekers who've spent decades \\"searching and never finding\\", I have a bookshelf full of books that did nothing more then compound the growing frustration while attemptng to resolve the basic question \\"Who am I?\\".Everything in our culture points to the \\"mind\\" as the source of all solutions; if you \\"do\\" this you will \\"get\\" this, often brilliantly presented formulas (The Secret etc) that do nothing other than lead \\"believers\\" even further into more suffering and end up on the long list of failed efforts.So it was with great amazement that I discovered<br />the non-duality works of Nisargadatta Maharaj.If you are ready to end the futile mind based \\"paths to nowhere\\"search and discover the shockingly simple truth, read this book.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|A Classic Book ( short Story ) made into a classic movie.     This is one of those intelligent, thoughtful & disturbing dramas that stays with you such as \\"Long Days Journey into Night\\" or \\" The Pawnbroker\\".    There are no Zombies. There are no naked people. There is no gore.     There is great movie making & superb acting. One of Lancasters best...
B0006Z2KIY|4.0|I would whole-heartedly recommend this love-story to anyone who hasn't had a good cry in a long time.  It is guaranteed to turn on the old tear-ducts, as well as lift your spirits and inspire you that the romantic purism of monogamous lifetime love can be and is a reality, at least for this young couple, of whom James Garner's character is reading about. Without giving away the plot of the story, James Garner is a very noble and loyal friend to a lady in a nursing home, reading her a story that was hand-written and personal.  He never misses an opportunity to pick up where the story let off during her previous session-- sadly, she is suffering from Alzheimer's and it is a challenge for him to keep her interested in the story, although she is surprisingly receptive to it and is amazingly consistent in her following of the storyline.  It's like two  stories of two couples in one movie!   Scotty/Sioux City
B00168HARG|5.0|I bought \\"The Sarah Connor Chronicles\\" on Blu-Ray to give this new tv series a chance, since I am a big Terminator fan. I watched the first season on a big screen that I have at home and I just loved the blu-ray quality of the show and the quality of the series itself:    Every episode feels like an entire movie. The special effects are stunning, the actors do their jobs very well and the story keeps you watching and wanting more of \\"The Sarah Connor Chronicles\\". I should not forget, that I was very impressed of some musical elements of the show: The main theme is beautiful and Johnny Cash and Shirley Manson rock the show (meaning season 1 and 2).    The 3 disc blu-ray set includes outtakes, commentaries, deleted scenes and a 10 minute longer version of one of the last episodes from season 1. I keep enjoying the satisfying feeling of buying this blu-ray set for an incredible price at amazon.com .     I can recomend this show to anyone who liked Terminator 1 + 2. This show prooves, that you don't need an Arnie to enjoy this! A+    Note: I do hope that this show will get a third season, since 2009 will be THE Terminator year with this show and Terminator 4 coming to theatres.
B000RJO578|4.0|this movie starts off kind of slow, but if you keep with it you'll be duly rewarded with its hilarity.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|I was surprised to find that this was not just another formula super hero movie. Of course there were tremendous action scenes, and very evil villains, but the hero was different. The hero was intelligent. It was so refreshing to watch someone with great intelligence problem solve during \\"impossible situations\\". Also, although he starts out as a rebel with a bad streak, he experiences a major transformation and the audience gets to watch his character develop in a way that I found to be meaningful.<br /><br />Although the movie dragged a bit at some points, it became so interesting that I wanted it to keep going. In fact, I'm really looking forward to the next Iron Man movie (the plot totally calls for it so I'd guess it will happen).<br /><br />I would also mention that Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding. I've always considered him to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and he did not disappoint. Of course Gweneth Paltrow did an excellent job as well.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would highly recommend this movie, particularly to those who enjoy intelligent characters, action, sci-fi and good vs. evil.
B0000AK7AA|1.0|Within the first 5 mins. you hear \\"h*ll\\" and \\"d@mn\\" from one of the characters. Not a problem unless you were hoping to show this to a 5yr old. To be fair, it is a PG film but the it would have played just fine without the language. If families were Spielberg's target audience (who else would watch this), he had to know that the language would keep younger viewers out and that older teens might not be interested in Casper. It was just strange language to hear in a film strongly promoted as \\"family.\\" If you read the other reviews, you will see others noting this.<br /><br />Got to go now to watch Bambi's mother get wacked in a G-rated film (got to love the rating system).  :-)
B00005JPO1|5.0|If you want a couple hours of being totally entertained, I would recommend this movie. While I expected to see a boring, tired and old Indiana - Surprise - it was the total opposite. I totally enjoyed this film. From start to finish I was completely pulled in. It was non-stop action mixed with great story lines, outstanding actors, and plenty of humor.<br /><br />I've seen others object to the fantasy/sci-fi element. Yes, there were some things that were far-fetched, but that's typical of any fantasy/sci-fi story. Personally I enjoyed those imaginative twists, and found this to be a lot of fun.<br /><br />Harrison Ford was fantastic! I was so surprised by him. He's apparently in great shape and did many of his own stunts, which were totally believable. The introduction of Shia Labeouf was unexpectedly just right for this flick. I wouldn't have seen him as a rebel and a tough guy, but he made me believe. It was great to see Karen Allen shine as well.<br /><br />The action was tremendous fun and very exciting. I was never bored. The story was compelling and it made me care about what happens to the characters. Forgive me for using this analogy, but for those of us who grew up with the older Indiana Jones movies, it was like seeing old friends. Maybe you haven't seen each other for a while, but it's like you never parted.<br /><br />This was a completely satisfying and fun movie, and I'm hoping they continue with the franchise. I intend to see it again, and I highly recommend it to everyone!
B000244FDW|5.0|This version might be called The Purist's Version of P&P. I saw this when it originally aired on Masterpiece Theatre in 1980 and bought the video shortly thereafter. It is now worn out from repeated viewing, so I'm happy that the DVD is now available.<br /><br />Essentially, I think this version (vs. the Colin Firth A&E version) adheres to the novel better and to the spirit of Jane Austen. While I enjoy that version and Mr. Firth, it includes scenes not in the novel,  has a more modern sensibility and is more overtly romantic (though not as romantic as the 2005 version).<br /><br />I believe Jane Austen's words are the real joy of this version. They come alive and absolutely sparkle in the hands of these actors! In addition, there are two characters that I believe are distinctly better in this version: Lady Catherine is delicious and infuriating, and Mr. Collins is a comic gem of a performance. The first proposal scene is I believe word for word from the novel and played to perfection. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as accessible to modern audiences as Colin Firth's, but I believe Rintoul's performance is more subtle and closer to Austen's intent. I like the narration in this version giving voice to Elizabeth's (and Austen's) inner thoughts, which are always clever and insightful.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001DHXT20|3.0|I would agree with other reviewers who said this Hulk version is better than the last Hulk movie. However, unfortunately, for me this was a forgettable movie that was only mildly entertaining.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Edward Norton's work, and of course Liv Tyler is wonderful. The acting was fine, but the story was just okay. I never really felt very invested in the characters and I was mildly bored through much of it. I also found it predictable at times.<br /><br />The special effects were well done, but without a story that really pulled me in all the way, I walked out of the theater feeling unsatisfied. Also, I felt the special effects fighting scenes dragged on way too long. I'm a big fan of special effects, but this movie seems to be trying to get by on them along with some big name fine actors.<br /><br />Frankly, nothing I've seen comes close to the old TV series, and that was without all of the special effects. It featured good stories, solid writing and believable acting.<br /><br />Watching it once was plenty for me, and I'm the kind of person that will watch a good movie over and over. Bottom line: I would say to watch this if it comes on cable, or rent it once.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|The album starts out and i thought i was back in the mid 80's and metallica was breaking off a steel toe boot in my butt.  Hard rocking...thrashing, shredding.  I loved it....then song two starts and segues back into the black and load era's. Song three sucked majorly...song four was a ballady type song that goes hard in the end.  Basically the whole album other then the first song is a mix of what metallica does best and what they do worst....and that is singing.  James hetfield is a great METAL screamer/chanter.  He isnt a singer. Ever since the black album he has tried to sing and there are more ballads on every album.  He just doesnt do it well....it seems like he is trying to bring chicks into the metallica fanbase.  Why go radio friendly or metal lite.  DO what you do best....ROCK.  This album is way better then the beer coaster cd ST Anger.  But its to all over the place....hard , soft , thrash , soft , hard , grunge.  Dont try and please everyone , just do a metallica album.  Im not against groups/artist trying new stuff...but if your no good at it...go back to basics.
B001E1DJD4|1.0|This cd was way too slow for my tastes. Not that I don't like slow cause I do.  Its just that every song on the first cd all sounds the same.  I need a little variation. Lyrically it might be good, but I still have to be able to listen to it, which after a couple of songs was hard to do.  The reason, it all sounded too repetitive.  Sorry to disagree with the other reviewers, but it wasn't what I expected.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Even though I am a huge fan of \\"Dexter--the First Season,\\" I couldn't imagine a better second season. In fact, I'm going to need imagination-stretching exercises because all the people behind \\"Dexter-The Second Season\\" give us just that--a BETTER second season!<br /><br />An observation: Whoever determines casting definitely has an eye for borderline anorexic women with small breasts. Dexter's sister Debra, his girlfriend Rita, and newcomer Lila, an English woman he meets in a 12-step program and who becomes his sponsor for Season Two--all match that description.<br /><br />In Season One Dexter tells us over and over he is emotionally dead, but as the season progresses, Dexter truly develops feelings for Rita and her two children. In Season Two he no longer denies his feelings, making it clear how much Rita means to him. However, Lila's presence and declaration that she understands him moves Dexter off-kilter.<br /><br />Throw into the boiling pot the discovery of all Dexter's plastic bags of body parts hidden at the edge of the ocean's currents and the viewer has an explosive combination that keeps him/her on the edge for all of the second season.<br /><br />But I neglect to include Special Agent Lundy, who has come to Miami to solve the serial killer case after the plastic bag discovery. He always gets his man and in one scene in particular, I could not imagine how Dexter would escape being identified. But remember? I have an imagination problem. I was wrong. Lundy (wonderfully played by Keith Carradine) also plays a pivotal role in a sub-plot. Nah, I'm not saying.<br /><br />As the season nears the end, I am astonished to think that the program will end the way it seems to be heading. However, by season's end all loose ends are tied, and concludes, better than first season, with a promise of even better things to come in the third season.<br /><br />I've described the bones of Second Season, but not the flesh. Season Two is about relationships: lovers, friends, lust, love, co-workers. It is also about character development. I did not care for Dexter's sister Debra in the first season, but her character development made me become quite fond of her in the second. Lila's character becomes more and more annoying as the season progressea, but I did not like her to begin with.<br /><br />Sometimes the tension is thick enough to cut and once I actually screamed out loud! I scared both me and my cats! In one episode when Dexter drags a torso from one of his victims into the police department with Debra nipping at his heels, I kept thinking, How will Dexter get out of this?<br /><br /> Michael C.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|[[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]]People said the same thing about \\"The Blair Witch Project\\"; that is, the hand held camera made them nauseated. Get over yourself. It is an effective film technique that is used to highten the feeling of panic and escalate the manisfestation of fear in the film. I liked \\"Cloverfield\\". I thought the hand held camera was used to good advantage to help build the emotion and move the story along. It is appropriate to the characters running in the streets from a gigantic monster. It helps heighten our own fear and is appropriate to the situation. It certainly would not have been the same movie without it.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|This is a great collection of material and tribute to the heyday of 'Beatlemania'.  The remastered edition of 'Help' is very well done; a huge improvement over previous releases and a worthy addition to any Beatles collection.  The amazing Amazon promotional deal made this purchase a 'no-brainer'.
B00000DCH9|5.0|Of the three albums released between 1971 and 1975, \\"Piano Man\\" is easily the best of Joel's recorded output from that period. It is by far his most cohesive and polished of the three (\\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" and the following year's \\"Streetlife Serenade\\" are the other two), and it includes some of the best material in his catalogue.<br /><br />\\"Travelin' Prayer\\" is a mock country number set to a fast paced hodown rhythm as Billy, an admitted atheist Jew from Long Island, feably attempts to ask God to look after his loved one \\"far across the sea.\\" Though it seems like a filler track, it is actually a very solid number, and the structure of the melody and the way it is arranged on record is nothing short of amazing. The blending of the piano with the bass and drums is beautiful, and the banjo playing is awesome.<br /><br />Next comes the album's title track, which obviously needs very little to be said. Though Billy has done more complex and impressive material both lyrically and melodically, this song easily personifies Billy and is deserevedly his signature song. A true classic with rich lyrical detail and a timeless melody.<br /><br />\\"Ain't No Crime\\" is a gospel rave-up with beautiful harmonies and tough, rollicking rhythm. This song was a major staple of Billy's live set list in the 1970s', and was even more exciting in that conext.<br /><br />\\"You're My Home\\" is a beautiful, atmospheric ballad with great lyrics and some hugely impressive instrumental work. The guitar strumming on the intro is incredibly beautiful and one of the most complex arrangements Billy ever wrote.<br /><br />\\"The Ballad Of Billy The Kid\\" is probably the second or third most well known tune on the album after the title track, an epic tribute to the Old West with fantastic lyrics, a piercing, atmospheric melody and arrangement, and a raw, powerful Billy vocal. I've seen Billy perform this song live three times, but I have yet to hear a version match the unbridled passion and intensity of the studio version.<br /><br />\\"Worst Comes To Worst\\" is another, solid catchy albums that hold sits own against the album's stronger tracks. The lyrics are very clever and Billy's sly vocals adds an extra flair to them.<br /><br />\\"Stop In Nevada\\" is another epic number, a tride and true 1970s' folk rock ballad reminscent of Poco, Bread and various other bands of that ilk. There are many great lines in this song (\\"With some money in her pocket, she's a rocket on the Fourth Of July\\"), and the song paints a vivid picture of the longing and detemination present in the 1970s', especially amongst females of the era. Great song.<br /><br />\\"If I Only Had The Words\\" and \\"Somewhere Along The Line\\" are perfectly crafted MOR pop ballads, and should've been bigger hits than they were. The latter song sounds especially Elton John influenced, who at the time was the premier rock pianist until Billy hit his stride four years later with \\"The Stranger.\\"<br /><br />We come to the album's closing number, \\"Captain Jack.\\" Ah, how hard it is to put my feelings towards this dark, brooding masterpiece in the word. A darkly atmospheric attack on the decadence of the early 1970s' drug culture post-Vietnam, this song is arguably the best thing Billy ever recorded. With its grim singalong chorus and graphic imagery (lines about masturbation, nose picking and smoking pot), this song is an absolutely chilling experienece that is also a pure crowdpleaser in concert.<br /><br />\\"Piano Man\\" might not be a masterpiece, but it's definitely an exciting look at what was to come for the boy from Hicksville, Long Island.t\\" is another, solid catchy albums that hold sits own against the album's stronger tracks.

B000MXPE7O|5.0|That this film has only an aggregate 3 stars is yet further proof that there are a lot of \\"stringer\\" spooks \\"out there\\" that post at these sites, policing us and our film opinions to make sure that we are steered away from such a superb and impressive movie, a film easily as good as anything John Le Carre brought to the screen, and most know how he is highly regarded as the novelist of record for such \\"spycraft.\\"  This film is every bit as good as anything he's done, high praise since he is so superbly nuanced, and it's a great introduction to the historical character of James Jesus Angleton, whose life \\"The Good Shepherd\\" uses as its model, though not exclusively.  Many details of his life are closely reprised, though.    Though not that surprised, I was impressed that director and creator Bobby DeNiro had the chops, depth, and intellect to come up with such a compelling history of what's what at Langley.  The roll-up at the end included a note that he intends a sequel, and I can't wait to see what he has planned, since all signs would point to it having some of the most important suggestions about all the rest of the \\"what's what\\" in our current day, with this blundering behemoth known as CIA ( note that the main compound there now is named \\"The George H. W. Bush Center for Intelligence\\" if you any more need persuading as to the oxymoronic nature of that Beast ~~ Bubba gave the dedicatory speech in fawning adulation of Poppy, and you can see that treacle if you go to \\"our\\" country's \\"intelligence\\" agency website, archived in their press releases from the end of the Millennium.)     Though by nature the film will arouse a certain controversy, it is anything but boring, rather riveting, and certainly should be at the top of anybody's DVD list. ( If you combine its insights with a film that is inescapably related, \\"The Good German\\" with Clooney, you'll see why Keith Olbermann recently tagged one of his recent stories \\"The Good German Shepherd,\\" as a little levity poked at the peccadillos involved in each. )    Ever since the fascination that's developed out of \\"The Quiet American\\" of 2002, with Michael Caine in a stellar portrayal, and please read the background story on this by professor H. Bruce Franklin in The Nation, which you can find by googling \\"By the Bombs Early Light,\\" a reprint of that review, there's been a sharper popular focus on the betrayals of the American people by our own intelligence community.  Graham Greene was on to the whole thing, and the disaster known as \\"CIA,\\" way back when, since the getgo when he covered it in his unknown role as British Intelligence officer.     All in all, this movie is a crowning achievement for DeNiro, who plays the old OSS boss William Donovan, renamed here S\\"ullavan\\" for the sake of \\"covert\\" courtesy.  Seeing it will give you the flavor and feel of James Jesus Angleton, and others, who put their indelible stamp on the Agency and gave it the DNA that all Americans should hope to re-engineer into something less of a mutation, and more of a service. Much like \\"Gangs of New York,\\" this film gives an accurate sense of history through a collage of several characters mixed into one, an effect I'd call \\"Historical Surrealism,\\" since the truth is retained even though certain facts and events are mingled. The truth is distilled out of many into one, so that the fiction can be even more relevant, even in ways more accurate, than the sometimes more pedestrian realities. Many traits or qualities are fused into a single synecdoche.    The flaws of the agency as it now stands could easily bring down the country, from the inside, from our heavily spy-infiltrated electronic elections, all the way to a near complete ignorance of foreign languages, when compared to foreign intelligence agencies, thus putting us at great disadvantage with their powers.      That's just for starters, and all the damage that CIA has done as \\"premier\\" of the National Security State inaugurated by Harry Truman ( naming the first chief of CIA, Souers, out of St. Louis, Mo., and his vast intelligence experience running Piggly Wiggly supermarkets) merely at home, in its massaging of our domestic agencies with bad and covert BS, is only a drop in the ocean of wrong and woe it has done to others around the world, with assassinations and propped up petty tyrants, just to name two chronic pranks its famous for.  Often their best defense has been our own ineptitude, and John Perkins explores much of the insider's viewpoint on this in \\"Confessions of an Economic Hitman.\\"    See the film, and learn of the lameness, your children will thank you.  Damon is surprisingly terrific, too, and all in all superbly directed, acted, scored, filmed.  Top marks.
0345403959|5.0|Belgarath The Sorcerer is more or less Belgarath's view and explanation of events which led up to the start of The Belgariad, which began with the book Pawn of Prophecy.  The reader will find most of this story quite familiar in that Eddings has rehashed much of the information which was presented in the previously mentioned series.  Granted, there are new twists and new detailed information, but the story is the same. Many of the characters in this new book are the very same characters we find with our original reading of the series.  Now some have found this to be a bad thing.  I personally rather enjoyed it.  I make no bones about it, nor do I apologize for being a big fan of Eddings (and as we now know, Leigh Eddings, his wife).  As I have mentioned in my previous reviews, these are comfort books for me.  I read them for relaxation.  The author has even used many of the tired old jokes, which are actually sort of funny, in this work as well as most of the settings and situations we have come to expect.<br /><br />As mentioned before, with the first ten books I have been able to identify 233 errors the author made (hey, I even have my books cross referenced).  With this work, I am able to add even more errors!  While this may seem a bit compulsive/obsessive (which indeed, it probably is, well too bad...I enjoy it and plan to continue the hobby).  We are not talking typos, punctuation and such; we are talking major errors in plot and facts.  This is a wonderful game and I love it.  For me it does not distract from the story one bit, and in fact makes it sort of charming.<br /><br />This work, like the previous works from which it was taken, moves right along, and while quite  predictable, for the most part,  is still a very interesting read and great fun to just enjoy.  The author can tell a good story and he does hold my interest.  Again, this is not for every one.  If you did not enjoy the first ten books of the series, then you will probably not enjoy this one.  Actually, I cannot for the life of me figure out why someone who hated the previous books, forked out good money for more of the same...go figure.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Belgarath and crew, then you will quite likely enjoy this read, if you are not...<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkscannot for the life of me figure out why someone who hated the previous books, forked out good money for more of the same...go figure.

031606792X|4.0|Good book, not as good as the first three, but enjoyable. It wraps the story on a happy note, despite a few inconsistencies, and leaves the door open for a book 5 if need be.  Having said that, there are a number of reviews bashing Stephanie Meyers for missing a chance to teach a lesson. Not all stories need to set an example. In fact, counter examples are just fine. Yes, it seems as if Bella lives happily ever after, married and pregnant at 18, a mother by 19, and no education in sight. However, Bella's story cries out for discussion. Anyone missing that has either lost an incredible opportunity or (perish the thought!) is just reading the book for enjoyment!   Additionally, fantasy, particularly urban fantasy gets pretty dark, and Meyers, knowing her audience is mainly in their teens, toes the line. Other reviewers seemed uncomfortable with the possessiveness of Edward and the way Jacob seems to take some liberties that he should not, but read some Anne Rice, Laurell Hamilton, or Kelley Armstrong. Meyers is staying true to genre, just with a lighter hand.

B000071K5L|5.0|\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is a book filled with mysteries, an engaging plot, and fascinating characters.  I just read this book for a summer reading project and it captured my interest.  The book starts out fairly slow but speeds up in a couple of chapters.  When it gets going it will be hard to put this book down.  The father, Atticus Finch, is a man who is shrouded in mystery.  In every few chapters you found out a new strange secret about him.  His children, Scout and Jem, are no less interesting.  They constantly explore the small town they live in and encounter many adventures such as making many attempts to discover who lives in a rundown and abandoned house that is rumored to contain a crazy man.      I particularly appreciated the plot of the story. It was constantly changing as you uncovered mysteries and horrifying truths.  The book never disappointed.      In addition to entertaining a wide variety of readers this book is filled with many morales.  It illustrates many issues that include racism and crime.  It talks about human nature and how we must treat each other better.      At the end of the book there is a big trial that is thrilling and suspenseful.  It is the point that the book has worked up to.  After the trial there are a couple of big twists that I will not give away for they are most surprising.  I am talking about this to show that the book is exciting to the very last page.  It will leave you with a lot to think about.      If you enjoy intricate and suspenseful books I highly recommend that you read \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\".

B00001IVR0|5.0|This extraordinary CD features fine studio recordings of two famous piano concertos played by the great German pianist Wilhelm Backhaus (1884-1969): he is accompanied here by Karl Boehm/Vienna PO. Boehm was probably not the best conductor of the XX century: his manner was at times heavy and brutal, and the orchestral sound lacked clarity - this is occasionally noticeable in Brahms' concerto on this CD. Despite of all this, Boehm was a serious and deep musician who had an affinity with Backhaus' approach to German classics. Their collaboration was fruitful and Decca's choice of Boehm in these recording is fully appropriate.<br />Brahms' 2nd concerto is often called 'the concerto of all concertos' and Mozart's last concerto is held in high esteem, too. Both Backhaus' recordings on this CD are great and I don't want to miss any of them. However, if I were to choose just one, I vote for Mozart: Backhaus's  touch is just so gorgeous and his playing so natural! Many pianists put up for show how deeply they feel Mozart's music and how sweet they play it. Backhaus did not curry favour with listeners and did not emphasize his virtuosity down the drain - and he was a great virtuoso. That's why his Mozart style was so organic.<br />Both Backhaus and Boehm were younger to the time of Mozart's session (1955) than when they tackled Brahms for the last time (1967). This can be felt. I do not mean that Backhaus is struggling with technical difficulties - he is in an astonishingly good form given his age - but the overall approach to Brahms's 2nd concerto is recessed and less energetic than in the previous recording of the same music made by Backhaus and Boehm in 1939. To my mind, the best achievement in this 1967 stereo remake of Brahms' concerto is Andante: Backhaus plays it slower and more heartfelt than in the previous versions.<br />It is amazing that the producer of the 1967 Brahms recording, Ray Minshull, recollects in the liner notes to this CD that he has been a big fan of the previous Backhaus' recording of the 2nd concerto made in 1952 and 'wore out two copies of the mono LP' before he applied for a job to Decca. That mono LP certainly deserved idolizing - it is simply the greatest recording of the 2nd concerto all way round. Backhaus is joined there by conductor Carl Schuricht who was an equally serious musician as Boehm but had a far greater command of an orchestra. And in 1952 Backhaus was fifteen years younger than on this CD!<br />Buy this CD and enjoy it but if you love Brahms and Backhaus try to get the mono version with Schuricht: it is available on Schuricht's 5 CD-set (Decca 475 6074)- you will find there some other absolutely first-rate recordings of Beethoven and Brahms.ous Backhaus' recording of the 2nd concerto made in 1952 and 'wore out two copies of the mono LP' before he applied for a job to Decca.

B0013D8LOK|3.0|Though decidedly watchable, Mr. Burton's attempt to translate a great black comedy/tragedy/musical to the screen is only partially successful.  The production design is gorgeously macabre, the majority of the cast is quite good and Sondheim's memorable score remains as virtuosic as ever.     However...the musical numbers frequently are unimaginatively and repetitively staged (\\"By the Sea\\" being a notable exception) and the two leads are disappointingly miscast.   Both Johnny Depp & Helena Bonham Carter are very able and talented actors, but here have not the vocal power, grim humor and maturity required for the parts.  While watching the film, this viewer kept thinking that Alan Rickman, here cast as Judge Turpin, would have proved a far more convincing Sweeny;  perhaps a Glenn Close or Miranda Richardson, a wonderful Mrs. Lovett.  Instead, Depp and Bonham-Carter come off as very talented leads in an ambitious High School production.

Nanny's physical transformation was wonderful and the musical score was magical. But what wasn't magical was Evangaline. What a dud. She just fell flat as a pancake. Nanny, beautified, had all the chemistry with \\"Dear Dad\\" Colin Firth and the ending just flopped with him hooking up with that boring old scullery maid with no personality and not much prior part to play in the story. Hence the 3 stars.  Loved Emma Thompson, loved Colin Firth, loved the kids, didn't love the ending nor Evangaline.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|Now that we have all gotten over ourselves (Is that a photo shop of the photo album cover - or not?), let's get down to the talent that is Miss Hudson. Rich, warm tones make Miss Hudson's vocal talent excel especially on several of the tracks on her self titled debut album. I put this CD in my car stereo on September 30th and it has stayed there ever since. There are quite a lot of potential #1 hits on this album. \\"I'm His Only Woman,\\" with Fantasia Barrino is quickly becoming one of my favorites, because of its almost heart wrenching soul of a woman scorned. Of course was it any surprise that the powerhouse \\"And I Am Telling You,\\" from the hit movie Dreamgirls would have gone missing from her debut album? One of the most masochistic songs ever written, it takes a woman faced with her world crashing down on her, and lets you witness the spectacle. INCREDIBLE! \\"Spotlight,\\" released first is a very groove inspired number that is quickly receiving a lot of play of the top charts. Overall an excellent album - raw talent not to be missed!

0525478183|5.0|I know there a couple of months left in 2008, but Paper Towns gets my vote for best YA book of the year.  John Green wrote a book that celebrates literature and the impact it has on those who read it, digest it, and learn to connect with it.  Forget the YA tag-this book reaches adults as well.  This insightful, introspective, and ironic page-turning mystery entertains and educates simultaneously.  Quentin is a hero to cheer for and Margo is a heroine to hope for.  As for the mystery, well, see if you can solve it before Q does.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|First, I did not follow Gilmour (or Waters) since Pink Floyd dissolved. I bought this based on sampling the songs I did not know (his solo material). I liked what I heard. I did not even know he was doing On An Island complete until reading reviews!<br /><br />This is a solid effort start to finish with superior sound quality. (I only bought the CD set; passed on the DVD's). The Floyd stuff great. The high points for me are Fat Old Sun (why did they leave this of the Pompeii DVD - arrgghhh!), Astronomy, and (wow) a complete rendering of Echoes. Floyd was always pretty much a play the album live band - not much difference from the studio, certainly not prone to re-arrangements of any sort. The same is true here, but I love these songs and the band is larger so we get a fuller sound and more textures.<br /><br />The band is great.  Being an avid Roxy Music fan,I wish Manzenera stepped out a little, but he certainly adds skillful backup. As you know or have read, Richard Wright is on keyboard (along with Jon Carin). This really helps the older material sound like, well, Floyd. In fact, if I close my eyes I could not distinguish a lot of this from Floyd, especially on cuts like Fat Old Sun, Echoes and Diamond.  Wright was such a superbly skilled musician; and humble. He will be missed.<br /><br />I really like the overall mellowness of On An Island. I am really impressed by Gilmour's playing on these songs - very emotive, he really soars. And the orchestra fills the sound out nicely.  Stylistically not very different from Floyd's sound, at least their mellower side (think Meddle without One of These Days).<br /><br />The booklet with the CD (is it the same as the DVD set?) is lame. I mean, it repeats the band and orchestra info three times! I would have liked more (and larger) photos. But I was really impressed with the On An Island tracks, the Floyd material is solid, and if you're reading this you are probably some kind of fan and have bought/plan to buy this.  I doubt I will backtrack into Gilmour's solo catalog, but I am certainly enjoying this release.  So if you are an old Floyd lover who (as I did) paid no attention to his later solo efforts, give this a listen.r's solo catalog, but I am certainly enjoying this release.

B000RJO578|5.0|When we watched Hot Fuzz, we laughed our patooties off!<br /><br />The movie tells the story of police officer Nicholas Angel, a top cop in London. Because he's received so many commendations and made so many arrests (400% more than any other officer in London), he's making his co-workers (and supervisors) look bad. To get rid of him, management has him transferred to the sleepy little village of Sandford. There, he gets stuck with an inexperienced partner (who happens to be the son of the police inspector) and finds difficulty making the transition from lean, mean, policing machine to do-nothing keeper of a town where very little crime is ever committed.<br /><br />But then, odd things begin to happen. A philandering couple is found beheaded on a local highway. A man is blown up after a gas leak in his house. A reporter from the town's newspaper is killed by a piece of falling stone from an old church roof. Local authorities insist that all of these deaths are just accidents, but Nicholas begins to think there's more to it than that.<br /><br />For the rest of the movie, Nicholas and his bumbling partner try to unearth the thread that links all the murders. The truth behind the rash of deaths is comic gold.<br /><br />This movie is a hilarious send-up of the cop genre, but it's also a decent action flick in its own right. Pegg is marvelous as the orderly, buttoned-up Nicholas, and Nick Frost holds down his side of the script as the naive Danny Butterman (Nick's partner). There were knee-slapping lines and situations throughout, with character-driven comedy playing just as large a role as all the funny plot-driven stuff.<br /><br />You will recognize several other cast members as well: Bill Nighy as the Met Chief Inspector, Jim Broadbent as Inspector Frank Butterman, Timothy Dalton as Simon Skinner, even a tiny role by Cate Blanchett, who plays Nicholas' former girlfriend.<br /><br />If you're in need of a laugh, I highly recommend this movie! We loved it!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|This movie was the perfect final installment to the series, but I wouldn't recommend unless you have seen ALL six seasons of SATC.  There is too much woven into the plot and dialog that will be missed or unappreciated if you haven't done  your homework.  Definitely get this movie to add to your collection, and get the complete series if you don't have it already; great for a \\"sick day\\" or girl's night in.
0609610570|5.0|If a business leader were to select one book as a guide to success, this would be my choice.  As a former AlliedSignal executive, I have seen these practices applied and reinforced; I have also seen the results that they deliver.  The book defines Execution as \\"...a systematic process of rigorously discussing hows and whats, questioning, tenaciously following through, and ensuring accountability.\\"  This clearly, crisply defines what must be the major focus for each executive in today's challenging business climate.    The 7 Essential Behaviors for Leaders should be posted on the office wall of every executive.  They are timeless and appropriate in any business serving any industry.    The 3 Core Processes collectively cover all business activities that directly impact the ability to deliver superior performance - People, Strategy, and Operations.  The discipline of structured, interactive reviews that cover the breadth and depth of the issues is a critical element, and written notes and action items provide a tangible record of decisions and \\"next steps\\".    The 3 Principles of Execution capture the essence of the subject matter.  I find the first principle especially insightful - \\"Execution is a discipline and integral to strategy\\".    I strongly recommend that every leader in business read (and reread) this book.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This album is something I've been waiting for out of Metallica for some time.  A hard-rocking album that doesn't let up from track one until the end.  If you are a fan of metal and hard rock who doesn't care about the radio airplay value of an album, this is one you can rock out to for the album's entirety.  There are no 3 1/2-minute radio ballads on this one, and I think that's a great thing.
0143113100|5.0|I first listened to this book on my audible download and was so impressed I ordered a copy for myself and two copies to share with the counselors that I supervise.

0385340990|5.0|This book was selected for my book club, and I knew nothing about it when I started.  It was a fascinating, and fun, read.  The letter format is very unusual, but didn't get in the way of the story progression.  The descriptions of the island during the Occupation were very moving.  The characters were believable.  But it was also a FUN read.
031606792X|2.0|It would be better if this book didn't even exist. After I read halfway through it, I wanted to put it down and pretend like I'd never read any of it. There were some good parts and plot twists, but other parts are too strange and simply unsettling to let go. This was NOT a good way to end the series. It should've been like the seventh Harry Potter book, with a battle of good vs. evil at the end with a few casualties on the side. It wasn't. It was a cop-out.    I don't regret buying the book simply because I liked the wolf parts, but everything from the middle on was unbearable. I went from being the Switzerland of the Jake-Edward debate to being fully pro-Edward and feeling sorry for Jake. Stephenie Meyer ruined him. It was like she didn't even write the last book. Good ideas were twisted and mutilated into stupid and happy-go-lucky crap. Sorry, fans of this book.    If you like Twilight, buy this book used. Save yourself some money. It's worth reading and keeping as a collector's item, but I wanted to go back and mark out all the idiotic parts. That would include blacking out all but maybe twenty or thirty pages.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|this thing is awesome.the scope is pretty fun to put on your nerf mavrick if you have one.the thing is awesome because it is like 2 guns in one with the pistol and the sniper rifle. the thing is that the sniper part shoots better with out the pistol. overall its a great gun except you cant trust ure friend with it because the more you jam it the more it rips up the bullet so LOOK AT THE DiRECTIONS before you use it.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I think that this movie had some great points. It wasnt one of those stuffy spiderman movies (which i liked only the first one). This movie gave the Joker all the credit that he could handle without taking too much from the batman or two face. The whole point with multiple villians is that the joker had a point with all of his cruel jokes and intentions. That this world is corrupted you cant trust anyone most of the time. But it also showed that there are people out there that you can trust. (I.E: prison inmates??) Definitely a must see!!

B0015D3Z4O|3.0|I'm not sure what to think of Hard Candy. There's so much to love about it, and yet so much stuff that's so hard to swallow. It's an anomaly in Madonna's career; rather than go her own ways and explore little-known genres or at least make them her own - like she's always done - she explores the semi-hiphop dance flora. Rather than be the risk-taking pioneer, she's joined the club. This is precisely why Hard Candy may be her weakest effort in terms of character.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; Hard Candy is full of wonderful songs, excellently crafted and atmospheric. It's just that its principal problem is that Madonna takes a somewhat 'backseat' approach to it. She hired Justin Timberlake, Timbaland and Kanye West to produce it with her (all of whose names I've come to dread seeing on an album ever since) rather than engage in a one-on-one musical collaboration as she's been doing throughout the course of her career, more or less. Sadly, this shows. Ray of Light has personality. Confessions on a Dance Floor for sure has personality. Hard Candy doesn't have that personality - even its title sounds like a sell-out. As I listen to it, I wonder what inspired Madonna to make it.<br /><br />\\"Candy Shop\\" is such a weak track, I'm surprised Madonna put it on the album at all, let alone made it the opener. \\"4 Minutes\\"'s flair wears off fairly quickly. \\"Give it 2 Me\\" is admittedly a very catchy track, but my sister's comments on the accompanying video still ring in my ears when I listen to it - \\"It must be hard to have to hold on to her sex symbol status at the age of 50\\". But the thing is, ever since Ray of Light, this hasn't presented a problem. Ever since Ray of Light, everybody said Madonna grew up, and that remains the album where my following of Madonna's music takes off, where she gained unlimited producing freedom and - more importantly - started exploring a certain maturity to her music. All that is out the window with Hard Candy. Some songs even go as far as having rap interludes, whether by Kanye West or others, and this just feels incredibly 'cheap'. It's as though M's previous four efforts never happened. Where's the woman who consistently risks everything by going her own way, in order to make original music? It's only in a handful of tracks - primarily during \\"Miles Away\\" - where her vocal maturity actually shines through, too.<br /><br />To give her right, however, Madonna shows on this album that in spite of lack of personality, this album bears her musical touch. Immediately after \\"Give it 2 Me\\", it's as though somebody puts on a different album, because \\"Heartbeat\\" is a wonderful surprise. The lyrics aren't the most original - about feeling alive on the dance floor - but it's a really moving song. Then the melancholic \\"Miles Away\\" kicks in, my favourite from the album, sublime and moving. \\"She's Not Me\\" starts out cheeky and fun, but towards the end it becomes really engaging. \\"Incredible\\" starts out great - the first couple of minutes are exquisite - but then it turns into a totally different song, right out of nowhere, with rappers shouting \\"oooh\\" and Madge chiming \\"Sex with you is - incredible.\\" Way to knock you out of a trance.<br /><br />\\"Beat Goes On\\", like \\"Candy Shop\\", lacks justification for inclusion on the album, being as it is rather weak, whereas \\"Dance 2Night\\" is catchy and a surprise winner. But the three closing tracks form a solid streak of diverse yet enveloping songs. \\"Spanish Lesson\\" sounds exactly as it sounds, and is definitely a personality of a song to take in (if it weren't for the \\"get up on the dancefloor\\" bits, that is). \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognise You\\" again touches upon the melancholic strings, and is a joy to listen to.<br /><br />Then, like \\"Miles Away\\", the closing track \\"Voices\\" casts my doubts about this album into the deepest abyss. Not an overly-long track - it stops just when it's at its height - it is a truly breathtaking number, a mysterious and moving musical mindscape. It's certainly one of this album's best reasons for being. If only the \\"Candy Shops\\" and rap monologues had been scrapped to explore this kind of sound further.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am as confused as when I started. On the one hand, it's evident that Madonna didn't try as hard to give this album personality as she's always done, and - worse - chucked out a couple of average tracks. On the other, there's plenty of good music to be had here, ranging from catchy to breathtakingly compelling. How do I rank this? In the end, for lack of personality this album gets a minus. For a number of wonderful tracks (despite some cheap bits here and there), it deserves a loud applause. Hard Candy lacks that originality and productional coherence which shone through Confessions on a Dance Floor, and Madonna needs to remember that she is fully capable of making good music by being true to herself. The cover art is downright scary - it makes Madge look much older than she truly does. But what frightens me when I listen to the album is the inescapable feeling I get that Madonna herself may fear that she's losing her touch. I pray that I'm wrong, and that the most compelling musical artist in history will again show us that she can still kick musical butt.If only the \\"Candy Shops\\" and rap monologues had been scrapped to explore this kind of sound further.

006097625X|2.0|I was required to read this book for a college art class, and hated it. I'm not a comic book fan, but I also don't detest them either. I found the book to be mildly interesting, but just way too reptitive. The author goes on and on about the same things for way too long, practically beating the subjects to death. The author tries to get the reader to take things in the book so seriously, it seems a little ridiculous.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|I work with adults, families, and adolescents who have addiction issues. I am always on the lookout for both new and older films who are about addiction that I can show to my clients.  \\"28 Days\\" is one of those films.  It chronicles the life of a alcoholic party girl Gwen (played by SAndra Bullock) and an involuntary trip to rehab that she does not take seriously at first.  After she is encouraged to get drunk in rehab by her boyfriend, and nearly gets kicked out of rehab and put into jail, she begins to take what her counselor and her other friends in rehab are telling her about her problems drinking seriously. A death of a friend in rehab really wakes her up, and upon discharge she is intent to make changes in her life and stay sober.     This video is excellent to show to a rehab group who are \\"on the fence\\" as to whether or not they have a problem with their drinking and or using drugs (despite the fact to everyone else in their life they obviously are addicted to alcohol and/or drugs). A counselor can process this movie by asking questions such as \\"How are you like Gwen (the lead character) in \\"28 DAys?\\"  Who is the enabler in the movie?  Why did the clients at the rehab center wear signs? etc.  I have found this movie to be very beneficial in producing a discussion of what is problematic, drug addicted behavior compared to social drinking.

0226039331|5.0|I have the 2nd edition of Bauer (the BAGD) and this 3rd Edition (the BDAG), and this is just excellent.  The definitions help a relatively novice student such as myself to get a much better feel for what words mean than just simple one word definitions which cannot possibly present the accurate sense in most instances.  For serious study of Biblical Greek issues, this is a wonderful tool.    The text is very readable.  The cross references are thorough.  The binding and paper quality excellent.  The biggest problem is the size of the work as it is quite large.  I would like to be able to purchase an electronic version to allow quicker look-ups, and potentially better cross referencing within the lexicon itself.

But the problem is, I believe in our country, just not in the government.  I think universal health care would work, I just wouldn't want to hand it over to our government to run.

B00005JLIU|1.0|I saw this movie last year (2007), because my school did the play (which is fabulous). I was aware of the racism in the story at that time, but only knew it to be mild and shown in a negative light. I was horrified by what I saw in the movie. The adorable, sweet, funny Ching Ho and Bun Foo, are replaced by creepy, perverted, 'Orientals', who come from a Chinatown, that bares a resemblance to the Biblical image of Babylon. The Chinese are portrayed as rat-like vermin, and the actual images of Big Mary's Tart Shop, were horribly disturbing, showing the young women, whom Mrs. Meers (the strange, Chinese-effected owner of the Hotel Priscilla) has kidnapped, writhing in gags and cords, while they are packed into shipping crates, for the trip to the streets of Hong Kong.    Julie Andrews is the absolute opposite of Millie in the musical; feisty, loud, flapper-ish, ambitious, and obnoxious - not poised, blessed with a posh British accent, and of course (judging by the aforesaid), British; the unwanted daughter of the Duke of Cornwall, or an origin to that effect. Mrs. Meers is merely an elderly white woman, effected, with simply sticks in her hair. Carrol Chaning as Muzzy van Hossmere - Good heavens! - There is nothing good about this movie, except for it shows where the musical comes from, and more accurately how things looked in 1922. I recommend this movie only to particularly vindictive, psychopathic racists, who want to see the young Mary Tyler Moore.

1932907009|3.0|I bought a few different books on screenwriting to help me with some sticking points on my current script... This is one of the ones I bought.<br /><br />First, there is some very good information in this book on beats and structure as long as you don't take everything as gospel.  Having been a theater major I've already been soaked though with character, motivation, beats, etc... but this was still a nice refresher on some of what I already knew.  For me the best information was the pushing of the log lines, and the index card breakdown... I use index cards, but like Snyder's idea for them better.<br /><br />Why this book doesn't get 5 stars - first, most of this info can be found in Syd Field's books and his credibility is a little higher.<br /><br />Second - The tone, or voice of the book.  Snyder writes in a very conversational tone... and unfortunately I found the voice to be a bit self-absorbed and irritating.  If I had to read anymore about his stupid movie \\"Blank Check\\" I would have wanted to have burned the book.  Also the tone basically implies \\"If you don't do what I say, you're an idiot.\\"  It also gets fairly nasty where the book basically informs the reader that \\"Memento\\" was a terrible movie, but NEVER goes into the why, basically poking at the reader with an \\"If you liked this movie you're an idiot.\\" I personally found a lot of the tone to be fairly confrontational, but since you are reading, you can't argue back.<br /><br />This book will be easy for many to dismiss since Snyder seems to only write generic family films, but the information in here can help you with your screenplay even if (like me) you're working on a horror film.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book to go into the actual formatting aspect, this book does NOT go into formatting at all.  This is more about story structure and characterization.  I don't think that this will be the \\"last book you will ever need\\" but it does contain some descent information if you can make it past the tone and argumentative nature of the writing style.the writing style.
0553381687|1.0|I hated this book, but I can see why some people might like it.  Let me start with why I couldn't stand it and then I'll say why I think it may be a good read for some people.  However, I would not recommend this to anyone I know due to my complete lack of enjoyment reading it.<br /><br />To start with, this book is extremelly well loved.  Usually when I read a book with almost universally positive reviews I expect a lot and often I end up greatly enjoying it.  This was different.  The first ten pages got me excited, it seemed like something incerdible and sweeping was about to happen.  It felt like an interesting twist on the somewhat standard 'age-old undead evil' and I was looking forward to see what developed.  800 pages later I was still waiting.  I grew increasingly frustrated as what I had expected to be plot progression was squandered on character development (some of whom die within the book after a great deal of time was spent on them), and I felt cheated.  To make matters worse I felt like most of the characters were simplistic charicatures with little actual humanity or depth, and I found even the noble characters irritatingly one-dimensional.  In general, I felt like most of the characters could be completely encompassed within 2-3 words.  For example, the man you assume to be the hero of this book is noble and honest to the point of blind niavette.  He reminded me of a simplistic version of Leto Atriedes, a man I'd loved, and I found that I felt he entirely deserved everything that came to him while I mourned Leto's death.  This pattern played out over and over, and I found that by the end of the novel I really didn't feel connected to or care about any of the characters since I didn't feel any of them to be lovable or even real.<br /><br />The plot itself is painfully slow for me.  Imagine Tolkien slowing down to talk more about backstory and cultural exposition.  Imagine the first two chapters of Dune spanning a book 3 times as long as the entire first volume.  That's what this felt like to me.  And to me, economy is a useful and enviable trait in an author.  The great authors can make you love or hate a character in a page because of a single line of dialogue that exposes just how very human they are.  I don't feel like Marten managed to accomplish anything of the like in dozens of pages.  And what suffers is the actual story, and in particular the entire book is very blatantly a set-up for the next (in which, presumably, the threat present in the prologue may actually appear).  It feels very much like a prologue, and though I won't say nothing happened I felt cheated in having to wait so long for what was expected.  Instead of a global struggle for survival that was hinted at it's mostly political squabbling.  While that make for a good story, I didn't feel this was particularly interesting or original and I had trouble really carring about outcome since I felt no connection to the characters (and often wished far worse on them than what they recieved).  When I was told if I just read the next three books it would be awesome I couldn't help but laugh.  And in truth lately I've started to enjoy books almost as much if not more for the sweeping ideas and truths about life or humanity than just the story or characters, and I felt there was nothing of the kind within this.<br /><br />Now, with all that said I can sort of see why some people would love this story.  If you've ever finished a book and wished there was another simply because you hated the characters to go, this might be a good book.  Or if you love Tolkien more for his cultural exposition than for the story he tells, this might be a good book.  My problem was I found the characters flat and unappealing, if you enjoy them the prospect of them being around and in real danger for maybe another 4000 pages may be riveting and delightful.  The real question is in what you read the book for, and if you can love the characters.  There's a huge amount of timededicated to the characters, their pasts, the political set-up, and things of that nature.  I feel other authors have done more and done it better (again, I cannot stop comparing this book to Dune after I finished it), but I can see why some people might like it.  It's a chance to really try and get into a fantasy world spelled out in painstaking detail.<br /><br />Overall I think Marten's inability to get me to connect to the characters doomed this book for me.  I did truly detest it, and I do not think it is either well-written or worthy of the accolades its been given by so many.  However, if wading through what is almost a historical text on a fantasy text sounds good, or if you're willing to bet on how the characters will appeal to you then it may be enjoyable.  Still, I think there are many better books out there.  If you enjoy it though there is unquestionably some value here, as it is very long.  Sadly, it's a bit of a gamble because if you don't care for it it will be one of the most painful reads I've ever encountered.dedicated to the characters, their pasts, the political set-up, and things of that nature.

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|The only way this horrible movie could be more historically inaccurate is if they said it took place in another country with monkeys or something. The producers intend to show how women in a different era were debased for ambition. But with their historical inaccuracies they once again debase Anne Boleyn but on a much wider scale then Henry VIII could've dreamt. He was in reality a narcissist and serial adulterer who would kill or accuse a wife of anything to be rid of her. This movie claims a lot of the rumors he created about Anne were true and reported by people without machiavellian motivations. In the process they debase a woman who happened to be vaguely successful in her ambitions, while rewriting history to glorify women of the court who lived dark and petty lives.

B001CD6FKS|4.0|(review of film only, not format)    When I first heard about a Wachowski follow-up to the Matrix, I was excited, but when I heard it was Speed Racer (a cartoon that for some reason none of us watched or it didn't even air in my part of the country), when I remembered it was their name on the horrible V for Vendetta, and when the official reviews trashed it, I just let it speed by.  My mistake!    This movie is thrilling, exciting, funny, and is as much an invention in ways of storytelling as The Matrix was (and has none of the drudgery that V for Vendetta has).    The official reviewers, Berardinelli and Ebert amongst them, must just be getting too old - they don't seem to understand that there's a new kind of storytelling going on here.  I don't have names yet for what it is or how it's done, but if you've seen the film you know what I mean.  Quick cuts and pans and other ways of getting the plot, characters, and emotions to move along and tell a compelling story.    The opening scene was absolutely thrilling.  Spliced flashbacks and whirlwind racing, all with a heartwarming story about brothers, duty, memory and doing the right thing - I almost jumped out of my seat and cried in empathy and joy!  The rest of the movie doesn't quite match this scene, but I was still stuck to the screen and cheering for most of it.    Bad parts:  -Parts of the rest of the film really dragged - lengthy dialogue that served no purpose as far as I could tell.  -The tour of the big capitalist's facility dragged on.  -Jack Shephard (oh right, Matthew Fox) was great as Racer X, but couldn't he have been more tough looking or something?  He seemed to just stand around a lot.  I loved how he spoke in an obviously \\"cool\\" voice that didn't help with diction or anything - the camp-ness was great.  -A chimpanzee?  Even if it's in the original cartoon, do we really need that?  The chubby younger brother is great, but do we need to do this to the chimpanzee?  -What about women?  OK, Speed's girlfriend is important, like Ricci's role in Sleepy Hollow actually, but it's still rather second-fiddle to the guy.  The mom makes pancakes, how cute!  OK, she welds or something too, and gives good advice in one scene, but I just wondered about the portrayal of women in the film. [note after second viewing:  OK, there are many cases where the women take on a strong role, like the mother's advise and praise for the son, Trixie's racing for a while and her piloting of the helicopter and contributions in getting Speed into the race, and Huroko Togukahn who offers Speed the entrance ticket to the Grand Prix and without which Speed would've had no chance.  But still, they seem to play roles that support males].  -The races - they were fun and fast and all, but I would challenge any viewer to say just exactly what each car was doing at any given moment.  It was too quick, blurry and rushed to be of any narrative use.  They could've just put a blur in the background and taken the lines from the script (RACE CONTINUES, CARS SPEED BY, SPEED RACER PASSES THEM), since I didn't see anything else going anyway.  I'm willing to let the laws of physics go by the wayside (it's a movie after all, and done by the guys who brought you the guy who learns that the rules of physics don't always apply), but it would be nice if the racing scenes actually propelled the plot.  See, for example, The Road Warrior, where visuals (instead of dialogue) tell the story - the feral kid reaching for the shotgun shell on the hood of the tanker that Mel is driving...  Nothing like that sticks in my head from this film. [second viewing notes: OK, on second viewing, I could follow the \\"moves\\" of the cars, and it was indeed pretty thrilling, but still not deliberate and purposeful enough].    Aside from those criticisms, oh and that its intellectual content is definitely designed for children (unlike The Matrix which could work at many levels), this movie was a blast.  [second viewing note:  well, childrenmay not get the stock market connections or the convoluted plot, but you don't have to in order to get the main idea - so maybe it is a bit layered like The Matrix].    [Second viewing note:  If you want to make comparisons, the moral story is a bit like The Matrix, too, in the sense that the hero can not simply defeat evil and lead everyone to a better world.  The scene where Pops and Speed discuss life and racing reminded me of the resolution of Matrix 2 and 3, where Pops is Morpheus envisioning a newer better future, and Speed is Neo, who knows that you can't just defeat evil and the best we can do is live with some kind of limited compromise.  Speed Racer does a better job, though, of satisfying the audience that even if limited results occur, one person's choices and belief can have positive outcomes for everyone.  As another comparison, consider Speed Racer and Iron Man - both have:  a male hero interacting with software-laden machinery powered by a blue-emitting perpetually-renewing micro-size clean-running energy source to achieve super-human feats and defeat cheating/evil/selfishness.  Is that a timeless tale or one specific to our current moment, or a timeless tale as told through the current concerns about renewable energy and integrated software/hardware systems in our portable devices and personal vehicles?]    I'm sorry I listened to the official reviewers and didn't see it in the theaters or IMAX.  Something wonderful is going on here that the critics have no idea about.  Go Speed go!

B00026WU9Q|5.0|Bringing It All Back Home being Dylan's 1965 release and his 5th studio album is without a doubt a grand album. The album is divided into one accoustic and one electric side. Here we have classic tracks such as Mr. Tambourine Man, It's alright ma (I'm only bleeding). The book-let is very nice with a photograph on the cover of Dylan together with some woman. I do not know who it is to be honest. Inside we get poetry penned by Dylan that I find to be very interesting. We also get a plethora of pictures of Dylan recording the album. The back cover photo is a photo of Dylan playing guitar in the studio. 5/5.

B000QQH4YS|4.0|I've been a fan of this film since I first saw it at a small downtown theater in South Dakota.  I'm not a fan of gory or ultra violent films; but this picture, along with its tongue and cheek humor, was like watching a live action adult comic book.  With this two disc, 20th Anniversary edition, you not only get a choice to watch the Theater or the Extended Cut of the film, you get plenty of what I always look for when I purchase a DVD; EXTRAS, FEATURETTES & COMENTARY.  My favorite was the documentary- \\"Flesh and Steel\\": The Making Of Robo Cop.  Finally, I like the packaging with its metal box.  One thing I didn't much care for was the difficulty of getting the individual discs out of its casing.  Plus, they are stacked so you have to take one disc out to get to the other disc.  With the hard to release casing; get ready for a project!
0064430170|4.0|This book is no doubt a classic and I love it.  However, I noticed a significant difference in the print quality of the older version I had checked out from the library and this new edition.  There is less detail and the color is not as good.  I checked out the library's copy to do some paintings of some of the illustrations as a gift for my nephew, so I noticed the differences right away.  Perhaps this is the times we are in, or perhaps there are better quality publications out there, not sure how to find them.  It didn't stop me from buying one for my friend though.
0385340990|4.0|This book came to me as an Early Review Book from Library Thing and my first reaction was, \\"I didn't request this!\\"  It had a somewhat cutesy cover (including a red bow) and I think I actually groaned.  But, I take my responsibilities as an Early Reviewer seriously (I am three reviews behind and keenly aware of my lapse) so thought I'd better dig in and make the best of it.<br /><br />I think I tried not to like the book and initially I had some help.  The story is told in correspondence centered on Juliet Ashton, a post WWII novelist who is tired of writing her successful series of novels and scouting for a new subject.  Several successful novels have been written with this somewhat stilted format including 84, Charing Cross Road (also having a literary connection) and Letters From Yellowstone.  As I made initial progress, 30-40 pages in, cutesy was still on my mind, but I was starting to sort out the characters and had a good sense of an emerging plot.  By the time I turned the last page (275) I realized I had enjoyed the book immensely, despite cutesy and despite the format.<br /><br />The plot begins to center on how the Guernsey Islanders survived the German occupation during WWII.  (Despite being a part of Great Britain and in the middle of the English Channel, the Nazis occupied the Channel Islands and cut off all communication with Britain.)  Aware of their pending occupation the Islanders bundled their children off to Britain and hunkered down expecting the worst.  As Juliet begins to uncover this story in her correspondence and the characters emerge, you find yourself in the grips of a compelling plot and caring about these rare characters on the island.<br /><br />As for the odd title?  Well, the \\"Guernsey Literary and Potato Pie Society\\" was a cover-up for the group who were attempting to subvert the Nazis.  But, it ended up drawing people together for many reasons, including literary.<br /><br />An excellent, innovative debut for this aunt-niece author duo.

B000I5X81K|5.0|We love his music.  My husband took me to this concert.  He was excellent and a real nice guy.  Keep it up!!!!!
B000SM7QUC|5.0|The critic obviously has no idea what he is talking about or what the music is about. Nikki Sixx has told a most amazing story the has the ability to help so many people suffering from the same types of addiction. The fact that he was able to do it musically is absolutely brilliant.   In the future the critic should not do reviews on subjects he knows absolutely nothing about. Unless you have dealt with an addiction or someone trying to cope with an addiction, some of this may be too deep. But for any one who has, it is right on the money and beautifully done.   I guess the critic could possibly be in denial of his own addiction, or anyone else that did not understand the depth of the story, which in turn this would rub them the wrong way.
B001DHE9KG|5.0|[[ASIN:B001DHE9K6 Britten - Peter Grimes (The Metropolitan Opera HD Live Series)]]    This DVD is a recording of the performance of La Boheme at the Met on April 5/2008 which was transmitted in HD worldwide. The first night was on 3/29th with the same cast, and the reviews in NY papers and the one here by Ivy Lin were based on the the opening night performance, not the one used on this disc. I attended the opening and agree with most of Ms. Lin's observations, i.e.: Vargas ' voice being \\"lyric,bright,ardent\\" hitting  the high C in Che Gelida Manina \\"delicately\\"; Gheorghiu's aggressiveness and sluttishness, and her being out of sync in her Act1 aria. I do not agree with her claim that Vargas was too chubby and phlegmatic to be a believable Rodolfo, but I tend to agree with her comments about the Mimi. I cannot blame Ms. Lin because I myself found Ms.Gheorghiu to be trying hard to appear too romantic and taken with her man. She practically  mauled him at the Cafe Momus with her exuberance.  I did not attend the April 5th performance but I listened to the PBS radio broadcast and saw the moviecast of the event,and was very  happy with the positive changes and improvement over the opening night performance. The excessive touching, smooching and other distractions were toned down, and the musical matters went on smoothly.                                  This disc has outstanding video and audio worthy of the Met's 50-yr old classic Zeffirelli production with an ideal casting of Angela Gheorghiu and Ramon Vargas in the principal roles, supported by a fine mix of veterans and newcomers to the Met. Everyone in this line up is gifted with enormous talent, rich voice and fine musicality. The conductor is a young but highly talented Italian who certainly knows his Puccini, and one who knows how to accommodate his singers' ideas without sacrificing the integrity of the music. True, he used some rubatos and expansive tempos here and there but always to enhance rather than diminish the musical and dramatic values. He supported his singers sensitively and the orchestera responded beautifully.    For some time, I was hoping the two singers would be cast  together in  any opera, not just Boheme, because I always believe that their voices are a perfect match in size, coloration, expressiveness and range. Plus, they possess truly beautiful voices, musical intelligence, innate musicality and elegant singing style. All of these qualities are evident on this disc. What I was not sure about was their chemistry together. Having seen the close-up of their facial expressions and subtle dramatic expressions, the total commitment and involvement throughut the opera by both artists and even split-second reactions, I do not know of any pair that could match such chemistry. Just incredible! They seem to inspire each other. Now I can understand why Gheorghiu, in Acts1&2, tried to convince everyone including the audience, her man and herself that she was REALLY in love with him. She was going to use this bit of realism to help her go through her slow death in Acts3&4 with  searing intensity and poignancy. And Vargas responded with such convincing sincerity that one cannot help but feel for the unfortunate lovers.Gheorghiu has been acclaimed for her acting, in addition to her singing, throughout her career, but it's hard to tell who the better actor is of the two here.    How about the singing ? Stunning, mesmerizing, magical, heartbreaking, ethereal. Stunning was Vargas when he discarded his lyric, bright-toned Che Gelida Manina on opening night and used his burnished, dark-hued spinto of late while preserving his customary warmth and sweetness. Mesmerizing was Gheorghiu in her Act1 aria with the movement of a graceful ballerina. Magical was the expansive Soave Fanciulla with Vargas visibly stunned at the sight of the radiant, beautiful Mimi bathed in moonlight and ushering in the sweeping splendor of this music with his magnificent sound. Heartbreaking was Mimi's farewell to the love of her life. Ethereal was Vargas' \\"alla stagion dei fior \\", ethereal as the snow flakes falling on the lovers at the end of Act3.    So, whose BOHEME is this ? Is it Mimi's or Rodolfo's ?  Buy this DVD and find out. Enjoy the quest for the answer.

(Before he even opened it, he saw on the back cover that another new one was coming out, and he got even more excited).  This book is more of the same (which is a good thing), and it adds a lot of blank areas within the story where it encourages readers to use their imagination and add to the author's story.    My son starting reading this book in the store, and didn't put it down until he had finished it.  The last half of the book is just lined pages for the reader to write their own stories.

B00168HARG|5.0|In an era of reality shows, lawyers and crime scenes, a short-season - nine episodes - Sci Fi series based on a movie franchise seemed to be filler that may not have a future. Wrong.<br /><br />The program was a winner on a number of levels, which the 3-discs aptly depicts; along with the entire first season, there is commentary on selected shows, audition tapes and other special features, including deleted scenes.<br /><br />The cast is what truly makes the series, as Lena Headley (Sarah), Thomas Dekker (John) and Richard T. Jones (FBI agent James Ellison) are perfect for their key roles. Summer Glau (cyborg protector) and Garret Dillahunt (T-888 hunter) have characters that push the action forward, but do not overshadow the human aspects of the story.<br /><br />There is a vast potential for this TV series and the Blu-ray edition shows why this sleeper was a huge surprise hit.

B0012QCZ54|4.0|STEP UP 2: THE STREETS, man, it's a clumsy film title and hearing it probably won't make you catch your breath in anticipation. But hold up. This is a pretty good musical drama. It's also a sequel to [[ASIN:B000J3OTSM Step Up (Widescreen Edition)]], the 2006 Channing Tatum/Jenna Dewan surpriser which made enough duckets in the box office so that, now, we get a return visit to the prestigious Maryland School of the Arts.<br /><br />A wave of public disturbances has hit Baltimore, public disturbances in the way of sizzling street dancing, baby. This time out, the troubled kid is Andie (Briana Evigan), an orphan who gets in trouble because of her street gang affiliation but who then gets a second chance when she's accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts. But it's not all about Andie. When her time spent at the MSA gets her booted out of her street crew, the notorious 410, she forms her own crew, consisting mostly of misfit students at the MSA. And, of course, there's an ongoing underground dance competition. And, of course, there's an exhilarating, stop-the-presses dance battle at the end. Naturally, the dance-off is between the MSA crew and the 410.<br /><br />It's a straightforward, by-the-numbers story, but we all know that the story is just there to prop up the spectacular dance sequences. The acting by the kids is serviceable, with Briana Evigan, daughter of Greg Evigan, holding the viewers' attention with her sexy, spirited presence. The other standout, to me, is scene-stealer Adam G. Sevani, who plays the gangly, geeky Moose. On the other hand, that guy who plays the stuffy dance director is awful.<br /><br />This is a PG-13 flick, so it's got pretty tame street cred. One of the kids gets roughed up a bit and a dance studio is vandalized. The tough talking, keeping-it-real smack the kids spout here is about as tough and keeps it about as real as a 1970's Kurt Russell Disney movie. Near the end of this flick, does anyone really buy into that boisterous crowd being swayed so easily by Andie's \\"We call this a battle, but what are we fighting for\\" speech? Yikes!<br /><br />There are some good-looking folks in this cast, so if you're wondering about the raunch factor, well, there's a kiss at the end, which I guess is smoking enough that it won the 2008 MTV Best Kiss Award, for whatever that's worth. But most of the lascivious stuff pops up in the dance routines.<br /><br />Apologies to the bellylicious Briana Evigan, but the backbone of STEP UP 2 is the electrifying street dancing. While the plot here is as anemic as that of the first film, the dance elements in this sequel are even more dynamic and definitely more street-centric. Breakdancing, krumping, popping, locking, you name it, it's here. Briana herself shows off some skills, but, really, the sickest moves are demonstrated by the 410 crew, by Adam Sevani and by the actors who play Monster, Cable, and Missy. Robert Hoffman (Chase) doesn't have Channing Tatum's magnetism, but he contributes with some nifty popping. Speaking of Tyler Gage (Tatum), he drops in for an extended cameo, to add continuity and provide a link to the first STEP UP. His one-on-one dance battle with Andie happens to be one of the movie's showstoppers.<br /><br />The music is so key to movies like this. The STEP UP 2 soundtrack, aggressive and with plenty of head-bopping hooks, is a crucial supporting character. Viewers be cautioned, as these songs  may induce manic bouts of getting down (or attempts at getting down). Just don't hurt yourself. Some of the hot tracks included are Flo Rida & T-Pain, \\"Low,\\" Missy Elliott's \\"Shake Your Pom Pom,\\" and Digital Underground's classic \\"Humpty Dance.\\" This last track, by the way, is perfectly, hilariously used in the MSA crew's online prank.<br /><br />STEP UP 2: THE STREETS isn't as sanitized as HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but neither does it come close to the gritty reality of, say, the [[ASIN:B000ARFPOO Rize]] documentary. Still, the focus here is on the dancing. And, when it comes to that, the pulse of the street beats in this film.g. And, when it comes to that, the pulse of the street beats in this film.

1416562605|5.0|What's astonishing about \\"The White Tiger\\" isn't Adiga's depiction of the social and economic inequalities of contemporary India. Other writers--Rohinton Mistry in \\" A Fine Balance,\\" Kiran Desai in \\"The Inheritance of Loss,\\" among others--have written very good novels about this. What is astonishing is the economy with which he does it. Novels about societal inequities are often lengthy; think of a novel by Dickens or Stowe or Dreiser or Steinbeck, in which the accumulating weight of the details of suffering creates a powerful impression. Adiga creates two disparate worlds, Balram's tiny native village in the Darkness and the sliver of Delhi he inhabits in his life as a driver for the urbanized son of the village landlord. The first is a place of absolute hopelessness presided over by allegorical figures of corrupt wealth: the four landlords known as The Stork, The Buffalo, The Wild Boar, and The Raven. From afar (and occasionally up close) The Great Socialist is re-elected again and again through promises of change (always unkept) and corrupt electioneering. Balram's family, it is clear, will be poor forever.<br /><br />The city, for Balram, consists of the glittery American-style mall (which he can't enter); the air-conditioned Honda that he drives; and the red bag stuffed with cash for politicians with power over The Stork's businesses. These two settings (and the human animals that inhabit them) set out a chasm that is utterly unbridgeable. Thus, when Balram murders his master (a fact established at the very beginning of the novel), it seems less a tragedy than the outcome of impeccable logic. I kept thinking of Dreiser's Sister Carrie, another small town character who migrates to the city. But where Dreiser is intent on portraying Carrie as someone corrupted by grinding social forces far beyond her control, Adiga deftly portrays Balram as an entrepreneur, one whose tiger's leap across the chasm is equally the product of social forces he cannot control. This leap leads to a 21st century ascent (in social and economic terms) not a 19th century descent into the loneliness that an obsession with wealth can bring.<br />M.

B00005JPS8|5.0|I haven't read any of the comic books of Iron Man, so I came into this as something of a blank slate. I knew, from reading other Marvel comics back in the day, who he was and a little of his origins. I also knew he was an alcoholic, so I couldn't help but snicker when I found out Robert Downey Jr was picked to play Tony Stark. \\"How perfect,\\" I thought. \\"Bound not to be much of a stretch for him.\\"<br /><br />Thankfully, he turned out to be far, far better in the role than I had expected! He really owns every single seen he's in, and brings a real sense of confidence and ease to the picture.<br /><br />You know the plot by now: Tony Stark, billionaire weapons designer, is captured by terrorists while on a visit to a place suspiciously similar to Afghanistan. They try to force him to build a new weapon for them, and instead he builds it for himself, emerging in a suit of armor and becoming Iron Man.<br /><br />It's a simple plot, but it works very well. The film succeeds on several levels due largely to the good writing, excellent pacing and wonderful action. But what really brings it home is the great acting on the part of Downey, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow. They make this film what it is.<br /><br />There's really not much else to say here. It's an entertaining, well-done popcorn flick. Not a perfect movie, but certainly a stunning example of what the genre can do and easily the second best super hero film of 2008.

When I first got the dvd, I was thrilled, but I start watch it, my ears, my eyes, and my mind just zapped, like something wrong with movie, something different, I was mad, even the director on the commentary wasn't satisfied of the track, I know all of us fans felt the same way. I love the first movie and the second movie. Movie still good, I'm okay with it, but I they can redo this, like first film did, the special edition with the original track, GOD I hope!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005Y1Y3|4.0|Way back in 2002, I was busy haunting one of my favorite Record Stores, {remember those?} in San Francisco, when the guy behind the counter says: \\"Hey man, you want a free CD?\\" Free CD? I'm your guy! He hands me this Disc called: \\"Bright Midnight - Live in America\\" with Jim on the cover gazing at a sparkler with Acid-Fried Eyes. 73 Minutes of live Doors, taken from Concerts in Bakersfield, Hollywood,Ca. to New York City, Boston, Detroit, Pitsburgh and Philadelphia, Pa in 1969 & 1970.<br /><br />As the proud owner of many Bootleg CD's of Live Doors Concerts, some of this was already part of my collection, {Madison Square Garden, NYC & Boston, from 1970} but some of it was new to me [Bakersfield...BAKERSFIELD? who's the backing Band behind Jim? Buck Owens and The Buckaroos???}<br /><br />Well, as it was I had stumbled onto something good here, a sampler of Primo Doors Shows from their last days on the road. 11 Minutes of: \\"Light My Fire\\", rare versions of: \\"St. James Infirmary\\" and \\"Been Down So Long\\", 16 minutes of darkness entitled; \\"The End\\", \\"Love Hides\\", \\"Crystal Ship\\" and \\"Back Door Man\\". Yeah Buddy, if the sound quality is decent, this is going to be a keeper!<br /><br />Well, the sound quality is very good for field recordings of that time. These are Multi-Tracks, that were recorded for the Groups live record: \\"Absolutely Live\\" and are very pleasing when compared to Bootlegs of much lesser quality. This sampler was an introduction to the Bright Midnight Series of complete live concerts by The Doors.<br /><br />This series is indeed for the Fans, and that said, it is a very cool way to take a little look-see into this World of Darkness & Madness...the World of The Doors. Try this out and decide for yourself, if you want to take that push over the cliff. \\"Bright Midnight\\"<br />Four Stars !!!
B001F7MSFW|5.0|I love this movie, it has action, plot, fairy tale fantasy genre, adventure, romance, drama, and better yet, hughe laughs aka comedy. This movie is mixed with King Arthur, Ghost Busters, Men in Black, Beauty and the Beast, and Wizard of OZ. If you're a fan of Hellboy, you'll love this movie. Ron Pearlman is a awesome actor, he is perfect to play Hellboy, one of his best character or should I say his best comic book character performance was outstanding. Including Doug Jones, who is amazing actor for any kind of creatures he plays, Abe is fun. Gurllermo Del Toro is the man, he's my idol, I love monsters, aliens, and some fairy tale characters, man, this guy has a great vision of filmmaking and storytelling. I like MIMIC, BLADE 2, HELLBOY, HELLBOY 2, and especially his Academy Award Winning Film PAN'S LABYRINTH. He's the next Steven Spielberg in my book. I can't for another one, I'm keeping a lookout there!!! Sweet Action Monster Movie!!!

3822837849|4.0|Stieglitz - Camera Work is an extract of the photographs that appeared in the Camera Work magazine that Stieglitz created and edited.  The photographs chart the history and change in photographic styles from pictorialist to the straight photography of Paul Strand.  As such it is a historical document to the changing style of the medium.  However, more than that it shows many accomplished photographers and their work that is truly refreshing even by today's standards.  The size of the book is quite nice, portable but also large enough that it will take time to work through it all and enjoy the pictures.  The essay on Stieglitz and his motivations and involvement in the photographic scene of his day and his importance even then is also quite interesting.  He was (and is) a real giant of the photographic world.  I \\"only\\" gave 4 stars because the book is not available in hard cover, and there is a big 25 year anniversary image on the book spine.  I don't much like advertising things like that on my bookshelf, and as the book was issued in 2008 (and Taschen's 25th anniversary was in 2005 or 2007) I don't quite get why they are branding this book like that.  Still, a sterling effort on their part. Print reproduction quality is excellent.  For who is this book?  For photographic artists, people interested in photographic history, as well as photographers who are looking to the past for a way to refresh and invigorate their photography.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I loved this movie.  I had never even heard of Iron Man until my husband said it was worth buying after he saw it overseas.  So I got it and watched it yesterday and was pleasantly suprised!  It was action packed, funny, and even had a little love story weaved throughout!  I highly recommend it!  GREAT MOVIE!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I only own dualshock controllers, so I cannot compare it to the sixaxis shockless controller. Works with PS3 and PS2 games. The design of the L2 and R2 buttons took some getting use with switching from the PS2 controller.    I tried to use the sixaxis for MotorStorm and had to turn it off. Is hard to keep the controller flat when laying in bed (the main way I play). It does add more \\"realism\\" to the game when you are able to actually use it.    Wireless is the only way to go.
0375826726|2.0|I am a big fan of this series but somewhere about the 200 page mark I began to lose interest.   Was the editor asleep at the wheel?   Large sections of this book could have been removed without any effect on the overall story. Did we really need to know how all the individual dwarves voted? Did we really have to have two long winded sword making scenes? What was with all the random battles?   Where did all the interesting characters go? A scant few pages of Angela(and most of those were poorly written) and even Ayra, the supposed love interest, pretty much disappeared for most of the book.    I finished the book with the conclusion that this had been written for the money or for the writer's ego. Pity.
B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|Man was I disappointed after purchasing this. A friend of mine talked me into watching this movie and since supposedly its visually stunning I decided to get it on BlurRay. Well, that was a big mistake. First of if you read the back of the cover it states that only portion of the movie is in High Definition - Translation I think there were only a hand full of scenes in HD the most of the movie was shot in standard definition. Second of all the movie it self SUCKS big time. Very simple, basic right down dumb story line. You can accurately predict the whole movie along with the ending after the first 10 minutes of it.  The movie has absolutely no historical or mythological values what so ever (like The Gladiator or Troy for example). And from the beginning to an end it's filled with bloodshed which gets old after the first 15 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />Over all I must say stay away from this movie BR or DVD.
031606792X|2.0|I was an early booster for the Meyer's book Twilight, hailing it as absorbing for both adult and adolescent readers.  I even compared it to Anne Rice's superior Interview with a Vampire, based on unique, well-drawn characters and innovative twists with the traditional legends.<br /><br />It's been downhill from there, unfortunately.  Writing is one of the hardest jobs on the planet and imagining people, places, events, desires, etc. takes time and much reflection.  While Meyers is quite skilled as a writer, she has failed to take the time to she needs to reflect which is all too evident with this last gasp at the vampire line.  Edward & Bella are not the two characters that launched Twilight--they are a faded photocopy done from a machine whose toner needs replacement.  Sad.<br /><br />The beginning of this book puzzled me--for some reason, I thought the marriage ceremony would take place perhaps halfway in the plot but it practically begins the book like a shotgun wedding.  From that high point, it's a rapid descent into the flatlands.  Tiny scenes remind me of the writer of Twilight, but too few.  Someone else could have written this book.<br /><br />Give me a break on the ending.  Please.  I don't believe for one second that Bella's father would be so accepting of his daughter's condition and his new in-laws.  It was the contrast between the real world and the vampire one that gave this story some tension--now it's the Addams family.<br /><br />I can only attribute this downhill curve to the desire for money and profit.  Publishers want to capitalize on success immediately and the new writer is flattered into writing nonstop to fill bank accounts.<br /><br />Meyers will regret trashing her series.
0446615641|5.0|A great follow up to the camel club.  I didn't want it to end and hope there is room for another follow up.  You get extremely invested in the characters.  Read the books in sequence for the full effect.

At first I heard too much crowd sound, but it fades out and is no bother. Still 5 stars. Cheesy cardboard sleeve, still 5 stars. Lots of ON AN ISLAND and DIVISION BELL songs, I love both albums so still 5 stars. David Gilmour still spot on his game at 60ish Priceless. I must recommend this album very highly. It may be one of the best live albums ever. $11.99 for over 2 hours of concerto perfection! I sure hope Gilmour keeps on working and wish Waters was still here for the fun, but I doubt he could make this any better. Go see Pink Floyd Australia on tour it is a blast and you will swear you saw the real band! I saw the real band on the ANIMALS tour at MSG and that was incredible. This album is even better, do not hesitate.
0783222149|5.0|A beautiful film about the Colorado River. The hero is the river and the nature it crosses, the gorges and the rapids and the falls. And you will go down the river in a light boat. Beautiful indeed. Then the film sets a plot on that river of a nice vacationing family held hostage by the surviving thieves of a cattle auction robbery who try to escape the police after the robbery by using the river and the expertise of the mother of this family. This adds some family tension with a father who is working too hard as an architect and neglecting, in a way, his family, and yet he will save his wife and his son from the grip of the thieves after having escaped them before. Courage, for sure, tenacity definitely. And the beauty of this river all over and always. This plot is multiplying the beauty of the river just as if it took a lot of courage for the river itself to go down this valley and its gorges.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

B00005JPS8|5.0|To consider Comic Book character Movies as a serious genre.  I know some people think there are a lot of them out there and might be getting sick of them...but you have to face it, they are a great source of material.  And they are getting better as a whole.    With the release of three superhero movies this summer (Iron Man, Hulk, The Dark Knight), you would think one of them really stunk.  Not so.  And with the release of Watchmen next year, I gaurentee many people will see a much different side of comic book heroes then they have before.   But I digress.   Let's talk Iron Man.    Iron Man is an iconic character in the Marvel universe.  Everyone knows his name, partially thanks to Black Sabbath.  But bringing him to the screen could have been really tricky.  Especially when you announce Robert Downey Jr. is going to play Tony Stark, the ambitious, brilliant and self centered billionaire industrialist who becomes the title character.  Downey might seem, to fans, too smarmy for the role.  But thankfully he is a great fan of the character himself and choose not to make any great changes.  For the most part, he plays Stark brilliantly, but adds his own touch as well.  In the comics, Stark is a brilliant playboy, with very little sense of humor.  As for Downey's version, he brings wit and a sense of being aloof.  It's just what the character needed.      Plot wise, it's simple.  Stark is captured and forced to build a missile for a terrorist group.  He rebels in his own way; he builds a suit of armor from the pieces in order to escape.  Since he realizes the weapons his company makes are being stolen by or sold to the enemies, he announces a halt on all weapon producing industry.  He starts working on his own project of creating a suit of armor based around his heart supporting energy source.  At first, he just wants to fly.  But then incorporates weapons to take out the terrorist group.    Director Jon Favareau deserves a lot of credit for balancing the serious with the brilliant with the humorist on this one.  Iron Man is one of the best Superhero movies ever to be made and Downey makes Stark his most entertaining character to date.
B001F12J3Y|3.0|I didn't mind this movie for the first part and it does a great job of getting the storybook 'look', but I want to warn those who haven't seen it, that for a movie that continuously goes on and on about Christmas and BELIEVING and having FAITH, guess what? They DON'T actually mean that guy that was born a coupla thousand years ago!    I'm actually agnostic, but when I saw it I felt conned for a number of reasons. Yes, when people talk about lifeless CGI and \\"the one with the zombie children\\", they're talking about this one. Glassy, lifeless eyes, and disturbing movement (not because it was motion-captured, but because they motion captured adults in place of kids! Tom Hanks might be playing himself as a kid, but the certainty of movement and the body language is all wrong. And the eyes, my God the eyes... Second, the 3d was cool, but it's no better integrated into the story than a 50s novelty-3d flick. Watch it again and notice how obvious (in either 2d or 3d stereo versions) the \\"comin' at ya\\" bits are, and how they don't really further the story.    Finally, the whole \\"faith' thing. Like I said, I'm not religious, but frankly I was aghast at the balls it took to hang the thing on belief and faith in regard to Christmas - but in regards to faith and belief in Santa, NOT Jesus! I guess everybody made a movie about X-mas, not Christ-mas. Whether you 'believe' in God or not, December 25th is a religious thing. It's pretty appalling. If they'd been straight up about it and hadn't danced around the consumerism angle, then fair enough. As it stands, I felt cheated. I haven't read the book, so I don't know if that was always the case. I give it 2 and a half stars (but I can't show half, so...).    SO that's my subjective view. I might have to watch it again, because I still can't really believe it. Ironic, eh?    An interesting tidbit is that when they released this movie, they showed pictures of Hanks acting, side by side with the final CG version. Why on Earth they thought that was a good move is beyond me, because it showed precisely how much life and expression was LOST in the transition! Talk about shooting yourself in the foot! Beowulf was generally MUCH more successful. You gotta start somewhere I guess.
B000I2MRHE|3.0|I can see where this could be a good thing.  My daughter is 6 months old and has had this for probably 3 months.  She was too little when I got it.  I try it again every couple of weeks.  She is now almost 14 pounds and is 25 inches long.  She just doesn't fit comfortably in it.  I think if the ladybug was a little softer, she may like it more...it just seems to hard for her to lay on.  I wouldn't spend $40 on it.  There are lots of other tummy time toys out there that seem to be better.
031606792X|3.0|It felt like #3 was supposed to be the end...somehow, I figure her publisher saw $$$ and begged her to squeeze out another novel in the series.  It wasn't unbearable, but it wasn't fantastic either.  I flew through the first 3 books as they came, but by the fourth I felt like, \\"Alright, already!!!\\"  I forced myself to keep going.  It was tedious at times and lost a lot of the mood and momentum of the first 3 books.<br /><br />MOMS-Please read:  I am a middle school teacher and a mom as well.  This book has a lot of implied sexual contact that you might want to discuss with your daughters and remind them that Bella and Edward are married.  I'm not a prude when it comes to what I am reading for myself, but I almost cringe when my students tell me they are reading this book!<br /><br />If you have read the first three, you might as well finish.  Yes, the book is very \\"happily ever after,\\" but isn't that what chick-lit is all about?  What did people expect?
B001F7AP5C|4.0|Mao: The Unknown Story deserves some attention.  For those weary of Mao history, perhaps one more book will not make a difference.  All histories are ultimately subjective.  Some more than others.  Jung Chang did not undertake this book to make Mao a nice person.  Instead, it gives us as all books do - some insight into historical leaders.  Does the book lack a balanced perspective?  Sometimes.  Does this invalidate the book?  Certainly not.  Did she and Jon Halliday do their homework?  Definitely.  Could the book have been better? Sure, in some places, Jung's appraisal of Mao's character (especially in the early years) feels more opinionated than observed.  After all, people change and do evolve, and making certain definitive statements about how Mao was like even as a young man - may be jumping the gun and could have been better tempered. I think this what the critics of this book are responding to.<br /><br />I have yet to read a Chinese history book that was happy.  So let's face the facts - 20th century China went through a massive upheaval and shock.  That they've been able to bounce back and become today's superpower has little to do with Mao, who liberated the nation but subjected it to his harsh ideologies.  The men who succeeded Mao's leadership have to take some credit for where it is now - not Mao alone.  He took them out of one darkness into another, and set the tone for the other country's leaders to improve on the country's fortunes.  This is my response to those that say that \\"Mao did it all in spite of being a mass murderer.\\"  Mao had a friendly smile but he was brutal, so I am more than okay with an author who wants to address that point. The book is clearly a labour of love or hate that the authors committed themselves to bringing to the public.<br /><br />GET THIS BOOK IF...<br /><br />a) You like reading about power and understanding why China is the way it is today.  This is a good study into power and how Mao shaped (and subverted) Chinese politics.  His political legacies are still felt, making this a relevant read.  + 1 point for addressing the Chinese psyche.<br /><br />b) You want a clear, readable text.  This isn't a dense, academic text.  The writing is straightforward but the facts speak for themselves most of the time. + 1 point for writing style and organisation.<br /><br />c) You want to understand Mao but not worry too much about other details.  The book focusses mainly on Mao and doesn't divert too much into the other Chinese politicians so be aware of that.  More research may be needed on them.  0.5 points for their backstories.<br /><br />d) You need to know how Korea, SE Asia and Russia figured in China's development and vice versa.<br />Historical scholars will find this interesting, especially if they're into Asian or Chinese history.  The book is 616 pages long with an additional 184 pages devoted to footnotes, research sources and indexes.  + 1 point for usefulness.<br /><br />e) You have read other Mao books and need more.  If you have read other Mao bios, and want more details, this provides more clarity on certain things - e.g. his unwieldy  relationships with Russia.  + 1 point for delineating new info.<br /><br />NOW - If you're new to Mao, do some basic reading on him first before jumping into this.  Casual readers may appreciate this more with some background googling on Mao first.  It's not a bad place to start, but you do need to know more about Chinese history to fully appreciate where Jung Chang is coming from sometimes.  Characters like Sun Yat Sen aren't discussed in much detail so have your google ready.<br /><br />Perhaps too much of modern China has been seen through Mao's rule but he remains its most visible personality and prism for now.  Nonetheless, this is not an all-round introduction of modern China and will assume you understand some aspects.  If not, I'd also recommend another Chinese history book to help you fill in the gaps as well.  However, Mao Tse Tung cannot be ignored and Mao: The Unknown Story merits a look.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|I'm glad to see I'm not the only one on earth that thinks this is a good movie.  I've always liked it a lot, and I'm not really sure why so many diss this film.  It's a hell of a lot darker than the first one, in fact REALLY dark.  The scenes in the \\"temple of doom\\" are very intense, especially for their time (the controversy this film engineered made the MPAA invent the PG-13 rating).  But the film has even more stunts than the first film (and a lot of them are awesome).  I especially like the mining car chase (even though it's a little hard to believe at times, even in escapist cinema like this one).  The \\"dinner\\" scene could give current reality TV shows (where people eat disgusting things) a run for its money.  It's a very memorable film, although it's may be too intense for very young children.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a very good film.  Ford is excellent as usual, Kate Capshaw (the future Mrs. Spielberg) is kooky and kind of endearing, and Short Round is a decent kid sidekick (at least you don't want Indy to throw under the tracks or anything like that).  Spielberg's direction is excellent as usual, and I haven't heard people complaining about this one like they have about the latest entry.  This is a film that should be revisited.
B00005JPO1|1.0|I was such a fan of Indiana Jones when it first came out.  The beauty of the premise was it revolved around a very complex man who lived two lives; that of a Professor and that of a globe trotting archeologist.  Even though the second movie (Temple of Doom) was the most disappointing, it was still better then this over the top attempt to make more money on a popular franchise.    Once again, Spielberg & Lucas do it THEIR way.  It doesn't matter if they break the barriers of realism.  C'MON GUYS, I used to love your work.  And sadly, they know exactly what they're doing.  War of the Worlds wasn't like this!     So what happened to the first movie we all know and loved?  Raiders of the Lost Ark came on to the scene as a breakthrough genre, making the Saturday morning serials that I'm too young to remember come to life...and Ford played it perfectly.  He was born for the role.  Indiana Jones ventured his way across the global, finding artifacts and history.  Sometimes having to fight his way through a world where civilization had not found it's foothold.  There were great stunts, great villains and most all...the fun that comes with going on that journey.  The supernatural element of Raiders was kept to a minimum.  We were teased throughout about the `Power of God' and the influence of the Ark.  So when something out of this world happened, we believed it.  It was scary.  And most of all, it worked at the most minimal state.     Now...Indy is surviving an atomic explosion in a refrigerator!?  I don't care how much lead that thing was lined with, he would have been smear on the inside when it finally stopped!  And falling over not just one 80 foot waterfall in an amphibious car...BUT THREE?!  That car would have been splintered on the first fall!  This puts Indiana Jones in a Superhero, indestructible category and de-humanizes him.  And he barely got hurt.  By the third act of Raiders, he was almost incapacitated.  But we were routing for him to keep going.  By the third act of this one it was apparent that nothing could kill him, so I didn't care anymore.    None of this might have bothered me too much if the movie had been really entertaining...but it wasn't.  Quite frankly it bored me at times.  I was glad to see Karen Allen return and some of the nostalgia was nice to see.  I like Shai LeBouf but he is Spielberg's golden boy of the moment and he's putting him in every movie he can.  He just seemed like an add-in here.  I've always admired Ford though.  He still persists as a great action hero despite his age.  He looked a little more haggard when doing his stunts and his punches didn't have the finesse they used too, but he looked great for his age.  He altered Indy's demeanor for this role to reflect his senior status and how things had changed.  Unfortunately the script could really carry the weight of the situation.    I felt like after watching this movie Spielberg and Lucas were saying, `Ha!  You wanted it so bad we knew we could make it over the top and still get your money.'  For Spielberg, a man who uses so many digital composite shots and green screens, yet claims he loves movies for the grandeur of making movies, it's hard to believe he won't shoot a film on digital like his friend George.  Seems like quite a hypocrisy.  I should have known.
B00005JPO1|4.0|Everyone seems to forget the Indiana Jones movies are pulp movies in the same way the Flash Gordon movies were, the same as the James Bond movies and Star Wars movies are.  They are \\"the continuing adventures of...\\" types of movies.  While this is not the best of the Indy movies, I personally think everyone was expecting a remake if Raiders of the Lost Ark.  In the spirit of the type of movie this is, it is a great movie.  Is it a great 'Indiana Jones' movie?  No.  I do like it better than 'Temple of Doom', but less than 'Last Crusade.'  Yes, 'Raiders' is the archetype for all Indy movies, but to expect the first Indy movie in 2 decades to rehash what has already come is stupid.  This is pulp fiction in its truest form, like (as I stated) James Bond.  It has its good moments, as well as its bad.  Come on, you cannot say you didn't like seeing Marion again and the banter between her and Indy.  If you look at the scenes between Karen Allen and Harrison Ford, it is hard to believe twenty plus years have passed since they have been on camera together.  So, my humble opinion, in the spirit of \\"in the continuing adventures of Indiana Jones\\" this is a good movie, as a stand alone in the franchise, not the best but not the worst.

0439023483|5.0|This book had so much carnage and ferocity. I read that many felt that Ms. Collins was extreme in her writing. I, however, believe that she was true to herself. As an author that knew exactly what she wanted to write she never held back for fear of offending someone. She pushed forward, not sparing anyone's feelings, including herself's. I admire her a great deal for that.<br /><br />Katniss alone is deserving of a five-star rating. She has an incredible spirit that she emanates with every breath she takes and every word she speaks. She is completely unbreakable, someone worthy of our daughters' admiration. After everything that she's been through, all the suffering she has endured; emotional and physical she is still pushing forward. Caring for Prim and never feeling sorry for herself. I believe myself to be a strong-willed woman who says what she thinks and feels. I therefore admire that quality in others', whether they are fictional characters, such as Ms. Katniss Everdeen, or an author simply being true to who she is, like Ms. Suzanne Collins. Thank you for creating an amazing, enticing series! I look forward to your next series, whatever it may be.

He suggested a concept album, and band members Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley agreed, much to the chagrin of Ace Frehley and Eric Carr. Then, later in 1981, The Elder was released, and subsequently tanked. The band rebounded (sans Ace) and eventually found success with different albums (and a different look). The Elder was forgotten.<br /><br />As far as a KISS record, The Elder falls terribly short of my expectations. That does not make this a bad album, though. It will not appeal to those who don't like extra cheese with their music (I like a large serving), as the lyrics are worthy of mockery, and the string arrangements are a bit over the top.<br /><br />To address the lyrics, though, KISS were never known for their insightful lyrics, and as with a lot of bands, I pay attention to the melody rather than the words. Paul's falsetto in \\"The Oath\\" and \\"Just A Boy\\" is some of his best. Gene is still Gene (\\"Mr. Blackwell\\"), but explores other areas of his vocal ability (\\"A World Without Heroes\\"). Ace's song \\"Dark Light\\" is unfairly lambasted as some of his worst work vocally, and I disagree. The man is not known for his brilliant singing voice, but I don't see how his performance here pales in comparison to anything he's done before, especially considering his lack of enthusiasm for this album. Paying attention to the lyrics will kill this album for almost anyone, but the melodies themselves are not bad.<br /><br />Musically, The Elder gets better with every listen. The bad reviews set the tone for me before I even listened to the album, so I didn't like it at first. I admit the first three or four tracks are not very strong, but \\"Dark Light,\\" \\"I,\\" and especially \\"The Oath\\" are found to be hard, guitar-driven rockers that with a bit better production could have been true KISS staples. A little more Ace would've been welcome, also.<br /><br />My main criticism on this album is the production. Bob Ezrin has produced many fantastic albums; The Elder is not one of those. The thinness of the guitar and drums is rivaled only by KISS' previous album, Unmasked. I especially think Eric Carr deserved more presence on this album (the double bass drum work during the chorus of \\"The Oath\\" is almost completely lost under the poor production). Fortunately (for some), KISS pulled a 180 when Michael James Jackson was hired for Creatures Of The Night, and gave Carr and the rest of band the sound that more properly would have brought KISS into the 80's.<br /><br />Overall, there are KISS-like moments in Music From \\"The Elder\\", but this is not a proper KISS record. It is, however, entertaining to listen to, and sounds remarkably epic (in a slightly jocular way) when cranked loud, and because of this, I rate it three stars.be hard, guitar-driven rockers that with a bit better production could have been true KISS staples.

1582406723|5.0|... in the best sense.  Volume 1 of the Walking Dead would make for a perfect zombie film in and of itself.  The fact that there are already another 7 anthologies awaiting the readers seemed frankly too good to be true (I've rarely been happier to be wrong).  When I read Robert Kirkman's forward to this first volume, I remembered the feeling of seeing the credits roll after my favorite movie ended, that agony of having to leave characters and places without knowing if I would ever get to see them again (this is admittedly not so much a problem for the youth of today in this age of infinite Disney sequels). The Walking Dead is an answer to that pain... Kirkman's goal is to spin a story that tells you What Happens Next.  And unlike the eternal sequels we have come to expect from Hollywood, these stories aren't endless iterations on the same theme... they instead show the evolutions of each of the characters in this world after civilization's fall.     Kirkman's writing is sharp and believable (at least it covered how I think people would talk if being chased by zombies).  The relationships are vital and poignant, thus capturing another crucial element of the zombie genre.  Tony Moore's art in this first volume is extraordinary.  The story is told as much from the images and expressions of the characters as it is in the writing - Kirkman and Moore created an amazing tapestry in these first 6 issues.  I was genuinely moved.      Now to grouse a bit.  Moore only drew the first 6 issues, contained in this volume.  Other than the covers of the ensuing anthologies, that's all you get of Moore, which was a bit of a rude shock when I opened Volume Two - Charlie Adlard took the reins in Issue #7.  Adlard has made the series his own, and done a great job of it, but I still miss the look and feel of those first 6 issues.      That said, I think that the comic has transformed from a great idea into a worthy epic part of the Modern Zombie Canon (Simpon Pegg even pens the after-word of one of the later volumes).     Now you'd better stop reading and click the \\"Buy\\" button.  It's time that you met Rick.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Great movie. Reminds you not to take yourself so serious and enjoy life and older peoples stories.
0763619612|5.0|I love this book and my kids love it too. I'd say go ahead and buy it. It is a great story about how a student really learns how to channel negativity and frustration into creative expression and then take what she learns and teaches it to another person.
0743496736|5.0|Ok this was ripped from the headlines. (Columbine etc and other like incidents) The book really got behind the students reasoning of why he did what he did. The writer covered POVs from the judge involved his friends and his parents --I loved the rich characters in the story. I don't at all condone what was done and the # of innocent lives affected but I got to see things from the killers Pov what would lead him to do this. Interesting twist at the end.
0736063684|5.0|Ever tried feeling your muscles while working out to see what is getting worked?    If you are into 0% body fat and just want to be fit overall, then this book is probably not for you.     This book is GREAT for people that want to target muscle groups in their workouts. It shows exactly what exercises work exactly which muscles. Want bigger pecs? bigger arms? bigger legs? a flat stomach? Then this book can tell what exercises you should be doing.    An example: 'Push ups' taget your pecs and arms, what you might not know is that 'pec-flys' target only your pecs and concentrate the entire workout on your pecs, building that paticular muscle faster giving your pecs a more defined look... faster.    My goal is to become ripped all in the right spots. Not too big.. but not too small. Whatever that means. And after years of exercise and using different methods, I have finally fouund out that nothing beats working out every other day by maxing your muscles out in 6 reps about 10 times and changing your target muscle the next time you work out. This book tells you what exercies you need to be performing to target the muscles you want to 'bulk' up.    Sidenote: I am 200lbs and consume about 150 grams of protein per day through the use whey powder and food. After 1 month I started recovering faster
B0014VPFTA|1.0|First of all, this is a painfully boring cd. I love his first 2 cds and listen to them all the time but this one is just not all that great. When I saw this album online, it lists \\"Say\\" as the last song. My wife bought me the 2 cd set but it didn't have Say on it so I returned it to the store and traded for the cd with the darker cover. It didn't list Say either but I thought maybe it was a hidden track. Well, it's not on there. Why is \\"Say\\" listed as one of the songs on the cd when you research it on Amazon, Best Buy, or even JM's website but when you buy the cd, \\"Say\\" isn't on it? Are there in fact THREE versions of this crappy cd?
B00192KCQ0|5.0|CD was in excellent condition, still in original wrapper as advertised.  If you are a Metallica fan, this new CD is definitely worth listening to!
B001DTPZNY|3.0|The kids are going to love it. They won't get the Brando hat. Shia doesn't cut it here. Each new movie doesn't have to be bigger to be better. But put on the popcorn. Line the kids up and enjoy.
0375826726|1.0|If I had realized when I picked up this book that it wasn't the final installment, I wouldn't have bought it. I loved Paolini's first book, his second was a bore (but had a brief bright spot of action and conflict at the end), and this third installment was just as bad as the second. When I finished the final page of book three only to find out I have to wait for a book four to discover how it ends, I was extremely annoyed.     In his acknowledgments, Paolini says he expanded the series to four books because Brisngr ended up being more complex than he expected. The truth is, he just needed a good editor. The story isn't as much complex as it is BORING. The author provides thousands of utterly useless facts, conversations, and actions. At one point in the book he points out that one of the characters is long winded. Unfortunately, it's true of the author himself.    This could easily have been the final book (and should have been). The story does have a few, brief bright spots when the action heats up. And the author has some creative ideas. But there are only about 150 pages of worthwhile reading and they do not make up for the other 600 pages of drivel. If the author had used the other 600 pages to actually tell the story, then this book could have wrapped up the series.    I feel like I've been cheated. I won't be buying the fourth book and I can't recommend this one.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|By far one of the most inspirational and moving films I have ever seen. For years, I have shared and recommended this film to all my friends and family. Being an animal lover, rescuer  and protector, the scene with the baby chicks was a bit disturbing as was the one with the overloaded donkey, but overall, this is one of my all time favorite films.
B00005JM20|5.0|It's a great story, great acting, excellent comedy... and all round great film.    I honestly couldn't say much more without giving away the story... needless to say, there's a laugh or three in every scene.
B0017WI5VQ|4.0|Is this girl 19 years old?? If '19' is what she can do being 19 years old, I don't know what she's going to do as she gets older. Amazing vocals, songs, lyrics... really moving
B0019EXZY4|4.0|Not the usual caper movie. And that's good. Truth is stranger than fiction. The entertainment comes as the dumb threaten the arrogant. The evil punish the careless. And the quick outwit the establishment. A marriage survives. And the details are still out there.
B001BYLFE4|4.0|The second disk is just a DVD-ROM containing the digital copy, it won't play in a DVD player (I tested it just to answer your questions). And just in case you're wondering, it's DRM protected.
B000E1155E|4.0|Yes I am, I'm 40! Thank you. I am not new to the AM's but have watched the media hype and listened to the album, and guess what. Its good. Ok, it doesn't brake any musical moulds but what it is, is this. Its a collection of good songs, with intelligent lyrics and played with aplomb and energy. Twenty year old kids (and students) are of course well known for thinking that they know everything but in fact they know nothing at all.    The AM's don't try and sing songs about Faustian themes and Daniel Beddingfield \\"love me or I'll jump off this bridge\\" type anthems, but rather songs that would have been just as relevant to me as a \\"know-nothing student\\" 20 years ago, because when you are that age, what is important to you is getting laid and partying. I have no idea why someone would want to be a student in a culture where you couldn't drink until you were 21,that would constitute a waste of the entire University experience. Hell, if I had actually had to pay fees to go to University, I would have expected table service during lectures.     These songs address the important issues of songs about how difficult it is to tap off with birds in nightclubs, the logistical and semantic issues regarding attempting to persuade the driver of a late night vehicle licensed for the conveyance of paying members of the public (a taxi) to allow the carriage of 6 members rather than the usual 5, added to which the additional complication of the possession of kebabs causes. If you are British, you will be aware that the food that the Am's are referring to are kebabs as these are the \\"industry standard\\" for wandering around with at night when the clubs kick out. And of course we have all tried the changing jumpers and rejoining the back of the line scenario depicted in \\"From the Ritz to the Rubble\\" when denied entry by over-zealous door staff.    These lads are not pretending to be the stars of \\"Dawsons Creek\\" (if any teens had tried talking and acting like that where I came from, they would have (rightly) received a good kicking) but they merely (and cleverly) are writing about what they know, and performing it with an energy and precision that is refreshing.    In these times where musical dross in manufactured by the shovel full by mediocrity factories like \\"X-Factor\\" and \\"(insert name)s got talent\\", its not surprising that these lads generated some hype. Fair play to em. Mind you, Britney's on the comeback trail so this might be an example of something some reviewers might prefer to get excited about. Consider my scorn well and truly poured.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|all episodes in order of their broadcast     great quality   same overacting by Kirk  but i love it    enjoyable
B000000W5L|5.0|What you have here is the Rolling Stones giving us back exactly what we had been missing right under our noses, and taking it to places that the creators never could have possibly imagined. Every element of pure American music is here and there isn't a sour note. From the smoke filled juke joints of the deep south, to the slick blues of Chicago's West Side, to a Texas roadhouse, to a gospel choir, right back to Chuck Berry, it's all here. Everything great about American music deconstructed and built back up to reach places never before imagined.   This is music one could imagine spilling out into Beale Street in 1955 or shaking the rafters of a Mississippi blues hall or belting out of some Baptist church. It's what every Saturday night should sound like. No need to break down each song here. They all have their charms. Needless to say no music collection is complete without it, and if you don't get it, you don't get American music and you surely don't get Rock and Roll.
B001GKO45K|5.0|I don't care of you buy this film for its innovations in cinema or because it is one of the greatest examples of propaganda in film history, you must own this DVD!    Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the Third Reich to make this film.  She was granted unrestricted access to The Fuhrer and the Nazi Conference at Nuremburg.  If you notice, at the beginning of the film, the shot of Adolf Hitler is out of focus.  There was a miscommunication between The Fuhrer's men and the film crew and they were originally not allowed onto the tarmac for the landing.    In scope and grandeur, this film will give you chills.  A night rally complete with torches and many symbols of the Reich make for an almost ghostly scene.  You get rhetoric from almost all of the major players from the time, including Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler & Dr. Joseph Goebbels (The Minister of Propaganda) himself.  A Leni Riefenstahl masterpiece by every account.
0811729117|3.0|Was an interesting read, a little heavy on personal political views on the way the German soldier was slighted after the war. Not once was there any mention of wrongdoing by any German soldier or the validity of the war.  I got the point of the hardships the front line soldiers endured, but the constant references to post Germany not appreciating their sacrifices were somewhat distracting.  Definately had a lot of interesting insight on tank tactics and supply problems.  It opened my eyes that Tigers were fairly vulnarable if not used correctly.  The author vividly describes his methods of preparation and execution in battle. This allows the reader to understand the need for good leadership and the consequences when leadership is lacking.  Overall I found the book insightful and would recommend to anyone who is interested in learning about a weapon that carries a certain respect in WWII history.     T.Parfitt
0375826726|4.0|I loved this book, but this is not a children's book. As I read other reviews and people calling it a children's book, I am amazed. Yes, the story is fantasy, and a great concept for children, but there is way too much gory detail in these books. The opening of brisinger with the gory sacrifices to the Ra'zacs is not something I would want my child to hear. It would give them nightmares. The first book with the infant on the spear left a terrible image in my mind, and right then I quit reading the books to my kids and just read them myself. Once again,I love the books, but as a parent I want to warn other parents out there that these books are very bloody, and scary for children. Great for older teens and adults. NOT a children's book.
B000002H4C|5.0|This is my all time favorite driving soundtracks. I never had road rage when I listened to it. I was too busy listening and driving.
B001GAH9YI|5.0|Dr. Caligari presents the viewer with a frightening vision of the world through the lens of German Expressionism.  It's surprising how frightening and impactful this film can be.  You will have dreams about it, I promise. These between-the-wars German films are riddled with creepy foreshadowing for us in the present, who know what was about to happen in Germany.    I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It's truly fascinating. And, it really (really) is an art film, since it purposefully and strikingly exhibits the new art of the German inter-war milieu. So, be prepared for an other-worldly excursion into the \\"total work of art,\\" or Gesamtkunstwerk, of this monumental and influential film.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|To start with,just the thought of a movies taking 4 years to make is attention worthy in itself.  The 2 leads the girl and Lee Pace ( a favorite since A Soldiers Girl and now Pushing Daisies) just flows through the movie like it was written for them. They are perfect. The locations are breathtaking and I've just watched the movie for them. Since I received this movie, it has not come out of my cd changer for it seems I am drawn to watch over and over. Visually and well as the 20's settting in old Hollywood set this up to be a long time favorite.
B00005JPO1|1.0|Look, we all knew it was unlikely to be better than those that came before it, but my GOD! This film was bad beyond all expectations! We're talking POD-RACE levels of stupidity. It's troubling and sad to see characters we grew up loving and caring about being manipulated and tortured in the hands of their insane creators. Look at the stunts in the recent Batman film. Look good, eh? I don't understand why Lucas & co. insist on not getting their hands dirty and CGI-ing this film beyond all recognition.     I'll be honest. At the start of the movie, CGI aside, it didn't seem THAT bad. I thought maybe there was a chance it was going to work out. Without giving spoilers, I can tell you that as soon as Indy and the gang hit the jungle things went terribly, terribly wrong. We have Shia swinging like tarzan from vines followed by an army of CGI monkeys and Marion defying all her natural maternal instincts by DRIVING THE JEEP CARRYING HERSELF AND HER SON NOT TO MENTION INDY OVER A FRIGGING CLIFF!!!!!!  INTENTIONALLY!!!!!!!    Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. There was no coming back from that for me. My brain turned to jelly as, much like the Star Wars prequels before it, the Indy show looked more like a video game than a film. I suppose there are plenty of gamer types out there who might enjoy this thing. Me? I'm interested in cinema, not all this baggage, so I have now severed my connection to anything with LucasArts seal of approval stamped on it. At least we can watch the old Indy films without a hassle. Try doing that with Star Wars, at least on a big screen tv. I better not go there.     Am I the only one who smells the Indy/Star Wars crossover potential? Was not a giant door kicked open toward the end of this film that will now allow Lucas and his sick imagination to run wild, culminating in the dreaded Han Solo/Indiana Jones handshake?    In summary - new Indy stinks. Terrible film making. Good effort from the actors, but the people behind the camera have apparently lost their sanity. Do what I do, and what I did for the Star Wars prequels - pretend it never happened. Let Indy and his daddy ride off into the sunset at the end of Indy III, a fitting and classy ending to a wonderfully entertaining franchise.
1401322425|5.0|I have made several of the dishes in this cookbook and they have turned out very well.  If you enjoy cooking with seasonal, fresh ingredients you will find it a valuable addition to your collection.
B001DHXT20|5.0|I ALREADY HAVE THIS MOVIE ON DVD WICH I PURCHASED FROM A STORE AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS PLACE GETS THE MOVIES WAY IN ADVANCE! I GOT THIS DVD ON THE 11 OF OCT, ABOUT 2 WEEKS BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GOT IT AND HE TOLD ME THAT THEY BEEN HAVING IT FOR ABOUT 5 DAYS BEFORE I PURCHASED IT! MUST HAVE MOVIE ALONG WITH IRON MAN! YOU SHOULD WATCH IRON MAN FIRST AND THEN THIS ONE BECAUSE THE ENDING OF THIS ONE KIND OF TELLS YOU WHATS COMING IN THE NEAR FUTURE!
0385340567|4.0|This book wasn't quite as good as most of them.  I think the political leanings of Lee Child got in the way of Jack Reachers character.  I'll keep reading but hope Child gets back to the Reacher of previous books.
0743243153|4.0|IT WAS A SUBSTITUTE BUT PROMPT DELIVERY SERVICE.  NOTHING ELSE TO SAY . HAVE NOT READ YET.
0930289234|3.0|I'm a huge graphic novel fan....I especially like the dark and serious ones.  So I have to thank Watchmen for helping to usher in this style of graphic novel....but the actual experience of reading it isn't that enjoyable.  It is so self-indulgent and pretentious, that it often becomes boring to read.  Frankly, I was disappointed considering all of the hype surrounding it.
0375826726|2.0|The first book in the series, \\"Eragon,\\" helped my dyslexic son develop a interest in reading. \\"Eldest\\" had its moments, too. We have slogged through Brisingr's dialog and philosophy. Many of the other shortcomings are starting to wear on us:    1. Characters usually don't speak with contractions in the manner of \\"Data\\" of Star Trek, TNG. Dialog is usually strained, even among intimates. Eragon complains of having to sit through endless political meetings with the dwarves----even worse is reading about them.  2. I have the sense that the author keeps his thesaurus at hand and insists on using a four-syllable word when a concise Anglo-saxon one-syllable word will do.  3. Add to this the endless descriptions of unimportant details and one has the elements of a long evening with a 12-year-old. I had to question whether Paolini was getting paid by the word for this installment.    At one point, one hopes that Galbatorix might fly in and put an end to the squabbling, posturing, and political infighting. Eragon's internal conflicts make him seem weak in relation to his powers and position to the point his character is weakened. Even Nasuada seems to view him as a wishy-washy pawn in her political games.    If one is already involved in the story, by all means finish it. I find that I'm not recommending the series to new readers, however. Most disappointing is that the book pretends to be about magic and yet the mundane has claimed it. Even when Eragon runs into \\"Tenga\\" under very mysterious circumstances, Eragon seems almost dismissive of the historical significance of Elven structures in Varden territory, magic texts, and the odd personality of his host.    Perhaps Paolin will pull it all together in Book IV of the \\"trilogy?\\"
0783226845|5.0|I am happy with Amazon delivery method, But their is a section of poor Film Quality and distortion when played !
B000063UR2|5.0|Legend, the Ultimate Edition brought back my childhood while allowing me to share it with the next. What a wonderful DVD with both versions of the film and enough extras to satisfy most. This is NOT a movie review (although that too would be high) but a review of this edition. If your research or knowledge of the movie peaks your interest, then this version is right for you.
B000066C6Z|5.0|I love this movie. It never gets old. Top Secret is an often overlooked comedic treasure.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is a movie that I have loved since I first saw it as a child. I bought it on VHS and finally on DVD. Although it is old, the special effects for that time period were outstanding. It is actually the only movie that I have ever seen Leslie Neilson acting in a serious part.
B001BTG3OQ|3.0|SB-900 overheated during a 25th anniversary shooting, it overheated fairly quickly, and I had to go with my backup the SB-800.  I was very disappointed in how fast it overheated and shut down. Just the day before, I used the SB-900 at a high school football game, took 180 pictures and it worked great. I suppose it did not over heat because of the time between shots. The anniversary was lots of pictures one after another. Never the less Nikon should build their flag ship Flash to with stand more than their second in command the SB-800.    One thing about the SB-900, the multiple flash set up is very easy. I like the way it's built and the features, I just don't like the fact it overheated so fast.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|My favorite Tim Burton movie, the second it The Corpse Bride.  Exceptional quality on the Blu-Ray (far out shines the DVD version).
0375826726|2.0|When I was reading through Brisingr I kept waiting for all the exciting scenes to happen. After defeating the Ra'Zac I expected Eragon to keep going on more adventures. Instead, he sits in with the Varden, for oh too many pages, while I just want him to go off and do something.    I really couldn't understand Eragon's fascination with Sloan. He's a minor character and that whole subplot was not interesting enough to make in it in this book (well, guess you could say that for 3/4 of the book.) Anyway, I understand there's some need for Eragon's transformation as a character, but it should not be boring. I was excited when Arya met up with Eragon, because I thought well that's the whole point of this trip; they can be alone. And then they just talked, and talked.     I seriously hated Nasuada in this book. For all her wisdom, why did she have a Dragon Rider who's supposed to overthrow Galbatorix sit and listen to dwarves talk? When Orik wasn't around at the beginning I just assumed that he had become king. But no, they actually have some big debate thing, even though everyone knows Orik is going to win anyway. Why did Paolini make us listen to the dwarves? This whole book I was waiting for Eragon to go back to Ellesmera because I loved that part in Eldest. But no, politics.     My favorite part was when they finally arrived in Ellesmera, even though it was rushed. Everyone knew throughout the whole book knew that Eragon was going to find his sword under the Menoa tree. I was glad when he got it, but I didn't so much like the process. Eragon found out Brom is his father (uhm, what's the big deal?) and that dragons use their heart of hearts to live forever. This felt a little like Paolini thought of it out of thin air. It makes sense, but I wanted a better explanation.     Then, the big battle scene. Eragon shows everyone with his big blue dragon and fiery sword wo ho. What I don't understand is why Paolini keeps creating more villians for Eragon to possibly get killedby, when he does have to kill Galbatorix by the end of the 8th book. Though I'm glad there is probably a future for Eragon and Arya, even though they have a total of about 3 conversations in the book.    And we dont even get to see Murtagh and Oromis fight. I found this fight confusing, and then sad when Oromis and Glaedr die. Seriously, if Eragon's mentors cannot defeat Murtagh Eragon is going to die a brutal death. This scene would have been a great climax, if we didn't have to see it through Glaedr's POV (how does that even work anyway?)    Oh, I can't forget Roran and Katrina. Personally, I getting sick of their gushy loves scenes meant to spice up a book of fighting. And I get the importance of Roran (he's just a man, but he's awesome) even if you can kill 200 men, I still think you're boring. I get it, Roran's great, he rescued Carvalhall blah blah blah... I just don't want to have to read about him anymore.    Overall, I love this series, and I loved Eldest. I loved seeing Eragon study in Ellesmera and get turned into an elf. I even loved how he was bested my Murtagh and the father revelation. I don't understand how some are saying Brisingr is better than Eldest, because i was just bored with Brisingr. Eragon actually does important things in Eldest, while throughout Brisingr, I kept thinking: Do you really have to write about all this nonessential stuff, Christopher Paolini?
B00000G3I2|5.0|Brought back a rush memories! I enjoyed watching it again after so many years, but the music is what was most nostalgic. Glad to make it part of my personal library.
B00005ATZT|4.0|The Fugitive---Harrison Ford-Tommy Lee Jones  Two multi-talented actors in the same movie-Great! One of the best remakes of any film or series I've ever seen. I list this as one of my top 10 movies. The street scenes as well as location scenes are well filmed. The story follows a simple line, without the viewer wondering what is happening! Superb movie, I gave it 4 stars, because I've never seen a 5 star film.
0375826726|5.0|I love the \\"Eragon\\" Series and am really satisfied with this installment. It has plenty of twist and turns and more than enough action. I suggest this book along with \\"Eldest\\" and \\"Eragon\\" However good this book is I do suggest you read the aforementioned books first in order to fallow the story properly.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I am glad to have seen this version of \\"The Women,\\" which arrived in excellent condition.
B00005N5S5|4.0|I thought this was a really good dvd. My only concern really, was the fact that the picture quality as people have said is a bit grainy, but on the positive side, I find this movie with the grainy picture adds some character. Most of the old movies looked this way, and adds a bit of creepiness to the movie.    But onto easter eggs. They're kind of cheesy, but are entertaining. If you're on I think the special features page, and I think the sound page? if you keep clicking the curser around in all directions it will jump up to a little square that is up above the words that says things like Trailers or whatever. If you keep clicking this same little box it plays a few different short interviews. Even after you watched the short interview, click the same link again, and it'll play a different interview. Not sure how many there are in total.     It's kinda cheesy though because it's just a still picture of whoever they're interviewing, and the sound is rolling. So it's mainly an audio interview, but with still pictures thrown in. They interview James Cameron I think, as well as Michael Biehn, and a few of the effects guys.  It's really cool. I mean it's not much as far as extras, but at least it's something, so I can't really complain. So anyone who has this dvd, and hasn't found the Easter Eggs, definitely fidget around with it, and you will find em.
159102594X|4.0|When I started The Blade Itself, I had just come off reading Scott Lynch and Brandon Sanderson; in the thralls of a new-authors/good-book high.  Joe Abercrombie was recommended to me to continue the streak, so I dove in eagerly.<br /><br />At first, I found it slow-going, a surprise since I had been told his books were on par with the ones I had just finished. But then I realized I was having the same difficulty with The Blade Itself that I had had years ago, when starting a little tome called The Song of Ice and Fire. And I realized I was in the midst of another vast, character-based fantasy.<br /><br />Like ASOIAF, The Blade Itself follows several major characters--which is why The Blade Itself begins slowly, because you're building background and introductions for multiple protagonists. And also like ASOIAF, it's worth working through.<br /><br />You have Logan Ninefingers, who has an alter ego, The Bloody Nine, a blood-thirsty warrior from the North. Then you have Sand Dan Glokta, the crippled torture-survivor-turned-torturer, who is often compared to Tyrion from ASOIAF. Next is Jezal Dan Luthar, an arrogant, selfish young noble who is training for a great fencing contest. You have Ferro, an escaped slave warrior-ess who is hunted, but obsessed with getting vengeance for her enslavement. And, last, you have The First Magi, Bayaz, who turns out to be anything but the friendly, helpful wise wizard. Their stories all come together, though I argue there is no one, major propelling plot force. The plot twists were well-executed and I loved the dialogue--it brought me right back to Lynch's comical wittiness, which I have to say I really missed in Sanderson's books, which are much, much more dark.<br /><br />Abercrombie likes to take all the archetypal fantasy characters and sort of un-stereotype them. One negative review I read laments the fact that by the end of the trilogy, none of the characters seemed to have grown or changed for the better, and most of them wind up coming off as irredeemable and unlikeable. But I think this is exactly what Abercrombie was going for--a sense of realism in a fantasy world. People don't, really, change fundamentally who they are--the changes that characters undergo in this book are purposely realistic. At the core, they always remain who they were at the beginning. The trick is that Abercrombie lets you believe that his characters ARE the stereotypes at first. Then, through the slow revelation of tiny character flaws or historic details, he destroys those stereotypes--the noble savage Northern warrior turns out to not be so noble afterall. The torturer with the heart of gold really is kind of a jerk. The young, naïve, selfish nobleman remains a coward. This may make the characters seem unlikeable, but are any of the people you like in real life perfect? Do they have entirely noble, unselfish motivations for everything they do? Have they never done something bad or said something hurtful or acted selfishly? Are the heroes we worship really as heroic as we like to believe? Not to digress too much, but look at what we know of a few of the standard heroes of our history books today, like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson or Christopher Columbus. All those men did epically great things, and all of them also did terrible things.<br /><br />Another complaint is that the trilogy doesn't have a satisfactory end. I definitely agree on that note. I'm not sure if this is Abercrombie's continued dedication to realism (in real life, stories don't tie up neatly), or if he plans to continue the story at some point. I hope it's the latter because the characters are so compelling, and the story still has plenty of life to give. I know his next book is set in the same world, but not about the same characters and is a one-off-er, so hopefully the one after will continue the tale.and unlikeable.

B001990LNW|4.0|I have not yet seen Season 5 of Stargate Atlantis, but I certainly loved seasons 1-3, season 4 was ok, but I really couldn't get past the fact that Elizabeth weir is gone from the show and that Sam is the new leader.  I also recently learned that this will be the LAST season of Stargate Atlantis, the show will end in January on their 100th episode.  MGM and SciFi, have decided to no longer keep the show. It is such a shame!
B0017V7H70|5.0|If you know anything about sound and like good sound... avoid the 2008 remaster of this classic album at all costs and buy the 1994 issue instead. Especially if you're new to the Offspring, before the 2008 remaster ends up superseding the original 1994 master and this new master is all you are able to purchase. Why you ask? Because the 2008 remaster is a casualty of the loudness war... and if those words ring a bell to you it's because 2008 is the year the loudness war finally broke through into the mainstream thanks to the horrible mastering on Metallica's million selling disc \\"Death Magnetic\\". If you still don't know what the hell i am talking about visit Wikipedia and search \\"loudness war\\" and that should fill you in.    The 2008 remaster fixes some issues up with the original 1994 master and generally makes everything sound more crisp and nice like late 90's Offspring albums but the songs are brick walled and all the dynamics are completely gone thanks to over compression. Epitaph may be known as a punk label but they definitely aren't when it comes to conforming to todays accepted standard of mastering. This remaster is an insult. Great for your poor quality iPod headphones... terrible for your high fidelity stereo system.

031606792X|4.0|First off- I loved it. (There ARE spoilers below)<br />To all the haters out there: I don't understand those out there who chose to tear every word apart- searching for \\"plot holes\\" and \\"inconsistencies\\". Why can't a story just be a story? The point of writing your own story is that it's YOURS. If you think you can do better (all of you high and mighties out there) then I think you should build up the courage to do as SM did. Write your own! Make it a sad ending... turn Bella into some \\"normal\\" college student. I think the point everyones missing in all of this was made very clear in the novel. Bella was BORN to become a vampire. She has all of the skills and determination to do so. That's what I wanted. And for those of you who think she \\"had no choices\\" I clearly remember Bella fighting with herself whether or not she wanted to keep her humanity for longer. There were many points in the book where she thought about college and sticking around for her family.  If SM wanted to make it a happy ending then by all means... it's her book! I love happy endings. AND for all those out there who SLAM SM for making Bella so lovey dovey and less super strong woman... go read some other series!! I've read many series (Sherrilyn Kenyon for example) where over and over the women are strong, independent, and tough. I like those books but I also like this one. I found it refreshing to find a main character with a bit more emotion...<br /><br />Suprises: I didn't see the whole Jacob/Nessie thing coming. I remember gasping when it did! I did NOT expect the whole baby thing either! WOW! I heard in an interview that SM had a few other novels to inspire this book... I was wondering if one of them was Taltos (Anne Rice- goddess of vampire novels!!). It seems hauntingly similar to me. I was a little put off at first but in the end when she was so dedicated to Nessie- I got it. It made me feel that yearing for being a mother. I think it's perfect given SM's choices in life... she's a mom!<br /><br />I'll wrap this up... all I want to say on top of this is that I found the series as a whole the most addiciting I've ever read. I couldn't put the books down. I read them ALL in one week... staying up until 2/3 in the morning sometimes to get through the exciting parts. I really enjoyed these books. Maybe I'm not as picky as some of you literary geniuses out there but I know a good book when I read one. I'm still haunted by Bella's pain in the second book... but it makes sense. Anyone who's gone through relationships knows that feeling of loosing another half. I'm TOTALLY one of those people (like Bella) who jumps head over heels into a relationship. It's like a wild roller coaster ride. I deovte myself 100% to any relationship and hope that as the years go by (with many bumps alogn the way) things stay as happy as they were in the begining.<br /><br />Good job Stephenie Meyer! Keep up the good work girl! :) ( and keep up the music stuff too- i downloaded a ton of your inspiration songs last night and i love them! rock'n out right now!).wrap this up... all I want to say on top of this is that I found the series as a whole the most addiciting I've ever read.

0060558121|4.0|American Gods by Neil Gaiman is the story of a mysterious man aptly named Shadow. The story begins while he is in prison for a robbery gone badly, from the beginning cryptic messages and foreshadowing signal a running theme throughout the novel, the anticipation of the coming \\"storm.\\" As the layers of the story unfold you learn what exactly the \\"storm\\" is, and the consequences as a result. The novel weighs in at over 550 pages, but moves very quickly. Gaiman's writing style is quick and snappy, pushing the action at a reasonable pace while explaining the pertinent points well.<br /><br />The strength of this novel lies in its characters. Strange and mysterious, eccentric and funny, the strength of Gaiman's characterization is what makes the novel successful. Another strength of this novel is the characterization of America itself. The story takes place in few major cities, instead relying on a myriad of small towns in Middle America. He takes great care in describing the awe-inspiring size of the country and the thousands of small towns that dot the landscape. His description of the quintessential small town is spot on, and clearly the fruits of months of research. The novel is every bit the story of the country as it is as of protagonist, Shadow.<br /><br />It is not without it's problems, however, the eventual climax is a bit underwhelming, though it does adequately answer all the many questions the novel posed. Also, the story is titled \\"American Gods\\", but doesn't adequately deal with the idea of God. The story certainly deals with Gods, but the author clearly has a problem in deal with the almighty, and for the most part, ignores his presence (or lack thereof).<br /><br />The author did a great deal of research into the nature of fables and tales, of stories passed through generations and locked into the minds of the thousands of people who migrated to this country. In many ways the novel is a conglomeration of these tales. Gaiman is fascinated by the idea that America was founded and peopled by such a diverse set of people and ideals, each with their own set of beliefs and Gods.<br /><br />Though it does have its flaws, American Gods is a riveting good read. It holds your attention from chapter one and the plot twists and turns definitely keep your interest. Unlike many novels that leave open endings and unanswered questions, American Gods does a wonderful job of tying up all the lose ends leaving a wholly satisfying experience. It is the perfect summer read for someone looking for an interesting, original, and well-paced piece of literature.peopled by such a diverse set of people and ideals, each with their own set of beliefs and Gods.

B000UR366S|2.0|This album is for hardcore fans.      My biggest gripe with the album is the immaturity of the lyrics.  Most of her \\"attacks\\" on what our society has done to the environment sound like the self-righteous plaint of a 13 year old junior high school student.     It's hard to take lyrics like these seriously.     Musically, the album's certainly not readily accessible.  It has grown on me with time, but the lyrics really get in the way of me wanting to give this album repeated listenings.
0060557818|5.0|Most novelists would describe themselves as storytellers of some kind, arguably the function of the Novel is to tell a story while conveying certain themes to the reader. However, the large population of today's novelists are more concerned with rehashing well-worn thematic storytelling instead of pushing the envelop of creativity to take the reader on paths they haven't seen, and experience things from angles they never comprehended. Luckily for us, Neil Gaiman has asserted his role firmly in the latter. Neverwhere can be best described as an amalgamation of elements derived from many facets of fantasy and science fiction. What makes the story successful is the ideal blend of the fantastical and the real, the contrast fuels the narrative and makes the novel a cohesive piece of great fiction.<br /><br />The story follows Richard Mayhew, a typical Londoner of little regard. On his way to a dinner function with his fiancee he stumbles upon a bleeding young woman on the street. He takes her home and his life changes forever. The young woman, aptly named Door, takes him on a journey to a world standing in the shadows, full of people who can talk to rats, traveling markets, and assassins of the most ruthless sort. Richard ends up traveling with Door trying to uncover the mysteries of her past, and desperately trying to find a way back to his world, London Above.<br /><br />Gaiman has a knack for creating memorable characters and Neverwhere isn't any different. Richard is every bit the forlorn traveler that the reader would expect, and he plays the role beautifully. He is both endearing and funny, and his knack for macabre humor brings needed levity to the novel. Door is the weakest character in my mind, she is fairly generic, but their are certain points, especially towards the beginning and end, that make her shine. My favorite character, however, is the Marquis. For me, he ties the novel together. He takes Door, the protagonist Richard, and the many ancillary characters and weaves them into the narrative in precisely the right way. He makes the novel move.<br /><br />Good storytelling is not an easy business. In an era where genre's are hashed and re-hashed, Neil Gaiman has carved out his niche as a gifted storyteller amongst a sea of hacks. He doesn't dazzle you with the ideas he conveys, but rather the method for their illustration. He's comfortable in his style and confident in his execution. It is easy to write a story about a man trying to find his way home. It is immensely more difficult, however, to take that idea and create something powerful, relatable, and memorable, and at this, Gaiman succeeds absolutely.m into the narrative in precisely the right way.

0375826726|4.0|Wow! As a reader of Earagon and Eldest, the belated release of Brisingr   was pure torture. When my copy arrived, via UPS, it was 2 days of near  non-stop bliss. It still blows me away that these works of fantasy fiction were created by a kid...go Palini! Brisingr was everything I had  hoped for, staying true to the story, providing enough detail to fill in   the blanks of each character, yet creating the insatiable desire to want  more. I will die if the last book is too long in coming!!!

If you are looking for ballads or fill-heavy drumming, look elsewhere; this album is all about Angus.  Some nice work by Bon Scott, too.  If you were too young to have experienced this album firsthand (like me), one listen and you'll know what all the fuss was about.

0375826726|5.0|I was looking so forward to this book. I was so worried that it would let me down, as some authors do...ya know, when 1 or 2 books in a series are really good and then they go and write another one that just doesn't 'do it' for you. You all know what I am talking about.<br /><br />I reread Eragon and Eldest right before this one came in the mail, so that I could follow it better, even though I had read them already before. I wanted them to be fresh in my mind. As I opened the book, I was ready for disappointment...but I did NOT get disappointed AT ALL! This was just as good as his other 2, if not better. True there wasn't much 'action' until the last third of the book. But to have a good book, you must have other stuff. It explained a lot that I had had questions with during the first couple books. It was awesome. I was actually sad when it ended, thinking about how long it's going to be until the next one comes out. I definitely recommend this book to all that read the other 2 and I recommend the whole cycle to anyone who likes fantasy.
0375826726|2.0|This book was fairly disappointing. Paolini spent a lot of time on parts of the story that didn't deserve it, and the few areas of the story that did deserve the time were not given it.<br /><br />Many of the important plot elements that were revealed seemed to be very contrived and isolated from the rest of the books. It seemed as though he made them up while writing the book and didn't even know about them while writing the original two.
0375424474|5.0|I personally feel that this should be required reading for every biology or anatomy and physiology class in the country.  I read the book over the summer and have been looking for ways to work it into my science class.  It is a lucid explanation of why the human body is such a wonder and at times such a Rube Goldberg device.  It all makes perfect sense in an evolutionary light.  The author's opening chapters are enlightening in his explanation of the predictive power of the Theory of Evolution and how it has been tested repeatedly and supported by the evidence.  I am very happy to see so many other teachers finding and utilizing this book with their classes.

B0019EXZY4|3.0|A well paced flick with plenty of tense moments and a preponderance of twists, The Bank Job makes for a decent movie experience.<br /><br />However, the pacing and twisting can't conceal that the film suffers from a lack of focus, both in narrative and theme. I felt Bank Job couldn't decide whether to be a light-hearted caper like 'Snatch' or a gritty crime drama like 'The Departed'. It attempts to be both and fails to be truly excellent at either.<br /><br />The cast of characters grows quite quickly, and we don't have enough time to care about all of them as much as the film needs us to. The central love affair is also lacking. There are many such loose threads in Bank Job which show promise but are watered down and create nothing more than disorder.<br /><br />A promising film that entertains but is ultimately forgettable. The special edition has some deleted scenes as extras, but they don't flesh out the movie. Standard DVD includes wide and full screen formats.
0765317389|5.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card     Many thanks to Borders and Barnes & Noble for allowing me to read this in the store while my wife checks out books and magazines for herself.   This is quite the story.   Ender is a genius.  He has been followed by some 'monitor' (inside his head or skin? Or just hovering around him?), so the government/military can make sure of his growth and development as well as his safety.  He has grown up in a normal enough family: Mother, Father, brother and sister. He has just started school and is adjusting to this new life.  There is a stigma associated with excess children, the world being a closed system, it can only support so many people.  One or two children is all that is normally allowed; a third is taking advantage of everyone else, and is given a very bad social stigma.  This is what Ender is: a third.  When the 'monitor' is taken away, nobody knows it is just another test for his quality or fitness to be who he has to be.  He passes and is taken away, after appropriate fussing and fuming,  from his family to command school.  It happens to be miraculous how prescient and adept the teacher Graff is in helping Ender become great, but it is fiction, so I guess the author can have the story do whatever he finds necessary.   It is hard for us 'normal' folks to understand all a genius thinks, so Mr. Card does not go into that, he just gives the impression of quality and intelligence exhibited in the actions and conversations of the heroes.   I have read this sort of thing before (Robert Henlein).  There I felt that the heroine was not shown to be such a great genius, in fact, she showed some very silly mistakes, not at all what a genius would do, as far as I am concerned.   In the edition I read, Mr. Card wrote an introduction.  It was funny how different people took the notion of exceptional children.  A teacher said it was all bosh.  A bunch of exceptional children said he really got the problems and attitude shifts they use verycorrect.  But some of that is odd, because he puts Ender in a school of exceptional children, so why the problems, etc.?    Mr. Card developed a full story.  He gave the characters something to do and problems to work out, and in the end you felt very good about the future of the characters.

I don't often choose to read victorian gothic, but the characters and the plot devices really hooked me. Setting: England, circa 1800s. Lush countryside estates. Characters: Two half sisters, bound through maternal line -- one rich, one poor -- one pretty, one not so much -- one very clever, the other, well is a tool to be abused. And get this -- an obese count to play the part of villain along with a dastardly baronet to wed an orphan girl.....you'll love it. And also -- get the Andrew Lloyd Webber CD of the musical with the same name AND watch the masterpiece theater version as well. Three ways to enjoy this splendid tale. I would rate it higher than 5 stars if I could!
1559279052|5.0|Death on the Nile is one of Agatha Christie's greatest works. Death on the Nile is one of the Poirot mysteries, and is set on a boat traveling along the Nile. A wealthy lady is being followed by her former-friend-now-rival, and Poirot is determined to find out what is going on. I will not give away any other information here, only to say that I would not recommend you reading this book at night.
B000069HJL|5.0|Supertramp's Paris is a must have in any form you can get your hands on. The remastered version is great although the packaging didn't change much from the original cd release; no new pictures or commentary from anyone. The song selection is great and the live versions are better than the studio versions. Includes a song called \\"You Started Laughing\\" which I do not believe was available on any studio album. It's a great song. If you are long time fan or are just getting into them, do not hesitate to buy this cd.Crank it up. You'll love it. Trust me.

0440178002|5.0|Straight from the beautiful mind of James Clavell comes the epic book Shogun. An english pilot on an ill fated boat, a land of strange humans, god seems to be turning away from poor Blackthorne. The story begins in the sea, where we first meet our weathered battered crew. Oringinally sent out on a mission to revage their enemy in the New World, they instead ended up in Japan. It's here where our story really begins. The crew, a bunch of portegues sailors are being led by John Blackthorne, the only englishman with them, and sadly for them, the only pilot. After being attacked by a terrible storm out in sea, the crew wakes to find themselves in a strange land, where the humans seem to be out of this world. Not only do the have differnt features then most of the crew is used to seeing, but these humans also have a completely upside down culture. Bow or be killed, behave or die, and that's simply the tip of the iceburg. Thankfully for this ill fated crew, they have blackthorne to help them. This book was a very exciting read, and I advise this book for any lover of Japan.
B00005MP58|5.0|Well, who doesn't love Colin Firth? I owned the tape version of this series and so love that I don't have to rewind each tape. The segments flow smoothly. This movie is well done and the best, hands down, at capturing the book. I have already gotten a second copy for a Christmas gift!
0060987464|3.0|Not for the faint, but certainly interesting.  It gives you some insight with a lot of sadness.  The message was clear and deliberate, yet delivered in an unfortunate polarizing style.
B000002KIT|5.0|From 1975 to 1979, hard rock was in its golden age as a result of an art form known as the double (or sometimes single) live album. And there was no record that best captured this day and age in more perfect form than Thin Lizzy's `Live and Dangerous' released in June 1978. Often cited as the premier live document of all time, this opus captured an in hindsight criminally underappreciated band in all of their ragged glory. These guys were untouchable and there was no cooler front man on the planet than Philip Parris Lynott! Behind him was Lizzy's greatest lineup in blood brother/rhythm genius Brian Downey and the ultra combustible duo of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham. In America, where they were often delegated to support act status (how stupid were we?), headliners would shudder at the very mention of their name. At the time of `L&D''s release, a Sounds magazine critic called them the greatest hard rock band in the world, but today in 2008, the kids don't really know. As with any live document worth its salt, all the best (or most of the best) are here in peak performance form. To list my favorites would be listing most of the album but anyway - \\"Massacre\\", \\"Emerald\\" and \\"Rosalie\\" to name my top three. For pure six-string brilliance take Gorham on the first and Robbo and the last two, mind blowing! \\"Jailbreak\\" is the opener and man what a stunner (I love when he says, \\"I think it's safer\\" in that low almost throw away register!). The way \\"Cowboy Song\\" flows into \\"Boys\\" is just pure majestic alchemy! \\"Suicide\\" is gut wrenching, \\"The Rocker\\", pure delirium and \\"Don't Believe a Word\\" as macho tough a love song as one can get. You  get the slow songs as well and Lizzy did them as well as anyone and two non-lpers which are fair but they don't make this record any more special than it already is (as if that were possible). As far as how \\"live\\" this album, if it bothers you that much - don't bother. This was Lizzy's REAL best of....and it really could be the greatest live album of all time.
B00007GZR5|5.0|The DVD came so quickly and it was just like new. Very awesome. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
0375826726|2.0|I loved the first two books, but this third installment is a true challenge to finish, and I don't mean because of the length!  150 pages in, I was amazed that so little had truly happened in the form of adventures.  It reads more like a political debate and is very boring, not to mention long-winded.  Needless to say, I will not be buying the 4th book.  And I'm very glad this was a gift and I didn't spend my own $18 on it.  Sorry Christopher!
0061564893|5.0|This book may not be to everyone's liking, but it does use a great of deal of commonsense with regard to Mankind's perception of geographical knowledge in Medieval times. It makes perfect common sense that people explored the world BEFORE Chris Columbus. He must have had an idea from somewhere, that the 'Final Frontier' was out there.......the way to The Indies....only problem was the American continent got in the way! Or did it?? Did he know, that there was a landmass to the West? Where did he get his maps?  If this book is not to your liking, you must have a mind that is welded shut to the reception of new ideas.
0931838401|5.0|This is a great book, the best about cameras. You can find almost any camera in it, with lots of pictures(b&w)and the orientative prices in dollars and many of them in euros too. It is a must-have book for any camera collector.
B000AJJNPY|2.0|Just didn't work for me. I've given it 50 listens over the last couple of years, but get more and more ho-hum as I proceed. Repetitive (well, yeah, what's new) but boringly and tritely so. With 60% of the reviewers giving this one 5 stars, far be it from me to attempt to dissuade anyone, but &Aacute;gætis Byrjun is so far above this that Takk sounds as if it was created by some wannabe group. This is a remote #4 in my list of Sigur Ros CDs.
B00127RAJY|4.0|As all the other reviews have stated this is a great workout! I love the levels of intensity. My husband tried to do level 2 with me and quit after five minutes!     This would have been 5 stars hands down if it wasn't for the fact that you have to sit through the dvd start up screens AND an introduction by Jillian every time (I can't even stop the dvd). This seems like a pretty bad error for a workout dvd that's made to be done everyday (or close to it).
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Having been lucky enough to see Rush in both 2007 & 2008 on the S&A Tour, if the DVD is even close to the shows I experienced, it's going to be well worth the cost. It's definately going to become a part of my Rush collection. I'm just curious as to what we are doing wrong here in the USA that Rush doesn't do much live concert recording here. It would be fantastic to see a tour DVD filmed somwhere in the USA next time around. I am confident there will be a \\"next time\\". Again, based on what I saw in the shows I attended, this band is going to be in good form for many years to come!
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|Personally I enjoyed the entire trilogy enough to purchase this set when it's released tomorrow, but for those who love the original and despise \\"Reloaded\\" & \\"Revolutions\\", just wait until Warner releases the first installment as one of their special \\"Digibook\\" editions. THIS IS DEFINITELY ON THE WAY SO JUST HOLD OUT...if you don't take my word for it then check/email some of the Blu Ray disc news sites like The Digital Bits or High Def Disc News or Blu-Ray.com    I am sure this set will ROCK and all the advance reviews mimic my hopes. This is just a warning for fans of JUST the original that YES, they are going to release JUST the first film on Blu Ray next year. Hope this helps.

0060557818|5.0|A friend highly recommended American Gods to me, I read it and was not very taken by it so wasn't going to bother with more Gaiman but Neverwhere came into my possession (book was left at my home by some visitor) so I read it and was swallowed up by it to the point where I almost called in \\"sick\\" so I could stay home and read.  I think why I can relate to this book is because I have dreams that kind of run the same way--things that can't be possible are, things go topsy-turvy and you accept them as normal, people get dead (some come back to life later on), etc.  And, heck, I LOVE these dreams although I'm not sure I could handle actually living like that all the time.  And now I find this book was made into a tv show???  Did they record it to DVD?  I  hope so 'cause I just have to see this.  This is what they ought to make movies from, not that \\"Rent\\" drivel or mediocre re-dos of \\"Sabrina.\\"  But then, I loved \\"Brazil\\" too.  The first 10-20 pages of Gaiman's books are real dull because he's setting up the main character (and they tend to be kind of boring guys) but once the story gets going, it's a fun ride.  I'm reading his other books and will try to hunt down that tv show too.  Thanks, NG, always a great feeling to \\"discover\\" an author who write for me--and you're still young so I can look forward to good reading for the rest of my life!
0452289963|5.0|This book is a profound insight into changing the way that we think to Be a catalyst for a universal awakening into the eternal.  It will either activate the spiritual in you or get your mind to delve deeper into an awareness of the process of thinking.  It reinforced my own awakening and bought a peace that indeed life is not random, but organized and intricately designed by the Master.

B001CC7PP8|5.0|The thing about a Hitchcock film is that it gets better with each viewing.  Universal Studios Home Entertainment realizes this, since they've just rereleased the ultimate terror film &#34;Psycho&#34; (1960), which broke cinematic ground in depicting on-screen violence.  Before &#34;Psycho,&#34; murders on screen were sanitized, scrubbed of the bloody and visceral.  Hitchcock changed all that in the tale of a strange motel keeper and his homicidal mother.  Based on a novel by Robert Bloch, &#34;Psycho&#34; is easily one of the most frightening films of all time.  Shot for a modest budget of $800,000, &#34;Psycho&#34; was to become Hitch's most popular and financially successful movie.  It is the ultimate haunted-house saga, with outstanding performances by Anthony Perkins as the odd Norman Bates, a man who covers up the crimes of his deranged mother, and Janet Leigh as secretary Marion Crane, who steals $40,000 in order to run off and get married.   If you've never seen &#34;Psycho,&#34; now's the time, because the current Universal Legacy DVD Edition fills you in on lots of juicy background info, including newsreel footage of the theatrical release of the film, behind-the-scenes production photos, a making-of featurette, and extensive analysis of the famous shower sequence.  A nice treat is the &#34;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&#34; TV episode, &#34;Lamb to the Slaughter,&#34; directed by Hitchcock, which sardonically illustrates how best to dispose of a murder weapon.
B001FEA9QU|3.0|Metallica still stands as my entry into metal.  The speed, sound and lyrics ushered me into a new world of music that I never left in the 80's (and had to move to other bands in the 90's).  I still to this day find myself drawn to listen to the first three albums (sometimes Justice slips in too).  The Black album signified a true change in the band - they were no longer the Metallica I grew up with.  I will admit that after I got over the shock, I found the new sound good, and I enjoyed it, but it was not great - it was not Metallica.  Then things went off the deep end.  I can say that this album seems to come back to that mid-point.  It is not great, but it is at least good.  It is not Metallica, but it does have the sound from the Black album that made them famous.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|\\"Holiday Inn\\"  is available in a deluxe three-disc Collector's Set that includes the original black-and-white feature starring Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, a new colorized version, and the complete music soundtrack CD featuring well-known holiday songs by legendary composer Irving Berlin, including the Academy Award winner \\"White Christmas,\\" which became an instant holiday classic.     Crosby plays song-and-dance man Jim Hardy, who leaves show biz to run an inn that is open only on holidays.  Astaire plays his former partner and rival in love, Ted Hanover.  The film takes us through the year, covering all the major holidays, as the two guys find themselves competing for the affections of lovely Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds).     There are some great novelty numbers here, including \\"I Can't Tell a Lie,\\" a minuet that Jim sabotages by accelerating the tempo when Ted gets a little too romantic with Linda on the dance floor.  The song that Berlin and everyone else thought would become the movie's hit, \\"Be Careful, It's My Heart\\" is serenaded to Reynolds by Crosby at the piano as Astaire comes quietly behind her, sweeps her into his arms, and glides her around the dance floor.  Though the song did receive considerable air play, it was \\"White Christmas\\" that captured hearts.   Remember, this was 1942.  World War II was raging, men were overseas, and the sentiment \\"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, just like the ones I used to know\\" resonated with homesick soldiers and had a wistful quality that reflected the collective feeling of a country at war.  Crosby's recording of the song still ranks as one of the biggest-selling singles of all time.   Extras include \\"A Couple of Song and Dance Men,\\" a retrospective of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire featuring an interview with Ava Astaire MacKenzie, Astaire's daughter; archive audio comments by Crosby and Astaire; and the film's original theatrical trailer.
1594201749|5.0|As one who has studied South African politics and is well aware of the significance of the 2005 world cup, I was very eager to read this book. Needless to say, this book was incredible.    John Carlin gives a sort of intimacy in this book.  He sets up the story, giving the background of Mandela's life. In addition, he also interviews those that had an effect on Mandela's life either in prison, politics, or sport. This 360 degree approach brings the reader to a fuller understanding of the actions taking place and the emotions that drive them.    Mandela has always been a personal hero of mine, and this book reinforces that. Though this is a (modern) historical account, the recapping of Mandela's struggle and the change he has brought to his nation also acts as a feel-good story of triumph.
B00005JPO1|4.0|After \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" (1989), the second sequel in the \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" franchise, there was talk among producer George Lucas, director Steven Spielberg, and star Harrison Ford about making yet another chapter in the exciting exploits of the archaeologist/adventurer.  Ideas were bandied about, various writers were hired to pen treatments, casting was discussed, schedules had to be considered, and ultimately the project was postponed -- indefinitely, it seemed.  Apparently, it took 18 years before the three principal filmmakers could agree on a story and get it made.   \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\\" a title that would have given heart attacks to the guys who put titles on marquees in the days when every movie theatre had one, offers plenty of action, a reunion with a character from the first film, a brand new sidekick, and enough exposition to fill a doctoral thesis.   It is 1957, the height of the Cold War, so the Russians are trotted out after a long rest on the shelf of handy movie villains.  Indiana is kidnapped by a team of Soviets headed by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) so he can lead them to an ancient artifact -- a crystal skull believed to possess supernatural powers, just the thing to give Russia the edge over the capitalist West.  Essentially, the movie is a football match -- sometimes quite literally -- as chases, fights, derring-do, aggressive soldier ants, monkeys, and an agent who keeps changing his loyalty conspire to keep possession of the treasured skull in a state of uncertainty.   Director Alfred Hitchcock always used what he called a McGuffin in his movies -- a device that exists just to set the dramatic forces in motion:  the stolen $40,000 in \\"Psycho,\\" government secrets on microfilm in \\"North By Northwest,\\" the chance meeting of a tennis star and a mild-mannered looney in \\"Strangers on a Train.\\"  In \\"Crystal Skull,\\" director Spielberg ladles out loads of chatter about the McGuffin -- the skull's history, its mystical associations, its power over mortal man. Meanwhile, the audience is impatient and eager to get on with the story -- how is Indie going to retrieve the skull and extricate himself from one perilous situation after another?   It's great to see Harrison Ford back in fine form in one of his two signature screen roles (the other, Han Solo in the \\"Star Wars\\" films).  The script has some self-deprecating bits of humor revolving around Ford's age (he's 66), but they're clever and not overdone.  Assisted by countless stunt teams, Ford makes his way graciously through the action scenes, particularly a wonderful motorcycle chase across a college campus.  John Williams' terrific Indiana theme is present throughout, making the action stuff all the more thrilling and bringing back memories of the first film.   Indiana is approached by a Marlon Brando/greaser wannabe named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf, \\"Disturbia,\\" \\"Transformers\\") who wants help in locating his mother.  She turns out to be Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) from the first Indiana Jones movie, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" and she's as feisty and spunky as ever.  Mutt has a chip on his shoulder the size of a telephone pole, a short fuse, and a pocket comb he likes to moisten in other people's Cokes and run through his 50's pompadour.  There's some good chemistry between Ford and LaBeouf, who share many scenes in the film.  There's also a neat bit of repartee going on, even when the going gets tough.   Ms. Allen appears about halfway through the film and perks things up considerably, especially in a scene in which -- as captives of the bad guys -- Marion and Indie bicker, recriminate, and blame even as their lives appear in serious danger.     Ms. Blanchett has fun with her role as the humorless but agile Russian comrade, as efficient with a 50-millimeter machine gun as she is with a sword.  There is a lot of comic-book villainess in her Spalko, but that is OK considering the tone of the movie.  She certainly adds stature to the picture, mostly from her body of work. Here, after all, is Elizabeth I chasing Indiana and an elongated skull in an armored truck through the jungle.   For all its fun, \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" lacks the overall impact of the earlier films.  Spielberg is known for creating wonderfully visual scenes in his films.  Think of \\"Jaws,\\" Jurassic Park,\\" and \\"E.T.\\"  These are movies in which the story is told largely through a series of carefully crafted images with a minimum of dialogue:  the shark attacking a lone swimmer; the Tyrannosaurus Rex stamping the car into the mud; Elliott and friends escaping the police roadblock on their bicycles by soaring into the sky.  In \\"Crystal Skull,\\" the director plunks in too many static sequences of characters standing around spouting exposition we don't really care about.  Spielberg has set a high standard for himself and other directors.  I'm just sorry this is not Spielberg at the top of his form.   Rated PG-13 for a few scary images, \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" has family appeal, is geared to attract a wide age range, and offers a neat roller coaster ride.  Only don't expect the Cyclone.

0425220931|5.0|What an amazing book! I bought it for my husband, a bassist, but after seeing Victor (the author) in concert and seeing hearing him playing so incredibly easy and relaxed but yet at the same time 'killing' everyone with what he was able to do, I thought that reading this book would give me some insight on how he got to where he was musically.   And I think it definitely does. it's a beautiful music lesson that he has decided to share and it helps us all perceive and recieve music from a complete other dimension.   It's written in an easy style, but the message is deep and not to be forgotten if you are a musician yourself.   I was reading only a chapter a day to digest and store the information well, because I have never read anything anywhere like this book!
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Four stars? Are you serious? Dave Mustaine is the father of thrash metal. Metallica owes all their success to Dave Mustaine. It's just too bad that he will never recieve the credit he deserves. Let's face it, Metallica hasn't put out a decent album in almost 20 years. Their first three albums are considered their best and guess what, they were all heavily influenced by Dave Mustaine. In fact, Dave wrote a lot of the songs on the first two Metallica albums. United Abominations is old school Megadeth, which basically means it is old school Metallica. I haven't even heard Metallica's new album and I don't intend to. Dave always has something to say, especially in the realm of politics. Metallica just whines about their dismal lives. It must be very difficult being millionaires, especially in today's economy. Poor Metallica; I truly feel for them. What a horrible life they've had.
B0002VEPRQ|4.0|I did it.  I bought a Disney movie -- I mean a kids-oriented one.  And then... I actually showed it to my kids (first I watched it again, just to make sure).<br /><br />This is so totally out of character for me, that it *does* deserve a gasp of surprise.<br /><br />Because Disney.  DISNEY!  No positive male role-models DISNEY!  Every male character is a fool, a tool, a slob, or a villain DISNEY!  Forget about little boys, because only girls are celebrated DISNEY!  And yes, I still think that is the case for Disney.  And I wonder who all those little girls will grow up to marry, when all the boys are fools, tools, slobs, or villains.<br /><br />But Julie Andrews.  JULIE ANDREWS!  Mary Poppins!<br /><br />So I cracked.  And I bought it.<br /><br />And I had a few twinges on my view-through -- the put-down of men as \\"rather stupid\\" in Mrs. Bank's first number; and the presumption that Mr. Banks' flying a kite with his children was somehow MORE valuable than his daily providing for them (I do appreciate the value of kite-flying, just not the value judgment); and the idea that the kids will respect a nanny who is sweet and pretty, but not one who smells weird.<br /><br />But I went ahead and showed it to the kids, and I'm so glad, because we have been singing the songs like crazy and laughing a lot.  The absolute fantasy of it is marvelous, and the songs are beautiful.  I like how Bert treats Mary.  I like how straight Mary is, as though she isn't magical, when she clearly is.<br /><br />Very nice.<br /><br />Now I'm wondering about Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  Would anyone be so kind as to enlighten me about whether that one is as good?  Thanks!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I tried to see this movie on day one, but when I went to the late showing every seat was sold out. I went the next night and the cashier told me the movie did so well the night before that they had another film overnighted so that they could show it on two of there three screens. I thought that was pretty amazing, hope he wasn't lying. So anyways I was able to get into screen two since the first screen was already sold out. This is a long movie which within five minutes of watching this your hooked. I would also like to say I don't like these type of movies. I was sold of the acting and the story which is where Batman Dark Knight exceeds anything I have seen in a very long,long......long,long time. I was so pulled in by the events happening on screen and yes Heath Ledgers performance that is beyond Oscar worthy but more so what every actor should set for his goal to exceed. It was if it was ment to happen, him passing away and this being his good bye which showed everyone in the acting business up. That set aside the special effects are superb. The Matrix which is funny saying this are outdated now compared to this. It doesn't pull of as many big spots as lets say King Kong but when it does there just as good. The end of this movie gets you pumped, asking for more and telling you that Batmans back and better then ever. I don' want to say anything about scenes in the movie (keep it spoiler free) but this is the next best thing and the new goal for movies to overtake. The whole family will love this movie, don't rent just buy lol. have a good day...
B00166BL6Y|5.0|It doesn't seem so long ago that the first three Jethro Tull albums were remastered and reissued with bonus tracks. So why buy this Collector's Edition of This Was? Well, unless you are a huge fan of the earliest incarnation of Jethro Tull, there is no good reason to particularly if you already own the previous edition. But, if you began your Tull experience when This Was was originally released, then you certainly will want to add this to your collection.<br />Admittedly, the This Was Collector's Edition is massive overkill. Not only do you get the ten songs (in mono) from the original release, nine additional songs from a pair of John Peel sessions are tacked onto the first CD. The second CD features the entire original album remixed in stereo, four remastered mono recordings of songs related to but not included on the original release, and stereo mixes of two of the bonus tracks. To sum it up, there is an astounding amount of music provided for what is currently a very fair price.<br />To me, My Sunday Feeling and Serenade To A Cuckoo are two of the early Tull pieces which, though utterly different in style, helped bring the band attention from a much wider range of listeners than it might have received if it were not so eclectic. They certainly got my attention and remain favorites to this day. I also favor Beggar's Farm, Move On Alone, and It's Breaking Me Up. Among the cuts from the Peel Sessions, I most enjoy My Sunday Feeling, Serenade to a Cuckoo and Beggar's Farm.<br />On the bonus disc, I most enjoyed the stereo mixes of the ones I like best on the mono version as well as One For John Gee which is kind of a poor relation to Serenade To A Cuckoo. One I don't like is Sunshine Day which is very unTull-like. Indeed, overall the extras don't match the quality of the songs ultimately selected for inclusion on the original album.<br />The double gatefold style presentation includes a small booklet containing pictures, commentary and album notes. So to reiterate, if you are a Tull fan with no particular attachment to the early years then you might be better off buying the single-disc remaster of This Was issued  several years ago. But if you are one like me who still thinks that the first few Tull albums are their best, then This Was (Collector's Edition) is a keeper that will give you pleasure for the rest of your life.ll fan with no particular attachment to the early years then you might be better off buying the single-disc remaster of This Was issued  several years ago.

0375826726|1.0|In my opinion if one skips Brisingr and moves directly from part 2 to part 4, not much would be missed. Brisingr can be summarized in 2 sentences related to Eragon's new weapon and the secrets revealed to him. Otherwise the overall plot would not be affected in the least if this part never existed.

B000002LQR|3.0|I've been listening to the Chili Peppers for a decade or so now, and finally I've decided to invest in them; that is, in their sound, their musicianship.  It's part of my method to avoid being influenced by industry bally-hoo.  We're all victims of Spin in virtually every arena of American life.  Half the cost of every product (and every political candidate) is publicity.  Not to lecture.  I don't buy the Peppers to affirm social theories; I buy the music for emotional and artistic stimulation and insight.  What I particularly like is A.K.'s singing.  The vocalizing of most men seems to me dull and uninspired, but Tony the K is wildly different.  He's better than his publicity, with his unpredictablec but secure, hot fusion of Gil Scott-Heron's breathiness and Cher's andrognous trombone riffs, he creates a new way of singing and therefore of listening that I find fascinating.
B000AP04L0|5.0|If you work in an office with cubicles this movie is for you. Funny every time I watch it. One of the few comedies in my collection.
B000V86OKG|4.0|I started watching this series during the second season and it seemed so dark and morbid.  As I got into it I realized that Dexter was really a good man with a desire for justice and if the law did not take care of the evil doer, then he would. I had to buy the first season to see how it all began. The series is captivating and you almost cheer him on when he brings the demise of those that \\"almost\\" got away with crime.  The fear of getting caught is always there and you wonder if he ever will be.  I don't like the fact that his sister has a foul mouth but he needs her as I see that he uses her to his advantage.  This is a very good series.  If you do not believe in \\"eye for and eye\\" then don't watch it.  Otherwise, I recommend it. The language and the killing may be questionable, but it keeps my interest.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I purchased this for the crib at my house for my grandson.  He loves it.  He watches the animals go round and the leaves go up and down and just smiles.  I love the different sounds that you can play on it.  I would highly recommend it.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|A few reviews talk about getting a standard DVD player and increasing the resolution to full HD 1080p thus skipping the blu ray version.. That is INCORRECT.. Those players just up-converter the image quality.. for the less tec heads, it fills in the gap where standard dvds are filmed in increasing the resolution not FULL HD 1080p.When the Matrix standard DVD set was made it was digital, but not at full HD since DVD lacked the storage capacity of a blueray, so buying a standard DVD set version and using a up-converter you'll never get the full HD aka 1080p.This box set is worth it.. a little expensive but the fact you get all Matrix is worth the money..The uncompressed audio is worth it if you have a sound system.
B001B7CNXI|5.0|No one makes a movie like Michael Mann. He's not a director who just gives you empty good guys and bad guys and likes to blow stuff up. Every character has a dimension that comes off screen. And while the characters come off screen, the master cinematography brings the audience on screen. There aren't too many directors who can orchestrate a crime thriller with such poetic justice.<br />  On the outside, the movie is about a team of undercover detectives trying to bring down one of the largest drug cartels in the world. The problems start when Rico, played by Colin Farrell, allows his false identity to compromise the mission.<br />  I really wouldn't want to give away any more of the story than that but believe me, there's an all-star cast of actors in this movie, they may not all be actors that you're familiar with but they're better than a lot of the ones you are. Forget the campy 80's crap you might have watched in that worst decade ever. Its rare that a film compliments audiences with such in your face thought provoking subject matter. Well Done.

B001GZ6QDS|4.0|I can't add anything new to a review of \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  It tops \\"Batman Begins\\" and could legitimately be the definitive take on the character and his world in either cinema or television.  This leads me to a response to the embarassing few that claim to hate this movie and want Batman \\"the way he was originally intended.\\"  So, you want Batman as who originally intended?    Anyone with even a smidgen of knowledge about the history of the Batman movies over the last thirty years (Burton's film had been in development for 10 before its release in 1989) knows that every single writer, producer and director thought they were doing an interpretation of Batman and his world the way he was \\"originally intended,\\" and yet, most seem so different.    The reason why \\"The Dark Knight\\" DESERVES its hype (as very, VERY few films do) is that it manages to be both an original interpretation AND faithful to its source.  It's suitably dark, but still fun to watch in most places.  Its story and characters are complex, but the movie has as little pretension as it can get away with having.  I've done my homework on this - you could watch this movie, then while reading Batman comics from 1939 on find familiar elements from the movie.  Heath Ledger's Joker is incredible, yet controversial.  Many believe he gave a great performance, but that the darkness of the material and his characterization made him depressed, which led to a sleeping disorder that may have led to his overdose.  Okay... Frankly, I doubt it, especially since he claimed to have had the most fun of his life in the role and his seperation from girlfriend and daughter seems a more realistic catalyst for depression.      'Fact is, David Goyer and the Nolan brothers didn't MAKE the Joker this sinister and neither did Ledger - Bob Kane and Bill Finger created the Joker seen in this movie and he's featured prominently in his first 1940 appearance.  Granted, the Joker of the comics was more a mad scientist than a psychopathic, homicidal anarchist, but that can probably be attributed to what was popular in pulp fiction villains of the World War 2 era.  The Joker's modus-operandi in \\"The Dark Knight\\" is EXACTLY as it is in his very first appearance, so to that extent, if you're looking for an interpretation of all or some of Batman's universe as \\"originally intended,\\" you're out of luck if you don't like \\"The Dark Knight.\\"     As for the rest of Batman's world as portrayed here, once again we're hearing complaints to the tune of, \\"Where is Batman?\\" Well, if they'd drudged up more angst over his parents' death, people would be complaining about that, as well, rightfully calling it redundant and unoriginal.  One of the biggest reasons why sequels fail in terms of quality is because the characters don't evolve. All too often, studios and filmmakers make sequels to make more money off of what made them so much money in the first place, which means that they fear letting their characters evolve too much lest they lose qualities so successful the first time around.  Luckily, that hasn't been the case as much recently in sequels, particularly comic book movie sequels, and it certainly isn't the case here.  Bruce Wayne / Batman has evolved from someone on a finite mission to clean up his city to someone recognizing that the city could be getting too much of a good thing, and that \\"good thing\\" is Batman.  He's seeing how Batman's presence has only made Gotham's criminals that much more desperate and, thusly, more dangerous because with Batman around, they have to be just to survive.      While someone here complains that Batman would never hand over the crimefighting reigns to a new D.A. nor sacrifice the \\"symbol of hope\\" he created in \\"Batman Begins\\" to save that D.A.'s reputation after his transformation into a criminal, these earmarks of the character's evolution are actually quite logical and even necessary if either Bruce Wayne or Batman is to have any credibility as the HUMAN hero he is.  Why?  Because just about any human would tire of Batman's struggle after a while, given of course that said human could even take it on in the first place.      Think about it - why go to the lengths of combat training, personal discipline and the donning of horrendously uncomfortable costuming to fight crime if there would never come a time when one's done enough - when the city is either as clean as one wants it to be or as clean as it can be? Batman could never be as smart as he is intended to be if he didn't have a clear goal in mind, and in the first hour of \\"The Dark Knight,\\" Bruce sees his goal being reached.  How so? He sees it being reached by the intended influence Batman has had on Gotham as manifested in the most realistic, if not best possible way in Harvey Dent's EFFECTIVE crusade from the office of District Attorney.  If Batman never wanted there to come a time when Gotham didn't need him, he wouldn't be much of a hero, now would he?    Challenge these observations if you wish, but good luck.  They're not just my own and they're logical whether you like the movie or not.  I'll agree that everyone is entitled to (an) opinions and to express those (that) opinion(s), but if it isn't backed up with logic, then I have as much of a right (or entitlement) to attack such (an) opinion(s).

B000V86OKG|2.0|I think that the most interesting character besides Dexter was Doakes, but this season eliminated Doakes and in so doing, reduced the complexity and value of Dexter himself.  By allowing that storyline to go forward and having Dexter do what he did. he is not avenging murders, he is what he was born to be a sociopathic, self-serving, serial killer, no more, no less.  A great character has been destroyed and a character with depth is looking more like you would expect the brother of dopey, clingy, pathetic, Deb to look like.  Not a good move.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I am very pleased with the Swivel Sweeper.  I've bought 3 so far [me and friends].  They're great on hard-surfaced floors --with great edging capabilities.  They are not good on carpet with any kind of pile, though.  They're ok for super-short, outdoor mat-type rugs, but you can tell it's harder on the little motor.  I wouldn't use it on large sections of outdoor carpeting.  Be sure to get the more current model that includes the little magnetic catch so the sweeper head can be folded up more easily for closet storage.
031606792X|5.0|Ms. Meyers saved the best for last.  In this incredible final sequel to Twilight, all the danger comes and the ending is thrilling and scary and satisfying.  A great read.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The characters--especially John Thornton and Margaret Hale--really came to life in this four-hour BBC mini-series. It captured the tense socio-economic climate of the 1850s that serves as a backdrop to the love story. This, along with the chemistry between the actors, and the beautiful costumes and sets, helped provide a texture of richness and realism. Casting, direction and screenplay are perfect. It made me want to read the book. Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South is now one of my best-loved novels and this mini-series, an all-time favorite.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This movie is a classic. To upgrade it to blu-ray was a brilliant idea by Disney. The graphics and colors are vibrant and stunning. But what put me over the top to buy it was the addition of the standard DVD with it. This made it a must buy since most people with young children have a grandma and grandpa or DVD system in the car that doesn't exactly have a blu-ray player in it. More companies need to think about adding in the standard version with the blu-ray version, especially with older movies so they can be watched anywhere.
B000274THQ|5.0|This movie tells the story of a family living in East Germany at a time of great political and social change.  It explores many facets of love, lies and politics:  the bond between a mother and her son, the love of kids for their mother compared to her love for them, the mistakes and lies of parents as compared to lies of children, politics and the economy ruling people's life, and love that actually rules every thing.<br /><br />My words will not adequately describe this movie; you won't regret watching it!  The son and the mother are both great actors who make you cry and laugh at the same time.<br /><br />The wounds of a family and a nation are told through the marvelous acting of the mother and son. Watch the silly details as the son's little lie takes on a life of its own, and the irony of meeting his childhood hero, who is drawn into the son's web of lies. Watch the son creating his own East Germany; very funny and very powerful.<br /><br />Such a wonderful movie, a lovely and new story played by great actors and delivered by good director.
B000MG1ZGA|4.0|L.A. Woman is my favorite Doors compilation, which is why it grieves me to have to give it a 4-star instead of a 5-star rating.  This bluesy collection is Morrison at his best with greats like Changeling, Hyacinth House, Been down so long & the fabulous title track.  I also enjoyed the bonus track Orange County Suite.<br /><br />The reason I gave this compilation a 4-star is because of the last track.  You see it's very simple...no Morrison-no Doors period.  I feel they could have found any a number of tracks done by Morrison to complete this set and I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but I want to hear his voice and only his voice when I'm listening to the Doors!  That's just the way it is with me.<br /><br />So, minus the last track I would give this CD a 5-star rating in a heart beat.  It's classic Blues/Rock only the Doors can pull off.
B000002L7V|1.0|THIS IS A GREAT RECORDING, EXCEPT THE COPY I GOT FROM AMAZON SOUNDS LIKE A CRACKLING RECORD ALBUM WHEN I PLAY IT. IT MUST HAVE BEEN BOOTLEGGED FROM AN ALBUM ONTO A CD.

B001AUKUTU|1.0|THIS IS AN AWSEOME RELESASE FROM DIO; HOWEVER, MY COPY I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON SQEALS JUST LIKE A CASSETTE TAPE GOING BAD. IT IS OBVIOUSLY A CHEAP BOOTLEG COPIED FROM A BAD CASSETTE. I SHOULD SEND IT TO THE RECORD COMPANY, THEY MIGHT FIND IT INTERESTING.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am embarrassed to admit I've never read a Gaskell book, but I am soon to remedy that situation. However, I've seen all of the movie mountings of her work. I think she goes way beyond Jane Austen and actually more closely resembles Dickens in that she was a social critic, a writer who was not totally focused on romance and the social restrictions inherent in the English \\"caste\\" system of the time.<br /><br />Not to suggest she didn't care about romance; the ending of this series, that scene at the train station, is the single most romantic movie moment I've seen in many, many years. It brought tears to my eyes. Women will absolutely melt.<br /><br />As is typical of these BBC series, the acting is uniformly excellent. I was familiar with the luminously beautiful Daniella Denby-Ashe from the British soap EastEnders. Richard Armitage is a revelation as the factory owner, and as his mother, Sinead Cusack is outstanding in the role of a seemingly cold and unfeeling widow, who demonstrates a fierce loyalty to her son.
0439023483|5.0|HOLY CRAP!!!! I have not had such a physical responce to a book in a long time. I couldn't breath at parts, my chest was getting tight, I could not stop thinking about this book, I still can't, but I do not really care.     I love this book and would recomend it to anyone who wants a fantabulous read. Being about the same age as Katniss, I loved her point of view, the confusion, her emotions and trying not to be so vulnerable.    This book is just amazing, plain and simple. Read it.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|This is the best that Mad Max 2 has ever looked!!! This is a great Blu Ray title!!! Great soundtrack too!!! Extras are a bit skimpy but that's fine because it's in anamorphic widescreen and is a visual treat, with truly awesome stunts,no CGI effects here,just raw stuntwork at it's best!!! A true classic!!! A+
0345501292|5.0|This is just a mind blowing book! Just amazing. The illustrations and the story accounts are truly superb, and the snippets of story and trivia are the best ones around, even having some I didn't know, and I'm a huge fan!    The pictures are of high quality, and the way the book layout is done is very well organized and detailed.    A piece of art for the making of \\"geek\\" and the Lucas/Spielberg fan!
1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was an exciting and fun to read novel. Mark Haddon makes the story of a fifteen year old Christopher Boone with Asperger's (a form of autism) enjoyable to audiences young and old. Christopher must use deductive reasoning and the laws of logic to solve the killing of his neighbor's dog, of which he as been falsely accused. Because Christopher has little emotion, this book can be sad and also funny at times. Haddon had a difficult job in writing this story where he had to portray a boy who has almost no range of emotion, as the main character. Haddon's insight into the autistic mind provides for a great read also while educating readers about a mental disability. The plot of this book I found to be not only interesting but physically engaging as well. Some of the mathematic equations we see in the book make the reader want to get out a pen and paper and work them out for themselves. The story keeps the reader involved the whole way and leaves with an ending that was not seen coming.
031606792X|5.0|Loved this book.  Was a great final story to the vampire family that you can't help but love.  I was happy about the closure it brought, but extremely sad to have to let these characters go.  Best series I have read in a really long time.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|I know most of us have heard her rendition of \\"And I'm Telling You\\" and while this is included on her debut effort.  I found other tracks on the cd to be as noteworthy if not more.  The first single, \\"Spotlight\\" for one which she sings of her man loving her a bit too much.  Always possessive and smothering, it's a nice debut single of her own.  It's true she didnt have a lot of say as far as the writing and producing songs.<br /><br />But i believe that will come with time and more experience in the music business.  I look forward to that but as for her cd now.  It's a solid interpretation of her tastes and different styles with songs like \\"If This Isn't Love\\" or the sassy and spirited \\"Pocketbook\\" w/Ludacris (who brings his A-game on this song).  Also of note are the songs \\"My Heart\\", \\"I'm His Only Woman\\" w/(fellow AI alum) Fantasia that has them both sparring for the title of the only woman in this guys life.<br /><br />I also found myself enjoying the songs \\"We Gon' Fight\\" and \\"Invisible\\" as showing other sides of Jennifer Hudson's abundant talent and with more time and experience.  I only see her taking more control of her career and more involved in all aspects.  Her debut, self-titled album however shows a lot of promise and more than enough variety to keep fans satisfied.
015206396X|5.0|The story in this book will keep your attention and the pages turning.  It has the perfect balance of adventure, excitement and romance.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  I can't wait to read the prequel.
0764574124|4.0|I purchased this book as an assist to me - to build upon the knowledge that I have already, regarding Macros and VBA. I know some VB6, and am translating that knowledge through this book. I don't think that I am alone in asserting that any type of \\"Dummies\\" book provides good insight/information to those who may even have some existing knowledge of the topic. I will probably purchase another more intermediate book for VBA programming, to extend the experience. The purchase came very quickly as Amazon always does !
0977326403|5.0|While the fuller context that was presented in the book \\"Good to Great\\" is not present, \\"Good to Great and the Social Sectors: A Monograph to Accompany Good to Great\\", provides a quick and thought-provoking read of critical \\"Good to Great\\" concepts.  Although it does not provide quick fixes to challenges non-profits may be facing (especially in the context of the current economic disruption), it frames important questions a non-profit should consider.<br />The book acknowledges that non-profits cannot simply be looked upon as \\"businesses\\" and describes parallel conventions to the profit and loss measurement that defines success for profit-making ventures.<br />I have purchased multiple copies of this book for my fellow board members with whom I serve as well as for management of the various non-profits with whom I am involved.<br />I highly recommend this book -- it is a quick read -- one train or plane ride long.
0399230033|5.0|My 18-month-old loves to look at this this book over and over again.  (\\"Gwa!\\") But I don't mind at all...  \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\" is one of my favorites.    The pictures tell the story in this book; there are only a handful of words.  I love the stunningly vivid and detailed illustrations.  There are little surprises everywhere you look -- a stuffed Babar doll in the elephant's cage; a family picture of the zookeeper's wife holding the baby gorilla.  When I read it to my son, I tell him something different every time.  He loves to point out the things he knows the words for: \\"Keys!\\"  \\"Moon!\\"  \\"Abido!\\" (otherwise known as an \\"armadillo\\").    Even though I know what's coming, I can't help but smile every time at the animals quietly following the keeper through the zoo, tiptoeing through his living room, curling up in his bedroom, and then finally following the zookeeper's wife back to the zoo.  (You get the feeling it isn't the first time she's had to do this.)    This is a beautiful and peaceful bedtime story.  I hope you like it as much as we do!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|As a major fan of the series and having seen the movie I couldn't wait to get my DVD (I own the whole TV series on DVD)...love the movie and the special extras DVD included.
0743455967|5.0|Inspirational and funny. He talks about writing then goes oh by the way here's a great little tip. At first I barely noticed them. He shows what's important to him as a writer and reader as well as tells you. But even when he's telling you it's like we're having a cup of coffee together. Since its the writing rather than the subject of his books that I adore this was so much fun!! Plus, he tosses in a cool little reading list. This was the best purchase I've made for writing yet.
B000AQBAUI|5.0|Simply an incredible CD. Every song rocks.<br />Hard LED ZEPPELIN comparisons are inevitable, but I much prefer the smoky, 'last call'-style vocals of Pete French over those of Robert Plant. Songs are bluesy, powerful, rockin' and hit like a sock full of thumbtacks!<br /><br />Buy this CD, and you won't regret it!
0375842209|3.0|The amount of five star reviews on this book is not surprising because it was an interesting and engaging read. The story is written in a style I have never encountered before and I was engrossed throughout.<br /><br />The reason it gets a three star review from me is because its not a book I'd buy, put on my book shelf and read over and over again.<br /><br />Was it good? Yes.<br />Did I enjoy it? Yes.<br />What it original and unique? Yes.<br /><br />Would I read it again? Not likely.
B0000CDL93|5.0|I have made it pretty clear in the past that Oliver Stone is a director I just don't really get.  He is lauded by many and he is considered to be one of the most controversial directors of our time, but every film of his that I have seen has proved to be less controversial and more boring and absurd.  He just seems to miss the point.  I know that some do not agree, but I also know that I am not the only one to feel this way.<br /><br />A friend of mine the other day stated that Stone was an `enemy of fun'.<br /><br />That said; I absolutely adore `JFK'; I mean, utterly and unconditionally flaunt this film as one of the greatest political thrillers of all time.  From the first few seconds of footage I was completely engulfed in this film, and Stone's dedicated delivery never let up.  I was blown away because I really expected to pass over this as merely decent at best, but I honestly am taken aback by just how brilliant this film really is.  From the acting to the script to Stone's masterful art of filmmaking, `JFK' is an unforgettable masterpiece if I do say so myself.<br /><br />It's safe to say that I really had no idea what this movie was about before I sat down to watch it.  I actually thought that Kevin Costner was playing Kennedy himself, that's how `in the dark' I was about the true nature of this film.  Instead, Costner plays district attorney Jim Garrison, a man on a mission.  After the horrendous murder of John F. Kennedy, Garrison makes it his personal agenda to bring the man (or men) responsible down.  When Lee Harvey Oswald is arrested and then murdered Garrison smells foul play and so he, along with his team, pursues the truth at all costs.  As Garrison sinks deeper into the seedy underbelly of deceit and betrayal he uncovers a truth that sadly only he can see, and this truth (what is truth really?) causes more problems than good for Garrison and his family.<br /><br />First and foremost I really need to praise the script, up and down, inside and out because it is pristine on all fronts.  Not only is the film informative but it is engaging.  It doesn't just throw random facts at you and expect you to follow along.  Instead, it lines each commanding sequence of events with facts that melt down off the screen and caress our minds.  We never feel like we're being preached to, and we never feel like we're being manipulated.  We are merely being told a story, and story that twists itself and morphs into something so much bigger than we ever could have expected.  The opening sequences that map out Kennedy's term and his horrific murder are brilliantly constructed, for they immediately engulf you into this tragic tale.  The reshot footage of the murder is spellbinding and gut wrenching and totally effective in getting the audience immersed in the film from the very beginning.<br /><br />Then there is the acting, all of which is superb.  I normally find Costner rather dull (except his wildly brilliant turn in `The Upside of Anger') and here he does skirt around to prospect of boring me (he just has a very monotone delivery) but he really pulls it all together when he needs to (his final courtroom monologue is brilliantly delivered).<br /><br />The rest of the extensive cast though never misses a beat.  Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman take highest praises from me.  Jones (who was Oscar nominated) is sublimely sleazy as Clay Shaw.  There is a scene where he is being interrogated by Garrison and as he denies all the allegations he carries this smirk of satisfaction across his face that sent chills down my spine.  Kevin Bacon (who I am never fond of) is masterful here and Oldman is just plain chilling as Lee Harvey Oswald.  Singling anyone out is very hard though.  Joe Pesci is on the top of his game, as is Michael Rooker, and Sissy Spacek is heartbreaking as Garrison's conflicted wife.  Jack Lemmon, John Candy and Walter Matthau make the most of their limited screen time, and Donald Sutherland is flawlessly captivating in his cameo as the informant X.<br /><br />The star of this film is none other than Oliver Stone though.  His direction, his complete grasp of subject, is astonishing.  Honestly, this was one of the most pleasant surprises in recent memory for me.  I really thought that nothing Stone did would ever move me, let alone be one of my favorite films of any given year, but `JFK' is just too perfect not to completely fall for.<br /><br />There has been a lot said about the truthfulness of the film, many attacking it for manipulating facts and expressing opinion, but honestly, isn't that what film is all about.  Stone is able here to give us his own interpretation of truth without ever forcing us to accept what we don't want to.  Nothing is presented in a way that conditions us.  Instead he delivers a solid thriller than exposes what `could' have taken place without ever telling us what `did' happen.<br /><br />Quite honestly, this film is a total triumph.he star of this film is none other than Oliver Stone though.

There has been a lot said about the truthfulness of the film, many attacking it for manipulating facts and expressing opinion, but honestly, isn't that what film is all about.  Stone is able here to give us his own interpretation of truth without ever forcing us to accept what we don't want to.  Nothing is presented in a way that conditions us.  Instead he delivers a solid thriller than exposes what `could' have taken place without ever telling us what `did' happen.      Quite honestly, this film is a total triumph.

B000063JDE|4.0|Let it be known that David Lynch has a very unique style; a style that is a very acquired taste.  You either love him or you hate him; there is rarely an in-between.  I personally love his work (most of it), which is what saddens me a bit about `Blue Velvet'.  This is one of those films that is lauded above all his other work as being the best of the best, but it struck me a little cold.  The script is flawless (I love the ambiguities that lie within Lynch's work) and the direction, pace and mood acquired is effortlessly captivating, but the film falls short in a very central area; the acting.<br /><br />Don't pelt me with stones just yet.<br /><br />The film revolves around Jeffrey Beaumont, a young man who returns to his hometown after his father falls ill suddenly.  Upon his return he finds a severed ear in a field and his journey then begins.  With local high school girl Sandy (whose father happens to be the Detective Jeffrey shows the ear to) Jeffrey decides to try and uncover the mystery behind the ear, and this attempt brings him into the lives of quite a few interesting people.  First there is Dorothy Vallens, a beautiful woman who is victim to a strange and violent man named Frank Booth; and sliding into their lives, Jeffrey finds himself in desperate need for help as he watches his life slide further and further towards its end.<br /><br />Lynch, like I mentioned, has a unique style of direction.  If you are familiar with `Eraserhead' or `Mulholland Drive' then you already know how this film is going to progress.  He allows the scenes to move at their own pace, manipulating them just slightly.  This may come off to some as dry or even stale, but this is Lynch's way of using everything at his disposal to create a mood, an air within each scene.<br /><br />I have no problem with this.<br /><br />The script is also brilliantly done.  The slow progression of junior detective is effective and consuming as we anticipate how things are going to turn out for Jeffrey.  We are interested in his relationship with Dorothy, and especially Sandy.  We want to know how these two women are going to affect the outcome of his life, and we are terrified at the revelations about to be revealed by the repulsive Frank Booth.<br /><br />I adore these aspects of the film.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, the only fault I have with `Blue Velvet' is the acting, and not as a whole but in parts.  I'll start with the good.  Isabella Rossellini is a stunning woman who really uses everything within her to create a woman of believable desperation.  She is conflicted in every scene, and this is scene marvelously.  We can see each fragment of her dissention into chaos.  Laura Dern is even more splendid.  She delivers such a richly honest performance as young Sandy, fascinated by each new discovery, no matter how terrifying it winds up being for her.  But as great as these two actresses are, the film starts to crumble when left up to the men.  Dennis Hopper (who actually received praise for his performance) is just one gigantic gimmick.  He never really transcends his characters stereotypes.  He's a crazy psychopath, nothing more.  He delivered (the same year) a wonderfully controlled performance in `Hoosiers' that I am disappointed he wasn't able to control this a little more.  That said, he is still much more interesting than Kyle MacLachlan who may very well be the most boring actor since Keanu Reeves.  I just really wish that someone, anyone else would have landed this role.  MacLachlan just killed the high the film as a whole effectively sets.<br /><br />All this said, I am fond of this film.  It has so much going for it, and Lynch is just such a unique and original director who always stays true to himself.  There are very few films like this one, and the ones that come close are also directed by Lynch.  This is not a film for everyone, but if you are a fan of Lynch then this is a film you are bound to enjoy.ip with Dorothy, and especially Sandy.

0375826726|5.0|I have read the first two books of this series and i was very happy with the thrird. it was very well written. I do have to say it was an unexpected ending. i thought this was a trilogy!! i was wrong!     Overall I would tell you to buy it and hang on to it because you will read it again.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the show and we watched the whole thing in a week, and again before the new season!
031606792X|5.0|Best in the series! Kept me up all night reading to see how it ended. Talk about twists! Can't wait to see the movie, can only hope it's 1/2 as good as the series.

0385720920|3.0|I picked up Chuck Palahniuk's Choke after seeing the movie preview for the same title a few weeks ago. The movie preview made absolutely no sense, was hard to follow, and tough to summarize - as Palahniuk's novel would turn out to be. But the preview was intriguing enough for me to go out and buy the book, and I'm glad I did... sort of.    There really isn't much of a story line to Choke. The book centers on a drop-out med school student, Victor Mancini, who works at a colonial theme-park; fakes choking in restaurants to ultimately pay his mother's institutional bills; and is a raging sexaholic. In a strange twist, he also may be a direct descendant of Jesus Christ.    That pretty much sums up Choke.    The book doesn't so much present a linear story line, as it is a tale of self-discovery for Victor, who is trying to figure out his ancestry as well as why he is the way he is. Along this path, Palahniuk describes detailed sexual situations, gruesome medical conditions and creepy mental disorders that follow Victor from scene to scene. Palahniuk's descriptions are so vivid, in fact, that you'll start to wonder, \\"Could this ever happen to me...?\\" And you'll then quickly pray that it does not...    On the plus side, Choke is certainly interesting, moves quickly, and is very funny in some parts. You can knock this out in a long weekend or two, and it's an easy read, especially after trying to absorb The Unbearable Lightness of Being, as I did previously.    But along the same lines, there are better options out there if you're into books about 20- to 30-somethings looking for answers on the road through life.
B00065GX64|5.0|Fritz Lang's great 1931 film M is an important film, and for anyone who collects classic films, a necessary addition. Criterion's 2 CD set is simply wonderful, with the complete 110 minute Lang approved version of M on disc 1, and a William Friedkin interview with Fritz Lang made a year before his death, among other goodies on disc 2.    M was Fritz Lang's 1st movie made with sound, although a few sequences were actually silent. This film is one of the last great examples of German Expressionism, as well as a precursor in terms of visual style and plot to the classic film noir of a decade later. This film is about a serial child murderer, played by Peter Lorre, and the efforts of both the police, and organized crime, to catch him. This was Lorre's first screen role, and it not only typecast him as a villian for years to come, but was used by Goebbels in the vile propaganda film \\"The Eternal Jew\\" as an example of Jewish immorality and corruption.    The visual elements in the film are particularly striking and memorable. The children playing a morbid game of \\"next victim\\"; a little girl bouncing a ball off the murderer's wanted poster while his shadow suddenly appears; the dirty deed done, signified by her ball rolling away and her balloon flying off; a potential new innocent victim framed in a mirror by knives; the mark of \\"M\\" applied to the murderer which can't be erased. There is also that ominous leitmotif of the murderer constantly whistling \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\".     Lorre is riveting in this movie. It really is the only great acting done here, but it makes up for everything else. He becomes a human rat, scurrying to escape, trapped in a cage, frantic, and in the end, pitiful and almost pitiable. The fact that his final tormentors are sane career criminals, while Lorre's character has sanity issues, gives the film a final moral ambiguity that almost overshadows the repugnance we feel toward him.
0618477977|5.0|My uncle gave me this book as a gift many years ago. I loved the fact that it came with a cassette (read by William Hurt) and it even has a little bell just like the boy in the story. This story is probably my absolute favorite Christmas book. I am buying it for my Nephew to pass on the tradition.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Excellent movie.  It is a must see movie that was way ahead of its time. Although the movie is more than 65 years old, it has meaning today because it's about girlfriends.   The all star cast includes Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell and no men.  What a hoot!
031606792X|4.0|Fist off, I am a 41 year old male who has read all four books of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Series. SURPRISE.    And despite me being a male and having to (La)push my way through the slower, sappy romantic moments between Bella and Edward, in total, ALL four novels were well written, creative and fun. The author has an acceptable balance between romance and action. I'm confident Hollywood will take each novel and further balance the equation and perfect the ratio between Edward once again taking Bella's chin and lifting her face up to his and the action entailed with all the vampire threats taking place throughout the series by making sure there's slightly more emphasis on the action. That's all that was really needed in this four-book series in the first place and the balance would have been perfect. The build-up to the battle finale at the end of Breaking Dawn was very electric and gripping. Well done.    Stephenie's take on vampires and the eventual reveal in this last installment of there being a difference between shape-shifters and true werewolves were all creative and infectious. It made me want to know more about the world the author has created and hopefully will get to do so if she ever decides to return to this series again in the future.    About the many complaints you will read below on how \\"unrealistic\\" the ending was to Breaking Dawn . . . uh HELLO? McFLY? This is FANTASY folks! It's a story about VAMPIRES and SHAPE-SHIFTERS for cryin' out loud. These claims that Stephenie should have been more responsible about \\"messages\\" to her young female fan base are ludicrous at best. Any teenage female who can't see past the unrealistic (FANTASY) aspects of the author's story and takes away from it that it's OK to get knocked up and/or married young and everything will still turn out fine is gonna find that excuse somewhere else anyway. Parents be warned - It's gonna happen at school before it happens from reading a book. But in an ironic sense it does revealhow well these books were written for so many of her fan base to take these novels so seriously. So take those critiques as a compliment, Steph. Ya did a good job. The fact that the ending wrapped up so nicely was a breath of fresh air in a day and age when all things seem to be unhappy endings. Besides, I got the strong impression that the Volturi Coven were anything but satisfied with the happy ending Bella and everyone else won in the end and I get the sneaking suspicion that if Stephenie ever decided to continue this specific series that is would be them that would try to ensure that there wasn't a happy ending in the future.    I'm not sure where some people got freaked about Jacob imprinting with an infant. Look, Stephenie obviously did her homework on wolves and they mate for life. They find the one they are supposed to be connected with and that's that. It doesn't mean Jake is hot for Renesmee's chili. That is supposed to happen when she comes of age - around the same age as Jacob. Until it blossoms into a more physical desire Jacob's feelings will remain protective and nurturing like a brother's love. Jacob's current feelings for Renesmee was clearly stated in Breaking Dawn. Too much sexual content has made it's way into our daily lives and it's affecting how we view things. People need to step back and gain their perspective again. There was nothing wrong with this whole imprinting concept. I do wish, however, that the shape-shifters were written a little bit better and not so kicked around, plot-wise, as well as looked down upon by so many in the series (I am a werewolf fan at heart and I am also 6' 6\\" and half American Indian - yep, \\"TEAM JACOB\\"). But this is normal for werewolf/vampire fans. One is always favored over the other so one species is always shown more higher caliber than the other species depending on which species is your favorite. But as Jake would probably have put it best . . . \\"Oh well.\\" And with a smile.    I say, thanks for letting mesee some sunshine again, Stephenie. Life imitates art but the reverse is true as well. Why not let the artists of the world  help re-introduce - through their artistic mediums - a better happier world for all of us to see again. I, for one, have had enough of \\"reality TV\\" to last me a vampire's lifetime and I always enjoy it when someone has the grit to make sure we are reminded that happy-ended fairy tales are still in style.     Here's hoping she delves into this world of hers again in the future and gets an actual Werewolf series out. Maybe even with cameos by some members of the Cullen and Quileute/Black family.    Ya never know.    With all that said, I need my Werewolf Fix and it's off to read The Hyde Effect.
B000059MEK|4.0|4 1/2    Discovery is the OK Computer of House music. Instantly and consistently transcending that genre, offering quite simply the closest thing to urban-middle-class-party-and-after-party-experience-via-compressed-audio to date. Admittedly I can see the case being made for a weaker second side, but it seems more a matter of sequencing since nearly every minute of this hour length future-flow brims with signature studio mastery.
6305841861|5.0|My friends and I have spent a lot of time this Halloween season trying to dig up hidden horror gems for each other.  It's been a fun ride and an expensive diversion for sure.  But as the bewitching hour draws near, it is time to stop digging for a minute and pay proper respects to a film that is so widely loved that this review will simply get washed away with the tide of reviews from its adoring masses.  I give you \\"Evil Dead II\\" (imagine trumpets blaring)!!<br /><br />-\\"TURE HORROR FANS\\" CAN BITE MY ASH!!<br />Oh yea, I'm coming after you people!!  It's time to open up a can of reality woopak on you!!  Those of you who say a horror/comedy is not horror at all are living in some self-defined fantasy world of limited thinking.  Most people in their right mind will tell you that half the fun of horror movies IS THE FUN!!!  \\"Evil Dead II\\" might be the most fun normal people will have while still getting a little bit scared.  So, \\"true horror fans\\", you can take your constipated narrow view of horror and drop it in the trash can man.  Sorry for that tantrum.  But honestly, there are so few really good, completely serious horror films that I'd die of boredom watching the same ten films over and over again.  Now that's \\"true horror\\".<br /><br />Indiscriminate Spoilers Ahead!!<br /><br />-STAY OUT OF THE CELLAR!!<br />I've seen this film so many times and yet, every time Ash goes into the cellar I get a little creeped out.  So yea, this film is still scary.  It's not so dark with black, shere terror that you'll have trouble going to sleep at night, but it still gets a few chills from me.  In fact, there are many elements in this film that set the standards for creepy camera work.  Sam Raimi was very inventive here.  When you see the camera (evil spirit) chasing after Ash, just think about how difficult that shot was.  Never mind the scene with the trophy animals and the c.lock on the wall laughing at him; way creepy camera angles!!  As creepy as this stuff is, it's all done brilliantly with a light hearted wink from Raimi.<br /><br />-HOLD ON TO YOUR HEADS AND TAKE A BOW.<br />I need to honor the cast for making this one of my all time favorites.  I tend to neglect actor for the most part.  So, here's the role call.<br />-Bruce Campbell = Ash:  Campbell and Raimi clearly have a love for the 3 Stooges and are certainly Moe schmoes.  As the main man, Campbell might have the most expressive face this side of Jim Carrey.  Needless to say, he is great at slapstick and has made being a horror klown, art.<br />-Denise Bixler = Linda:  Next to Ash, Linda is the most memorable role.  Even though she technically dies very early, she spends a lot of time as a head.  Though hardly the queen of B movies, Denise gets huge respect for all the nastiness she endures in this classic.<br />-Ted Raimi = Possessed Henrietta:  His price for nepotism; spending hours in a ridiculous amount of latex!  What a trooper.  This is a pretty darn creepy character too.<br />-Sarah Berry = Annie Knowby: She has the distinct honor of being the last woman in this realm that Ash lusts after.  She gets pretty messy in the worst ways too.  Raimi was just brutal on these people.<br />-Kassie DePaiva = Bobbie Joe:  She's so sweet and helpful in this film.  It also turns out she's a tree hugger, well, they hug her anyway.<br />-Dan Hicks = Jake: Dan gets to be meat.<br />-Rick Domeier = Ed Getley:  Rick gets to be meat too.<br /><br />These people didn't always distinguish themselves but will always have a place in the hearts of \\"Evil Dead II\\" fans for making this such a treat.<br /><br />-IF YOU HAVE D' TIME SON, I HAVE D'WIL SON.<br />Well son, or daughter, or \\"bro\\" or \\"sis\\" or whatever your position in life may be, I suggest that if you haven't seen this film yet then you either don't have the time (so why are you reading this?) or the will.  Get off your butt and watch this all you fans of horror!!  Bruce Campbell is no George C. Scot, man. However, he is quite brilliant in this standard-bearing comedic/horror classic.  You can spend your Halloween all wet while you Bob for apples, and count to 22 or you can watch one of the most entertaining films a true fan of the genre could ever hope for.<br />Sorry J.  I couldn't figure out how to fit a single letter into this mess!!while you Bob for apples, and count to 22 or you can watch one of the most entertaining films a true fan of the genre could ever hope for.  Sorry J.  I couldn't figure out how to fit a single letter into this mess!!
B001E7X4M4|5.0|Before I discuss The March, lets discuss In The Eyes of Fire first.  In the Eyes of Fire was a boring cd that sacrificed everything that made them good in order to become more heavy.  What ended up as the result was a long boring album that was slow in too many places, ditched melody for heaviness, and had way too many breakdowns.  Many feared that The March would end up just like In The Eyes of Fire, and well, today is judgement day for Unearth.    Did Unearth redeem themselves with The March?  Will The March bring all of their old fans back from the days of The Oncoming Storm?    ....    As you probably guessed, YES!!!  YES!!!  As soon as you hit play, you will be greeted by a scorching guitar solo that will instantly destroy any doubts or things you held against this band after listening to III.  Trevor has returned to his old style of vocals from their second album The Oncoming Storm, which is a good thing in my opinion because there is far more conviction in his delivery on this record.  Their new drummer Derek Kerswill is decent but their return to their former sound makes up for any of the flaws in Derek's playing.    1.  MY WILL BE DONE sets the mood for the entire album because it not only displays their amazingly catchy harmonies (think the riff in the intro to Zombie Autopilot), but it marks the returns of Unearth's wicked guitar solos and their original sound which is something all of us Unearth fans have been waiting years for.  2.  HAIL THE SHRINE is another great song with a brutal guitar riff during the verses, a really catchy chorus, and ends in a killer breakdown.  The lyrics are really good as well, during the chorus, Trevor declares \\"Believe my every word/Believe and I will protect you/So criticize/Bow down you might meet your maker.\\"  This is easily one of the best songs off of this album simply because the lyrics work so well with the guitars.  3.  CROW KILLER is another song that features an incredibly catchy and technical riff that lasts through the entire song.  The only problem with the main riff is that it makes the solo look lackluster because it is so complex.  4.  GRAVE OF OPPORTUNITY begins with a slow melodic introduction, then immediately kicks off to a really fast riff.  The bridge consists of clean guitar backed up by a distorted guitar, and leads into a short solo which goes right back into the incredible main riff.  An amazing song which will be even better live in the pits.  5.  WE ARE NOT ANONYMOUS leads off with an insanely complex lead on the guitars before leading into a Gothenburg-esque melody which starts and stops throughout the song.  The song constantly becomes more complex as it moves on, giving it a fresh feel and never lets the riff get old or boring.  The solo after the breakdown is really good and leads back into the complex lead established in the beginning of the song.  Yet another great song, I would not be surprised if this was put into Rock Band or something---it is that catchy and technical.  6.  THE MARCH has a dark feel to it set by the the bass and the guitars and slow-paced drumming.  While it does not come off as a good song on the first listen, it will grow on you as you listen to the album a couple more times.  Good song.  7.  CUTMAN is easily the best song on this entire album.  It opens with a STUNNING lead, which builds up into a very fast and heavy riff backed up by Derek on the kit.  This will most definitely be a crowd pleaser at future Unearth shows, the main riff SCREAMS circle pits to me.  Trevor's voice just plain sells this song to you the second it begins.  This is easily up there as one of their best songs to date, although it does not match This Lying World or Black Hearts Now Reign.  8.  THE CHOSEN stands out as one of the most unique songs Unearth has written to date.  It's heavy, but it sounds more anthemic than their other songs on this album let alone their entire catalog of music.  The song is perfect to listen to before a game to get fired up.  9.  LETTING GO is a display of both Unearth's melodic side and their heavy side.  While it is a huge change in pace from the other songs on this cd because it is the slowest song on the album, it is much reminiscent of The Oncoming Storm in the sense that it fits perfectly in between THE CHOSEN and TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCE on the album just how ARIES did between ENDLESS and PREDETERMINED SKY.  10. TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCE closes the album on a dark note. It begins with a soaring melody in the beginning, and goes into a riff that sounds ominous.  The melody of the song fades out and ends the record.    BEST SONGS: Cutman, Hail the Shrine, We Are Not Anonymous, My Will Be Done, The Chosen, Grave of Opportunity, The March      Unearth has redeemed itself in my book with The March, I think it even surpasses The Oncoming Storm because it is produced and written so well.  The skill of all of the musicians in this band is simply undeniable.  Their catchy melodies, scorching guitar riffs, and aggressiveness keep the music fresh and interesting.  While some listeners may think that Trevor's voice is bad(I personally don't), the band just simply wouldn't sound good without him.  He shows an exceptional amount of passion and delivery in his voice, which I haven't seen in many other bands.    The March may alienate people who got turned onto Unearth by In The Eyes of Fire simply because it sounds less heavy guitar-wise and utilizes more melodies than any of the songs on III did.  It may also come off as just another Unearth album at first, but I can guarantee you it will grow on you after a couple of listens if you let it.    This is easily the best metal album of 2008 (yes this may be subjective to some, but I loved this far more than the new albums by All Shall Perish and The Haunted), and I highly recommend buying this.  I also recommend seeing this band live because the music sounds far better and they put on an incredibly good show.    EDIT: Didn't realize the bonus track was on most American copies of this album as well.  The copy I have somehow does not have the hidden track on it.  My bad.  It's still really good though, highly recommend it.
B000007OW1|5.0|I've heard and seen a number of 'La Traviata' productions.<br />I got this set from Amazon some time ago, at THAT price for the sake of Ms. Devia alone.<br />I heard the first few tracks and was put off by the sonics, wondering why that extortionate price?  Recently an Italian opera house (Parma) came to my home city and showed us how Italians do Verdi (Rigoletto). Afterwards I came back again to this disc for the PERFORMANCE of La Traviata itself. This time I could really listen to it as the great performance that it was!<br />The three protagonists are all very good.  Ms. Devia and Mr. Zancanaro are exceptionally good, and Mr. Aronica very competent in the role of Alfredo, all sounding very Italianate and authentic, singing with good pyrotechnique as well as ardent comittment.<br />I fully share the view of the reviewer who bewailed the plight of Mariella Devia, perhaps the last great Italian coloratura soprano.<br />I could not understand why people can pamper Ms. Bartoli (which is fine) but ignore Ms. Devia in the way they did.<br />I've heard Patricia Ciofi in the role. She is nowhere comparable to Mariella Devia, yet she is a great hit internationally these days in a way that Ms. Devia never was. Perhaps the Italians are like the Japanese - reserving the BEST to themselves. Who knows?
1416562605|5.0|The White Tiger is superb. Embedded in a narrative which draws the reader along, are profound insights about modern India and the human condition. Once again, India has produced a literary giant.  With Messrs. Adiga and Rushdie in good form, Indian literature holds the hope of standing squarely beside the efflorescence of Russian literature during the time of Tolstoi and Dostoevsky. You really should read this one.
B0018D4SHY|4.0|I dream of being allowed to compile a Little Richard set from the original masters. Well, I will have to settle for this. Great sound, we all know these are THE performances - I just wish they would have added: \\"Can't Believe You Want to Leave\\"; and \\"I Got It\\". There are others as well, but what can a poor fan do? Sadly this does not (at this time) replace Georgia Peach (which needs a sound overhaul).
B0010QEPLI|5.0|If you enjoy electronica, particularly trance but with greater variety, you'll surely at least like this.  See my Amazon UK review along with its two-disc 2008 remix (even better in some respects...available via Amazon UK).

B000025XKM|5.0|Many call this album stark, depressing, and disturbed.  Yes, there are elements that are deeply sad, stark, and depressed, but I find most of the music beautiful, haunted, and beguiling.  The title track is justifiably a Drake classic, and despite being used in a car commerical, I still love the song.  The commercialisation of the song didn't hurt the integrity of it.  Drake's music is like that.  It's completely in its own universe than nothing can ever damage it.  It's so pure and so unique.  Nothing can poison it in the eyes of those who love this man's work.<br /><br />This is the most stripped down album Drake ever did.  It's just his voice, his guitar, his songwriting, and a touch of piano in the title track.  That's all that's really needed.  Despite the fact that his other albums have beautiful instrumentation (including appearances by Richard Thompson and John Cale), the stripped down quality of this recording really enhances it.  I'm not going to say if this is my favorite Nick Drake album, but ultimately, it doesn't matter with him.  All 3 of his albums are so unique and special there's no need to divide them up.  They are like chapters in a book, all contributing to the greatness of the man himself.  I miss Nick Drake quite a bit, but the albums will remain.

0375842209|5.0|This novel is a must-read for everyone, young adults and adults alike.  I was completely captivated by this story and the style in which it was written.  Zusak's approach to Death as the narrator is unique and engaging, and his voice is sometimes cynical, sometimes sympathetic.  He tells the story of young Liesel as she is sent to live with foster parents outside of Munich in the heart of Nazi Germany during WWII.  The relationships she forms over the next few years are so compelling: Rudy, her best friend, Hans, her adopted Papa, Max, the resident Jew in hiding, the mayor's wife who owns an enviable library, and a cast of others who add so much dimension to this novel.  Mostly, though, it is about Liesel's love of the written word and her determination to acquire books at any cost.<br /><br />The most captivating part, however, is the last 30 pages when Liesel's story comes to a dramatic end.  Be prepared to have some tissue on hand and to sit quietly for a time to ponder this extraordinary book.  I will forever be haunted by the quiet silver eyes of Papa, the incessant cursing of Mama, and the lemon yellow hair of Rudy.  But especially, I will not forget the image of Liesel finding comfort in books during a tumultuous time in human history.
0143038583|5.0|What struck me most while reading this book was discovering along with the writer how little I know about where my food comes from, how it reaches me and what has been done to it along the way.  Very rewarding were Pollan's sense of curiosity, courage, determination and integrity in looking at the truth of industrialized food, to pulling the trigger in the forest, hauling hay, standing knee-deep in excrement with \\"534\\", and firing up the grill for the sake of having an authentic knowledge, not just a label with a barcode. And it started to bother me that I really had no idea where my (extremely important and life-sustaining) food had come from or how much coordinated effort it took to get it to me.<br /><br />I know I will never see through the same lens when I step foot in a supermarket, grocery store, convenience store or restaurant.  I will think twice about eating corn-fed meat, not for a moral repulsion to eating meat, but for a moral repulsion to the way our country obtains our meat and what they stuff our animals with before we ingest.  If our industrial abattoirs cannot be humane, then perhaps we can't call our civilization civilized.<br /><br />Yes, every eater - herbivore, carnivore, omnivore - should read this book!  Pollan has an honest voice and an engaging way with words.

1400103789|4.0|I don't believe in god, but I refuse to call myself an athiest because, in my experience, avowed athiests tend to be arrogant, strident and condescending. This audiobook has not shown me otherwise. Although it is very well researched and packed full of information, much of it is read in a snotty, superior tone that ridicules other belief systems, and adds nothing to the arguments. (Although, in all honesty, the uppity-sounding English accents add to the perception.)  I think I would have preferred to read this rather than hear it read by these two.
006016848X|5.0|I found the woman of my dreams and my relationship with her was failing. I could not understand what it was that I was doing that was wrong, so I became frustrated in general, confused at how the most passionate relationship I could ever wish for was now cold and distant. I bought this book as a last chance to try to rebuild what I was losing and salvage our life together. I got tired of all the Mars and Venus references, but the info was right on. I now understand what my faults were and by applying the info my life is easier and the frustration is gone. If you have a woman that seems super sensitive and you find her getting upset and distant when you try to talk to her, this book may help you to see the changes you can make to better your life with her.

However, I came away with more fear than ever of Muslims.  After her spell wore off a littla, I decided that she might be exaggerating her claim of Muslims' hatred and desire for violent genocide of all \\"infidels.\\"  At least I HOPE she was exaggerating!
B00139B39E|1.0|Ok, so this written from the perspective of someone who isn't opposed to prog rock and listens to a fair amount of punk/hardcore/alternative but isn't really into heavy metal. Why I bought this abomination I don't know. Well, actually I was interested in the prog angle and have yet to come across a decent metal band. So Dream Theater being an innovative metal band crossing the boundaries sounded like a reasonable alternative to my usual fare. This double CD has a \\"dark\\" and a \\"light\\" side.  Impression of \\"dark\\" side: Ok songs but nothing special, overproduced, probably technically brilliant. Reminds me of Metallica, probably because of the singing but less memorable and I don't really consider Metallica a very memorable band. Guess these songs are decent if you like metal. No prog rock here and as \\"dark\\" as a day on the ski slopes.  Impression of \\"light\\" side: Is this a joke? Come on, even metal heads must cringe at this. Sounds like Bon Jovi meets Europe (not the continent). Who listens to this? Metal fans on Valium? Your little sister? And no prog rock here either.  Summary: Utterly forgettable. No wonder there was only one greatest hit. According to the other reviewers here the prog songs are missing here but going by this boring introduction I doubt that Dream Theater are anywhere in the same league as old Yes, old Marillion or old Pink Floyd even when they play their better songs.
0142412147|5.0|I picked up Let it Snow, expecting to read it leisurely as the holidays approached. I imagined reading a few pages here and there throughout the month of November, perhaps finishing it over Christmas break, just in time to break out those reindeer socks with the holes I've been wearing since I was ten and refuse to throw away. Instead, I found myself sucked into a charming, engaging web of a story, only to emerge 14 hours later wanting more.          As a fan of all of the author's independent works, I was pleased to find that each author's voice remained just as unique and bold as in their other works, yet all three worked together seamlessly to tell a larger story. The vividness of the characters is such that they stick with you long after you put the book down. (Okay, I say \\"long after\\" but seeing as I finished it about 4 hours ago, I really just mean \\"stick with you for at least four hours and probably longer\\" after finishing the book. The point is that you'll find no one-dimensional characters here.) I feel sort of scarily like I grew up alongside Tobin, Addie and Stuart, or have been best friends with Jubilee ever since we both missed the bus on the first day of middle school.          The story is simple, but also marvelously complex, tackling such important existential questions as \\"What course of action should one take when fourteen cheerleaders are locked in a Waffle House in a small town in Virginia during the worst snow storm in fifty years?\\" Yes, people fall in love- there is romance and heartbreak and lots of dumping and break ups (or at least a couple); but I promise Let it Snow is not one of those Made-for-TV movies that air way too many times on the Hallmark channel during the month of December in which someone learns to believe in the Christmas spirit and Santa Claus brings everyone presents at the end.          No, Let it Snow doesn't tie a nice little red bow on its romance. The character's relationships feel raw, real and honest. They warm yourheart and sort of make you want to be in love. (So much so that I had to actually remind myself that, oh yeah, I was already in love.) Don't worry. If you don't have your own love story to tell this Christmas, after finishing this book, you'll probably want to start taking it out for coffee and to your mother's Christmas Eve smorgasbord. Maybe the two of you will even frolic in the snow? Okay, so I don't actually recommend that, since it's a paperback and ice is usually wet and \\"wet\\" and \\"paperback\\" is usually a bad combination.         My point is, that you should read this book. You should read this no matter how old you are, or where you live, or what time of year it is or whether or not you like Christmas. You should read this if you want to be entertained, moved, made to think.       Do something nice for yourself this Christmas (Or Halloween, even) and read Let it Snow.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit goes all out in the album displaying their talents and showing the world that they still reign as one of the best metal bands ever.  Fred Durst is a musical genius along with the rest of the crew.<br /><br />Fred Durst is vocals are naturally good, he doesn't need special effects or a growl like monotonous death metal bands.  And the guitar riffs are better than anything Morbid Angel, Sepultura, Iron Maiden, and Black Sabbath have ever done.<br /><br />Hands down best metal album ever!

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Metallica's has 9th album, much awaited after the extraordinary 'St. Anger' shows a tad decline in the music, but all an all a great album.  The solos on this album aren't needed, but they still perform better solos than any found on the first 5 albums.  The 'Unforgiven 3' shows Metallica can be a great ballad band, unlike their miserable attempts 'Fade to Black' and 'Sanitarium'. All and all a great album, but can't top St. Anger.<br /><br />Now on to Metallica's history-<br />Metallica's history is very controversial and there has been many debates on whether their old stuff is better than their new stuff, and vice versa.<br /><br />Let's get the facts straight here people.  Metallica's first 4 albums were cliche 80's metal, no different from generic thrash metal at the time.  Metallica's 'Black' album showed the world that the band had potential, but still failed miserably.<br /><br />Metallica's first great album would have to be 'Load' and 'Reload was another step in the right direction.  Tracks like 'Until it sleeps' and 'Fuel' displays some of the 90's finest hard rock songs.<br /><br />But all and all the greatest Metallica album would have to be 'St.Anger' Metallica has never shown that much musicianship in their 80's efforts as they did in St. Anger.  Key tracks like 'Frantic' and \\"Invisible Kid' show James vocal abilities at his very finest.<br />---<br /><br />Can't wait to hear another great album from the boys of Metallica.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Director Jon Favreau (Zathura & Elf) brings Marvel Comics' armored superhero to the big screen in the first-rate comic book adventure \\"Iron Man\\". While demonstrating his company's newest weapon system, billionaire industrialist and genius inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by Middle Eastern terrorists and forced to build a powerful weapon. Instead, Stark secretly develops a suit of armor to escape his captives. Upon returning to the United States, a renewed Tony Stark is determined to amend his company's mistakes and improves his armor to become the high-tech superhero Iron Man. \\"Iron Man\\" is a superb crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster that ranks as one of the best superhero movies to date. The latest comic book adaptation delivers a well-paced storyline, excellent visual effects, good action sequences, a solid cast and great humor. Downey's entertaining performance as Tony Stark is one of the movie's biggest strengths. \\"Iron Man\\" also stars Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Academy Award-winner Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man\\" arrives on Blu-Ray with a fully loaded 2-disc Ultimate Edition that's a must-have for any Marvel Comics fan. The 2008 blockbuster is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is very impressive but not quite perfect. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio is excellent. \\"Iron Man\\" Ultimate Edition features two great documentaries: \\"I Am Iron Man\\" that offers an in-depth behind-the-scenes look in the development of the film, and \\"The Invincible Iron Man\\" that explores the origins of the Marvel Comics' character. Other bonus materials include four picture galleries, 11 deleted and extended scenes, theatrical trailers, \\"The Onion: Iron Man Trailer\\" gag short, actor Robert Downey Jr's screen test and \\"Hall of Armor\\" interactive feature. Overall, \\"Iron Man\\" Ultimate Edition scores an \\"A\\".
B000V86OKG|5.0|If you loved the first season, you won't be disappointed with the second.  I watched this over a couple of weekends... may have warped my life view a little, but I was highly entertained.  Michael C. Hall is fabu as is the rest of the cast.  Not a dull character in the bunch!
0345452585|3.0|Here's my review system--I score on four categories and average them together for the number of stars. The four categories are: character development (are the characters deep and complex, plot (is it interesting), voice (is the narration smooth and engaging) and cliche level (is it predictable.)<br /><br />Character development: 5 stars--Kellerman is very good at getting inside the head of his characters<br /><br />Plot: 4 stars-- It took forever but there was a nice twist or two<br /><br />voice: 5 stars-- Very easy and pleasant to digest<br /><br />cliche level: 3 stars-- The crazy serial killer and the non cop protagonist has been done a bit<br />and this one didn't bring a whole lot that is new<br /><br />I like psychological thrillers and this one was pretty good.
B00133KFGW|2.0|Well, August Rush wasn't terrible, but it just didn't do the job for this viewer. The movie tells the story of Evan (Freddie Highmore), a young orphan in a boy's home somewhere in New York state. Evan insists that he can hear music everywhere, that he knows his parents want him and will find him, that he doesn't want to be placed with a new family because he's already GOT a family.<br /><br />Rewind 11 years to meet Lyla (Kerri Russell), a famed cellist, with a controlling father and an engagement to play with the New York Philharmonic. After her big performance, she meets Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), the lead singer in a band, at a party. The two instantly click and share a passionate night together. However, the next day, Lyla's father forbids her from seeing Louis again and ships her off . . . somewhere.<br /><br />Lyla later discovers she's pregnant due to her encounter with Louis, but cannot find him. A car accident late in her pregnancy lands her in the hospital. While Lyla is still unconscious, her father gives her baby up for adoption. When she comes to, he tells her the baby died as a result of the accident. The baby, of course, is Evan.<br /><br />Back to the present - Determined to find his parents, Evan runs away from the orphanage. \\"Following the music\\" lands him in New York City, where he meets all sorts of unsavory characters, discovers his own musical talents, and searches for the missing pieces of his family.<br /><br />While I think the initial concept of this movie was a decent one, it suffered in the execution. Too many plotpoints were thin or didn't make sense. Too many things seemed sooooo improbable that it kept me from fully engaging in the world of the movie. And it was so sugary sweet that I almost got a toothache.<br /><br />All performances were pretty solid (though one does wonder why Louis' Irish brogue hasn't softened at least a little after living in the U.S. for 10+ years). I fully believe that, with a better script, this could have been a great movie.<br /><br />As my husband said, \\"I might have liked it better if I had been a 17-year-old girl.\\"id, \\"I might have liked it better if I had been a 17-year-old girl.\\"
0312995423|2.0|The plot was interesting, full of action like all his books.  However, the main characters were so extremely \\"perfect\\" (they are gorgeous and geniuses at the same time) and the romance was so cheesy (they are PERFECT for each other and nothing is wrong with their relationship).  Many plot twists can only be found in stories, for example, the main character needs to find a girl and it JUST SO happens that the first guy he met at a CONCERT knows who she is, and it JUST SO happens that the girl missed her plane ride when he got to the airplane. There are just way too many convenient conincidences to tell a story. There were also many inconsistencies of the book, and Brown seemed like he did a bad job researching about Asian cultures.  I enjoyed Dan Brown's other books, but this one was disappointing.
6305428557|5.0|This movie is a very substantive movie.  Don't let the presence of Hugh Grant trivialize this movie.  It is one of the funniest and smartest movies I have ever seen. It is a true story about a little town who is about to lose it's mountain, which is a source of pride for the whole community.  I think it is the most watched movie with all of my family members.  As a side note our church is showing this movie at our movie discussion night, it has lots of meat.
0375842209|5.0|This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE book of all time!!! I've read it three times (which is unusual for me). Even though I know what's going to happen, I never fail to shed more than a few tears at the end. The characters and their relationships to each other are rich and realistic. You get a sense of their daily lives, sameness day after day, dreariness, poverty, fear, hopelessness. And yet the author adds details (the shape of a cloud, the feel of a book, a snowman in the basement) that become shining rays of hope, reminding you that life is worth living, even in the midst of evil, cruelty, and the worst that humans are capable of. Hope remains.

0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho, is the story of a shepard boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids.  Santiago is quite content traveling in the countryside with his sheep, and dreaming of the merchant's daughter in the village where he sells his wool.  That is until he has a dream in which a child appears one day and is playing with his sheep.  Suddenly the child takes him by the hands and transports him to the Pyramids, telling him \\"If you come here you will find a hidden treasure.\\"  He meets a gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king and a alchemist on his journey, all of whom point him in the direction of his quest.         Coelho writes with simplicity and directness.  The whole novel is only 167 pages long and is very compelling and almost reads like a fairy tale.  The reader is transported to a world of magic and adventure, but the book also is full of specific wisdom for the reader on his or her own quest for their dreams (sounds extremely cheesy, i know, but true ihmo).       Santiago starts out to find worldly treasure but ends up finding the treasure within.  This is the theme of the book, and it is conveyed in a way that is not preachy whatsoever.  An exciting and inspiring book for anyone in search of their own Personal Legend.

0385333846|5.0|It is daunting to attempt to say anything unique about a novel that already has 700+ reviews on this site, but here goes.....    I somehow managed to get through all of high school and college without ever having been exposed to this great book.  And in retrospect, I think that may have been for the better, as I believe that many of this book's themes would have been lost on a younger me.  Mainly the theme of destiny versus freewill, and the idea that in becoming \\"unstuck in time,\\" Billy Pilgrim has a better perspective on his life as a whole.  That doesn't however, always translate into making better choices along the way, and hence the idea that destiny is ultimately inflexible.    This book is the perfect example of a modern classic and remains relevant in many ways that it might not have had it been written just ten years earlier.
B001CLG6RC|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Enigma ever since I bought their first album. I own, and frequently listen to, all of Enigma's previous albums and have loved them all. However, this album was very disappointing! What happened?! :( I hardly liked a single one of the songs on either disc (I bought the 2-disc edition of Seven Lives Many Faces). There were only two songs that I thought were okay but I probably wouldn't listen to them again. This is very surprising for me. Considering how much I liked all of Enigma's previous albums, I never expected to think this new album was bad. In the past I always looked forward to Enigma's next album as soon as their latest brillantly-composed music was released.
B001H1WY28|2.0|I enjoyed the movie and the characters were good, I was able to relate to them and create a minimal bond. However, Amazon needs to work on the delivery of the movie.

B001GMH8SI|5.0|I knew nothing of Christopher McCandless or the book of his life or even anything about this movie until I was sitting in the cinema. The only thing I knew is that Sean Penn was directing and having been very impressed with his gut-wrenching, if incredibly downbeat, [[ASIN:B00005BCKG The Pledge]] I was pretty much guaranteed to like this film. My guess turned out to be extremely correct.<br /><br />Alexander Supertramp (that's Emile Hirsch as McCandless folks) is a man with no attachments. Having been raised in a loveless household by parents who only wish for him to 'or-din-ary' things he entertains them as far as graduating college but escapes to the country as soon as the diploma is in his hands.<br /><br />His dream is to explore the land with no ID, no money and no chance of being found by those who might want to interfere with his mission of reaching peaceful seclusion in a remote corner of Alaska. Along the way he touches many lives, some brief, some profound and gains experience and character that some might never have even if they lived to a hundred.<br /><br />Sean Penn's photography and affection for nature give this film an overall gorgeous look. It is surely one of the most uniquely composed films of the year. He reminds me a lot of Clint Eastwood as an actor who can also direct fine movies and encourage impressive performances out of his cast. Pretty much everybody here is on top form, even Vince Vaughn manages to shake off the taint of those tawdry 'frat pack' comedies and play a genuine character for once.<br /><br />But Hal Holbrook as old Ron Franz really is a standout. I've never seen a more heartfelt or touching performance in so long. It's a real shame he was conned out of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I think it's great that Sean Penn brought Holbrook (now 82) back for such an important and thought-provoking role. If you don't shed a tear for him then you have no soul.<br /><br />Don't con yourself out of a good movie. It may have a limited release but Into the Wild is a film worth taking time out to see. Since I live in the UK, the story of Christopher McCandless (which appears to be some sort of true urban legend in America) is not well known here. I guess that having no expectations of the film made me enjoy it on the right level.worth taking time out to see.

B001AX9DT0|4.0|Ray's third album definitely takes his sound in a different, and more interesting direction.  He obviously has no interest in impressing critics, and it comes across in this album.  He just writes what he feels, and I frankly love it.    Trouble will always be my favorite album, but I certainly prefer Gossip in the Grain to Til the Sun Turns Black as it is more upbeat and utilizes sounds from many different genres.  You can almost feel him channeling Cash and Ray Charles in a few songs.    Overall, the guy could sing the phone book and I would melt.  Lucky for me, he actually sings good songs.  I say buy it.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|... when it just came out TODAY?  =/<br /><br />I'm afraid simple logic evades a few Amazon users.  We don't want your review of the movies.  Most of us have seen them.

I haven't watched them yet.\\"<br /><br />&lt;/facepalm>  So because I THINK the blu-ray versions of these movies will be great, I'm giving it 5 stars.

0307269752|4.0|This is a page-turner with interesting characters and an intriguing central mystery, but Reg Keeland's English translation (first published in London) lurches from fluid and lyrical to awkward, and could use some editing for American readers. The lingering British spelling of judgment as \\"judgement\\" is particularly annoying.<br /><br />It is a shame that Stieg Larsson died young. He showed great promise as a mystery writer, especially in those sections of the book where he draws upon his experience in magazine publishing.<br /><br />Readers have had more than enough of sadistic violence in mysteries, particularly against women and animals, and I feel confident that had Larsson lived he would have outgrown this kind of shock appeal. One villain in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, when his crimes are exposed, tells the principal researcher that he enjoys stalking and capturing his victims far more than their inevitable rape, torture, and murder.
B0013ND30M|5.0|This is a new release of a Disney classic that first appeared in 1959. As is my custom, I much prefer to watch an animated feature film with several of my younger grandchildren (ages 3-7) and did so again with Sleeping Beauty on its 50th anniversary.  Once again, they were engrossed in the story line whereas I was somewhat more interested in how the quality of animation measures up (after 59 years) when compared and contrasted with recent films such as Toy Story and Toy Story 2, the three Shreks, Ratatouille, Cars, and Wall-E. It measures up remarkably well. Just as there is a certain charm in black-and-white classic films from the 1930's and 40's (e.g. Casablanca, The Little Shop Around the Corner, and It Happened One Night), the same is true of older Disney features (e.g. Dumbo, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and Pinocchio) despite relatively less sophisticated animation.<br /><br />There were also generational differences when my companions and I examined the special features that include \\"Sleeping Beauty Castle Walkthrough (a fully immersive virtual tour), an all-new \\"Enchanted Dance Game,\\" the \\"Dragon Encounter Audio Sensory Experience,\\" and an all-new \\"Making of Sleeping beauty.\\" Predictably, my grandchildren much preferred the supplementary games whereas I was (as always) intrigued by the \\"behind the screen\\" material such as a discussion of the film by John Lasseter of Pixar, the film critic Leonard Maltin, and the Disney animator Andreas Deja. The production values in this new edition are superb, especially in the Blu-ray version.  The running time of 75 minutes seems just about right. Whatever the ages of those who see this film and one or more of its numerous special features, they will find much to enjoy and appreciate.<br /><br />The story line is strikingly similar to the one in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  A daughter named Aurora is born to royal parents and then cursed to die by her 16th birthday by an evil fairy, Malificent. To protect her, three good fairies take her away, re-name her Briar Rose, and raise her themselves. A handsome prince meets her by chance, they fall in love, and agree to meet again soon. However, on the night of her 16th birthday, as she prepares to return to her parents and be crowned a princess, the evil fairy locates her and then.... Fortunately, everything eventually works out for Aurora as it also does for Snow White, Belle, and other Disney heroines.<br /><br />I highly recommend this 50th anniversary celebration of one of Disney's most delightful animated films. Although it was under-appreciated when first released, I think it will now receive the praise it so clearly deserves.  Bravo!ries take her away, re-name her Briar Rose, and raise her themselves.

Jodi Picolt has taken a very difficult topic. You couldn't help but struggle with the family. What is right and what is wrong? What is moral?<br /><br />Although the story is pretty good, the book is also disappointing in a few aspects. Firstly, the six different narrators have almost the same voice. The way they talk is not much different. Secondly, although there is some interesting twist towards the end of the book, the ending is too neat and easy and a bit of a cliche, making it more or less predicable.<br /><br />Overall, I am still recommending it as it provocks one's thoughts on controversial issues we are facing in this modern society.<br /><br />Lucy Chen

B00005OWEG|5.0|Whether or not Apocalypse Now accurately characterizes Vietnam is beyond me, and I concede my ignorance out of respect and admiration for the men and women who sacrificed their real lives and real limbs in Vietnam --I judge only the cinematic merits of this great film.<br /><br />The film opens in a small greasy hotel room in Saigon. Counterintelligence operative Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has trouble readjusting to civilian life. His room is helter-skelter. He drowns himself with alcohol and drugs. Sometimes he'll lie on his back and gaze at the ceiling; the revolving blades of the ceiling-fan remind him of helicopter propellers.  One day, two uniformed men show up at his room; they take him to Nha Trang. There, Com Sec Intelligence briefs Captain Willard. Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), Operations Officer 5th Special Forces, is wanted for murder. In 1964, Kurtz returned from Vietnam a changed man and wrote a report on what he saw in Vietnam; his report--addressed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Lyndon B. Johnson--was restricted. At 38 years of age, Kurtz made three requests to airborne training in Fort Benning, Georgia and was finally accepted. He joined Special Forces in 1966 and returned to Vietnam. Shortly after joining the Special Forces, Colonel Kurtz became unstable in his ideas and methods. He crossed into Cambodia where he lords over a tribe of natives who worship him like a god; Kurtz crossed into Cambodia to avoid arrest after he executed some Vietnamese Intelligence agents whom he believed were double agents. Captain Willard is to proceed up the Nung River in a Navy patrol boat, to pick up Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba, and to follow Kurtz's path. Upon finding Kurtz, Captain Willard is to infiltrate Kurtz's army and to terminate Kurtz with extreme prejudice.<br /><br />Captain Willard has killed many men, but this is the first time that he is ordered to kill an American soldier.<br />He looks over Kurtz's dossier: top of his class, Korea, Airborne; almost 1,000 decorations; third generation graduate of West Point; Master's degree, Harvard University--there, Kurtz wrote a thesis on American foreign policy in Southeast Asia.<br /><br />From Nha Trang, a helicopter transports Captain Willard to his patrol boat. Chef, a machinist and saucier from New Orleans; Lance, a gunners-mate and surfer from south Los Angeles; Clean, a gunners-mate and 17 year old African American male from the South Bronx; and Phillips, the chief and captain of the patrol boat--these men accompany Willard on his journey up the Nung River.<br /><br />Willard and his crew rendezvous with Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a gung-ho war-tested officer. Kilgore's 9th Air Cavalry escorts Willard to Vinh Kinh Drap, a heavily fortified village controlled by Viet Cong peasants. Vinh Kinh Drap sits at the mouth of the Nung River<br /><br />Six foot swells roll into Vinh Kinh Drap; likewise, the Air Cavalry thunders over Vinh Kinh Drap. Armies of screaming Bell UH-1D Huey's fan out of the rising sun. Bombs and bullets rain out of the sky; on the ground, 50-caliber machine-guns bristle out of trees and huts. The surging battle cry -- Ride of the Valkyries--gains momentum. The village of Vinh Kinh Drap washes into a splintered soup of trees, huts, and human corpses. A quartet of low-flying jets rushes by spraying napalm; underneath those jets, liquid flames devour a swath of trees and brush. Officer Kilgore admires the distant fires. He closes his eyes and swells his bare chest. \\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\\" he crows.<br /><br />Kilgore and 9th Air Cavalry gives Willard's boat to the Nung River. The Nung River presents a bristling throat of trees, brush, and hidden dangers. As the patrol boat moves up the Nung River, Willard walks in Kurtz's shoes and sees what Kurtz saw.<br /><br />A small sampan drifts towards Willard's boat. Willard and his crew detain the sampan. Food--mangos, fish, rice, etc.--and livestock--a couple of goats and some chickens--pack the hold of the ramshackle boat. Peasant farmers--several men and a young woman--occupy the small boat. Whether they are Viet Cong is less obvious to Willard and his cautious group. Phillips, the captain of the patrol boat, orders Chef to search the boat. Crates shatter and vegetables fly about; the peasants helplessly watch as Chef ransacks their boat. The animals on the boat become anxious. Chef and Phillips quarrel over the din of noisy animals. Everyone's nerves--the peasants, Willard and his men on the patrol boat--are taut. Clean and Lance machine-gun the boat. Rattling bullets jumble peasants, livestock, fruits, and vegetables into an oozing salad. Phillips and his men find nothing on the peasant's boat; however, this incident tells Willard more about Kurtz.<br /><br />Nung River slowly pulls Willard's boat to Do Lung Bridge, the last army outpost. Strands of light-bulbs sag off of the broken bridge. The river vibrates around the patrol boat. Shooting flares tangle the night sky overhead. Gunshots and bombs reverberate. Bunkers dot the outpost. Soldiers spray wild bullets into the darkness; the darkness retaliates. Willard stumbles upon a bunker called Beverly Hills. He asks the soldiers for their commander; they don't have a commander. Willard and his men abandon the outpost and proceed down the Nung River. This incident tells Willard more about Kurtz.<br /><br />The men on the patrol boat receive their mail. In a one-page letter, Com Sec Intelligence adds another wrinkle to Willard's mission. Several months ago, a man was ordered on a mission that was identical to Willard's mission. Com Sec Intelligence believes that Captain Richard Colby is operating with Colonel Kurtz. As Willard reads this letter, the other men on the boat are festive and rowdy. The surfer, Lance, celebrates by lighting a flare and waving its purple haze around the boat. On top of this error, it's also broad daylight. The 17-year-old boy named Clean is on the back of the boat quietly reading a letter his mother sent him from home. The purple haze billowing out of the boat informs the enemy. Gunshots attack the boat. Gunsmoke and purple haze clog the narrow river way. Phillips races the patrol boat up the river and out of danger. Out of the danger and out of the smoke, the boat is riddled with holes. Clean is sprawled at the back of the boat. He's dead. This incident tells Willard more about Kurtz.<br /><br />As a film, Coppola's Apocalypse Now has the same flavor as Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. In both films, external forces cause men to evolve. In Apocalypse Now, the Vietnam war changes the heart of Kurtz; in 2001: A Space Odyssey, the sudden appearance of a planed monolith inspires primitive apes to evolve into modern man. Screenwriter John Milius adapted Apocalypse Now from Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness. Apocalypse Now became notorious for its myriad production difficulties involving its soaring budget and its troubled cast. Coppola shot the film in the Philippines during the monsoon season; subsequently, a typhoon destroyed many of the film's sets. Coppola used the profits from his Godfather films to rebuild sets destroyed by the typhoon. Actor Martin Sheen, who played Captain Willard, was an alcoholic and suffered a near fatal heart attack during the film. Also, actor Marlon Brando, who played Colonel Kurtz, showed up on the set overweight. Coppola suffered from severe depression and with marital problems resulting from the stresses of filming the movie. He threatened to commit suicide on three separate occasions. Thankfully, he persevered and finished his movie. The `70's was a freakish decade for Copolla. In one decade, he made three films that are among the best films ever made. Has any director had a decade as successful as Copolla had in the `70's? Apocalypse Now is one of the great films of the last century.

[Was it this primitive in 1902?] Daniel Plainview does his own drilling, he is not dependent on contractors. He offers to work for others who have lands. A young man comes to Plainview with an offer. They settle a deal with cash and a handshake. The Sunday ranch is hardscrabble. [The film is slow paced.] They hunt quail and find surface oil. Plainview buys the ranch and seeks other lands in the area. Finding oil will make the community flourish.    Eli Sunday preaches to cure the sick. [Was this a comment on current culture? The references to drinking suggest Prohibition.] They strike a gusher. Young H.W. is hurt. The oil well catches fire. Dynamite extinguishes the fire. H.W. has lost his hearing. Plainview attacks Eli Sunday when Eli asks for his money. Then Eli disrespects his father! Henry Plainview, his long-lost stepbrother, arrives; he has had bad luck. We learn something about the family. There is a new problem of a fire in the house. H.W. will be taken for a train ride. Some men want to buy out Plainview, and Plainview wants to buy out the lone holdout. He makes a deal with Union Oil. [The film is slow-paced.] There is a surprise involving the stepbrother! Is the surprise believable? Symbolism?    William Bandy wants Plainview to be baptized and join his church to repent his sins and be saved. He has abandoned his child! [Is the church scene too emotional? What is the point?] Now the oil pipeline can go through to deliver low-cost energy to the people. [The film is slow-paced.] Do Plainview's actions suggest he is going insane? Now its 1927. Plainview has a mansion and a radio. H.W. is grown up, and decides to become independent. Will H.W. become a competitor? Does the conversation make sense? Is it a crazy ending? Was the ending a joke on the viewer? The bad ending to a bad movie? Was this the sickest film you've ever seen this year?  [This film was supposed to be based on Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel \\"Oil\\". Sinclair's novel must have been much better than this film.]
B0000028M7|5.0|From the beginning of \\"Them Bones\\" where Staley screams out over a pounding riff it is clear to see why this is a classic.  Then the chorus comes and the melody works perfectly against the guitar work, and I end up wishing the band was still around.    \\"Dam That River\\" shows why they were the most metal of the Seattle bands,  but the next classic is \\"Down In A Hole\\", again sinking down into the dirt until it turns quicksand and starts to float.  If you haven't heard \\"Rooster\\" the song is epic.  Some songs afterward are alright, \\"Iron Man\\" is nothing great, but it is clear why Godsmack would name themselves after the song with the same name.      The other two best tracks are \\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Would\\".  \\"Angry Chair\\" agains sinks even further down in the dirt than \\"Down In A Hole\\", while \\"Would\\" is easily the best song on here, especially the very end.    This album is not a happy one, instead it is infused with depression, frustration, and self disgust.  But it transcends in a way that Bush (Who I used to like) or Seven Mary Three never did.  Instead this album is on the same level of early 90s greatness as Nevermind and Superunknown.
B0013ND30W|5.0|\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is Disney's master piece.  No other animated film has utilized the talents of the best dancers, costume markers, musicians, animators, painters, designers, and singers to bring about such a harmonious clear vision as in \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\"  Artistically it is one of the most beautiful films you will ever watch.    The Blu-ray and/or the DVD of the restored version are well worth purchasing even if you already own an older version of the film.  Comparing it to the special edition DVD, the film grain has been eliminated which gives the characters a nice clean flat look.    The colors  are a lot brighter, brighter than they've ever been before.  However, I'm not 100% convinced that it enhances every scene.  Most of the scenes look wonderful with these bright vivid colors, but there's a few scenes which I feel might have looked better, having a more sophisticated color composition with those subdued tones you get from watching the Special edition.  But the thing is, I don't know how true these enhanced bright colors are to the original color compositions intended by the artists so I suppose it all boils down to a matter of taste.  Thanks to the Blu-ray you can see in the backgrounds a much higher level of detail and depth of color which is quiet striking.    No matter what version of the film you get your hands on, \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is a must watch and this new restoration has done a wonderful job of eliminating film grain, brightening up colors, and the fact that aspect ratio allows even more of the artwork to be scene is a wonderful breath-taking improvement.

Not too many Americans realize that Guernsey was occupied for almost five years by the Germans and the only outside news they had wwere lies being told them by the occupation as all radios were confiscated , newspapers etc.<br />That generation of Brits were magnificent .<br />Perhaps it will have more people look into non fiction books about that time and place .

But, I felt like it was mainly a rehashing of parts of Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and I think Covey said it better himself. I would advise checking your public library first if you're interested in the book, just so as to avoid possibly spending money you will regret.

In that review, I'd dwelt heavily on the \\"gorgeous arrangements, most of them by the great Johnny Mandel\\" (plus a few beautiful orchestrations by Johnny's brilliant prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Jorge Calandrelli).  The lady stated that, when she \\"read your review, over the phone to Johnny,\\" he asked her with genuine humility, \\"Can you hear me blushing over the phone?\\"]<br /><br />This, by way of noting that the arranger of the full-stringed orchestra for my favorite track here, \\"ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU,\\" is not listed --in otherwise accurate liner notes (and none of the string players is listed either!) I'm guessing the arranger is Johnny Mandel himself, (or else Jorge Calandrelli). Did I mention that this, my favorite track, includes a 25 second solo by the greatest-ever jazz harmonica player, Toots Thielemans? Breathtakingly beautiful!<br /><br />While this review is for the CD alone, it should be noted that the \\"CD/DVD\\" (2-disc) package includes a five-part \\"video version\\" on \\"The Making of a Swingin' Christmas.\\" For only an additional six dollars, it's the better bet (I say) for Christmas giving!<br /><br />[NOTE: Jazz musicians know about \\"Monty Alexander\\" -- others may not.

Apart from one desultory chapter in the early going, Sanderson's book is a page-turner that'll blow you away with action, razor-sharp pacing, and revelations that there's no way you will have seen coming. Sanderson connects all the dots by the end, and leaves nothing unanswered. It was a pleasure to read a trilogy that in no way is going to keep going.<br /><br />At least I hope it doesn't keep going. The ending was terrific, and one more chapter would have ruined the series.

There is something interesting happening in every chapter. I have been completely hooked.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|A film that moves briskly, but carries the viewer along nicely.  It is entertaining and features a realistic portrayal of characters struggling with lives that are slightly derailed.  The film--similar to the film Passion Fish--avoids becoming maudlin or manipulative and manages to surprise the viewer once or twice.    Highly recommended.
B001DHXT2A|5.0|The Incredible Hulk may not be the darkest comic-to-big screen adaptation yet, but it may be the best mixture. It's a true psychodrama that touches on the depth of the human psyche but still delivers great comic book type action. It's everything that the 2003 version wasn't but should have been. It gives us a human element to which most anyone should be able to relate and manages to convey the Hulk as a hero and Banner as a truly tortured soul. Believable choices delivered by an exceptional cast. The large action spectacles make this film but the small character touches elevate it. I also love the homage to Lou Ferrigno and Bill Bixby's TV Hulk, not just the cameos but the man on the run tone. The action was as good as advertised and the CG worked better then I had hoped. These strengths make it more than your average wham-bam action flick and make Incredible Hulk one remarkable movie.

Many books can say the same, but without good prose, no such book is worth reading.  After all, once we were told what a neuroanatomist is, the \\"brain scientist\\" thing was insulting.  There are many better recovery books.  Here the concept was good; the execution was not.
B0017MO10U|4.0|Slow at times, but overall an excellent and fun addition to the Stargate story. Over the years I've thoroughly enjoyed any episode that deals with using the gate for other purposes than just \\"going off-world\\" - intentionally or unintentionally. The way this story happened - as a result of Ba'al trying to manipulate an entire galaxy just to save himself from being destroyed (how self-absorbed the Goau'ld can be) - seemed very in-line with the Stargate universe and a natural adventure SG-1 would have.<br /><br />I like the treat at the end with the picture in the locker.<br /><br />From a strictly \\"Amazon.com purchaser\\" perspective, I pre-ordered the item and it arrived within 24-hours, even with 2-day shipping. Package was whole and unspoiled (no shipping mishaps) when it was delivered.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|We had seen this movie in the theater four months earlier and were delighted to get it on DVD.  It also has an option to download the full movie without any extras online to be played on an Ipod.   I downloaded it and it works fine.  The movie has a few minutes added to it from the original and we were happy with that.  I hope that there will be more in the future as this movie plus the television show have gotten both my wife and I addicted to the personalities and the clever way the show presents relationships. Buy it.

0736063684|5.0|I have a huge collection of books, many on strength training and fitness, this is the one I refer to most frequently.   This book is only about muscle anatomy as relates to strength training. As such it really helps you to focus your energy to where you need it. and I add that I think the book is helpful in preventing many injuries.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I am a Cold Play fan... I think I own all the US released disks; not including imports.  Their musical style is a blend of The Police/Sting & U2... two other groups I appreciate.  I like all the tracks on Viva La Vida.    There are 9 songs with an average run time close to 4 min & 20 sec.  Most tracks are mid to up tempo.  But with a total play time under 40 min, the disc seems to fly by and I'm always left wanting more.  That's part complaint & part warning, but at the same time, the high quality makes up for low quantity.  If the teaser tracks appeal to you, buy this disk with confidence.  Cheers!
0143038419|2.0|... cause it was just plain naive! I don't want to give it 1 star because parts of it at least made me interested. But overall (until I stoped reading it)this book really didn't do it for me. I think first of all it was too spiritual to suit me and secondly I got really annoyed with the selfishness of Gilbert. I blame myself for the second part though - I should have realized that reading some other reviews and given the fact that the book is about one woman's life crisis. However I just found it bland and annoying. The part in Italy was ok (I think that this is because I have lived in Rome myself before) but it is the India part that made me give this book away. So many people recommended this book to me and I would too... if the person in question is really spiritual, to me it just got wierd.
0385340990|5.0|I was on my way home from San Diego last month and saw this book in the airport book store.  Based on the review and summary on the jacket cover, I decided to take a chance and I am so happy I did.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It was a very quick read and perfect for the airplane.  I learned parts about WWII that I didn't know before.  I also enjoyed the writing style - a series of letters.<br /><br />I immediately passed this book on to my mom, who loved it as well.  And she bought the book for her sisters, who have read and loved the book.  I wish there were more books like this!  I can't believe how lucky I was to stumble on this book by chance.  I highly recommend it.
1400064287|5.0|I admit I work in an industry that loves simplicity, concrete messaging, stories, and recall: advertising.  Yet it is rare to see an agency practice on itself what it does so well for its clients.      The truth is that ideas are hard and communicating ideas is even harder.  Even for professionals!      Made To Stick manages to combine the \\"why\\" with the \\"how\\" of successful communications.  Like their column in Fast Company, the Heath's Duct Tape Book successfully communicates ideas.  Lots of them.    A great business read, with real value for communicators, Made to Stick is a must read for agency/ideas people and a top 5 business book recommendation for all of my colleagues and partners.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|Although a musical, Cabaret is not silly or awkward as all but one of the songs takes place on the stage of the Cabaret, and the one exception is performed at a political rally (of sorts). Songs and story alike are brutally realistic as the facade of morality is stripped away to reveal how people really act when their needs are not being met. But this is not a gloomy movie. Rather, it is entertaining - and overtly seductive, being directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse, the master of sexual choreography.
0321344758|3.0|Well.. The book is awesome. Some stuff (which i didn't care too much until now) was new to me, some other stuff wasn't too strange for me. From this point of view, the book have 10 stars from me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some pages of the books just fly out from the book (unglued) which made a very VERY bad impression to me. And yes, i take care of all of my books and how do i read them ;) From this point of view, the book have 1star (even though, is too much :P )<br /><br />Anyhow, if you want to learn some new stuff about usability and usability testing, go ahead and buy this book. It's great if you concern about this aspect of your sites. Is not too long so you can read on a long LONG road (like i did).

B00005JPO1|4.0|It's been 19 years, as the press is fond of reminding us, since we saw Indiana Jones ride off into the sunset at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Now after nearly two decades in what we shall call Indiana Jones and Development Hell, the man in the fedora is back in action!    And it is good.    Very good.    Not great, though. But it is better than Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, though not quite as good as the aforementioned Last Crusade. It comes close, though.    You know the plot by now. Indiana Jones goes looking for a McGuffin, while eluding the bad-guys. A simple formual that can work very, very well indeed. It worked so well with Raiders of the Lost Ark that Roger Ebert considers it one of the Great Movies.    As for how well it really works in this movie? Well, there wasn't anything about it I specifically disliked. Shia LeBeoff does a good job of playing a rebel without a pause. It was nice to see Karen Allen again. Jim Broadbent was good, but along with Ray Winstone, his appearance was completely unneeded, though in the case of Winstone it was interesting seeing him after seeing Beowulf. Removing his character and Broadbent's wouldn't have changed the movie in any fundamental way, though it might've streamlined things.    Basically the only real gripe I guess I have can be summed up like this: It seemed like they were trying to hard. Like Lucas and Spielberg were saying, \\"Look! We can still make a movie that's good and popular! LOOK, DAMN YOU!\\" As a result, just about everything seemed to be set to eleven. This sometimes took the form of silly things, like someone surviving a nuke by a: hiding in a fridge, and b: being hurled miles away and not dying on impact.    There's also the fact that there didn't seem to be any real stakes in this movie. With Raiders and Crusade you had clearly defined objects. You knew what they were and what they'd do. You knew why it would be bad if the Nazis got a hold of them. That just didn't seem to be the case here. The franchise seems to work best when looking for holy artifacts. Maybe next time we can have Indiana Jones and the Spear of Longinus?    Despite this, it made for a good movie and I was pleased to see Harrison Ford up there doing what he does best. I'm hopeful there will be another movie, and I have great confidence that it will be even better than this one!
0446607274|5.0|There is a double killing in a tram car at Angels Flight.  The list of suspects is long, but it becomes a complicated case when Harry Bosch and his team are assigned to the investigation.  A coverup of past deeds leads to more coverups.  People in power don't want clay feet exposed.<br /><br />The case is filled with racial overtones, and is lighting a fuse that could set LA on fire.  The Chief wants a quick resolution that will put a lid on things, even if it's not the right solution.  Harry wants guilty parties punished, but sometimes the guilt is about things he had not expected, and sometimes the punishment takes unusual forms as the case takes on a life of its own.<br /><br />Overall, an interesting case with some unexpected twists and turns.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Christopher Nolan has somehow found a way to trump his previous success with Batman Begins and remakes the super-hero genre in the process, changing it from a simple battle between men in tights to something deeper, darker, and oh so much more interesting, which is saying quite a bit, because Batman Begins was an excellent film.    The plot of The Dark Knight, one of the best-reviewed films of the decade, centers around the Joker, and his various games. Throughout he puts Batman and the rest of Gotham through a series of moral quandries and situations to test their ethics (and not incidentally provide some amusement for himself). Along the way, major characters die and one is horribly scarred.    This film is unlike any previous super-hero movie. While things like Batman Begins, Superman, Superman II, Spider-Man 2, X-Men 2 and this summer's other great super-hero film, Iron Man (movies which are generally regarded by many, including myself, as being the best super-hero films to date), were excellent super-hero films, none of them have been exceptional artistic achievements.    This film is. It tears apart the conventions of the super-hero world and peers, darkly, into our own world, showing a post-9/11 super-hero enviroment unlike any we've seen before. It's a world with a terrorist dressed in clown makeup, where the savior of the city is a man in a mask who monitors everyone's cell phone calls, and where even the whitest of knights can have the steepest of falls.    There are serious layers to this movie, and a depth absent in most films, let alone \\"genre\\" pieces like this one. The film has received favorable comparisons to crime dramas like Heat, and LA Confidential, and though I've only seen the latter of the two, I can say that yes, it holds up favorably.    Are there any real flaws to this movie? Some have criticized its 2 1/2 hour run time. I had no problem with that. Some thought Aaron Eckhart didn't make for a very convincing Harvey Dent. I mostly disagree there, though I would've liked to have seen more hints at a darker side. Though the only real complaint I have does center around his character in that I really wish his eventual fate would've been a little different.    On a different note, all the praise you've heard for Heath Legder's performance is not exaggerated. Here's a man who has created a character every bit as memorable and twisted as Hannibal Lecter, but while Lecter at least had some rules, this fellow has none. You'll laugh at some of what he does, but a lot of that will be nervous laughter. If he doesn't get the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor next year, something is seriously wrong with the system. He deserves it completely. In fact, don't be surprised to see the film be nominated for Best Picture. It won't win, but it should, and probably will be, nominated.    One final note, do NOT take your children to this movie. Not if they're younger than ten or so. This is an adult film with adult themes to it. The Joker alone is likely to give kids nightmares, as is what becomes of Harvey Dent. How the film escaped an R-rating, I'll never know, except that the MPAA is less likely to give one for violence than they are for sex. If there'd been some tits in this movie, now, that might've been a different story!    So not for kids, but for everyone else? Go see this movie. Even if you don't like super-hero movies. See it.
0930289234|4.0|The reviews on back cover claim Watchmen legitimized the graphic novel as a form of literature, that couldn't be more accurate. Moore blends naturalism, a dark depiction of the human condition with multiple perspectives and multi-faceted personalities. He breaks down the stereotypical hero and twists the Watchmen into beings who have accomplished a great deal but also have tremendous faults. Not mention,  on top of Moore's writing, Gibbons contributes the perfect illustrations to compliment the text in variety of styles.
B001E75QGG|2.0|Check other reviews for plot synopsis - I thought it was weak from top to bottom and no where near as good as the other three. I don't want to spoil the finale, so suffice it to say - I hated the ending. Absolutely hated it.     As far as the Blu Ray is concerned, I automatically have to knock off 2 points just for being on more than one disc. The content is great, but beyond the first time through the extras, I'll never look at the second disc again. As far as the movie goes the sound and picture quality are phenominal. The effects shots - of which there are too many do look amazing. The sound mix is also perfect. The movie favors the grainy look that Spielberg is in love with for his big action movies, so this may not be the perfect disc to show off your system too, but it still delivers a better quality experience across the board than most new releases on Blu Ray.
B001E1DJD4|4.0|If it takes another 4 years for Rachael Yamagata to make another album, I will be ok with it. After listening to this album, I can agree with the reviewer who gave the album one star regarding the tempos. But, in the context of the album, putting a song like \\"1963\\" or \\"I Want You\\" from Happenstance wouldn't fit the mood. This album is a much more complete album vs Happenstance. Her first album has great pop tunes with some deep tracks. But, Elephants...Teeth Sinking into Heart is all deep. The album will emotionally drain you if you let it. It's lush orchestrations, arrangements and beautiful melodies counter the dark, melancholy tone of the lyrics. If Happenstance was about the excitement love has to offer, Elephants...Teeth Sinking into Heart is about the pain love has to offer. This is a Radiohead (Exit (Music for a Film)/Let Down) meets Jeff Buckley (Forget Her/Lover, You Should've Come Over). While most artists write about love and pain and convey to the listener in a memorable melody, Rachael Yamagata makes you feel her pain - whether she's whispering or screaming. Most artists never conquer that kind of connection. Jeff Buckley did and so has Rachael Yamagata with Elephants....Teeth Sinking into Heart.

B0013FBS20|4.0|Just about any movie with Will Smith is good, if not great. He is one of the best actors at this time and just seams to add a lot to the movie. The bonus features of the Blu-Ray are nice. I wish that I had not watched the alternate ending. It is just to weird. The theatrical ending makes him into more of a \\"legend\\".
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. simply owns this film. He makes the whole gamut work - snide capitalist pig, sentimental son, vengeful menace and hero.

Well worth the time spent.
B00004TWZF|4.0|Big Blue is a joy to watch. The scenery, on land or in the sea is beautiful. The acting is very good. The movie is humorous and mellow. There is a spiritual theme that unfolds towards the end of the movie, but I will not be specific lest I spoil it for others to uncover.

B00009ATIX|4.0|\\"Solaris\\" is a very good adaptation of the famous Stanislaw Lem novel by the always interesting Steven Soderbergh. The film, while falling into the conventional genre of science fiction, is really more about human interactions and emotions: in other words, it's really a love story. Soderbergh is a very creative man, and I appreciated his approach to the subject matter: technology is ever-present in the film, but is never actually the subject of the film.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Dr. Chris Kelvin, a psychiatrist who is haunted by the death of Rheya, the one true love of his life. He is sent to a space station circling a planet-like object named Solaris to investigate strange happenings on the station and if possible to rescue the crew. What he finds are the remnants of a crew who are having severe emotional problems, and he soon discovers that the reason is the apparition of relatives and loved ones who are in some cases (like Rheya's) deceased and the accompanying mental and psychological duress these beings put the cast through. It is sometimes difficult to tell what is real and what is not, though subtle cues exist for the acutely aware, most notably the changes of color balance in the film between earth and the station and past and present. The film explores the nature of love and human relationships, and it is important to view Solaris as a character in the film, rather than a planet (it actually isn't a planet, it's a planet-like object with intelligence, as explained by James Cameron): Solaris is the antagonist, in essence. The course of the film skillfully takes the audience through the entire gamut of human emotions, but requires rapt attention to understand what's going on, particularly toward the end of the film.<br /><br />The cast did a fabulous job in the film: this is definitely the best acting I have ever seen Clooney do, but it is the supporting cast members who were most brilliant. Natascha McElhone as Rheya had the most difficult of the roles in the film requiring enormous emotional changes in exquisitely subtle increments. Jeremy Davies as demented crewman Snow likewise had a challenging role (particularly in the climactic scene) and gave a top-rate performance. The performance that was, to me, the most amazing was Viola Davis as Gordon, a crewmember whose role in the drama is unclear at first, but is revealed layer by emotional layer. Davis is simply amazing, and her performance alone is a more than valid reason for watching the film.<br /><br />The DVD features many extras including two behind the scenes features which are excellent. The interviews with the actors and crew are very insightful, and Soderbergh in particular is very enlightening. I recommend this film to people who want emotionally intense, cerebral science fiction. It is sometimes slow moving, but always intriguing.equiring enormous emotional changes in exquisitely subtle increments.

B001E95ZNI|5.0|I really loved this film. It was a pleasure to see it on the big screen. Ed Harris has such a great scope when it comes to his films, directing with an expansive feeling... Like any great work of art, you can't leave his films without being touched.    I loved Appaloosa. From the simple, honest relationship of the two \\"hired guns\\" (played with such comfortable ease by Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen) to the complex love interest of Renee Zellweger's Ms. French... I just wanted to figure this puzzle out. How could Ed's character Cole really stand by such a coyote as Ms. French, even after she tries to seduce his best friend? And yet... love is love. There's a great scene where the camera focuses on Ms. Zellweger at the piano, and you can see her conflict, a wild creature in a corset who can't help herself, who can't help but betray those closest to her heart. There's fear and desperation and longing. It's a remarkable moment. And Ed and Viggo are just as delicious in their roles, fitting each other like a pair of comfortable shoes.    The supporting characters are just as wonderful, from the \\"society gentlemen,\\" eager to rid the town of evil when it suits them, to Jeremy Irons' opportunistic villain, to the other hired guns who were once friends of our heroes but have a face-off nonetheless. It's definitely a comment on that notion of a \\"dog eat dog world.\\" And yet, the real and true love story of friendship against all odds and men who don't see the point of lying, was a lovely theme as well.    This film was so epic and beautiful... it made me want to read the book!
B001AX9DT0|3.0|Sure, he's expanded his sound a bit on some of these songs, but I find the album as a whole really flat and sort of forgettable.  There are a few stand-outs such as the single, You Are the Best Thing, the soulful Let It Be Me, and the back-country porch rocker Hey Me, Hey Mama.  Other than those, everything seems to kind of blend together into a whispery mush.      I've heard a lot of Ray's live and rare material that hasn't been included on any of his studio albums and it just leaves me wondering, \\"Why?\\"  A lot of it is better than anything Gossip In The Grain.  Dig 'em out, shine 'em up, and record 'em, Ray.  No more gimmicky songs about talentless female drummers please.
B0000024K1|5.0|This album is simply beyond amazing.  This is coming from someone who's not a huge hip-hop fan, or at least wasn't before I knew it could be this good.  I have no clue how ANYONE could possibly give this less than five stars.  It's easily the best hip-hop album of all time, if not the best album, period.  The beats are funky, the lyrics amazing, and the rapping incredible.  I can't say enough about the quality of this album.  EVERYONE owes it to themselves to own this album.  It's an all-time, mind-blowing classic.
B00005JNX0|2.0|Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) is having a midlife crisis.  He's tired of life in the Central Park Zoo and wants to see what life is like in the wild.  When he escapes, his three friends try to chase him down and bring him back.  And while Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) do catch up with him, it doesn't turn out quite as planned.  Instead, all four of them find themselves headed to Africa.  Will they survive when they get there?<br /><br />I normally steer clear of Dreamworks Animation movies because I find them pale imitations of the Disney Pixar films they are attempting to rip off.  But the previews for the sequel looked so entertaining, I had to give this one a try.  I should have stayed away.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few amusing moments.  I laughed at several of the movie spoofs.  But that was about it.  The story was boring.  The characters had so much potential.  Instead, they went with the easy joke (read bathroom humor) and didn't play out the jokes the premise could have set up.  As many have said, the group of commando penguins are the funniest things in the film, but they don't have nearly enough screen time to make much difference.<br /><br />Then there's the issue of voice casting.  Yes, most of the cast did fine.  But I couldn't get Ross from Friends out of my head whenever Melman had a line.  Trust me, that was very distracting.<br /><br />Many have dismissed Disney's [[ASIN:B000G75AZC The Wild]] as a rip off of this film.  That's a shame because, for my money, it is the far superior film.  Stay away from this one and get a copy of that film.  Instead of staring at the TV screen, you'll be laughing from start to finish.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|Historically and Entertaining!  A great treat after a long study--Not being one who is especially fond of history...before my study of Henry VIII for a Church History class, I knew very little of the Boleyns.  Since I am a visual learner, I looked for a movie to see if I had a grip on the information. The librarian suggested this movie/book ---This was great for me; reference material that I had read - it even cleared up, or at least prompted me to do a bit more research on several areas.  A great way to be gain historical knowledge and be entertained at the same time...Enjoy :)!
B001G60FSY|5.0|There are almost one thousand reviews for this book, most are positive, do I need to submit one?  Yes.<br /><br />The author discusses split-second thinking, or \\"in the blink of an eye\\" speed of thought.  He postulates that those rapid decisions are usually better.  He backs it up with many examples of decisions made with more time, more information, and more discussion that turned out wrong, when the initial decision was actually the correct one.  How does this happen?<br /><br />The subconscious mind processes many inputs and helps to steer our decisions.  It is usually right and we need to trust it more often.  I trade financial products and I have found that too much information does not give me a clearer picture of what is going to happen, especially in the short to very short term future.  I don't know how many times each week while looking at the market, I get this flash of go long, or go short.  I have started tracking these thoughts and they are correct almost 90% of the time.  How is that possible?  I don't know, but I assume my subconscious mind picks up small clues that my conscious mind misses, or needs more information to form an opinion.<br /><br />The whole process is very exciting and while I can't explain the details, I can verify the results.  Another book that delves deeper into the thought process and the subconscious decision-making process is [[ASIN:0060955414 Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind: How Intelligence Increases When You Think Less]] an excellent book, which I read a couple of years ago and I think I am ready to pull it off the shelf and give it a second read.

B001AGXEA6|4.0|Why oh why do studios stamp \\"Deluxe Edition\\" on movies and then provide nothing to make it worthy of that title??????  I absolutely LOVE the movie Beetlejuice, and just about anything else Tim Burton has done.  The Blu-ray version of this movie looks and sounds better than any version I've seen before.  The colors are sharp and the sound is greatly improved over other DVD iterations I have seen before.  The movie comes with a nice slipcover featuring the cover art in lenticular motion.  That's about the only really special feature you are going to get on this disc.  With it being the 20th Anniv. of this film, I thought that surely something would have been included about the making of the film, but there is NOTHING.  There is no commentary track, no making of doc., no interviews with the cast.......NOTHING.  Oh you do get 3 episodes of the Beetlejuice cartoon.....yaawwwwnn and the original theatrical trailer.  I'm not complaining too much, because I do love this movie, and it is worth the price just to see it in High Definition.  It just ticks me off a little when studios stamp the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" on the cover, when there is nothing Deluxe about it.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Colonel Robert Neville, also a doctor, is the last man alive in New York City.  He broadcasts daily on AM radio asking for people to meet up with him at what looks to be an old naval base by the water.  Neville and his German Shepherd Sam show up everyday looking for other survivors of the virus, named KV.  Once thought to be the cure for cancer, the engineered virus mutated and spread airborne, killing people and radically altering those who didn't die into zombie-like, mindless beings.<br /><br />Neville spends his days hunting deer, loose from the park or the zoo, and picking up supplies for his house.  His nights are spent inside his altered house, shuttered and barricaded against the beasts of the night.  Beneath the house is his lab, where he continues to work diligently on a cure for those infected monsters that prowl the streets at night, hungry for blood.  He sets traps to catch the zombies for test subjects using his serums.  At last, Neville believes he's found a serum that will work.<br /><br />During an excursion in town, Neville notices one of his store mannequins has been moved, and when he investigates he's caught in a trap and unconscious until nightfall.  Who moved the mannequin and who set the trap?  Is someone else still alive and uninfected?  Neville and Sam must make it back to the car before sundown, but the hour is late and the darkness is falling.  Something bad is about to happen.<br /><br />To those of you who've read the classic 1954 novella, 'I Am Legend', by Richard Matheson, the movie does not follow the book very well.  Other movies have been made from the novella, including the 1964 movie 'The Last Man On Earth' and 'The Omega Man' filmed in 1971 starring Charlton Heston. In this version, the infected are more like zombies than vampires, and more aggressive.  The film had been modernized (the incidents in the book take place in 1976) which is more attractive to today's audiences, and there's a lot more action involved.  The movie is more external (action) which is well suited for a film version than the book, which is more internal (introspective), but what I really didn't like was how they twisted the ideal of Neville's \\"legend\\" status.<br /><br />Will Smith does an excellent performance as Neville, and the atmosphere of a deserted New York City was captured quite nicely.  The zombies are pretty cool, though I don't know who dreamed up the hairless idea.  Sam the dog is added to the film (not in the book) but Sam stole the show for me.  (I love German Shepherds!)  If you're a Matheson fan and have enjoyed both novella and the other remakes of this story, then 'I Am Legend' is well worth the purchase.  Enjoy!hich is well suited for a film version than the book, which is more internal (introspective), but what I really didn't like was how they twisted the ideal of Neville's \\"legend\\" status.

B00006FR47|5.0|I went into Chicago V worried the album might not feature the same quality of songwriting that the first three Chicago albums had, along with the interesting brass arrangements, and spectacular vocal melodies.  Thankfully, Chicago V IS at the same level of quality as the first three albums, only problem is that the album is pretty short overall.  No more double albums of one amazing song after another- now there's just not as much as before.  Not a REALLY bad thing, since, after all, it's how GOOD the music is that matters, and the music really is fantastic.  You simply can't go wrong with 70's Chicago.  Back when the band wasn't afraid to experiment and write songs in an unpredictable way loaded with tasty brass, guitar, and drum tricks.  Great album.
B000002C25|5.0|I don't understand Noel's disdain for this record. Hell, it might be my FAVOURITE Oasis album of all (7) !! I bought the album on August 26, 1997 and it has been close at hand ever since. This is a pure, powerfully agressive masterpiece that I bet will get recieved better as the yrs go by. This record is about as subtle as a nuclear bomb. Raw aggression, yet still very listenable. Unlike the \\"hard rock\\" that is played on the radio these days, there is some quality to it. Sure, it's a bit overdone, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. To me, music serves as escapism, a mood changer of sorts and BHN completes that mission with flying colors. If you haven't listened to BHN in some time, try it again. If you have never heard BHN give it a try. THIS IS OASIS in it's purist, rawest form !!! BTW, I got to see them live on the BHN tour !!!!
B0010SEMP0|3.0|I had to laugh at the person who said this book had a realistic settting.  So how many people you know live in caves?  Work for a secret branch of the government?  Walk into bars into a secret back room to witness vampires sucking the life out of three people?  carry around silver knives strapped to their boots?  And really, come on?  Have you bothered to count HOW MANY knives they throw during a fight? It's absolutely absurd.  This book is like a corney Bond's movie.  Yet like the said famous corney movie, it does have a draw.  I read it because it was strange and I enjoyed for the same silly reason, but I would not considered this excellent writing.
0786838655|5.0|The Lightening Theif was recommended to us by a book store clerk.  We purchased the book at the beginning of the summer and it sat in our schoolroom for months.  One day my 13 year old son said \\"I want to read that lightening book we bought at the bookstore.\\"  He read the book in about 3 days and begged for the second.  The second book came from Amazon on a Friday afternoon and he finished it Saturday night!  Again, he was begging for more.  When the UPS truck arrived today he ran outside to get the package ripped it open and ran to his room to start reading.  It takes a lot to grab a 13 year old boys attention away from xbox, and wii or playing football and basketball outside but this book series has done it!!  Thank you Rick Riordan!    The following review is from my 13 year old son:  \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightening Theif is a great book!  I liked the book a lot!!  It just kept on going with exciting things and right when you think it is going to die down more exciting things happen.  It has a great story that is easy to follow after you get through the first two chapters.  It is about a boy named Percy Jackson who lives with his Mom and his Stepdad.  Percy gets kicked out of school and ends up going on a quest to find Zeus' master bolt which was stolen from Olympus.  The Olympians blame Percy for the theft so Percy has to clear his name, and find the theif.\\"
B000WGWQG8|4.0|HBO does a great job with their miniseries. John Adams was a little drier or slower than the Rome or Deadwood series but it was a good picture of how our US government began. Has it changed?     My ten year old granddaughter has studied John Adams in school but I think the miniseries is a little too graphic in places for her.
1433502410|4.0|Scandalous Sanity has received copies of the long awaited ESV Study Bible. We approached the newly formed ark of the covenant with consecrated hands, and revealed it's contents to the world.<br /><br />We discovered that the presence of God has been reboxed, BUT can now speak directly to you(just as he does John Piper, Tony Evans, Mark Driscoll and Joshua Harris) without the need to buy the aforementioned guys books or of mumbling pastors.<br /><br />Each copy comes with glare reducing cream for the brightness with which you will be gleaming, sunglasses for your family to be able to look at you after you delve into it(Moses looked like a firefly compared to the way you'll be glowing), and earplugs to tone down the volume of God's voice.<br /><br />Those who purchase the hardback and tru-tone leather copies will become known among their people(We have already ascended the hiearchy of our communities). But those who purchase the suffering baby calfskin manuscript will sit at the right hand of God (after Jesus, John Piper, J.I. Packer, Mark Driscoll, and Joshua Harris, but before the rest of the generations of people. It's guaranteed on the side of the box).<br /><br />We do warn you, the ESV is the closest to God you will ever get, even after you die(probably). Being in close proximity is dangerous. We recommend you proceed with caution.<br /><br />We give this Study Bible 2 stars for it's maps and detailed portraits of the temples and cities(Those things are awesome! It's like a world class architectural firm came up with them). Another star for the outstanding and sensational promotion of the Bible. A quarter star for the endorsement by the biggest and most theologically correct speakers/preachers of the day. A quarter star for the triangle on the front of the Bible. A quarter for the recently found truths that no one has unearthed before, and we've been missing all this time. And a final quarter star for the smooth feel of suffering baby calfskin.<br /><br />In all seriousness this Bible is pretty sweet.  The introductions to each book are a bit more detailed than the new NLT study bible, and the study notes are ridiculous in number and content.<br /><br />The only real problem we had with it was the article on \\"christian\\" ethics(The amount of articles in this thing are ridiculous as well).  It seemed like a bunch of middle class white guys promoting their political views, and putting them in a Bible for the rest of us to believe as absolute theological truths because they have a Ph.D next to their name. (I think Kierkegaard would call them a bunch of \\"scheming swindlers\\" seeing as how the rest of that quote would apply to them. . . that crazy existentialist)<br /><br />That took away a half star from our review of the Bible, the other half was taken away because of Tullian Tchividjian's unruly excitement in the promotional video (take it easy brother).<br /><br />So, we hope you enjoy your new ESV study Bible as much as we have.  There is nothing more convenient than having a group of people who believe the same thing you do, think the same way you think, and speak the same way you do come together and make a Bible that speaks the same voice of God that you listen to (Seriously).introductions to each book are a bit more detailed than the new NLT study bible, and the study notes are ridiculous in number and content.

B000002OCP|5.0|I'm not typically a music reviewer so I'll keep this short. This album is a short but very tight production of an upbeat electric blues sound. I have some of Muddy's older stuff, but don't know all his music. I would put this at the top of my list. If you like classic rock but want to dabble in the blues, this may be the way to go for you. It's a much shorter crossover than the older accoustic albums. This is a long way from his \\"Plantation Recordings\\". Give it a listen, I think you'll enjoy it.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Anyone who knows me, knows how big of a Batman fan I am. And even though this may sound biased, I can honestly say that \\"The Dark Knight\\" is the best comic book adaptation movie ever made! With little nods and sideplots that only us deep Batman fans could recognize (i.e. the sonar spying system that Batman utilizes in the film that is ironically close to the Brother I satellite from the OMAC Project storyline in the comics ([[ASIN:1401208371 The OMAC Project (Countdown to Infinite Crisis)]]), or the Batman wannabe gang that mirrors Frank Miller's \\"[[ASIN:1563899299 Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]\\"), Nolan's \\"Knight\\" brings so much to the table that I can only think that the filmmakers achieved what Raimi so desperately tried to achieve with [[ASIN:B00005JPFH Spider-Man 3 (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], only they failed miserably; whereas Nolan and crew made a stunning success!<br /><br />There are so many plotlines in this film, which may make you think that the movie would become convoluted, but it doesn't. If anything, it keeps the audience involved with each and every character all the while keeping them on the edge of their seats, as there are plenty of nailbiting sequences in this film. The main plotline is Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) having to deal with the fact that his persona as Batman has inspired many new acts of criminality -- both seemingly good and extremely bad. Yes, Rachel Dawes is back too. Only instead of Katie Holmes, we now get Maggie Gyllenhaal. I was one of those few when the first film came out that didn't think Holmes' performance was all that bad, but, after seeing Gyllenhaal in this, I now realize how -- although not that bad -- truly stiff Holmes' performance was. And, much to Bruce's chagrin, Rachel's love interest is no other than the compassionate, idealistic District Attorney Harvey Dent (with a performance by Aaron Eckhart that may be the best of his career to date). Of course, Bruce has to deal with this relationship as well (continuing their relationship from [[ASIN:B0017HPHBM Batman Begins (Limited Edition Gift Set)]]), all the while dealing with the newest criminal to grace Gotham's streets -- an anarchistic criminal who simply \\"wants to watch the world burn\\" and calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger). And the complicated relationship between Gordon, Dent and Batman (another comic book staple) is explored with great writing (again, taking a cue from their relationship in [[ASIN:1563894696 Batman: The Long Halloween]].<br /><br />Now, let me just take this time to say that I'm definitely not one of those people who believes much in an actor or actress receiving awards just because they've passed away or because they're so old and the academies believe they'll be passing away soon (Yes, Martin Landau, for his performance in \\"Ed Wood,\\" I'm directing that statement at him; his performance in that film didn't even come close to Morgan Freeman's in \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\"). However, regardless of Ledger's living status, I can truly say that he deserves an Academy Award for Supporting Actor nomination for his turn as The Joker, dead or alive. He is that good! Of course, being The Joker, he does have a few funny one-liners, however, unlike Jack Nicholson's Joker, Ledger's lines are so creepily delivered that you're not sure whether you want to, or should, laugh. And the complex relationship between The Joker and Batman -- one not being able to exist without the other -- that is a constant in the comics even to this day is added into the movie, which I was delighted about. Also, Ledger's Joker is always one step ahead of Gotham's police and Batman that he makes the perfect formidable foe that us fans know from the comics.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is also back as Lieutenant Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox; and all have good screentime and give great performances. Also, for those fans wondering, Cillian Murphy is also back for a brief cameo as The Scarecrow.The performances are all excellent but the true accolades should go to the writers, brothers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan, and David S. Goyer. They wrote what a Batman movie should be and perfectly showcase why all of us fans love Batman in the first place: the dark, gritty realism peppered with hope and lots of cool gadgets. The fact that director Christopher Nolan has finally brought the cool respect that was lost by his predecessors back to the Batman franchise is superb! The action is plentiful but doesn't take away from the drama that is also needed for a film of this caliber.<br /><br />I liked [[ASIN:B00005JPS8 Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)]] a lot, but The Dark Knight blows it and every other comic book-movie adaptation out of the water! I can only hope that there are more Batman movies planned for Nolan and crew, especially after all the money they've raked in (they broke the record for a midnight opening with $18.6 million, and that's not including any other showings; just the midnight ones)! Whether you're a comic book fan or not, I would recommend this movie! It's probably the best summer blockbuster I've seen in years! Immediately after seeing it, I wanted to see it again and felt bummed out that I couldn't. I won't write any more about the storylines or surprises in store as that would rob you of the full effect of the movie's greatness. Don't read any more into it.

B00069YE0W|5.0|Well, this is my first John Frusciante CD. I'm glad it was, too. \\"Curtains\\" was a little odd for me, at first, but as I started to listen to it, I got use to Frusciante's singing and his lyrical content. \\"The Past Recedes\\" gets you started to thinking that it's going to be a good CD. And it did a good job of doing so. When you open the CD you find the lyrics are written in Frusciante's handwriting.   I think that this is a great CD for any collection. It's a great CD for those of you who like either Frusciante or the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

0575081406|5.0|The book begins by dropping you into a story that feels like you've missed a volume, then it gathers speed and you're in the race.  As a fantasy fiction lover, the slightly sci-fi bent to it is fascinating, disturbing, irritating and with time completely normal.  Not realising that this is a trilogy made the race to the end of the book very intertesting.  It is full of intelligence, intrigue, clever and lyrical description and it wound it's way, no doubt via wizardry magic into my daily life so that reading it became the goal of the day.    While the ending (the last 100 pages) is slightly less absorbing, simply needing to find the climax and resolution pulled me through, but I did find it a little '$2 ending' as I like to call the quick and cheap endings of movies, as was the case of this book.  But none the less, I immediately jumped on line to research this author and to my delight discovered the triology.    Lovers of lyrical and passionate story telling will indulge greatly in this.  A fine read and a wonder to let the imagination journey on.  You can't help but wonder at those of us, Patrick Rothfuss namely, how may have already enjoyed a lifetime surrounded by this magic in the real.
B000V698JM|5.0|This album is so different from John Mayall other albums it the first of his groups without a drummer but it is such a great sound my favorite track is California but the whole album is very good. Some of John best music was produced in this period, he is always experimenting with different combinations I was so lucky to see some of his line ups over the years. Unfortunately this was not one of them if you are like me when it comes to John Mayall this is one you should have in your collection.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|SALO, OR THE 100 DAYS OF SODOM is by far the most harrowing filmic experience I have ever had.  Many times I had to stop the DVD just to breathe; most often I was forced to look away at the sight of appalling acts.  That the film is a masterpiece, there is no doubt. But it is a masterpiece of degradation and untrammeled sexuality, if, indeed, it can in any way be called sexual.    I recommend it only to those who can look at it objectively and see through the grossness of its subject to its masterliness as film art.
B000IVW25M|5.0|The classic DVD arrived promptly and in excellent condition - a big hit with a little girl!
B001E7X4M4|3.0|The March has fewer interesting songs than Oncoming Storm (best place to start) or Eyes of Fire.  But if 'heavy' is your mode, not melody or thrash or mood, I'm hard pressed to think of albums much purely-heavier than this.<br /><br />My Will Be Done starts with an amazing power riff, but that riff isn't used again until the end of the song -- and there really aren't any equivalent moments in the rest of the album.  We Are Not Anonymous is worth checking out.  The Chosen is a bit more punk and anthemic, but doesn't stick.<br /><br />Overall, March still feels like a devolution from earlier and higher moments in Unearth's career.  They've fallen into the same trap a lot of bands have this year, trying to make the most 'heavy as sh**/f**k' album they can, forgetting the elements that really made them unique.

B0013LPS7U|4.0|... there was a whole lot of energy.  To listen to how U2 began is interesting, especially for those of us who didn't discover them until Under a Blood Red Sky and Joshua Tree.  Their music always had a lot of passion but in the beginning the energy was pretty boundless.  I don't love everything on this release, but there are a number of really great songs.<br /><br />\\"I Will Follow\\" is of course trademark U2, but I also particularly like \\"The Electric Co.\\" which I knew from Under a Blood Red Sky.  A couple of new favorites are \\"Out of Control\\" and especially \\"A Day Without Me\\" which has a fantastic beat that gets pleasantly stuck in your head and you just can't get it out (not that you really want to).  \\"Into the Heart\\" is another that has a beautiful sound - I wish the instrumental beginning was even longer.<br /><br />The bonus CD is interesting as well, and sometimes I think I prefer it to disc 1.  There are a couple of live versions of \\"11 O'clock Tick Tock\\" (another favorite from Under a Blood Red Sky) and an early version of \\"I Will Follow.\\"  There are a couple of stinkers but overall it's likely to please the die-hard fans.  It's interesting to listen to the original three songs from 3 (U2's first album) and note the difference in sound, both vocals and guitar (Bono sounds like the teenager he probably was and the guitar lacks the Edge's trademark delay and sounds like everyone else at the time).<br /><br />The packaging on this release is nice, with the original artwork as opposed to the hideous silhouetted American cover, which is included inside (the band was concerned about accusations of pedophilia, or something like that).  The essay by Paul Morley is rambling and incoherent and overly-grandiose - and is best ignored - but there are a number of interesting comments by the Edge regarding several recordings.  I especially liked his comments on the distinct drum sound achieved on \\"11 O'clock Tick Tock.\\"  This and the lyrics are what make it worthwhile.<br /><br />Like some others have mentioned, it's probably not for the casual fans, but it's a lot of fun to listen to and is an interesting contrast to their later music./><br />Like some others have mentioned, it's probably not for the casual fans, but it's a lot of fun to listen to and is an interesting contrast to their later music.
B0017ANAZY|5.0|I think this movie really allows us to see things in real life. every body is so used to the \\"fairy tale\\" story, but life is not full of that, it's full of trials and tribulations. I love the story line and it shows the true meaning of friendship and marriage.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I went to see the movie with a dear friend of mine....waves of nostalgia  washed over me as I heard those classic songs of ABBA's interpreted by  a new \\"season\\" of performers amidst an intriguing, yet thoughtful, love story.....

1419551795|4.0|I didn't want some text that would be a waste of time. Instead, I wanted something that would prepare me for the format of the exam while, at the same time, helping me with any finer points on the specific stragety for the exam.    The text was a great choice because it only shows the most difficult problems, and then explains how they arrived at the \\"correct\\" answer. Naturally, I found some to be easy and others quite challenging. In the end, it made the GMAT very easy to take, and appears to have gotten me a good score (just took it this AM).    I would recommend to anyone who considers themself a smart person.

1433502410|5.0|The ESV Study Bible has launched with eight editions: Hardcover, TruTone Nat Brown, TruTone Classic Black, Black Bonded Leather, Burgundy Bonded Leather, Black Genuine Leather, Burgundy Genuine Leather and Premium Calfskin Leather.<br /><br />In any edition the ESV Study Bible looks great. It is contemporary in its coloring (white is dominant with orange accents in the hardcover) and in the rectangle which shows up throughout (on the cover, to mark headings, and even as a bullet for lists of information). The rectangle has no deeper significance than a simple design element. In an interesting but effective design decision, the TruTone editions have this triangle stitched to the cover. The leather editions have \\"ESV\\" in large gold letters on the spine with \\"Study Bible,\\" \\"English Standard Version\\" and \\"Crossway\\" in smaller gold type. The TruTone has the same text but with the \\"ESV\\" embossed. The hardcover features black and orange backgrounds on the spine with the text printed over top. The standard ESV guarantee applies to these Bibles, meaning that a customer who discovers manufacturing defects during normal use can return the Bible to have it replaced with one of equal or greater value.<br /><br />The Bible is made to be durable. It is smyth sewn which is the binding process considered by many to be the best and longest-lasting method. It allows the Bible to lie flat even on page one and on page 2,752 (at least in the TruTone). It is printed on \\"high-opacity, high-quality French Bible paper\\" and in a single-column format with the cross-references in the inside margin. The paper is thin and light but still sturdy. My two year-old put the Bible to the test when she inadvertently stepped on it while it was lying open. The page wrinkled under her heel but did not tear. I also learned from her that chewing gum can be removed from the cover of the TruTone while permanent marker cannot. The fonts are very dark and easy to read with a heavy black serif font for the biblical text and a thin black sans-serif for the notes and cross-references. The page headings are in a bold gray with page numbers in a thin gray. Chapter numbers are a large gray serif font while headings are italicized black sans-serif. The pages display a fair bit of bleed-through where, when you look at a page, you can see the ink showing through from the previous page or two. Most of us are accustomed to this bleed-through in our Bibles. Where it is a bit more apparent and distracting is where it shows through on the maps and illustrations.<br /><br />One feature that has received much attention in the ESV Study Bible is its use of color. Most study Bibles offer maps and illustrations only in grayscale. The ESV Study Bible, though, offers full-color illustrations and maps. This is quite a nice feature. The splashes of color throughout, including colored highlighting and shading, are unexpected to my eye but very effective. Though the standard glossy maps in the back of the Bible are superior in quality to the ones scattered throughout, even the smaller maps are nicely done and provide important geographical context without having to slip to the Bible's final pages. The illustrations, commissioned specifically for this project, are very well done and nicely supplement the notes.<br /><br />ESV Study Bible Online<br />The ESV Study Bible is one of only a couple of study Bibles to offer an extensive online component to accompany the Bible. Included with each Bible is a registration code that will allow the customer to access the ESV Online Study Bible. There they will find the complete text of the Bible along with all of the study notes, articles, maps, and all the other features of the Bible. Unique online features include the ability to create and save personalized online notes; to search and follow interactive links between notes, maps, articles, charts, timelines, illustrations, and cross-references; and to listen to audio recordings of the ESV. It adds interactive features that are only possible in a computer-based environment. While the online component is a useful addition to the Bible (and a free one!), at this time it seems under-developed and I suspect many readers will find that they do not refer to it very often.<br /><br />Format<br />Each book of the Bible begins with an extensive introduction. This may include sections dealing with Time, Date and Title; Author; Theme; Key Themes; Purpose, Occasion and Background; Literary Features; Outline; and so on. Particularly important is the History of Salvation Summary which sets each of the books within the context of the wider body of Scripture and hence within the history of salvation. Introductions may also include timelines, maps, and notes on literary features specific to that book. In every case, the reader will receive a thorough explanation as to the book's authorship, purpose and context in God's plan of salvation.<br /><br />The text notes vary in density but typically comprise about half of each page in the New Testament and perhaps a third in the Old Testament. They focus primarily on explanation and rarely on application. In one handy feature, highlighted notes correspond to primary points in the outline while highlighted verses and headings within the notes correspond to secondary points in the outline.<br /><br />Scholarship<br />The ESV Study Bible has been produced by as good a group of scholars as any study Bible. The General Editor is Wayne Grudem, the Theological Editor is J.I. Packer, the Old Testament Editor is C. John Collins and the New Testament Editor is Thomas Schreiner. The study note contributors represent a broad cross-section of reputable Evangelical scholars. The articles included within the Bible have been contributed by some well-known pastors and scholars, including John Piper, David Powlison, Darrell Bock, Leland Ryken, R. Kent Hughes, Daniel Wallace, and many more.<br /><br />Controversial Theology<br />One concern people are likely to have when considering a new study Bible concerns the theological perspective offered in the notes. Does this particular study Bible take a Reformed or Arminian position on salvation? A complementarian or egalitarian perspective on gender roles? An amillennial or premillennial position on the end times? I looked through many of the notes seeking what this Bible says on some of the more common controversies: end times, spiritual gifts and soteriology. I found this an interesting comparison with the Reformation Study Bible. It seems to me that the Reformation Study Bible came from a much more narrowly-defined theological position; it was Reformed, it was cessationist, it was amillennial. The ESV Study Bible, on the other hand, offers a wider or less-defined perspective. Where the doctrine is clear and undisputed among Evangelicals, so too are the notes. But where doctrines are controversial and within the area of Christian freedom or disputable matters, the notes tend not to take a firm position, even when the author or editor is firmly in one camp or the other. Whether this is positive or negative may well depend on the individual reader.<br /><br />To satisfy my curiosity, I opened my NIV Study Bible, Reformation Study Bible, MacArthur Study Bible and ESV Study Bible and compared their notes on several areas of controversial theology--spiritual gifts, predestination and spiritual gifts. None of these Bibles offered notes that were unbiblical so I was left looking for the differences in perspective. In general I found that the MacArthur Study Bible offered the most defined position. This makes good sense as it represents the position of a single individual. This was followed by the Reformation Study Bible which offers the position of many individuals but each of them drawn from a very consistent theological position. The ESV Study Bible came next, offering a charitable but open view on most of these issues. The NIV Study Bible seemed almost to shy away from some of the issues. So while it is clear that the ESV Study Bible is not distinctly Reformed in its position, neither is it Arminian. It is not cessationist or continuationist and is neither amillennial nor postmillennial. In fact, it seems as if it emulates the parent who tells one of his children to cut the last piece of cake in half and the other to choose the first piece. In many cases a person from one perspective wrote the notes while a person from the other perspective screened them. This ensures the notes maintain both charity and some degree of objectivity in those areas of dispute.<br /><br />Having looked at the areas of dispute, I would not hesitate to recommend the ESV Study Bible to either new or mature Christians. The matters at the heart of the faith are described and defended while the matters of lesser importance are presented charitably and non-dogmatically.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />I suspect that many of the people reading this review will already be owners of at least one study Bible. I feel it is important to affirm that there is nothing innately wrong with the Reformation Study Bible, The New Geneva Study Bible, the MacArthur Study Bible and many of the other similar products. If you are currently using one of these Bibles and are happy with it, there may be few compelling reason to rush out and purchase the ESV Study Bible. I have used the Reformation Study Bible and its predecessor for many years with great benefit. I have no doubt that I will continue to refer to it.<br /><br />With that said, I think the ESV Study Bible is an incredible resource. A long list of endorsers have expressed their excitement for its theological faithfulness, its accessibility, its insight, its scholarship, its practicality and its sheer excellence. I would simply append my name to this list. I agree wholeheartedly with C.J. Mahaney who writes, \\"I can't imagine a greater gift to the body of Christ than the ESV Study Bible. It is a potent combination indeed: the reliability and readability of the ESV translation, supplemented by the best of modern and faithful scholarship, packaged in an accessible and attractive format. A Christian could make no wiser investment for himself, a pastor could recommend no better resource for his congregation.\\" This is a powerful resource and one that can aid any reader of Scripture. It is one I recommend wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Early in this review I wrote, \\"Today, if you drop by my home in the early morning, you are likely to see me reading from the Literary Study Bible.\\" I think it's safe to say that, if you drop by my home early tomorrow morning, you are likely to see me reading from the ESV Study Bible.ered in the notes.

0439023483|2.0|No matter how many times I have tried to read this book, Suzanne Collins fails to engage me as a writer.  More compelling is her ability to come up with an abhorrently unbelievable concept of children participating in gladiator-like games for survival.  Sure, there's the 1984/451 F-ish attempts at suggesting a future world gone wrong, but involving children takes it too far even for me, as a parent, to believe in unequivocally.    Skip it - I don't understand the praise heaped on this book.
B001AX9DT0|2.0|With the exception of two good tracks the rest of the album is just forgettable filler.  As much as I appreciate Ray trying to push the avenues of his own creativity this album holds no candle to the previous \\"Til the Sun Turns Black.\\"  I'm a Ray fan and I just can't find anything on this album that strikes any emotion in me.<br /><br />The first two albums moved me and the music just caught your attention in a pleasant phonetic way.  I'm really pained to say this because Ray has become one of my favorite artists over the past few years and I was highly anticipating this album but alas I'm extremely disappointed.  Sadly enough the albums final track \\"Gossip In the Grain\\" is probably the best track, it should have started the album off and followed this style and progression.  I'm not looking for a repeat of the first two albums but I do expect great song writing and catchy tunes and I just don't get it with this album.  His own website tags this new album with the quote \\"\\"his most creative and emotionally expansive collection to date\\".  Apparently Rays own page updater didn't listen to the new album because this is anything but emotionally expansive.  Plus the Meg White song is just flat out annoying, annoying...

I happen to know this item very well even though I haven't received it yet, that is why the 5*'s.  However, it STILL SITS SOMEWHERE AT AMAZON.  They have no plans to ship it until the 20th of this month.  I don't understand it...

B00005KARK|4.0|Jumbo?  Don't you mean Dumbo!<br /><br />And so the tearfest begins.<br /><br />I loved this movie as a child and recently rediscovered it while visiting with my two year-old niece. As is typical for kids that age, we watched the movie everyday (sometimes twice) for a week.<br /><br />Every time I cried.<br /><br />I can't really think of another Disney movie that depicts such a wonderfully loving and sweet relationship between parent and child (no Bambi didn't do it for me).<br /><br />Plus Dumbo is the self-doubting underdog throughout, which simply makes me love him even more.<br /><br />Oh, and my niece, she squealed with delight for Dumbo's triumphs each time and paid serious attention to the sad parts where mother and child are separated.  Never underestimate a two year-old.<br /><br />The only reason I stop short of giving it a 5-star is the dated depictions of excessive alcohol use, smoking and the stereotyping of the crows...yeah I know you can't stereotype crows as such, but we can easily figure out to whom those stereotypes apply.  Can't go back in time and undo the social circumstances that made this acceptable childrens entertainment.<br /><br />Overall, though the touching story of an outcast only a mother could love and his triumph over his tormentors is timeless.

B000WTNCYA|5.0|This disc was fabulous, Gardot's music is reminiscent of the divas from the golden age of jazz.  Her voice is smooth and soulful, with a depth that is rare for such a young musician.  My only complaint is that it's so short, I wish there were more songs.
0061537934|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Everyone with whom I have shared this book has loved it.
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|This is a great performance. It shows Don Felder's amazing talent with a guitar. Joe Walsh is great too, though a little subdue - probably due to the rehabilitation he was newly emerging from. These two amazing guitarists play off each other perfectly and with the wonderful chemistry they used to have before the band's break-up.    Everyone else in great form, too; Henley's voice is out of this world - though I wish he would tone down the theatrical gestures and facial expressions of pretentious indifference - and Tim Schmit sings like an angel, as always! That speech from Henley, about 'how very glad he is they are all friends again' grated badly and the insincerity of this big-headed, gifted performer - I emphasize performer - is big-time CRINGE. Watch the expression on Felder's face here!    Just GET OVER IT and get on with it! We all know the real story already, even long before Felder's book; don't waste your breath and our patience, pushing your crap down our throats.     But yes, Eagles fans - get this DVD. You will love the sound, the songs and the extraordinary skills of Joe Walsh and Don Felder, especially in Hotel California! Flying fingers of Felder's!
B001FBSMW6|1.0|Now I have to say that I have been a Keane fan from the very start so each album that comes out I get really excited for. However, after listening to the samples of each song on this new album I couldn't believe how bad it was. Im sorry but its important to be truthful. I do not understand how such great musicians could make something so....totally bad 80s. Lets just say that sometimes the past needs to be left in the past. My heart it definitely saddened by this because I know what this band is capable of. Though sometimes it can be a hit or miss. I would call this one a miss. Sorry boys, maybe next time.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|First, let me start off by saying that I am a techie geek. I love to buy new stuff not because I NEED it, but because it's new.  With that said about 10 years ago I got into the radio business where I NEEDED a set of headphones. I bought many sets of very expensive headphones from AKG to Grado...  As a DJ you take your headphones off and on hundreds of times a week.  All of the headphones I purchased broke after a short time. (Could have just been bad luck I suppose)  Finally a seasoned guy said, BUY THE SONY 7506s!  I bought them 10 years ago and they've held up great!  Eventually the ear cups will show a little wear, but they still sound amazing and flat (like you want!).  Just spend the money and get these.  You'll keep them for a long time!
B001E7X4M4|5.0|Unearth is again, on point!  Though to me this seems as a step backwards from the progression that III: In the Eyes of Fire had made from the Oncoming Storm, they still slay!!!  I don't know what the gripe was about III:ITEOF, because I feel like I'm the only person on earth who actually really digs that record, and if anybody gave The Stings of Conscience a chance they'll hear that Unearth weren't all that melodic from the get go, though again, a very solid debut.  If you really loved the melodicism of TOS then you'll especially love The March.
B00005JPO1|5.0|Yep, I've read all of the disparaging remarks made by cynical movie-critic wanna-bees.  Get over it folks, it's Indiana Jones done in the same spirit of fun that was found in two of the other three.<br /><br />  The refrigerator hiding spot wasn't credible?  The ET factor was way over the top?  Tell me, how much more over the top were they compared to toppling an ancient statue of Anubis to crash through an equally ancient temple wall?  A man managing to hang on to a submerged Nazi sub and travel hundreds of miles?  Exit an airplane thousands of feet in the air with an inflatable raft, land safely on a mountain slope and then take another tremendous drop into river rapids?  And this movie wasn't credible?  You folks need to go back and look again because you're not processing this correctly.<br /><br />  I'm a huge fan of the character for many reasons, not the least of which is that he made wearing hats cool again.  As a musician, in my miss-spent youth, I wore fedoras on stage at every gig. (Even before Raiders)<br /><br />  I feel that the Temple of Doom is still the weakest of the four.  Far too dark (it scared the hell out of my pre-school kids), not nearly as much fun, a female lead with screams and squeals that pierced my head like a nail and a \\"side-kick\\" that really stretched plausibility.  It wasn't until years after the fact that I realized that even a bad Indiana Jones movie still had enough entertainment value to give it repeat viewings.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|Gojira is a band that is very unlike others in a scene where a lot of extreme bands seem to be just carbon copies of other extreme bands.  On this particular outing Gojira are finding their voices and wearing their influences a little less on the proverbial sleeve.  Well, I first heard of Gojira in an interview that Randy Blythe gave and he highly recomended these french men, so it is to say the least and to make a long story short, I purchased From Mars to Sirius soon after.  At first I really couldn't wrap my head around fMtS and considered it a waste of hard earned cash.  I gave the disc a few chances and put it away.  Well Gojira didn't stay put for long because one I was pretty bored and wanted to listen to something different and fMtS was there staring at me, daring me to give it another go and this time it was a truly different experience!  From that moment on I was a fan, and much like fMts, The Way of all Flesh is 100% original and a breath of fresh air!  There is no other band out there just like them, if you haven't heard them yet give Gojira a chance!  You won't be disapointed.

B001CIPU3G|5.0|Trivium is a band that gets a lot of hate from a lot of metalheads, but do they deserve it? I really think that they don't and I'm not a fanboy at all, in fact, I don't really like Ember To Inferno and Ascendancy. I'm pretty sure that a lot of metalheads hate Trivium only because they used (yeah, they don't anymore) to play metalcore and/or because they aren't tr00 (that's what some people say) or for another reason that has nothing to do with the quality of their music. Actually, I used to think like that too, but one day I decided to stop being so close minded, I listened to The Crusade and I liked it a lot. I've seen a lot of ridiculously negative reviews for this album and honestly, I really don't understand them because Shogun is very far from bad! My guess is that some of them wanted to hate it.    A lot of people consider Shogun to be a mix of Ascendancy and The Crusade, well, they're right. It's thrashy and \\"melodic\\" like The Crusade and it has the screaming of Ascendancy, yeah, but it's different overall, it's more melodic (The Crusade was more thrashy than melodic), more epic, more progressive, it doesn't sound as mainstream (By the way, Down From The Sky is the most mainstream sounding song on the album and it's the weakest one too) and it doesn't really sound like Metallica at all. I couldn't really give it a specific metal genre, it's quite unique (atleast to me), it's a mix of a lot of things, sometimes it's heavy, sometimes it's thrashy, sometimes it's progressive (ala Dream Theater), sometimes it's melodic (ala Iron Maiden), sometimes it's catchy, sometimes it's epic, but I can say that it's not metalcore. Some people say that it's metalcore, but they must've heard a different album or maybe they're simply Trivium haters because there's nothing metalcore about this album except the screaming, but it's not even THAT metalcore, it sometimes reminds of bands like Dark Tranquillity.     Anyway, the guitar playing on this album is very good, Matt and Corey are GREAT guitarists, hell, maybe even more than great. The album is filled with great technical riffs (the riff at 8:24 in the title track is a good example of that) and awesome solos that probably require a lot of skills to play, but I have to say that a few (only a few) riffs are quite generic, they're typical metal riffs. The bass, well, I can't say much about it because it's nothing special really, but I have to say that there's a really nice (and dark) bass \\"solo\\" in Torn Between Scylla And Charibdis. Talking about Torn Between Scylla And Charibdis, it's probably the best song on the album, it's filled with great riffs and solos, it's quite epic in parts and it's very catchy. The drumming is awesome, I don't know much about drumming, but I love the drumming on this album, it sounds quite technical. The vocals aren't great, I mean, they're nothing special, but they're far from bad. Matt Heafy still sounds like young James Hetfield, but I think that his (completely) clean voice got much better. Like I said earlier, there's some screaming, but not THAT much, every song has like 2 or 3 screaming parts and all of the rest is like on The Crusade.    About the songs, there's no bad song on this album, some are good, some are great and some are awesome. Into The Mouth Of Hell We March is almost as good as TBSAC! It's very melodic, it has a lot of harmonized melodies, some of them remind of Maiden (the part at 2:29 reminds a bit of a part from Hallowed Be Thy Name for example), the verses are great and the choruses (especially the first one) are very catchy. Kirisute Gomen is one of the best songs on the album, it's very thrashy ala Ignition (from The Crusade), it has a very memorable chorus and the part at 1:50 is just awesome! It's the perfect opener because it really represents the whole sound of the album. Throes Of Perdition is very nice, it has a great heavy main riff that reminds a bit of the main riff from Dream Theater's Panic Attack and it has a catchy chorus that is pretty radio friendly, it's probably the most mainstream sounding part on the whole album, but it's good anyway. The Calamity, He Who Spawned The Furies and Of Prometheus And The Crucifix are all great and have original and memorable choruses, I can't really pick a favourite one out of them. I didn't really like the title track at first, but now I love it, it's the progressive song of the album, it's very epic, it's very catchy and the slow part is just awesome, it's definitely something that could have been written by Dream Theater, well, the whole song could have been written by Dream Theater! Ok, it's very far from a rip off, it doesn't sound like Dream Theater THAT much, but some of the riffs remind of them and overall it's almost as good as some of DT's epics. Insurrection is very thrashy, it would have fitted well on The Crusade, the verses are pure thrash and they're awesome! It's chorus is catchy, but it's definitely not one of the catchiest choruses on the album. Like Callisto To A Star In Heaven is the second weakest song on the album, but it's still a good song with some nice heavy parts, there's nothing else to add about it. Down From The Sky is the weakest one, it's not bad, but it's nothing special, it's quite generic and the chorus is nowhere near as memorable as the choruses from most of the other songs. The screamed part before the chorus is pretty nice though.    I don't really care about the production, but a lot of people do, so I'll just say that it's perfect! You can hear everything perfectly and every instrument sounds great. I would add more if I knew anything about the production terms.    Anyway, overall, it's not perfect, it has some unoriginal parts, but it's a GREAT album, it's also a grower and I highly recommend it! I'm SURE that if it wasn't a Trivium album, A LOT of metalheads would love it! Just put a sticker with another band's name on the cover and I can assure you that your tr00 metalhead friend will love it. Remove the sticker and he will suddenly hate it. Anyway, it seems that they (Trivium) get better and better, so personally, I can't wait for their next album, I expect something even better than this album!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Ok, so basically, giving the fact that I am only a 19 year-old metal head, I am not the most gifted in the history of Metal. But to anyone who is anyone, Metallica is always on the tip of the tongue when you ask `who is the most powerful metal band?'    I bought St. Anger the day it cam out, and minus the trash can drums and lack of anything remotely creative, it was tolerable, more so than Load or Reload. It wasn't great...or even good, but it was good background noise in a woodshop (which speaks on its quality).    Then Death Magnetic came out. I was wary, but I read a review of an old-school metal head on his site ([...]) and he said it was good. He has never wronged me yet, so I went after it.    I have to say, I am actually pleased with this record. First off, the shortest song is 6 min. long, meaning that they FINALLY let go of the old fashion verse, chorus, verse, chorus X2 end formula that has in my opinion plagued the band since the Black Album. I guess that booting Bob Rock and placing the career doctor Rick Rubin in role of producer finally lit a fire under Metallica to make a decent record.    As far as songs go, the drums are good. No trash can style going on here. There is even an instrumental thrown in there for good measures to keep the fans of \\"Orion\\" at bay. Now, this record is no where near any of the 4 great records from the beginning, this is actually like if Metallica recorded during the time between ...And Justice for All and the Black Album. But it is still good none-the-less.    I have read about the sound quality, and it's not too noticeable unless you are looking to find it. You need to remember that Kill `Em All was quite the crappy record as far as productions go. This in my mind was intentional; Metallica is trying to show that they remember the sound that got them to where they are.    All in all, a good record. It's nowhere near Master of Puppets, but it's a start of good things to hopefully come. I recommend getting a used Amazon copy if you are still wary. And you can always upgrade to the expensive sets Metallica's has out on there website.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|Before going to see HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY, my wife and I sat down a re-watched the original HELLBOY with our 15 year old daughter, because she had not seen it. I truly enjoyed seeing the original film again after a few years, and was once again quite interested in the trials and triumphs of \\"Red\\", \\"Blue,\\" \\"Liz\\" and all the others.     So the next night, we went to see HELLBOY II, and frankly, I was nearly blown away. It's a far superior movie. Everything the first film got right, this one gets right again. And what amazes me is that I'm not really a \\"superhero movie\\" fan or a \\"comic book\\" fan...yet I think these particular characters, as realized by Guillermo del Toro and his team, are marvelous meldings of \\"mundane\\" human emotions with outsized powers. Hellboy is incredibly strong, supernaturally durable and also the spawn of the devil. Yet he drinks too much, is too clingy with this girlfriend and has an all-too-human short fuse. Abe Sapien is shy and softspoken...but he also has psychic powers and can breathe underwater. Liz is an attractive but troubled young lady who can set some pretty nasty fires just by thinking about it.     You might say that X-MEN plows the same soil...yet those films, to me, are all glossy surface level efforts. Perhaps it's because there are SO MANY X-Men that few of them are more than assemblages of some character traits. In HELLBOY, we almost forget we're looking at \\"monsters.\\"     That effect is aided by the fact the Del Toro has concocted some of the most monstrous looking creatures ever seen in a mainstream film. I don't even know what to call his creations...they sometimes look like something from H.P. Lovecraft, sometimes like something from the Cantina in STAR WARS and yes, sometimes like creatures from PAN'S LABRYNTH. But all his creatures are striking to look at and brilliantly executed.     HELLBOY II follows the efforts of Hellboy and his gang to restore the truce that has long existed between humans and \\"creatures\\" such as trolls, gremlins, elves and many other far less identifiable \\"fantastic\\" beings. The evil Prince Nouda is essentially breaking the truce with man, and intends on ridding the earth of them forever by bringing back to life an army of 4900 giant robots than simply cannot be destroyed and setting them to rampage through our cities.     So often, stories like this just aren't terribly interesting, but I have to say that this one kept me going throughout. Much simply had to do with the imagination with which all the beings are presented. In an early, very striking scene, the Prince confronts his elderly, elf-like father. When the old man dies...his body turns into a stone statue. I know we've seen this kind of effect before...but the feeling this transformation evokes is a lovely mixture of awe at the beauty and dread at the finality of the change.     But thankfully, the world has Hellboy to protect it. He charges into the fray, barely understanding what's going on, but hellbent to kick some butt!! His crush first, ask questions later attitude gets him into trouble, of course...but also wins the affections of the audience. He's like a little kid with some big powers. His is somewhat domesticated by his fiery girlfriend (their relationship has progressed in surprising ways over the years)...but he still can't help letting his big arm fly! The crew is joined by a new \\"leader\\" in the form of Johann Krauss, an entity made entirely of gas! Krauss animates an old-fashioned diving suit in order to give himself some shape...but his powers (and his Teutonic arrogance) give the movie a nice jolt. He's a completely new creature. Not physically strong like Hellboy or empathic like Sapien. He's smart and he knows some pretty cool ways to use his gaseous state! He and Hellboy have what amounts to a locker-room showdown that had me and the entire audience in stitches.     I see that I am just going on and on in my review. There's so much more I'd like to share...but I hope you atleast get the gist that this is a highly entertaining and worthwhile film. Del Toro is a visionary director. But I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the film is truly made wonderful by the fully-realized and heartfelt performance of Ron Perlman as Hellboy. He'll never get an Oscar for a part like this (not that he should)...but he gets a Summer Movie Season of 2008 MVP award for his very charismatic turn. Selma Blair has never looked better. Doug Jones (Abe) is wonderful in his physicality and the always enjoyable John Hurt even makes an early, welcome appearance. Only Jeffrey Tambor (normally so good) comes off poorly as their befuddled boss. His part is actually written to make him too much of a buffoon, so he's actually only irritating most of the time.     In the best sense, I felt swept away by this film. I am quite eager for Part III!!

B001E75QH0|5.0|We could all day compare the last movie to the Temple of Doom and so on. It is not about that really. This collection is about grabbing some popcorn and sitting on the couch all day with your family and everyone having a great time.  Unless you have been living under a rock you know what this movie franchise is all about.<br />This collection is the same one that was for sale prior to the release of the last movie The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. (stars are my opinion)<br /><br />It contains;<br /><br />Raiders *****<br />Temple of Doom *<br />The Last Crusade *****<br />(new)The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. ****<br /><br />Also included are some documentaries that were filmed during the making of the films. Making of documentaries make this a must have for the Indy collector.<br />The Indiana Jones franchise may be getting long in the tooth but I think that this collection is a great pack of movies to have.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my little review of this pack.
B001E75QH0|4.0|Cursed Amazon, they lump DVD and BLU-RAY reviews together, I had to delete my DVD review to add this one.<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant when I heard they had done a frame-by-frame restoration of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" but nothing with Temple of Doom or Last Crusade, however, my concerns were not necessary. \\"Raiders\\" probably looks as good as it did the day it was shot. Sure, it's got 35mm grain, but that's better than THX noise reduction creating an oil-painted look. What you do get is a clean, crisp, vibrant print that leaps from the screen, thundering, full sound and the besting sounding John Williams score this side of Star Wars.<br /><br />Everyone has their opinions on the films, I don't have my favorite. All those who talk about the second film being too dark and violent overlook the \\"death by propeller\\" and \\"face melting\\" scenes, those who said \\"kingdom skull\\" was too plot heavy or silly overlook the monkey (sorry the monkey was a jar-jar moment) saying \\"uh oh\\" or the \\"just don't look at it and it won't kill us\\" ending (and a refrigerator saving him from nuclear blast is silly?)<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy all four of these films, there funny, exciting, and completely entertaining and unlike anything else. These blu-rays look/sound fantastic, as sharp and vibrant as you cold hope for. My daughters aren't the biggest fans, yet, but I'm sure my son and I will enjoy them for years.ectations and enjoy it.    Over-all I say if you don't own them already this set is a good deal, me, I'm waiting for all four on blu-ray.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I have no real review to write about the Dark Knight.  As a summer movie, I rate it right up there with Iron Man as one  of the two best movies of 08.    I write this as a reminder of the lost we had in the tragic death  Heath Ledger. Not just in the lost of a decent man, but in the lost of  a great acting talent. And the sad part is we will never know what potential hights his talents would have taken him.
0143038419|5.0|This book is not a heavy read, but a sit around the pool read of a woman on a journey of self discovery. All along her journey were tidbits of learning, new people, and good food.

B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC is one of those rare bands that all these years later, I can honestly say that I still enjoy listening to--almost as much as I did when I first heard it back in '80. It's also one of the ONLY bands that bring me and my oldest son together...something I cannot say about the music MY Father used to listen to.<br /><br />Debates have raged for YEARS over who is better, Brian or Bon...? Honestly I love 'em both. While to this day SOME people have a problem being able to distinguish between the two (and some of those people even consider themselves FANS), I noticed the difference the second Brian began singing on the very first track I heard, which I believe was the title track. It took all of maybe 45 seconds for me to become a total convert. As long as I can get that old AC/DC FEEL, I honestly didn't care who sang it.<br /><br />Originally Back In Black was a tribute album to the late Bon Scott, and at that point nobody in the band had a clue whether or not the record would be well received enough to warrant staying together or splitting up for good. I think virtually everyone was stunned to recoginize that not only did the band pull out all the stops with Back In Black, but the band was far from over. Good thing, too.<br /><br />This new incarnation is EVERY bit as impressive as everyone is saying it is. I think a LOT of us have heard so-called Re-Mastered CD's that just don't live up to the hype, but that certainly isn't the case here. Those of us who listen to detail almost to the point of being a Geek about it can tell you that the process mastered here with this version truly has out-done themselves. Kudos to the Producers who literally made magic happen. Crisp and clean, very clean. I've been in the broadcasting business now for nearly 20 years and one of the perks and also one of the downfalls is constantly hearing songs recorded digitally, and some older songs recorded analog-style just plain suck. It's painfully obvious when that hiss plays where a recording has or hasn't been either done or done well...but once again, for those of you who go out of your way to look for that sort of dynamic in the recordings you listen to, boy have you have GOT to listen to this one.<br /><br />While arguments will probably continue to soar over the inclusion of Back In Black as one of the Top-10 Greatest Heavy Metal albums of all time (in my opinion it VERY much deserves to be ON that list), there is NO doubt that this Re-Mastered version is (at this moment anyway) the cream of the crop. Worth EVERY penny for you to upgrade your collection.either done or done well...but once again, for those of you who go out of your way to look for that sort of dynamic in the recordings you listen to, boy have you have GOT to listen to this one.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|yall just haters because Metallica is better than you entire life! This album really shows some great metal like My Apocalypse!!! Another good song is The Day That Never Comes and Cyanide!!!! Metallica rocks life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =D
0385340990|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I learned more about World War II from the perspective of the people who suffered occupation, near famine, air raids and other incredible hardships than from any other book I've read.  The visual pictures made me want to visit Guernsey.  The story line reminded me of Jane Austen novels.<br /><br />While it might not win a Pulitzer, the book had wonderful characters and a good story.  I would recommend it to anybody as an easy, enjoyable read.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|It's really amazing how after they come out of the ashes of St.Anger and kick you in the face. Metallica really shows how they never have lost their fire, it was just waiting to be unleashed  by the right person (Thanks Rick Rubin). As soon as the album starts you can feel the difference, the fire and ferocity of Metallica. In my opinion every track is incredible but the radio track \\"Day that never comes\\" since that song feels as if they just threw random riffs together in order to lengthen the song. The album is very reminiscent of Justice, back to their progressive roots. All who have been Metallica fans will feel very comfortable with this album as it references a lot of old riffs, fills and solos. It's truly an excellent album for any new or old listener of 'tallica. Haha
0694003611|4.0|My opinion should matter very little here. What's important is that young kids absolutely love this book. All 3 of my sons loved this during the 1.5 to 3 years of age range. It's a great book for them to wind down in the evening. They love spotting the moon, the kittens, and whispering the word \\"hush.\\"    It's easily memorized (as an adult reader). The illustrations are adequate, but the flow of words just does not do it for me. It's not something I would pick up to read for a child, but when they start clamoring \\"moon, moon,\\" there can be only one response. Yes, you read it to them again (and again...and again...).    I do recommend it, but don't expect to personally love it, like I do with other books (like the Spot books).
0061150142|4.0|Jodi Picoult has always been one of my favorite authors. Her ability to capture the reader's attention while simultaneously providing insight on each character's thoughts and emotions, without losing the overall direction of the plot line, is very impressive. The Pact dissects yet another intriguing and controversial topic based on teen suicide. While I have no personal experience with this issue, I know several who have, unfortunately, dealt with the struggle and aftermath of such feelings of loss and despair. Picoult did a wonderful job going back and forth between characters throughout the book while creating more and more questions in the reader's mind. I do feel that this book was well written and planned out. I also became increasingly more and more frustrated with each and every character as the story progressed. It was almost as though I was on an emotional rollercoaster, not knowing which character to sympathize with and which character to blame.  My hopes were to better understand Emily's character and find someone to place the blame on for her suicide, however, by the end of the book, all I found was more frustration, disbelief, and questions. I ranked this book with four stars because of its ability to capture your attention, thoughts, feelings, beliefs, emotions; I could not justify giving it five stars because the ending just did not seem to give justice to the characters or the story as a whole. It felt unfinished, almost as though the author did not know what else to say. Granted, it wouldn't be acceptable to end the story with a happy ending, considering the foundation of the story. I guess, in a way, that is exactly how victims of a loved one's suicide feel. Speechless. Confused. Almost as if the whole world is unfinished and questions remain unanswered. I just didn't expect to be left with so much resentment towards all of the characters. Great book. A whirlwind of emotions. Many questions left unanswered.
0838577016|4.0|I purchased this textbook for a Neural Behavior class, and was very impressed.  Definitely a keeper, I feel like I can go back to this book again and again for reference.  The chapters are well connected, but take time to explain the material so that they don't need to be read sequentially.  The only thing the book is lacking is a glossary, in my opinion.  Overall a wonderful book!
1420931571|4.0|Fitzgerald wrote this novel immediately before he wrote The Great Gatsby, to my mind to best American novel of the twentieth century.  So I picked this book up with considerable interest.  There are points in the book where Fitzgerald reaches some of the heights of Gatsby.  The description of Patch's descent into alcoholism, his regrets and weird investment in his own nihilism and deterioration, and the extraordinary description of the dysfunctional co-dependency between Patch and his wife Gloria are truly great.  This part of the book is riveting.     Also worthwhile is the humor and satire of the book, something that really is not present in Gatsby. While in some respects, the book pokes fun at everyone, including Patch's crusading reformer of a grandfather and his novelist friend Caramel, I don't think Fitzgerald is himself a cynic or nihilist.  The descriptions of what Patch's more idealistic Harvard classmates do and Patch's transient regrets about his wasted life, clearly reflect the conventional moral lesson that Fitzgerald is trying to deliver:  do good; make something of your life.      But the book is not in Gatsby's league, and Fitzgerald at this early point in his career (he's only 25) is still developing as a writer.  The early chapters of the book are written with an irritatingly intrusive narration, and the reader must have patience to stick with the book.  Fitzgerald seems to find his voice a third of the way through, and the novel then just takes off.  The ending of the book is disappointing and contrived.  It serves Fitzgerald's ironic purposes and digs at the idle rich, but it's not believable.  Also, Fitzgerald does not understand the legal system that is at the heart of Patch's struggles and completely bungles his description of how the appellate process works. And the title of the book -- please.  Couldn't he have come up with something better than that?  It sounds like something his character Richard Caramel would use for one of his many bad novels.  This book would have been much improved with editing or a rewrite.     In any event, a lesser work by Fitzgerald is a masterpiece by anyone else's standards.  I recommend it.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|After the disaster that was St Anger, you'd have forgiven Metallica fans for wondering if the band had lost its mojo. Thankfully, Death Magnetic puts all those fears to rest. This is one riff-heavy monster, recalling the days of Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning and the Black Album, all rolled into one. And thank God for the guitar solos which were completely absent from St Anger - Hammet rips into them like a man possessed, making up for lost time almost!    Two gripes though. First, I've never been a fan of Lars Ulrich's one-dimensional drumming and he delivers pretty much the same form as always on this album. It's no-frills drumming if you know what I mean - tight and competent but nothing more. You have to wonder what this material would've sounded like in the hands of a more accomplished drummer like Mike Portnoy from Dream Theater...Second, the sound quality. If you're familiar with Rick Rubin's other work, then you'd know he goes for a stark, arguably even harsh sound so the sonic brew on this CD shouldn't be a surprise. It isn't everyone's cup of tea I'll admit, but even though I would've preferred a greater dynamic range, it ain't so bad as to completely spoil the experience. I'm more than happy with this CD and if you're a fan of hard-driving metal-rock, you won't be disappointed either.
B001F7XIJW|4.0|This album is really what you should expect from Gojira. It is heavy, loud and incredible. The only negative is that the songs are less catchy and just don't stick in the head like tracks from Sirius or The Link. No tracks like 'From the Sky' but they do keep a similar sound to their older stuff. Drums are still there. A good album with a little new direction.
B001CZJKS0|5.0|I have been reading some reviews on here about the Halloween 30th Anniversary Commemorative Set, and most of them are just stupid. Let's take some things into account when reviewing this Box Set. First if you don't own Halloween, 4, 5, Halloween 25 years later or Halloween blue ray, $54 is a very good price for this set. If you are a collector of Halloween movies, like me, it is worth $54. And finally take this into account, if you were to buy all these movies by themselves on Amazon you would pay about $245. So paying $54 for a set worth $245, this is a great deal.<br /><br />And please do not bring up Halloween 2, 3, 6, H20 or Halloween Resurrection, because Anchor Bay does not own these Halloween movies.

0671646788|3.0|It is commonly said in the world of persuasion that<br />\\"Facts tell, stories sell\\".  Many personal development<br />books follow this axiom.  The authors of these<br />books appear to be following a familiar model<br />in order to sell us, the readers, on their ideas.<br /><br />What do third-party stories do?  what is their<br />purpose?  Is it that we derive a sense of social<br />proof or veracity from a story told about somebody<br />else by a narrator who may or may not be reliable?<br /><br />\\"The Magic of Thinking Big\\" follows a model similar to<br />\\"How To Win Friends and Influence People\\" -<br />brief illustrative stories which are held up as<br />proof for the author's theories about what makes<br />people successful with other people.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter of this book there is<br />a brief recap of the lessons in the chapter.  This<br />is a useful feature because you can read the<br />lessons the stories illustrate quickly this way.<br /><br />It's quite a good book.  It was written in 1959 and<br />the formula wasn't new then and it's certainly<br />been immitated hundreds of times since - and<br />writing a book of straightforward ideas about success<br />padded out with anecdotal stories seems to be a proven<br />model for establishing oneself as a personal development<br />guru or motivational speaker.<br /><br />I haven't written a book about the topic yet but<br />if I do I'll be sure to immitate the formula<br />of this one - apparently it's a good way to sell<br />a lot of books or at least be perceived as<br />an authority.<br /><br />Worth reading but more or less interchangible<br />with countless other titles.  It's a classic because<br />a lot of people have read it.  The strategies<br />aren't particularly out-of-date or hard to get<br />your mind around.<br /><br />A useful book worth reading if you haven't read<br />many of these types of books or if you want to<br />read all the classic ones.
B001C4AFP8|3.0|This would have been a two star film except for the exceptional performances by Crowe and DiCaprio.  There is no doubt that as DiCaprio ages and develops character in his face and experience in his craft his performances have gone from competent to outstanding.  In spite of the torture, crashes, and explosions this movie actually had some slow spots and I found myself looking at my watch.  Nevertheless it is entertaining and it makes some excellent points by pointing out the many issues and ambiguities in the middle east politics.  I think few Americans have read the Koran or have any real knowledge of middle eastern history or politics but this film does touch on several very key points and shows both sides of some very complicated issues -- hence my review title of ambiguous.  The terrorist bad guy quotes the Koran to justify his position relative to murder and terrorism but is rebutted by DiCaprio who also quotes from the Koran.  But the Crowe character also points out that the devout Muslim is charged with killing all infidels and so concludes there are no innocents -- thus justifying the killing of the unwitting Muslim Pawn.  The plight of the Palestinians is hinted at but not explored.  Crowe plays a jaded, arrogant, and cynical CIA agent.  This part is exaggerated I think to make the point that in general Americans are terribly ignorant of other cultures -- especially the Islamic culture. The film also points out the superior American technology is useful but cannot be substituted for truly understanding how the Islamic Culture operates.  Of course there were some illogical parts to the film.  We see Muslim women without head scarves and being seen in public with a man not related to them.  Then we have DiCaprio prancing around the Middle East where he would stand out and would only lack the American Flag to identify him as an American.  On a final note I must ask -- does Crowe ever take a bath or shave?  He always looks like a hygenic disaster.  Nevertheless this is an entertaining film and worth seeingss this is an entertaining film and worth seeing

B0013ND30W|4.0|We as a family can watch it on Blu-Ray in the front room, or if me and wifey don't want to be bothered my daughter can go into her room and watch the dvd.    The Blu-Ray was done right and looks fantastic, better than any cartoon I have ever seen that's for sure.    My only complaint is the DVD comes in a paper sleeve, and doesn't \\"plug\\" into the plastic case like a normal disc based media would.  Looking at the design of the case I really don't see any reason why they could not have incorporated a \\"plug\\" for the DVD into the plastic case.  Oh well, just have to be careful not to lose it.  Planet Earth Blu-Ray managed to fit 4 Discs into a dvd sized case so I know it can be done.

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|\\"Crayons\\" is a collection of Donna's new recordings which we have waited for a quite long time. It is a set of various flavours and styles of music, from slow-ballad as \\"Sand on my feet\\", electro-blues \\"Slide over backwards\\", bossa-nova sound of \\"Drivin' down Brasil\\" to dance-hits as \\"Stamp your feet\\" and I'm a fire\\". Variety of music approaches within this album is maybe announcing different music styles which Donna will face in her near future projects: it would be great if we could hear Donna's new project entirely done in electro-bossa-nova style, cooperating with Brazilian contemporary music stars, or electro-blues-y album arranged by some DJs. However, \\"Crayons\\" is puting Donna's beautiful and astonishing voice in new music technological industry background and standards, previously introduced by Madonna. Therefore, many people comment that \\"new Donna Summer\\" is resembling to Madonna's music. I would say that Donna Summer made us always expecting her to be original and intrigant, she used to be the Queen who introduces shocking and revolutionary sound in music (Love to love you baby, I feel love, Hot stuff, MacArthur Park, Last Dance, Enough is enough, She works hard for the money...). Unfortunatelly, \\"Crayons\\" does not contain any original or substantially new approach in (disco/dance) music, but just gives us a sign that \\"Disco Diva\\" is totally awake (after long sleep) and ready to return to her faitfull audience! \\"Crayons\\" could be understood as Donna's transitional step towards her new phase in music, as her investigation or experiment of her voice fitting in new sound technology standards. She already starded this investigation with \\"I got your love\\" and it seems she is prepared for new challenges. However, \\"I feel love\\" still sounds much more fresh, intrigant and \\"new\\" than many of new tunes. \\"Crayons\\" is brilliantly produced CD with magnificent voice of Donna Summer placed in contemporary music technology background standards.
B000P12LWY|2.0|This series begins well, but the quality is not sustained. After three or four episodes it becomes silly, the plot meanders, and attention is sustained only be frequent sex and nudity -- which start out well but soon become crass and pointless, as happened in ROME. The casting is good in some cases, very bad in others.  So after buying the whole set we gave up watching half way.

And I have to say that Sanderson's storytelling keeps getting better and better.<br /><br />Simply said, Brandon Sanderson's books are so good that they're starting to piss me off. It just doesn't seem fair that someone should be about to write this well, this fast.<br /><br />I don't believe in spoilers, so I will say simply this. Everything comes to good resolution in this final book. It all fits. It all makes sense. But at the same time I didn't see it coming. That doesn't happen very often.
0446579939|5.0|Logan Thibault is an ex-marine who has just finished his third tour of Iraq. While serving, he found a picture in the dirt of a young woman, which quickly became his lucky charm. Not only did he win money at poker games, but he also escaped death several times during his marine days.    Now that Logan is out of the military, he's determined to find the woman in the picture. Logan starts walking across the country from Colorado to the small town of Hampton, North Carolina to do just that. Once he arrives in town, he discovers that the woman's name is Elizabeth Clayton, and she lives with her grandmother Nana and her young son Ben. The three of them reside in a house that is attached to Nana's dog kennel, where they train and board dogs. They just happen to be looking for some help when Logan shows up. Nana quickly hires him and Logan and Elizabeth's romance progresses from there.    I would have to say this is easily the best story I've listened to by Mr. Sparks. The characters had me engaged from the beginning all the way to the final chapter. The budding romance between Logan and Elizabeth had me biting my nails and crossing my fingers, especially when her ex-husband (Ben's father) shows up in the story.    John Bedford Lloyd added great narration to the story with strong emotion and a talent for making you fall for Logan, too! If you've never had the pleasure of reading a Nicholas Sparks novel, I'd strongly suggest you give this one a shot!    Armchair Interviews agrees.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|If you want a war move that probes the depths of madness and incorporates surerealism while exploring the lives of soldiers trapped in a pointless microcosm of a wider war, you have two options. Get a pretty lame and boring variation on this theme in Jarhead, or get Apocalypse Now. The later is the infinitely better choice.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Being a die heart Jane Eyre fan I have seen many versions of this classic story. In my opinion this BBC version stands out among the rest. Its captivating portrayal of the classic love story of Jane and Mr. Rochester is full of passion, turns and above all an undying love. Although the movie is a long one, almost four hours long, it is well worth the time spent watching. They focus more on Jane's adult life rather then her childhood, which in my opinion was a good choice, as that's when she meets the adoring Mr. Rochester. If you enjoy romance stories that are full of twists and turns but end in joy this is truly a movie for you. So snuggle up with a cup of tea and enjoy this classic.

You know all you need to do is read a little snippet about this in literature and history books. There is no need to see anything like this at all, ever. You have got to be sick in the head to \\"appreciate\\" this sort of thing, and unintelligent to be able to even justify anything like this at all. Yes we all know Pasolini went berserk, and let it rest there. Don't touch this, folks. Decent people need to force our culture and community to bury this kind of absolute degradation and keep it buried.

0375703764|4.0|I read this on the advice of a friend, and am glad that I bought it, if only because the layout is so weird.  It was definitely an intense read (due to the multiple parallel storylines and occasionally bizarre layout.  However, I couldn't decide if the author had a seriously amazing vision in writing this, or if it is all just a very well realized piece of artistic pretentiousness.
B001E75QGG|3.0|Come on now...aliens? This film had potential being that it was backed by two of the most biggest directors in movie history. This film, like the ending episodes of X-Files, really ruined it for fans. Those that gave it higher ratings are I'm sure die hard fans.<br /><br />I am a big fan myself and that is why I will tell the truth about this flick. The amount of poorly placed CG in this flick was insulting. Even down to them overlaying Harrison's face with a digital one in the motorcycle chase. There is obviously no way a 60+ year old will do all that. And there seemed to be moments where they were going so fast that the editor did not fully match the face together with the stunt actor.<br /><br />You almost want to snatch the ability to create these type of effects from these directors nowadays so they can go back to the basics.<br /><br />if you want to complete your collections by all means pick it up...I will. But as far as really calling it a master piece, no. It's a little dissapointing after a 20 year layoff.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|Remember that scene at the end of `The Silence of the Lambs' where Clarice is in the creepy old house and you just know that Wild Bill is lurking around every dusty corner?  Remember how your heart all but stopped while the scene was running, how you gripped the arm rests in fear as you told yourself over and over again that it was all going to end well; that Clarice was going to get the bad guy and save the girl and whatever else you had to tell yourself in order to make it through?<br /><br />Gather those feelings and relish in them, because that is precisely what every moment of `Blade Runner' feels like.<br /><br />The film takes place in the near future (eleven years to be exact) in the year 2019.  Man has created an equal to themselves, human clones known as replicants, who, equipped with fixed life-spans, can work in the colonies outside of Earth.  When a bloody mutiny breaks out these replicants are labeled illegal.  When a few of these clones escape their Off-World Colony by stealing a ship and make their way to Earth, an ex-Blade Runner (police officers dispatched to hunt down and terminate replicants) named Deckard is asked to come back into the game in order to get rid of them.<br /><br />The kicker with the film, and really what makes it so much more than just a science fiction/action film is the fact that the replicants don't know that they are not human.  They are practically human (except they are not programmed to express human emotion, although they have the capability to learn how to) and so they fear death just as much as you or I.<br /><br />If one looks at `Blade Runner' simply as an action film or a science fiction masterpiece they are bound to be satisfied.  As far as run of the mill blockbusters are concerned, Scott's visionary epic is at the top of the pack; by a long shot.  It is beautifully shot, it is fast paced and thrilling.  The acting is actually very good considering the genre and the usual messy performances that come with.  But, if you take a minute to look at `Blade Runner' as something deeper than all that you come to experience an entirely different and ultimately more rewarding film.  Yes, if you dissect the humanity captures within the films core you will find a very thought provoking film that gropes at our very feelings towards life and death.<br /><br />I remember recalling Sean Penn's devastating words at the end of `Dean Man Walking', where he said that killing is never okay.<br /><br />Instant chills.<br /><br />`Blade Runner' has a style that is probably the films greatest focal point.  To say that Ridley Scott (totally snubbed of an Oscar) is the star of the show is an understatement.  The film is like a really gritty `Fifth Element' with enough horror and even a little noir thrown in for good measure.  Scott effortlessly pans across a universe that seems strangely distant yet almost too real.  We can see ourselves there even if we don't want to.  My best friend told me that `Blade Runner' is his favorite film because it seems too probable.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is brilliantly cast, lending the film his masculine charm.  Rutger Haur is terrifying yet overtly sympathetic at the films end, and Sean Young is devastatingly powerful as Rachael, the `special' replicant who is coming to terms with her own reality.  Daryl Hannah also turns in a great performance as Pris, a beautiful replicant who is as dangerous as she is intoxicating.<br /><br />Everything about `Blade Runner' is stunning, from the set pieces to the actors who inhabit them, and to judge a film on pure surface value alone would place this picture towering above many; but when you add the satisfying substance that marks this films core you can see why `Blade Runner' is considered one of the greatest films of all time.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Okay the writing and story line of this series was awesome!!! kept me hooked but unfortunately the networks had their heads you know where.  Liked the undertone of comedy
B00110K62U|2.0|There is a few glitches in the DVD but I am not going to pay to send it back when it should have come to me in perfect, new condition.  I was not very happy about it.
1931559317|5.0|Really good for intermediates.  You need to know the constellations to make this useful.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Excellent Movie that is safe for the entire family and friends and visitors.  We added this to our collection of movies to have on hand when we have visitors.  It is always great to have a collection of movies that are not only entertaining, but also safe to put into the DVD player regardless of the presence of children or the values of different people.  These types of movies are getting rarer and rarer.
0385340990|3.0|This is one of those books that is a little gimmicky and annoying at first--as is the title--but, if you stick with it, you will get past some of the pretentious writing and then slip into a vivid tale of how strangers find one another and provide the love and support they need after a very harrowing struggle during and after WWII. Overall, it's an enjoyable historical fiction tale that is engrossing enough to make one believe that the events actually occurred.
B000XT1P3E|5.0|These are two of my favorite Julia Roberts movies and two of my favorite movies in general of all time, so I was really happy to see them offered in a twin pack. \\"Notting Hill\\" is a charming romantic comedy with Hugh Grant set in London with a great soundtrack. \\"Erin Brockovich\\" is a true story about how Erin Brockovich fought against corporate giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co. This movie has it all: funny, uplifting, sad and touching. I recently met the real Erin Brockovich Ellis at a conference and she is an amazing lady and very much the way she was portrayed by Julia Roberts in the movie. My husband really enjoys these two movies also. Buy this set and you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll enjoy them both over and over....
B001DHE9KG|5.0|I saw this at the local cineplex in HD.  These are wonderful events for those of us far from New York.  We were thrilled by the performance.  This is the same production (different singers) as the Pioneer DVD which has been available for a long time.<br /><br />When THIS \\"event\\" is available in Blu-Ray...I'll buy it.<br /><br />PS: And I already have the earlier DVD of the Zeffirelli production.
0688145078|5.0|I bought this book for my almost 4 year old son, soon to be a big brother. He loves it so much he asks us to read it every night. But the best part is that he is now looking forward to his baby sister being born or as he put it \\"out of mommy's tummy\\" and that he understands that she would not be able to play \\"trucks\\" with him for a while. He proudly announced to his preschool class that he was going to be a \\"Big Brother\\" and that he was going to help mommy make the baby \\"warm and comfy\\", just like in his book!
B00005JOHC|5.0|We've recently started watching \\"Two and a Half Men\\" in reruns and find it hysterical!  I bought the first season for my husband's birthday last month and we have watched the first three or four episodes.  They always bring on \\"laugh out loud\\" moments!
B001FBSMW6|5.0|Really that's enough said. This album is a step towards a more poppy feel. They've departed a bit from entirely piano driven ballads to a bit more of a rock n roll feel but it works for them. Keane fans won't be dissapointed.
0439023483|5.0|One of the biggest reasons I loved this book isn't because every chapter literally ended with a sentence that made you want to keep reading or because of the romance (which is usually what wins me over, I must say). Rather, it's how deep of a level it reaches. I just finished it, so naturally there hasn't been enough time for reflection, but in these few moments, my stream of thought is going spastic. The book jacket wasn't lying--there's mystery, adventure, romance, suspense, all of that in here. And yet the substance of the novel surpasses just these box-office-hit qualities (which is all I can compare those four adjectives to).<br /><br />The world building was fantastic. While it's quite a different land than current North America, Panem had some disturbing parallels relating to the society, especially of its higher class (the lower-number districts and the Capitol). The fixation with the sappy romance, the fact the games were more like a deadlier reality show of nowadays than anything else, the frivolousness... It was quite unnerving. So clever. Only adds another layer to this story.<br /><br />Not many books have kept me on the edge of my seat. This plot is brilliant. Truth be told, I'm not the biggest fan of thrillers and am fine with books that employ the \\"girl-next-door\\" dynamics to its plot--quiet, but charming and accessible. Well, needless to say, this book is anything but quiet. But it is bewitching.<br /><br />You know what? I'll stop. There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. Plus I could stay here all night. I wasn't kidding when I said my mind is going spastic with all the directions this book gives it to think things out.<br /><br />Not recommending it to everyone though. Some really hate violence. Some really hate dystopia. I'd still give it a shot if you're one of those people, but I wouldn't specifically recommend it to you. Everyone else? Knock yourselves out. This is one of the ultimate must-reads right in front of you.<br /><br />But in short: this book is AWESOME.

B001E1DJD4|5.0|For awhile, I was afraid that Rachel Yamagata would fade into the limelight. But Yamagata's second album, \\"Elephants...Teeth Sinking Into Heart\\" is a saucy collection of soft intimate songs with alternative punk rock songs at the end.<br /><br />It's extraordinary to hear Yamagata sing with a croon that Norah Jones would be jealous of. With the help of producer Mike Mogis, she turns \\"What If I Leave\\" into a gorgeous soft jazz song with beautiful string arrangements.<br /><br />Of course, that song isn't as emphatic as the nine-minute epic \\"Sunday Afternoon,\\" in which Yamagata turns from a soft kitten to a ferocious tiger, with a resounding orchestra to back her up. Yamagata goes all out in this song, singing \\"I'm not gonna live for you, or die for you/Won't do anything anymore for you/'Cause you leave me here on the other side.\\" Yamagata is a soul shaker in this epic, even as she softens to a quiet murmur.<br /><br />And that's just the first disc. In the second half, \\"Teeth Sinking Into Heart,\\" Yamagata switches to electric guitar jams. In fact, she even resorts to strumming loud electric guitar punk chords in the song \\"Accident.\\" In-between all of the drummers excellent fast drum rolls, Yamagata sings \\"I think he's gonna to be a big star/a voice of social change to rearrange the world's perspective/but there's nothing better than watching him down.\\" Obviously, Yamagata is a little sick with a certain president named Dubya, singing \\"all of this talking and all of this chatter is making me sick, even though they say it doesn't matter.\\"<br /><br />Even though Yamagata doesn't sing in the higher registers in her loud songs, she's still pretty menacing as an alto. And she works very well with producers to play awesome compositions for her songs. However, the first half, \\"Elephants,\\" is the real meat of the album, in which Yamagata sings her heart out in soft, jazzy eight- and nine-minute songs. It's a beautiful testament to Yamagata's progress so far as one of the best and most multi-talented female singers to date.singers to date.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I loved this movie so much on the big screen, I'm buying it for me and my closest girlfriends for gifts.  This movie is about the special bond women have with their closest friends and no matter what happens in their lives, they are there to support each other.  I know some of the reviewers thought it was predictable.  And it was somewhat.  But the deeper message of this movie is what I loved about it and and why I'm buying so many copies of it for my friends.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|The album starts off with a string of four songs that sound like an 80's pop music nightmare. I actually had trouble getting through these songs, and was extremely disappointed. After the beautifully original previous album \\"Under The Iron Sea\\", I couldn't believe my ears.<br /><br />Luckily, once track five rolls around (the title track, \\"Perfect Symmetry\\"), the rest of the album really takes off. It's dynamic, unique, and the final minute or so of \\"Love is the End\\" is a rare combination of power and beauty that just doesn't come around often enough.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Keane, I'm sure you'll be happy with this album because it's got something for everyone. I'm sure some people will enjoy the earlier tracks that I didn't care for, and anyone who doesn't will definitely enjoy the other half.
B000V86OKG|3.0|Many people have written a review of the series itself, but I haven't seen anybody yet mention that the special feature on this dvd are worthless!    Am I the only one who buys dvd tv shows and enjoys the odd interview with the cast members and a little behind the scenes here and there? I dunno, it just seems that it wouldn't cost so much to have a few words with Michael about what he thinks of his character, as he is certainly one of the oddest tv creations of recent years. My Sopranos, CSI and Oz dvds have a bucket load of features, and I'd be happy to throw an extra 5 bucks at a dvd set that gave me a little something extra than what I saw on cable tv.   I'm also slightly miffed that they offer the first episode of season 3 as a 'sneek peek' and then when I click on the feature it tells me to buy some crappy dvd set that I'm not interested in buying to see it.   Am I wrong? The show is great, I'd like to give it a 4 star but my disappointment of the lack of extras takes off a star. I hope Showtime puts more effort in to making the season 3 dvds worth a bit more to those of us prepared to shell out the extra bucks on having this on our shelf.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|Beautifully crafted and acted movie pays homage to the wonderful and witty Tv series. A scrumptious treat for lovers and admirers of the show for years. Thank you for this gift!!
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr is just as good as the other 2 books in the trilogy and maybe a little better.  Eragon has become a man and it is exciting to see what will happen to him next.  A definite must for any fantasy reader.
0425220931|1.0|I will state first that my spiritual beliefs are liberal, so I am not giving this book a poor review because it goes against any \\"dogma\\" I may have.  I agreed with everyone's review who mentioned how great a bass player Victor is.   So why one star?  Because this is rehashed, 101, 1960 new age type philosophy (I hate to use the term as this is so elemental a book on music and spiritually).  What we need is a complex discussion of the two, and there are examples do a google or Amazon search, of books, thesis and Research studies in the fields of Anthropology, Ethnomusicology, and even in books which discuss practicing an instrument.  I brought this book without really looking at it, since I assumethat Victor's writing would be as interesting and informative as his playing. Wrong.     My recommendation:  Read someone else on this topic.
B000B5XOXY|3.0|'Batman Forever' had many roadblocks to break through to get made! First off, the studio was afraid to let Burton direct another Batman film fearing it would be so dark, it would appall the general audience. Second this made Keaton uneasy about committing to the new film, so...... enter Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer(Keaton's lips replacement). The only thing left of Burton in this film is the opening WB logo turning to Dark Knight ala the first two Batman films and the ending at the creepy Arkham Asylum, in between is a lot of Burton imitations,....so maybe the folks watching won't notice...I guess?<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's impossible not to notice as this cartoon vision of the Dark Knight unfolds into a psychedelic acid laced circus! Two great performances by are next pecking order villains Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face and Jim Carrey as The Riddler. While over the top they both fit the film's cartoon-ish acid nightmare style and make this film better than it is. One villain would have been plenty, but we all know you can't make a third movie without adding way too much of everything!<br /><br />There is no danger, this is pure fantasy and Batman can do whatever comes to mind, without the aid of his \\"Batgadgets\\", although he has many. Surprisingly this film does resemble the Batman comics of the late 40's and 50's, which is a period that I really don't care for. The action is big, loud and campy like the TV show,but not an good. The psychological aspect doesn't work either, but the film is entertaining to a point, in a juvenile way. I could have done without the quick cuts of Batman's nipples, crotch and butt!... What's up with that? I give the film 2 1/2 stars and the 2 disc special edition boost it to 3 stars. It's DVD transfer is excellent and the 2 disc has more than enough extras for this film......now if I can just get through 'Batman & Robin\\"! ;-b
B001CVCB9O|4.0|It took me quite a few listens to get into this album. Maybe I'm just sick of leftist politics in music. Victor Jara's Hands is a beautiful song but it alludes to a guy who was in a position to become Communist Salvador Allende's own Che Guevara had Allende not been overthrown. And Guevara, despite his iconic status on the left, was little more than a mass murderer who cloaked his actions in the language of idealism. I notice there are a lot of people on the activist left who champion political murder as long as its the right people being murdered but howl like banshees when one of their own gets it.  Despite the occasional outbreak of leftist sentiment in Calexico lyrics, there is a lot to like in both the music itself and the way it is interpreted. I have four other Calexico albums and I think Carried To Dust stands tall with the best of them. My favorites here are Two Silver Trees; The News About William; the growling, gritty Man Made Lake; the well-crafted and evocative Inspiracion; and the fast-paced, distinctively Western El Gatillo (Trigger Revisited).  Though Carried To Dust may not have the power of Feast of Wire and Convict Pool, it is certainly a good album in its own right and one that should please Calexico's legions of fans. I am determined to ignore the leftist twaddle and just hear the great music. I'm already looking forward to their next one.
0312360266|3.0|The story itself is great, so much promise... the book though... The writing is fairly bad, even for a young adult book. The characters are obnoxious and inaccurate depictions of high school kids. The dialog is often unbelievable. The timeline is ridiculous. There is a reason that Harry Potter spanned several years and the Twilight series nearly 2 (or 3?). It's hard to believe that THAT much horrible, unbelievable, crazy stuff happens in a month (I'm speaking to the whole series, not just this book). Also, most young adult books try to avoid dropping the eff word and being overly explicit with sex scenes. While, as an adult, I was a little disappointed when the Edward and Bella's scene got glossed over -- I would have been suprised if it had been presented as it is in this series. If you're a parent who is uptight about those sorts of things, skip over this series and find another.    Overall... an OK series. I wouldn't read it again, but I'm upset that I'll never get that time back either.
B00005BIIP|4.0|Though I have not been a Porcupine Tree fan from the very beginning, I have been making up for my laggard ways by delving into anything and everything I can find that they've recorded. And that they are on the verge of mass popularity I have no doubt when you consider the number of some of their scarcer CDs being sold on the secondary market for serious money.  I won't rehash what's already been said here about Recordings, I'll just throw in my two cent's worth. To those who are new to Porcupine Tree, you have to realize that this collection of B-sides is head and shoulders above most bands' A-list material. The phenomenon that is Porcupine Tree never ceases to amaze me.  I like every song to some degree but there are a few real standouts. The best two are masterpieces Buying New Soul and Even Less. I also greatly enjoy the acoustic psychodrama of Cure For Optimism and a pair of instrumentals, Untitled and Ambulance Chasing.  Its too bad about the price here, it will certainly keep many from buying Recordings. My patience was rewarded recently when I found my copy for a very good price at a favorite record store. Even though this is the flotsam and jetsam of a few recording sessions, I highly recommend it if you are able to eventually find it at a price that's not stratospheric. Fans' best hope is that PT will re-release this and other rare recordings, making them available at a fair price to a growing legion of fans.
B00102F5WK|5.0|\\"I fear you speak upon the rack, where men enforced do speak anything.\\"<br /><br />That's a line from Shakespeare's THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, and it's also a key theme in RENDITION, a disturbing, yet very good film, released onto DVD by New Line Home Entertainment.<br /><br />Omar Metwally plays an Egyptian citizen, a successful chemical engineer who has lived in the United States since he was 14-years old.  He's married to Reese Witherspoon, has a young son and another child on the way.<br /><br />On his way back to his home in Chicago from a scientific conference in South Africa, he is intercepted at the Washington D.C. airport and taken into custody by the CIA.  They believe he is a terrorist and may be responsible for a recent bombing in North Africa.  Even though he passes a lie detector test and there is no credible evidence against him, CIA chief Meryl Streep orders that he be sent back to Africa for interrogation and torture.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays a low level CIA agent, assigned to oversee Metwally's interrogation.  He becomes increasingly uncomfortable with what he observes, particularly after he becomes convinced that the man is innocent.<br /><br />Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard are cast as the U.S. Senator and his chief aide to whom Witherspoon turns when her husband disappears.<br /><br />RENDITION, directed by Gavin Hood, is a tense, exciting political thriller that follows multiple characters and storylines to a powerful climax.  There is also a major surprise near the end of the film.<br /><br />Special features on the DVD include audio commentary by Hood, several deleted scenes, a \\"Making of\\" documentary and another documentary that shows that events like those portrayed in this film actually happen.
1400063515|4.0|Nicholas Taleb är född i Libanon, doktor i finansiell ekonomi och före detta börsmäklare på Wall Street. Hans bok The Black Swan var 2007 års facklitterära bästsäljare på nätbokhandeln Amazon. Den har översatts till 27 språk och recenserats i mängder av tidningar, magasin, TV-program och bloggar. The Black Swan är en personlig berättelse om historia, kunskapsteori, sannolikhetslära, beslutsfattande och kognitiv psykologi.    Boktiteln syftar på en högst osannolik händelse som i huvudsak har tre karaktärsdrag: den är oförutsägbar, den har stor inverkan och efter att den inträffat konstruerar vi en förklaring som får den att framstå som mer förutsägbar än den faktiskt var. Den 11 september 2001 och tsunamikatastrofen 2004 är exempel på svarta svanar, menar Taleb, men de finns genom mänsklighetens hela historia och även i våra personliga liv. Inom framtidsstudier talas det om begreppet wild card (joker) som betyder ungefär samma sak som svart svan.    Metaforen bygger på den gamla västerländska föreställningen om att alla svanar är vita. När européerna senare upptäckte Australien såg de för första gången att det även finns svarta svanar. En svart svan blev på så sätt en metafor för det högst osannolika och oförutsägbara.    Talebs berättarstil är arrogant men också tankeväckande och humoristisk; han är en naturlig provokatör som njuter av att sparka mot intellektuella eliter och vad han uppfattar som bedrägliga vetenskapliga konventioner. Han underkänner hela det ekonomiska och samhällsvetenskapliga kollektivet vars teorier och modeller utgår från det normala och genomsnittliga. Studiet av det normala är ofta irrelevant för framtiden, menar Taleb, och doktrinen om den statistiska normalfördelningen har invaggat vetenskapen i tron att vi lyckats bemästrat det osäkra, det osannolika.     Nästan alla samhällsforskare arbetar under denna falska tro som Taleb kallar den stora intellektuella bluffen. Ekonomer och planerare räknar inte med de återverkningar som extraordinära händelser för med sig - de är offer för prognostisering inside the box - och är inte bättre på att göra förutsägelser än astrologer som spår i stjärnorna.     Han finner det skandalöst hur vi - trots att erfarenheten visar på motsatsen - fortsätter med trendframskrivningar och prognoser som utesluter avvikelser och extraordinära händelser. Vi luras alltför lätt av dem som vill ledsaga oss in i framtiden med vad Taleb kallar nerd knowledge, missledande matematiska formler som behandlar världen som ett spel där omständigheterna är kända och utfallet kan kalkyleras tillförlitligt och precist.     Vår förmåga att modellera och förutse världen har tvärtom minskat med dess tilltagande komplexitet, menar Taleb, vilket tyder på att det oförutsägbara, de svarta svanarna, får en växande roll.    Vi bör vara frisinnade, bottom-up, skeptiska, praktiska och empiriska för att bättre förstå världens osäkerhet och risk, och inte förlita oss på den konventionella, top-down, teoretiska och fördomsfulla huvudfåran (Taleb benämner den platonisk) som inriktar sig på förutsägelser och prognoser. Hans förebilder är matematikern Henri Poincaré, vetenskapsteoretikern Karl Popper, ekonomen Friedrich Hayek, psykologerna Daniel Kahneman och Amos Tversky samt beslutsteoretikern Howard Raiffa.    Taleb hänvisar framför allt till Popper och dennes samhällsvetenskapliga angreppssätt, piecemeal tinkering, och kritik mot möjligheten att förutsäga historiens utveckling.     Taleb tar följande exempel för att illustrera Poppers tankar. Föreställ dig att du är en medeltida prognosmakare som får i uppdrag att förutspå vad som sker i framtiden. För att lyckas med det måste du förutse bland annat ångmaskinen, elektriciteten, atombomben och internet. Annars missar du hela den historiska utvecklingen och därmed också framtiden. Men om du lyckas förutsede tekniska genombrotten (och se in i den kommande historien), då vet du vad en ångmaskin, elektricitet, atombomb och internet är - vilket innebär att du också har uppfunnit dem.     Mer kortfattat uttrycker Taleb resonemanget så här: För att förstå framtiden till den grad att du kan förutse den, måste du införliva element från framtiden. Argumentet är egentligen så fundamentalt att det nästan framstår som trivialt; det intressanta är varför vi inte tar mer hänsyn till detta. Poppers \\"bevis\\" går givetvis att problematisera, vilket Taleb avstår från.     Varför blev boken en sådan succé? Den innehåller ju ingenting nytt. Kritiken av den induktiva metoden (som Black Swan theory i huvudsak bygger på) och alla andra frågeställningar och teorier Taleb refererar till är väl kända inom vetenskapssamhället. Min tolkning är att framgången beror på Talebs personliga och anekdotiska berättarstil, hans förmåga att förklara enkelt och roligt för en bred publik sådant som tidigare var förbehållet en elit av filosofer och forskare. Framgångsformeln är uppror, självsäkerhet och humor. The Black Swan är en osannolik bedrift som tilltalat läsare världen över - en svart svan helt enkelt.

There's a curse in Penelope's family that was cast many many years ago, and her mother has been finding a way to break it. Men have run away from her time and again, until one. Of course, he turns out to not be the one they think he is, and Penelope decides to venture out in the world against her mother's better wishes. It's sweet, funny, romantic, and very uplifting.
B000VUQ4HW|4.0|Great acting, great scenery and chilling story; Dracula, the master is back<br /><br />The movie was released in 1922, but in 1994 it was named one of the top five German films of all time.<br />That just goes to show you that great work goes stronger with time. The greatness of silent movies originates from the difficulty of telling the story and in this silent great work, terror is a mission greatly accomplished.<br /><br />Just a side note; the music wasn't good, but knowing that it isn't the original music of the movie, that just doesn't count.
0694003611|5.0|This is a very sweet book.  I had to read it at least twenty times in the same week to my children. They love it.  I highly recommend this book.

0810979772|5.0|My lovely granddaughter read the first two Wimpy Kid books and enjoyed them immensely so we ordered this one and she absolutely loves it.  There are so many ideas, suggestions, things to think about and things to do with this book, to make it the child's own creation.  Can't go wrong.  We've also pre-ordered the next one, can't wait!
B000P12LWY|4.0|I never watched The Tudors prior to purchasing the first season on DVD, but I was very pleased with my purchase.  The show is fun and exciting, but you must be a fan of drinking, sex, and bad language in order to enjoy it as much as I do.
B001E7X4M4|5.0|UNEARTH have fired back with THE MARCH. Everything that made \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" a great metal record is back in play on THE MARCH. Lead off track \\"My Will Be Done\\" displays (much like \\"Zombie Autopilot) all the UNEARTH trademarks that set the band apart from all the other here today, gone tomorrow metal/hardcore bands. Lead guitarist Buz McGrath is definitely on display here as well, showing why he is one of the sickest guitarists currently in metal...more listens are bound to impress, but on first listen, I'm absolutely diggin THE MARCH!
078322933X|5.0|I liked this movie alot, I liked it from beginning to end, I liked that is had drama the whole time, I hope another movie comes out like this one.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|I saw this movie in the the theaters and the plot was entertaining and interesting to a degree but predicatable and Jolie's acting not at its best, same is to be said about freeman's but I'll be damned McAvoy is sexy, yum yum.

B001BGTWXI|5.0|If you liked the previous Slipknot and Stone Sour albums, this album won't disappoint.  It is still hard and there are enough new elements to this album to keep it interesting.
0780631684|4.0|Ok, I am new to the \\"Final Destination\\" horror films, as horror is not my genre. I actually saw the 3rd one first, and became intrigued by the \\"cheating death or did they\\" plot. Last weekened, TNT had a showing of all 3 and for a lark I recorded them all (which will nicely fit on a 6 hour DVD).    I saw FD-1, and let me say, that it was interesting, and thought-provoking. It had it's moments and if you remember it's fiction, I think you will enjoy it better. As one person said, don't take it too seriously. You really don't want to keep running around scared to death and looking at everything like it's going to kill you.    None of us knows how we would react if something like that would happen to us. Would we panic, go insane, be grateful we were saved, be more careful, or wonder \\"was it really my time, and my selfishness to save my own butt caused the death of my friends\\". So, given all of the youth \\"I'm going to live forever\\" ideas, young kids who don't know how to deal with death (maybe they didn't have to) and fiction, it's worth 4 stars.    The movie starts out like life, you begin by thinking you got your whole life ahead of you, then you get to the airport.     Yes, a plane disaster, like we haven't seen or read about them before.     BUT, this one is a little different. One of the guys, Alex, is sitting in his seat for a moment (the whole numerology deal starts clicking; he was born 9-25, flight 925, ROW I (9) SEAT-25), then has a \\"vision or premonition\\" of the whole disaster. He freaks out & how many of us wouldn't?? He jumps up, alerting the crafts personnel and irritating a few other people (Kerr Smith's character--Carter). Teachers and students are dragged off the plane, and while chaos ensues, the crafts disembarks and explodes, as he said it would.     Of course the FBI being suspicious won't stop following him, even though the cause was \\"mechanical failure\\". The FBI doesn't believe in premonitions or the like.     That accident sets off a chain reaction to the whole death-master plan design. One by one, freakish accidents plague the survivors in the order they would have died had they stayed on the plane. Of course we don't know about such things as there are usually no surviors or instances where this has happened recently, so we don't know how true this theory is, it could make sense if you are open-minded.    Since Tod lost his brother on the flight, it is assumed he committed suicide, and he's the first to die. Then, it's the antagonist's girlfriend (Terry) who was next--killed quite freakishly after telling Carter to \\"drop dead\\". Then, the surviving teacher's freakish accident.     By this time, Alex realizes he might be able to cheat death and keep the others alive, and sets out to do just that. After saving Carter, another character (Billy) is rambling on about Carter being dead and is hit by a piece of debris from Carter's car versus train incident, leaving just Alex, Carter and the girl (Clear or Claire).     As of note, doors do not lock by themselves, BUT since he was on a train track, it is feasible the vibration from the coming train caused them to lock as they were the manual locks and relied on being \\"pushed down\\" (gravity/velocity type of thing??).     Since they figured they survived they run off, but Alex realizes Clear is next and sets out to save her, which he does. 6 months later they are in Paris (their \\"final\\" destination at the beginning), and after hearing the song \\"Rocky Mountain High\\", which preceded most of the other deaths, they realize they might not have cheated death and the movie ends with Carter sacrificing himself to save Alex.    And, as predictable there are going to be sequels.     FD-1 is pretty good entertainment, thought-provoking, plot is slightly recycled in the whole \\"teen death/slasher\\" genre, slightly over used \\"edge of seat\\" plot as well.    Watch it on the TV first. If you're really intriugued keep it on DVR or find the DVD cheap ($10 and lower), try Walmart $5 binor thier $7.50 stack. If you must have the whole series, buy the triology on Amazon for under $25.
B001HMSFFC|1.0|Make no mistake about it, this is a horrible movie.  Odd, since I was a fan of the series.  So here we are 4 years later in their lives, and the four girls have been reduced to caricatures of themselves that make it impossible to care about them.  Charlottes's wide-eyed innocence has grown into an immature stupidity, Miranda has gone from being driven to being old, tired, and bitchy.  Meanwhile, Samantha has become an over the hill tramp that will grate on you like fingernails on a blackboard.  But worst of all is Carrie, whose witty and insightful observations from the series have been replaced by a totally self absorbed whiner who deserves the heartbreak she must endure from her faux fashion accessory Big.<br />Do your self a favor and avoid this movie, particularly if you are a fan of the series...leave well enough alone.
1594489505|5.0|First off, I must say that this is an important book. There are some reviewers who claim that Khaled Hosseini must have written this with the western reader in mind. This may be true, but in my opinion it is a good thing. He has brought the plight of Afghanistan into the living rooms of those who live in the free world. Some of us may not have ever known or bothered to learn about the horrors that have taken place there; this book makes it personal. I cared about, cried with and for Mariam, Laila, Tariq and their families. I was outraged on their behalf. I wept many times while reading about Mariam's strength of endurance and what it cost her. I wanted to kill Rasheed, Mariam and Laila's sadistic husband. The depiction of the Taliban's sadistic regime left me feeling shell-shocked and harrowed. I honestly don't know how anyone survives such things as these.<br />There are other reviewers who claim that the \\"fairy-tale happy ending\\" ruined the story for them, that it was unrealistic. Well, I did a little research on Kabul. It seems a western reporter went there and remarked to a survivor in Kabul that everyone must be in terrible sorrow. \\"Are you kidding?\\" responded the survivor. \\"We are happy! After all this to finally have some peace, it is a happy thing!\\" Out of the horse's mouth. So it seems Mr. Hosseini's ending was not so far off the mark of reality after all.<br />This is an important book because of all that it made me feel, and I am thankful to live in a country where Afghani expatriates are free to write books like this. My life is richer for the experience and privelege of reading A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|For an hour and fifty minutes, this movie manages to achieve something no Hollywood product has done all year: sustain a non-stop level of excitement and interest. Very seldom do I purchase a DVD just on the basis of the Amazon.com reviews and recomendations and I'm glad because up to this point of the year (October 13th.), it's the best film I've seen all year. There were even a couple of jokes that I saw a long time coming but made me burst out laughing anyway. That's the kind of movie this is.
B000AQBAUI|2.0|This album is okay.  I wanted to like it a lot more than I did.  The artwork is great; the music is so-so.  Kind of like a collection of Free demos.  I've listened to it a few times, but it never really struck a chord with me.
1932907009|2.0|If you are serious about screenwriting (and if you're not, why would you want to read a book like this?), take the time to read Robert McKee's far superior, and far longer, \\"Story.\\"  This reads like a very dumbed-down version of \\"Story\\" and favors rigid formula over story-telling principles.  Also, as many point out, Snyder is a big fan of lame, middle of the road movies.  Inexplicably, he says Memento (one of the greatest movies of the decade) is an example of bad screenwriting and backs this up based on its poor box-office performance (I seem to recall it playing at two of the local art-houses in my town for about six months - and the writer/director going on to make Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, while Snyder has had no movies produced in the last 15 years or so). Then, he points to \\"Miss Congeniality\\" (!) as an example of great screenwriting, based on the fact it made $100 million.  If that sounds about right to you, then by all means buy this book.  The book does contain some tried and true principles on screenwriting - as do about 20 other titles on the market - but if you want to make a go of this, I would check out Story instead.
0345440900|5.0|Like most parents today, we were overwhelmed by the amount of advice given to us by family, friends, and other books about good sleep habits for our little guy. Basically we kept feeding him on demand which was okay in the beginning but he didn't need it after a while. Plus I kept interpreting every cry as a cry for food. Finally after two and a half months of getting short stretches of sleep totaling maybe 3 hours a night and dealing with postpartum issues, we had to make a change.     This book gave us a plan to follow and made us realize that routine is not all that bad. We have been using the plan for a week and it has made a difference and brought back some sanity. My baby is now waking once or twice a night to feed as opposed to every two hours! It's not a perfect book but it is working for us right now.
B0018M6J90|4.0|I like quirky and slow moving films that are full of characters and creative elements. I liked Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day because that's exactly what kind of movie it is.<br /><br />Miss Pettigrew, (McDormand) in a desperate attempt to stay off the streets hijacks an opportunity to become a social secretary for a very flaky and lost Delysia (Adams). Delysia, in an attempt to grasp stardom has scrambled and manipulated her way into a messy love quadrangle -- 3 guys with expectations. Miss Pettigrew shares her wisdom borne of regret and loss and interacts with Delysia's \\"friends.\\"<br /><br />The lifestyle of Delysia including suggestive comments, a naked man (back and side view), and a flashes of Delysia in her dressing room make this movie not appropriate for children. The message is uplifting and sweet. A happy ending is provided. Dialog and characterization are rich, as are the musical elements. Lee Pace is charming and I always appreciate the acting skill of Ciaran Hinds.<br /><br />There are moments of Lucille Ball type comedy, a hint of Mary Poppins and Nanny McPhee, a melancholy that wends its way through the film, and downright charm. There were several moments and situations that cross over into unbelievable, but I can forgive those because of the underlying heart of the film.<br /><br />I'll end up buying this film for my library.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Testament has always been my second fav thrash band after Megadeth and i enjoyed all their albums from the legacy through the gathering, except demonic. All i can say here is that, 8 years absence does NOT make them rusty, the line up is in fact the best they ever had! 4 original members + Paul Bostaph!! The first track \\"More then meets the eye\\" is no doubt my fav song on this one, a quality crunching thrash riff with blazing yet melodic solo! Chuck Billy vocal is just as strong as in Gathering, he always deliver no matter clean or growl. The drum fill by Paul Bostaph through out the album is really impressive. Other fav tracks<br />are Evil has landed, Dangers of the faithless, Afterlife and finally one of the best Testament song, Henchman ride!, this one really has thrashing tempo with Brutal riffing and fast solo!<br /><br />To be honest, this album will not grow on you with just 2-3 listen, you'll need at least 10! then you'll start to reliase how brutal Testament riff can be. I also dig the album cover as it has a really good artwork and very detailed. So, for all thrasher, you'll certeintly will like this one as long you dont give up on it in just 3listens.
0375826726|5.0|I just finished reading Brisingr, and must say I enjoyed this book very much, and am impatient to read the next and hopefully last book of the series. 'Hopefully last' only because I want to see how it all ends and not because it's not a good story. I did find that some parts were overly long, and dragged a little. The sword-making bit, Christopher, if you're reading this, really was unnecessary to go on for so many pages! It's obvious that it's only been put in because of the amount of research you probably put in. I hope you will resist the urge in the final book :)    There was one tiny but glaring mistake: when someone says/thinks \\"he could care less\\" - the common error made in colloquial English, when the person actually means \\"he couldn't care less\\".     Otherwise I admire your skills and maturity of writing, very well done!
B000W1V5VU|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise.  I found myself laughing out loud, especially at some of the antics of Linus (Matt Damon's character).  It was fun to see the crew together again and up to their old tricks.  This time the stakes were higher, the technology more sophisticated, and the tricks sneakier.  A couple of new characters are thrown into the mix, plus some old characters brought in with new roles.  I was expecting a variation on the two previous movies, and to a certain degree this was true, but the whole fun of these films is to watch the gang in action (outlaying how many millions to get the job done? but isn't that part of the irony?), detail by minute detail as they lay out the plan, implement it, and meet all obstacles, foreseen and unforeseen.  The Brat Pack is a wonderful mix of personalities, each with his own unique gifts, quirks, and sheer genius.  My favorite is Linus, who has grown up since Ocean's Eleven (even if his folks have to bail him out regularly).  Of course, Danny Ocean and Rusty (Brad Pitt) are suave and, mostly, keep their cool.  Lots of action, clever plays, and even more clever dialogue.  You might want to replay it just to catch the bits of dialogue you missed the first time.  Highly recommended for anyone who likes to see that the house doesn't always win.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|because of the times was my first album by KOL and i love that album then i bought an older one (Aha Shake) and thought it was \\"good\\" so i wasn't sure what to think of there lastest until i listened in full and i have to say it rocks.  if you liked \\"the times\\" like myself, you will love this album...thank you kings, for not sucking.
0765318741|5.0|I Am Legend - In this most popular collection of shorts, the novella 'I Am Legend' has turned out to be a timeless piece of horror.  Originally written in 1954, it takes place in the future of 1976.  Robert Neville finds himself alone as a human in a sea of vampiristic creatures who once were human beings.  After losing his wife and daughter to the \\"sickness\\", he turns his house into a fortress and spends his time drinking heavily and studying blood and bacterium.  He discovers the \\"vampires\\" are actually victims of a bacterium, and begins to frequently experiment on cures and repellents as he hunts out the living dead during the day.  Some are truly dead, but others, though only coming out at night, still breathe in their hidden cubbies.  Neville kills them all; after all, they're ALL the enemy, gathering on his lawn night after night, wanting in.  When Neville finally does meet a woman (Ruth) in daylight, he discovers he has become too much of a loner, leaving him very suspicious of Ruth.  After she leaves, following an 'altercation' I won't explain, she gives him a warning.  But is it too late for Neville to hear her message?  In the end, Robert truly is a legend.<br /><br />'I Am Legend' is a classic novella of terror, isolation, and the human condition.  You can't help but think of a herd animal segregated from it's herd, and how much anxiety and behavioral changes that animal would make.  It's been used for three movies; 1964's 'The Last Man On Earth', 1971's 'The Omega Man' (starring Charlton Heston), and 2007's 'I Am Legend' (starring Will Smith).  The book, however, is a collection of shorts that are all good.  Here's a quick summary of the other stories in the book:<br /><br />· Buried Talents - An odd man wins a carnival game.<br />· The Near Departed - Very short story of funeral arrangements<br />· Prey - A strange little doll comes to life<br />· Witch War - Seven pretty little girls win a military battle<br />· Dance Of The Dead - An innocent girl gets corrupted by wild friends who take her to a bar where the \\"Loopy's\\" dance<br />· Dress Of White Silk - Strange but flat tale of a young girl and her dead mother's white silk dress.<br />· Mad House - An angry man with a volcanic temper passes along his rage into the very fiber of his house<br />· The Funeral - A Vampire funeral starts a fad<br />· From Shadowed Places - An ancient African ritual must be performed to save a man's life<br />· Person To Person - A man receives phone calls inside his head, but who are they coming from?<br /><br />The novella 'I Am Legend' is a must-read horror classic.  The other stories included in the book were written between 1952 through 1987.  Matheson was an artist of horror and science fiction writing, a master at his craft.  If this is the first Matheson book you pick up, you'll be hooked and want to try out his novel length books, all of which are timeless regardless of the era he wrote them in.  Definitely worth a purchase.  Enjoy!who take her to a bar where the \\"Loopy's\\" dance  · Dress Of White Silk - Strange but flat tale of a young girl and her dead mother's white silk dress.  · Mad House - An angry man with a volcanic temper passes along his rage into the very fiber of his house  · The Funeral - A Vampire funeral starts a fad  · From Shadowed Places - An ancient African ritual must be performed to save a man's life  · Person To Person - A man receives phone calls inside his head, but who are they coming from?

B000H0MKOC|3.0|'Thank You For Smoking' is a satire/comedy of the industry of Big Tobacco.  Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is the Vice President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies, and calls himself the Colonel Sanders of Nicotine.  He's divorced, but stays very involved in Joey's (his twelve year old son) life.  Joey (Cameron Bright - Running Scared, The Butterfly Effect) looks up to his father, often seeing him in a Godlike way.<br /><br />Nick belongs to what they call the MOD Squad (Merchants Of Death).  He and his two friends, Polly Bailey (Maria Bello - Secret Window) who works for the Moderation Council and is an alcoholic, and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner) who works for SAFETY (The Society for the Advancement of Firearms and Effective Training for Youth), meet for lunch one a week and discuss the deaths related to their current jobs.<br /><br />The movie begins with Nick appearing on the Joan Lunden show, against anti-tobacco groups and a young boy suffering from tobacco related cancer.  Nick, the best of the spin-artists, walks away smelling like a rose.  On his case over his defense of Big Tobacco is Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), who leads a sub-committee dedicated to labeling cigarettes with the skull and crossbones poison symbol.<br /><br />Nick, while waiting for the sub-committee hearing, travels to see The Captain (Robert Duvall), head of the tobacco company and founder of Nick's employer.  Nick's boss stole his idea to use Hollywood to promote tobacco (by getting stars to smoke on screen) and the Captain wants Nick to fly to California to get the ball rolling.  Taking Joey along, Nick meets with Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), a Hollywood super agent who heads up EGO (Entertainment Global Offices).  (Jeff and the whole Hollywood scene is so over-the-top \\"typical\\" that it's hilarious)  Jeff and Nick agree on 25 Million dollars to get Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones to smoke on screen after a futuristic $ex scene. (unbelievable!)  While in California, he takes a huge money payoff to the original Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott) who's now dying of lung cancer.  He also appears on the Dennis Miller show against Senator Finistirre, and receives a death threat from a caller.<br /><br />Nick comments on his life as being the most hated person on Earth.  It's pretty much true.  He's kidnapped, stripped, covered in nicotine patches and left at the Lincoln statue.  He almost dies and can never smoke again because of the overdose, but spins it into how cigarettes saved his life because a non-smoker would have died.  The reporter he's dating, Heather, takes all their private pillow talks and publishes an extremely derogatory article about him.  (You'll have to watch the movie to see how he pays her back)  Nick has to balance his life between his moral-less job and being a father to his son.  The things he teaches Joey aren't right or wrong but how to win, an approach Joey's mother disapproves of.<br /><br />Whether you're a non-smoker or even a smoker, the actions of the Big Tobacco will make you red with fury.  Eckhart plays a good role as Nick, totally unconcerned with his job as lobbyist for a known killer.  (as expressed in the meetings of the MOD Squad)  Though not based on a true story or even real statistical facts, the casual way Big Tobacco treats their \\"customer's\\" lives rings true.  Adding in Polly and Bobby Ray as advocates of alcohol and firearms holds a certain irony to the film.  Though the movie has a good premise (as far as satire goes) and an excellent cast who all perform well, it never quite advances itself into either comedy or drama.  The pace is a little to slow, and the debates not long enough or heated enough.  It's interesting enough if you want to watch a benignly evil man do his effort to spread poison, but not worthy of a purchase.  Rent first.

B001E95ZNI|4.0|Once upon a time, 2008's \\"Appaloosa\\" would have been just another entertaining western drama.  Horse operas are now scarce, and good ones scarcer still.  \\"Appaloosa\\" pays homage to all the best old westerns, and if it doesn't say anything terribly original, it does say it well.<br /><br />The small town of Appaloosa, New Mexico, is terrorized by a lawless gang led by the ruthless Randall Bragg (a weathered Jeremy Irons).  In the opening sequence, Bragg murders the city marshal and two deputies just after finishing his morning coffee.  In despair, the town fathers of Appaloosa hire two itinerant lawman, Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch (Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen in a classic, laconic partnership) to clean up the town.  Cole and Hitch quickly assert their authority, gunning down three of Bragg's thugs, then winning a bloodless faceoff with Bragg and his gang.<br /><br />Enter Ally French (Renee Zellweger), widow, piano player, and charming opportunist, who quickly comes between Cole and Hitch.  When the two lawmen arrest Bragg in a daring raid on his ranch, Ally is the means by which two hired gunmen spring him from custody.  Cole and Hitch take off in pursuit of Bragg, forcing a way through Indian country to a violent confrontation in another small town.  However, that gunfight is not the end of the story. There is one final confrontation back in Appaloosa to settle all the scores.<br /><br />\\"Appaloosa\\" is a slow-rolling movie, meditating over its austere landscapes, terse dialogue, and quick violence.  The story and the ending plot twist are dictated by the Code of the West.  This movie is highly recommended as good entertainment to fans of the classic old westerns.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|[[ASIN:B0001ZX0OW Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)]]  From its first release I have always loved this movie.  I read the book recently which has gotten me started on a Dennis Lehane quest.  Now I enjoy the movie even more because I know more details about the characters and their histories.
0765316897|5.0|Wow.  Just ... wow.  That was an awesome ending, and I was marveling the whole time at how everything fit together with the first two books.    I loved the little reveals throughout the book... as mysteries brought up in 1 and 2 were solved in 3.  You can tell that Sanderson wrote all three at once.    Essentially, if you've read Mistborn 1 and 2, you need to pick this up.  If you haven't read Mistborn 1 and 2, it will be worth your while to start at the beginning.    Sanderson is a fantastic writer, inventive and creative.  I can't wait to see what he does next.

B000G73U5Y|2.0|Steely Dan has been chronicled in a number of greatest hits releases and this 2006 collection does nothing to replace the previous ones or provide new insight.<br /><br />This is a good starting part for those beginning to explore the band's catalog and do not want to immediately jump into the studio albums. And for those who are lodged into listening to a FM Classic Rock format, the collection presents the songs that have some rotation when Steely Dan's number is \\"drawn\\" for airplay.<br /><br />But repackaging the same selections time and again is not definitive and makes it impossible to recommend for fans who have progressed well past this point in their record libraries.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|What to expect from a band who already released the perfect Brit-pop album ([[ASIN:B000A2WPD8 Hopes & Fears]]), then who darkened and deepened that formula for their very good (if not quite perfect) follow up [[ASIN:184609643X Under the Iron Sea]]?  Well, I'm not sure that this album was what anyone was expecting...but it has much of the brilliance that these boys are capable of delivering.    It has already been noted by other reviewers that the first 5 songs are very influenced by the 80's.  At worst, it is just a bit confusing: witness the third track \\"Better Than This\\"--gone are the pianos, replaced almost completely by synths, all detuned slightly.  I hear hints of Oingo Boingo here, and I'm not sure if that is good.  At best, it produces some really effective pop music--the synth intro of Again and Again sounds much more like an homage to the 80's than a pastiche.      On the best tracks of the album, the neo-80's influences meld beautifully with the honest piano driven melodies into a synthesis that is greater than the sum of its parts.  The title track is one of the finest examples of this.  Just when you are getting into a very comfortable groove on the song, the bittersweet bridge kicks in and smacks you in the face with why you loved this band in the first place.      There are definitely some tracks for those who long for the soaring melodies and purity of voice found throughout the first album.  The title track, to which I have already alluded, is really a standout in the melody department.  The final track on the album is also quite lovely, reminiscent of a simpler version of Keane.    Lyrically, the whole album has a lot to offer.  The title track is haunting in its understanding of the challenges of modern life, juxtaposing melodic beauty with the disjointed feeling that technology can give.  \\"I dream in emails, worn out phrases\\", Tom intones, \\"My life, my life, just empty pages...\\".  On You Don't See Me, he practically begs the hearer to see what isgoing on around them, instead of having the moment to moment move too fast to hold: \\"Moving at the speed of life, reflected in each others eyes, but you're moving so fast in this beautiful scene, you don't see me...\\"    This is a very fine album by a group that can probably turn out very fine music without trying very hard, and if you catch a bit of criticism there, well, it is just because I know that Very Good is not quite as good as they can deliver.  I expect a lot of these guys, as I know they can give it.  I definitely found much to love in this album--I applaud them their experimentation, the desire to stretch themselves musically--I think that this desire will keep them a viable band for a much longer time than simply repeating the formula of their first album.  The songwriting is good, and the melodies are strong and interesting.  Even so, there are some definite missteps here: Tom's voice sounds strained at times, the 80's instrumentation on the first half of the album does not work completely, and the decreased emphasis on the piano may not be their absolute best idea ever, but repeat listens prove even the missteps have their charm.  This album is definitely not for those who love only the first album.  This album is also not for someone looking for a clone of [[ASIN:184609643X Under the Iron Sea]].  This is an excellent album for the fan who is committed to following the band develop over time, who believe in the power of these guys to move them emotionally.  If you approach this album with an open mind and a willing ear, you will not be disappointed and you may find some moments to genuinely love.
0071359168|5.0|This book is simply a must-read for anyone entering the world of marketing. It teaches the essence of one of the core concepts of marketing in an easy-to-grasp way, filled with many examples. Interestingly enough, most of the suggestions are against common-sense approach and after some time a reader gets into this \\"ahaaaa\\" state.   If there is one message from this book for me, it would be the following - positioning is about deciding what you will NOT be (or how you DON'T WON'T to be perceived). Being a marketer, I find this concept one of the most difficult in everyday work. Why? Because usually a marketer has many options to choose, each one of them having great impact in the long run and many of them being totally wrong. So the key challenge is - what to sacrifice?  On the negative side, one can argue that positioning is a bit obsolete concept. However, although some of the \\"new marketing rules\\" exist nowadays, I would still consider classic concept positioning as one of the keys of successful marketing strategy for any brand.   Bottom-line - read it, study it, subscribe to a podcast. You'll learn a lot.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I first heard Madeleine Peyroux's seductive, swingy voice in a grocery store of all places, singing Leonard Cohen's \\"Dance Me to the End of Love.\\"  I ran to the computer as soon as I got home to find out who would have the great good taste and chops to perform that song without making me long for the original.   Great voice, fine album, wonderful selection of songs.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|I love these movies, the only one we were a little disapointed with was the 3rd one....the first one is by far my favorite!! Definitely recommend!
B001CZJKS0|2.0|I was anticipating on this set even though I have every one of the Halloween movies on DVD.  I was hoping for a complete set but I guess that's not possible since Anchor Bay don't own the rights to Halloween II or H20.  Most of all what's even MORE DISAPPOINTING is the fact that Anchor Bay have released Halloween so many times and they still don't even release the original movie and the Extended aka as the TV Version with [CC] CLOSED CAPTIONING for the Deaf & Hearing Impaired or have any SUBTITLES, even Halloween BLURAY is not [CC] or subtitles.  Anchor Bay seem to be lazy and not release a proper release with extras, an uncut version or extra footage along with everything CLOSED CAPTION... I wish they get it right for once and quit do with the lazy and quick put together set, believe me the mask and box set idea is pretty lame and an embarrassment.
B001AEF6CW|5.0|Cool collector bowling ball with extras. A must for any Lebowski fan. It really ties the room together.

8590379825|5.0|This book is very approachable and has a clear, concise writing style. It not only teaches the language, but also covers many interesting computer science topics along the way and shows how to make the most of Lua's features. I can honestly say you could also use this as a tool for learning advanced JavaScript, because it does a great job covering closures and other concepts that the two languages share. There's also a large section on embedding Lua, a powerful idea that makes software like [[ASIN:B0018VH8S2 Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2]] run.
B0018S6YO4|4.0|I bought this Cd recently and i must say it's awesome! her voice is fantastic and i love her lyrics. I'm one of those people that will listen to anything but this Cd is one of those that i listen to the most. She is a very talented womand and I hope she makes more Cd's like this one.

0553124986|5.0|I first read this novel in the tenth grade and was deeply impressed at how Daniel Keyes created such honest, living characters out of only words.  The novel is expanded from its original short story format here and tells the story of a mildly retarded man named Charlie Gordon who undergoes an experimental surgical procedure designed to increase his I.Q.<br /><br />The experiment works to a degree: Charlie now has a genius-level I.Q. of 185 and can read in several languages.  However, he has all the emotional ability of his pre-surgical self and as his intelligence increases, his friends and family decrease in size due partly to his own arrogance and self-centeredness.<br /><br />Keyes makes everyone in his novel a real person, with the exception of Bertha Nemur, the wife of the professor whose research Charlie benefits from; given only one or two scenes, she comes across as shrill and unlikable.  But Charlie, his teacher (and lover) Alice Kinnian; Fay, his exotic neighbor, Dr. Strauss, his psychologist; even Rose, his mother and Norma, his sister: all come across as real people.  The depth of Charlie's humanity is seen in how he reacts to these people before and after his intelligence increases.<br /><br />The ending is heartbreaking, but this is a novel I'd recommend to anyone.  This is probably the third time I've reread it over the years, and its emotional impact never leaves.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Ok I see that some reviewers have given Ray an unfair rating on this album. One reviewer said that on some songs it sounded like Ray was channeling Ray Charles and Johny Cash, and acted like that was the highest point of this album. Now I get that Ray's voice is full of soul and he has been influenced by some of the past greats, and that tends to pull in some of the older audience. But when Ray doesn't give them that redundant bluesy/soul sound they get all pissey and call it filler and say they just don't get it. What they fail to realize is that Ray is an artist of his own time, and of course will \\"channel\\", if you may, some of his past influences, but in all is more of his own self. I have learned to love his first two albums equally as they are a part of a growing process of a true artist, and after giving this album a couple listens I already know that I will love this one just as much as the first two. If you are on the fence about buying this album and are thinking about passing just because some stubborn oldies didn'nt get \\"When A Man Loves A Women\\" (Although a fantastic song!!) 10 times. Wonder no more and purchase this songwriting genius' latest masterpiece!!!
6304698798|5.0|This Clint Eastwood movie is my favorite of the 'saga' of spaghetti westerns starring Clint Eastwood.   Everything from the engaging music, to the intense almost agonizing suspenseful long moments before a fight scene.  The overacting of Eli to the sublime acting of Clint.  Every element combined makes this movie one of a kind.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I love Coldplay's first three albums and have listened to them many times, so I was stoked for the release of VIva La Vida. I bought it the day it came out and I've tried to like it I really have, but I can't get into it. Chris Martin was starting to get weird on the X&Y tour with his crazy hair and what not but now I know that he has gone completely of the deep end  by releasing this piece of garbage.
0375826726|3.0|Good story, but there was a lot of build up for the action in it. There was so much prelude, it seemed that the ended w condensed into some quick underwritten highs.
B00005221M|5.0|I watch this several times a year.  I own most of the movies ever made of \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\".  I enjoy them all, but this is my favorite (even though I can't get over the production crew member in his red ball cap showing up in a shot when the British are leaving the fort after the surrender to the French). So much for professional editing.  This is about the only thing (other than \\"Their Will Be Blood\\")that I have liked Daniel Day Lewis in.  This is a classic.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|\\"Gossip In The Grain\\" builds off of both of Ray's older albums. It has the beautiful soulful simple vocals of \\"Trouble\\" combined with the amazing instrumentation of \\"Til The Sun Turns Black\\". In true Lamontagne style, Ray provides moving beautiful song after song on this album. He also experiments with a more traditional folk sound in tracks such as \\"Hey Me, Hey Mama\\". The song \\"You Are The Best Thing\\" will become an instant classic and go down as one of the all time greats. If you too have fallen in love with the moving soulful work of this modern master don't hesitate to buy this album. You will not be disappointed!
076531178X|5.0|In the fantasy field where uniqueness is rare, Mistborn is a trilogy where uniqueness is ubiquitous.      There were moments of incredible intensity that made my heart pound twice as fast, and there were moments of sadness and melancholy that gave me tears.  The ending, however, follows the excellent tradition of \\"happy\\" endings but with more to come.      It is rare for an author to give you so many questions in one book, yet answer them so perfectly in the second (while raising more), which are ultimately satisfyingly answered in the third.    Buy it!!!
B001AEF6C2|5.0|A couple weeks ago I made a list of my top 10 John Hughes movies, and I decided to revisit a lot of his films to ensure I wasn't going on past memories to compile it. WEIRD SCIENCE, one of Hughes' earlier directorial efforts, is probably my favorite of his, because it has the sappy Hughes stuff, the teen angst, sure, but most of all, it is very, very funny. A lot of people who call this film kind of stupid and even (my favorite) unrealistic are kind of missing the point. Two guys create a woman with a computer, which results in missiles, snow, and a kitchen magically painted blue, and you're going to say it's unrealistic? First of all, Hughes supposedly started the whole teen genre with SIXTEEN CANDLES & BREAKFAST CLUB, but even at the time they were not realistic portrayals of teenage life (yep, every stereotype of a high school would share detention together, and uh huh, all nerds and awkward 16-year-old girls end up with the prom king and queen). So at least with WEIRD SCIENCE, Hughes is not denying it's all a fantasy.<br /> Anyway, the plot is pretty well-known: two high school outcasts, Gary (Hughes staple Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith, who apparently quit acting not long after this, and he was only 15 or 16 here), decide to make what they believe will be a two-dimensional representation of their dream woman, but through a freak lightning storm, actually create a wily, beautiful young woman they call Lisa (Kelly LeBrock). From there, the two initially use Lisa to live out what they wish they could do (go out drinking, drive, have a party, ask girls out, shower with a girl, stand up to Wyatt's military butthead of a brother Chet), often forceably through Lisa, and in the end, they learn to have confidence (and again, sure, those hot girls at school REALLY want two sensitive nerds, not the A-holes who get them into parties, sure, Johnny) and don't need Lisa anymore. Gee whiz.<br /> But wait, before Gary and Wyatt learn to have confidence, Gary gets drunk in an all-black bar (cough, ANIMAL HOUSE)! Gary's father loses all memory of his existence! Wyatt's grandparents are frozen in the blue kitchen because they can't calm down! A missile arrives in Wyatt's bedroom because of a second, less successful making of another woman for the jerks at school! One played by ROBERT DOWNEY JR.! The cast of THE ROAD WARRIOR shows up so Wyatt and Gary can stand up for themselves! Chet (a memorable Bill Paxton) is turned into a toad/pile of you-know-what!!! Leaping lizards!<br /> So in conclusion, yes, this movie is cheesy, kind of outdated (especially near the end), ridiculous, and certainly not as beneficial to the teen genre as films like SIXTEEN CANDLES and THE BREAKFAST CLUB, but what it lacks in meaning and impact it makes up for in just pure fun. John Hughes wrote this movie in 2 days, people. I can't even plan an essay in that amount of time. So in the words of Gary Wallace, why are you messing with the fantasy? We KNOW the reality, so just enjoy some WEIRD SCIENCE, people. Cue Oingo Boingo!s drunk in an all-black bar (cough, ANIMAL HOUSE)! Gary's father loses all memory of his existence!

0375424474|3.0|I should confess up front that my not loving this book is partly my own fault. Given Shubin's academic pedigree -- and it is impressive -- I expected the work to be more substantive. That he decided to write for a more general audience is not so much a problem as a simple disappointment.    But that's only part of my issue with the book.  Simply put, it's poorly written.  While literary style is not the forte of the majority of scientists, you'd expect them to have at least relied on a competent editor. Most offensive of all was his labored redundancy; important sentences were deemed so important that they were sometimes used -- essentially verbatim -- multiple times; if a point could be made in a short paragraph, Shubin used three.    Still, he has some interesting stories to tell, and while their connections to broader concepts are sometimes forced in rather painful transitions, the episode and ideas should hold the attention of most general readers.
B00003CXWV|4.0|This film takes a great pleasure in depicting a mediocre criminal, a drug dealer actually, who considers himself a hero, a genius and maybe even a god on earth. His initial success he analyzes as his own and does not see it is the success of a system and when he fails it's because he crossed a line somewhere: too much and too sure of himself maybe even arrogant and condescending. Then his story is a story of successive failures in between short periods of success and long periods of prison as a result of it all. He ends up betrayed by his own partners who deliver him to the FBI and DEA one night in order to get themselves out of the business clean and unharmed. Finks, that's what his friends were. But he deserved it. Then the story seems to support him on the other side of the coin: his daughter. He loses his wife and his daughter in order to go and by going to prison a first time. Then he re-conquers his daughter little by little and he promises to take her away from the squalor her mother is providing. But that's when he decides to do one more trick to get the money he needs to kidnap his own daughter. That's when he is picked up, lower than him you cannot fall, by the police and sent to prison for so long that he will never see his father alive again. So he dreams his daughter comes and visits him. But that's a dream, an illusion, a mirage. He was not able to deliver his promise and he has been discarded like an old shoe or a worn out sock. Sad but after all very moralistic. Crime does not pay and only brings deception, disappointment and suffering. Too moral maybe to be as good as it could have been. How can we support or sympathize with this selfish and arrogant p**** of a man?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
0743454537|5.0|this is actually one of the best ive evr read. from teh moment i picked it up i could not put it down. i loved the style of writing, the content, the characters and the story. i'm so grateful it's going to be  feature film (and not a lifetime movie) and can't wait for the release!
0930289234|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said. Excellent story. Excellent character development. I had Watchmen years ago and read it. I shared it, and it vanished. I had it again, and reluctantly shared it again - GONE. The only thing I would caution you about buying this book is this:<br /><br />If you love to share great things with people, you WILL want others to read this book and share the experience.<br />These people will, inevitably, love the book.<br />There is a chance that you might never see your lovely book again.<br /><br />Get it. Share it with caution.
0743496736|5.0|i ended up reading this shortly after a school shooting had just taken place.  the compassion that picoult takes when fleshing out the characters and never telling you what is right and wrong, but instead letting you decide for yourself is one of my favorite trademarks of a picoult book.
B000ZN8036|5.0|What i Got out of this movie was simply that this young man lacked nothing materially, but was starved for a relationship with his dad and mom,  and had the father wound so common for american young men...  having grown up with hard working dads who  come home at night spent, and who  spend lots of time  assembling their portfolios and place  their security in how much  money they have and  what status level they are at, how many toys they have..ect ect.. this young man  had probably been told  most of his life  what to do, how to do it, and this is what success is blah blah...  you must look like this, act like this, go here and do this and he was damn tired of it, and wanted to find out  who he really was, and if it was impossible to find himself in the presence of his family then he had to get away, and if they had any knowledge of where he was they would probably be sending him money, instruction and advice, and trying to tell him every move to make... so he broke away... and by degrees  he grew up and began to see what was really important in life and to find the healing he didnt even realize he needed...  the fact that he made mistakes and died as a result does not take away from the movie at all. to me the movie was a true story of the journey we are all on, and the goal is not to die with the most toys or to be a big shot know it all, but to live well and to learn  that we all make mistakes and  need to learn to forgive and grow and love and  to \\" Call Things by their Right Name\\"  and in this regard i think this young man was a success.

The cast is, as always in Quentin's movies, fabulous.    The script, as always in Quentin's movies, fabulous.    A don't miss for Tarintino fans. A should see for just about everyone else 8 to 80.
B0019IB26I|4.0|Un buon disco, onesto sia nel suono che nelle esecuzioni  il primo CD contiene esecuzioni acustiche solo lui con la chitarra e finisce con alcuni brani nella formazione del suo mitico TRIO (Steve Jordan e Pino Palladino)  il secondo CD invece lo si può apprezzare con tutta la band al completo. Superbo in tutte le situazioni.  per chi non conosce John Mayer, con questo disco si riesce a farsi una buona idea della notevole caratura dell'artista.

0743289412|5.0|I see many people complaining about the language.  I think the use of the personal intermarriage lexicon is a further rebuttal of the modern shallow manner in which people interact just as Cell was a comment on what he deemed to be the detrimental impact of the ubiquitous gadget phone on public life.  Mr King embraces characters who are in touch with visceral experiences rather than carefully packaged prefab interaction.  The wry humor and worldly wisdom throughout the novel is a fitting antidote to the mundane spiritless outlook espoused by modern corporate culture.  The point of the novel is to celebrate imagination as much as love.  I didn't think this was a perfect story by any means.  I question whether anyone could really convince themselves that they intend to permanently turn their back on a fairy world with a magic healing pool.  But this tale had a LOT of heart.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|I was among the biggest fans of this series. I relished the series with my friends and also introduced every male friend and my ex-bf to it for the insight and educational value I saw in it for them as well. For me and my gf's this was just a very easy to relate to series being young late 20's women who were torn between the dreams of our mother's, grandmother's and ourselves. Part of what made the series so good was the refreshing if not unabashed honesty, sincerity and realistic nature of the conversations and interactions. Innuendo always scored major points with us as well.    The movie was comfortable and familiar to me and many of my friends. That said it was a bit sad with an underlying message that women cannot have it all unless you are a \\"Charlotte\\". Not the best of messages. On the other hand the message of comfortable unity and imperfection as well as not needing a partner is a positive message but a bit lost on the obsessive nature with which Carrie's relationship trumps all others and dominates the film. I also think the male frontal nudity was NOT an integral part of the film and if anything was \\"old\\" and placed there for shock/tittilation value. It was a direct parallel to the \\"Samantha outside the Yankee's Lockerroom\\" scene from an episode in the series and just went too far and was tacky in my opinion.   All in all it is worth the watch if you are a die-hard fan mostly for nostalgia sake because at this point the series has been off too long to evoke a true curiosity as to \\"what happens next\\" but nevertheless it is still chalk full of lessons. I would recommend it only to those who followed the series closely as otherwise it is another sappy \\"we tried, we failed, we compromised\\" movie.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|Unlike many reviewers here I'm not comparing this album to their previous work when I say it is not what I expected - instead, I'm comparing it to their single release \\"Sex on Fire\\".  I'm new to Kings of Leon, with Sex on Fire being the first of their songs that made me want to know who this band was.  Go ahead and label me \\"mainstream\\" but Sex on Fire was a great song, great beat, unique vocals.    So what about the rest of the album.  I admit there is enough there to make me listen to it - but just as something to play in the background.  Nothing stands out, everything else blends together, and nothing else is like the one single I heard.  I went back to their older albums to get a feel for the band and I liked those albums even less.  Just not my kind of music.    So, if you like the old Kings of Leon you may well be disappointed here as this is different.  If you liked the single \\"Sex on Fire\\" you may also be disappointed as there are no other songs on the album that sound like it.    In the end, I gave it 3 stars, as it isn't bad it is just mediocre and, yes, boring.

B00005JPO1|1.0|It's too bad that this movie was so lame. Harrison Ford at least had the decency to show up and not phone it in. Unfortunately George Lucas gave us yet another craptacular story. Spielberg did an ok job but nothing ground-breaking. The thing that bothered me the most was that everything looked like it was shot on a sound stage or a back lot. The old Indy films all had marvelous location shoots and made the movie that much better. For such a big budget movie, it just looked cheap. As for the story, the fridge, and the aliens, well that just comes down to personal taste. For me the movie just didn't work. And a lack of a truly great Indy Villain didn't help either; the bad guys never once seemed threatening.<br /><br />After the Star Wars prequels and now Indy 4, George Lucas has proven that he is not to be trusted with his own creations anymore. Please, no more sequels or special editions to your old works. They are fine in their original states and need no continuation of story - walk away.
0307386171|5.0|This is a fantastic book; beautifully written, and well crafted; a short, bittersweet slice of life.  My book group loved it, and we had a very good discussion about it.
B000001FHV|5.0|This happens to be my favorite album ever.<br /><br />I heard the Puppets at the same time or before Nirvana (and NOT because Unplugged, although that was awesome).<br /><br />\\"Backwater\\" - great. \\"Severed Goddess Hand\\", \\"Never To Be Found\\"... these are the sounds of my adolescence.<br /><br />AND produced by PAUL LEARY from none other than the also-immortal Butthole Surfers.<br /><br />Yes, this album should have been bigger than it was.<br /><br />But let's face it, the Pups are just too weird for some.<br /><br />Some don't like the voice(s).<br /><br />But NO ONE can deny these men are solid songwriters, amazing musicians, and far-out dudes that prove psych-rock can be listenable and have hooks.<br /><br />So here's to the immortal Meat Puppets.<br /><br />My favorite song on here is \\"Things\\" although it's a great damn ride.<br /><br />LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY.<br /><br />If you are not hooked by the intro, \\"Violet Eyes\\", you probably won't like 'em.
B001E75QGG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater. I enjoyed it even more on Bluray. It looks and sounds amazing. Both disc are loaded with special features, with the second disc containing 3/4 of them.<br /><br />I have to say, when I was in the theater watching the movie, the lighting of the film, just seamed off to me, it seamed OVER lit. Plus there were scenes that had some CGI looking added effects. All 4 movies had scenes  like that. BUT, I don't care. I STILL enjoyed this movie a lot and I have to say, all that weird lighting and CGI blends much better on the small screen. I actually think the lighting looks like the other films do on DVD.<br /><br />Over all I highly recommend this on Bluray. It looks amazing. What a fun ride. I can't wait for the orginals to arrive on Bluray someday.<br /><br />Let me just say, I go to see a movie to have fun. I am not a person who sits and nit picks a movie a part.
B000FIMG68|5.0|One of the best shows to ever air on television. This show is a must see (preferably from the beginning).     LOST is about a group of survivors who crash on an island. Nothing about the crash, island, or survivors is obvious or apparent however. The show is full of so many twists and turns you have to follow it closely.     The clever writing and amazing scripts make this show engaging on an episode-to-episode entertainment level as well as an overall arc for a very intriguing series.
0061373877|1.0|The primary aim of an audio recording is to be clear and understandable and Neil Gaiman's recording of Neverwhere is neither.  The author has the annoying habit of dropping his voice on the last few words of each sentence, making them unintelligible.  The only option is to turn up the volume, thus risking hearing damage as the first part of each sentence is now very loud.  On certain sections, he adds special effects (echos, static) which make those sections completely unintelligible.  This may be a great book, but I will never know as I gave up in frustration after about 1 hour.
1401206905|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic comic book. I wasn't even a huge fan of Batman when my friend recommended I buy this book but it hooked me. The deluxe edition is a nice piece in itself, hard cover and quality printing.
031606792X|2.0|I'll try not to spoil this for those who haven't read it yet.  Okay, First the good parts: We finally get a look inside Jacob's head. I know a lot of people hated this part, but I felt he was the only interesting character, and, despite being female, the only character I could relate to. He's also the only character who actually develops after Twilight. He's the only reason I gave this review 2 stars instead of 1.  The bad parts: The rest of the book. While Twilight was an intriguing new twist on an old story, the writing and plot throughout the rest of the series falls apart. From the 2nd book on, Bella is selfish, obsessive, worthless, has no redeeming qualities, nor is there any character development for her. She is so unrealistic that she becomes impossible to relate to. I honestly  hoped she would die just because she's so annoying. Edward could easily be replaced with a loaf of bread-he has no personality at all, isn't particularly likable, is also impossible to relate to, and just downright boring.  For me the ending was a huge cop out. Stephenie Meyer spends an entire series leading up to what appears to be an epic vampire war, but it seems like she got lazy at the end and didn't really feel like finishing the book. Everything fits into place way too neatly, as every character gets a perfect happily-ever-after. Now I am all for happy endings, but you can still have a happy ending that does not insult the audience's intelligence by just making everything as simple as possible (think Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, LoTR). And the fact is, SM will completely change a character to get them to fit into her happy ending (imprinting is just so convenient, isn't it?).   Like most people I loved Twilight, but after reading Breaking Dawn I have lost all respect for Stephenie Meyer as an author. The book was rushed, sloppily written, poorly thought out, and not creative (seriously, did anyone really not see how this book would end?) There is a good reason why great series have several years between books. In her haste, SM ruined what could have been one of the greatest sagas ever.
B0019T9FL6|3.0|Spotlight is by far, the best track on this CD. A classic in the making; but the rest of the cd is only ok. Jennifer has a really big voice and at times comes close to domination some of the songs. She is definitely broadway material and has a very bright future in that arena. I also like the tracks \\"What's wrong\\" with T-Pain, \\"Giving myself\\" and the song with Fantasia took me back to the soulful sounds of the 70's. The Gospel track shows off her vocal range. Overall good album but not a great debut.
B001BKG9SK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Live In Gdansk\\" and I'm recommending to everyone..Though he released another show from this tour about a year or so ago this one holds up. Its also the last we'll see of the great Richard Wright who passed away just days before \\"..Gdansk\\" was released. The song selection is a bit different from the previous disc also.

0375826726|4.0|After reading the slow pace of the second book, Eldest, I was keeping my expectation of Brisingr fairly low.  I was wrong in doing so. Brisingr was the best book of the Inheiritance Series thus far.  Incredible detail, quick paced writing.    Once I started I literally did not stop reading until I finished.  My only disappointment is having to wait for the next book.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I recently received my set in the mail.  It is a nicely packaged DVD collection which is setup like a scrapbook with a furry/felt textured  cover.  There are nice photo pages with summaries of the episodes.  Each season has it's own color.  I've watched the 2nd season DVDs, and they all work in my PS2 DVD player.      The only problem I had was the defect with the pages inside the pick cover.  The top and bottom corners were not cut well - so somewhat ragged while the rest of the edges are cut straight and clean.    If you're looking for a good price for a set of the DVDs and don't care much about the box, this is a good deal.
0743298039|5.0|I have recommended this book to all of my friends, and to random strangers as well! This is one of the most original plots - grabs you from the start and holds on for a wild ride. You will not want this book to end. It's one of those that calls to you from wherever you are...\\"read me, read me...\\". You might as well give up and just read the whole thing, cover to cover, as fast as you can!
B000V86OKG|4.0|not much to say about this. as u can see from the other reviews, the series is awesome, and i do not think, that a brutal serial killer is hailed here, the reader gets confronted with dexter's inner doubts...   the bonus material on the other hand is kinda ridiculous, it only contains two episodes of another showtime production and provides the spectator with the very \\"helpful\\" hint to buy another dvd series for being able to watch the sneak preview for the third season - it's even more ridiculous since there is a special point on the bonus features dvd named \\"watch preview of the third season\\" - you click on that and get what i just described... kinda frustrating. additional material includes some pictures (only screenshots from the second season; every little child could do that), as well as some short crappy biographies of the authors... you find much better stuff on the web. if you already downloaded the series or watched it on tv, showtime gives u no reason for buying this dvd... i'm kinda disappointed to say that...

B0018AOAOI|5.0|Well deserved praise has been bestowed upon this album by others.  I echo all of it.  But the MP3 conversion here leaves much to be desired.
1594489505|4.0|I enjoyed the 2nd novel from Hosseini almost as much as Kite Runner, which I gave 5 stars.  The author tells a fascinating human story with well-developed characters in rich prose that is all the more impressive because it is not the author's native tongue. Everyone should read Kite Runner, and once you've figured out why everyone loved the book, you'll want to read this novel, too, and you won't be disappointed.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I had wanted to see this movie since first advertised.  It was well worth the wait.  These 2 stars are my favorite duo of today. They never fail to please.  The movie was different & refreshing.  Much better than most of those out there today.
B00005T5YK|5.0|I Am Mainly Writing a review on this not just because of the fact that this album in any format has the best sound quality , performance , production and writing of any album in the analog era! . but it sets the standard of other recordings of all time .  I cant believe anyone would say that this is a waste of time to listen to this album .   Also the use of surround sound is also fantastic here .  Henley's drums are Back Beat to the true dynamics of what cd's and other high resolution formats should sound like .
B001HDYK6Y|5.0|This is a great album...probably my favorite one by Keane.  Sure, it's different.  Each album by them seems to be a bit different.  Some may not like their new sound...but I LOVE it!  This album is the perfect blend of 80's and 2008 music.  Take a chance...give it a listen.  It will grow on you like it did on me!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Just received my copy today. Great movies however one feature was supposed to be digital copies of the movies for portable playback. Turns out they only put in the first movie and nothing else. Not a deal breaker, but hardly an ultimate collection without digital copies of the last 2 and Animatrix feature.
B001DZLAWI|4.0|Metallica have returned to their older style of metal, bringing their jagged logo back from the grave as well. This album, in my opinion, is the only  metal in 20 years from this band. After a long detour with Bob Rock and the Hard Rock sound that came with him, Metallica have joined forces with Rick Rubin to record Death Magnetic.  Lyrically, rhythmically, and musically this band has really pushed their way back towards the sound of ...And Justice For All. If Load, Reload and beyond turned you away, this is the album for the true Metallica fan.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|This album has so much distortion that I can't stand to listen to it anymore! ...which is very unfortunate, because the songs are all INCREDIBLE.  At its core, this is the Metallica album most of us have been waiting twenty years to get, and the band should be commended for creating this fantastic collection of songs.  Every track is extra long and packed with great riffs, tasty solos, catchy writing, excellent lyrics and outstanding vocals--but sadly, most of it sounds terrible!  Apparently, Rick Rubin earns his millions by instructing his sound engineers to turn all the knobs past eleven until the sound is completely distorted.  In an age where singers just scream and guitar players can't play a solo, I suppose that the deliberate creation of noise is par for the course.  It is a crushing disappointment, though, that Metallica has finally made a worthy follow-up to Justice, only to have it destroyed in the last stages by ignorant, overpaid flunkies.  Next time they should hire any random fan to produce them--somebody who can work Rubin's \\"magic\\" by telling the band members to remember what it felt like making Master of Puppets, but who still has the hearing and intelligence to not make the final product torturous to listen to after the band members get on their jets and leave town.  Seriously, ANYBODY could have mixed and mastered this album better than it was done.  It is, by far, the worst sounding album I have ever heard.
B001AX9DT0|2.0|I've loved Ray's music for a long time now. \\"Trouble\\" is a work of genius, \\"TTSTB\\" was more expansive, and even other collections like \\"One Lonesome Saddle\\" showcase his talents. Given that, I was looking forward to this album for a long time, even longer as the release date seemed to be continually pushed back. After all that, all I can say is that this album is a big disappointment. \\"Let it Be Me\\" may be the only song in the collection I know I'll be listening to in a year's time. \\"You Are the Best Thing\\" is also a good track, although different. I wouldn't have minded if the whole album featured the horns and backup singers as this track does - it would have separated this album from his others and avoided what it is now - an uneven grouping of weak songs with overly-forced vocals. That voice worked great on your first two albums, Ray, but on this one it's just a little bit too much. I've heard how you naturally sang, pre-Trouble days (check out the demo of \\"Shelter\\"), and that's the voice that would have better suited this release.

0670019925|5.0|Lodge gives a detailed picture of what it's like to go deaf in middle age and all the limitations deafness brings.  The deep description of a deaf man's life feels familiar when he faces the same issues everyone does as they age and terribly sad when his hearing loss isolates him from people he cares about.  The main character would be interesting even if he weren't deaf, and his deafness adds poignancy that makes this book special.

0142000671|5.0|This wonderful book is one of the most popular books written by Nobel prize winner-John Steinbeck.     It is also probably one of the most popular books in American Literature.     Set during The Great Depression,The story is about two migrant farm workers-George Milton(who is a cynical man) and Lennie Small(who is very big,strong but mentally disabled and reliant on George to look after him) and how they dream of owning their own piece of land.     Due to something Lennie has done(which was actually sort of a misunderstanding),the pair must go to a ranch in Soledad,California, to make money and escape the trouble they are in.     The book is an amazing tale of friendship and the heartbreaking thing George must do at the end to save his friend Lennie is so touching.     I first read this book for GCSE and it is now one of my favourite's.     It is a definite 'must read' and I would recommend it 100%
B001FBSMW6|3.0|It's hard to determine whether producers Jon Brion and Stuart Price's obvious influence on Keane's newest release is a positive one or not. Both are eclectic, fairly big-name producers who bring a lot to the table, and Keane definitely needed to differentiate themselves from the horde of piano-rock bands out there at this stage of their career. And with that they assuredly succeed; opener and first single \\"Spiralling\\" bursts out of the gate with some truly ridiculous `80s synths and an epic drum sound that sounds like the soundtrack to a John Hughes movie.<br /><br />\\"Spiralling\\" succeeds on being so wildly different from what Keane have become known for (Coldplay/Snow Patrol soft-piano rock, for those unfamiliar with their work), but the continuation of this `80s infatuation leads to a record that sounds cheesier and faker the more you listen to it. \\"Lovers Are Losing\\" is a handclap-happy pop song that makes the wise choice to keep singer Tom Chaplin's talented voice on top of things, but the ridiculous pogo-funk on \\"Better Than This\\" and the electronica beats on \\"You Haven't Told Me Anything\\" place the emphasis on how Keane is trying to reposition themselves instead of on the song. The synths are so blatant, the beats are so processed, it's almost as if Keane is practically screaming, \\"we're not just a boring piano band!\\"<br /><br />The title track is Keane at their best, sweeping piano pop that builds up around itself for a fittingly epic climax, and Chaplin is in top form both vocally and lyrically, but any momentum is killed by the boring, effects-laden \\"You Don't See Me\\" that follows it. \\"Again & Again\\" is Keane wishing they could be the Killers, a style that has absolutely no bite coming from this particular outfit.<br /><br />The remainder of the record is fairly solid, with some surprisingly funky guitar riffs on \\"Pretend That You're Alone,\\" while the mandatory majestic closer \\"Love Is The End\\" is uplifted by Chaplin's typically earnest delivery. While Keane have definitely held up their end of the bargain to deliver a record that challenges previously held expectations of their sound, it doesn't quite have the style or punch of Under The Iron Sea to make Perfect Symmetry anything more than an interesting experiment.up their end of the bargain to deliver a record that challenges previously held expectations of their sound, it doesn't quite have the style or punch of Under The Iron Sea to make Perfect Symmetry anything more than an interesting experiment.
B001DDBCUU|3.0|As a big fan of the TV series,I really looked forward to seeing this movie.     However,while some people who usually don't like the series loved the movie,I find I was the other way around...I loved the series but thought the movie was just 'okay'.     Some of the things that the characters did,didn't really seem to be in their nature and sometimes it felt as if the writers were trying too hard to be both fashionable and funny(and I found the whole resorting to toilet humour thing in Charlotte's case just a bit cheap and try hard).     On a more positive note...It was,at the end of the day, a good,fun,uplifting movie with plenty of beautiful dresses and fabulous outfits.     Although I do think some of the characters didn't get enough air time,such as Charlotte and Harry whose relationship we didn't see nearly enough of and I would have liked to have seen Stanford and Anthony feature A LOT more (but apparently there are rumours of a sequel so maybe they'll show more of them in the second film).     Overall...I enjoyed it,although I thought at times it was a bit slow in parts and less witty than the series was and it certainly didn't pack that sassy single girl punch.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|The music from the movie \\"Across The Universe\\" is just as outstanding as the film itself. This will stir emotions in you that have been dormant for decades. The performances are truly stellar. This CD is in my top three list of best music of all time.
B00005J6T0|4.0|I love Madonna's music.     Even though she changes direction so often with both her sound and image,I ALWAYS buy her album without even reading reviews or listening to previews because I can almost GURANTEE I will love it(and you shouldn't listen to reviews all the time because the critics seemed to hate American life,but I personally think it is some of Madonna's best and most personal work).     And despite owning ALL of Madonna's albums...     I am NOT a crazy Madonna fan,who just blindly worships her like some idol.     I don't think she has anything close to one of the 'best' or 'strongest' voices in the music industry but I do think she has an incredibly versatile voice that seems to suit whatever she sings well.     True Blue is ONE of my favourite albums of her's(others are Madonna,American Life,The Immaculate Collection & Hard Candy).     Her is my opinion on each song individually...     1.Papa Don't Preach-This song is considered a Madonna classic,but it annoys me a little(I don't know why,maybe because of the Kelly Osborne association),sometimes I like it,sometimes I HATE it.   I'm going to give it 7/10     2.Open Your Heart-I absolutely LOVE this song.It excites me every time I hear it and reminds me of a certain someone!And it ALWAYS makes me want to dance and jump around!   10/10     3.White Heat-Since I only recently bought this album,I also only recently heard this song...and I am shocked it was not released as a single!   It has to be one of the most catchy Madonna songs ever!   I even bought the movie White Heat because of this song,because I was so intrigued as to was it was about!   10/10     4.Live To Tell-I believe Madonna has said this is her favourite out of all her songs.   I disagree!   While it is a powerful and moving song,to me it is also slightly boring and I must prefer her song Take a Bow(not on this album,but I think it is more moving).   7/10     5.Where's the Party-A fan favourite.   But I don't particularly like or dislike thissong.   I didn't think it was very catchy or exciting.   6/10     6.True Blue-This is a very sweet song and great to listen to when you're in love or feeling incredibly happy.   Some might think it's a bit too girly or sickly sweet but personally,I love it!   10/10     7.La Isla Bonita-This is my Mother's favourite song,however I'm not incredibly enthusiastic about it,maybe it's because I've heard it SO many times.   I don't dislike it,but saying that,I don't love it either!   8/10     8.Jimmy Jimmy-Quite a fun track,not particularly memorable.   6.5/10     9.Love Makes the World Go Round-I don't mind this,but again it's not that memorable.   7/10     10.True Blue-This is a remix I'm not a fan of them,so I'll leave you to judge for yourself.     11.La Isla Bonita-See above!
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Great old-fashioned cliffhanger episodes of the Enterprise's battle to save Earth.  If you are a \\"trekkie\\" this is a great season to have.  I found it to to be the equivalent of a real page-turning novel that you couldn't put down, I had to keep watching episode after episode.
0375826726|5.0|Before reading this book, I really wasn't happy with the idea of two more books instead of just the 3rd being the last. But after reading this book. I see what CP meant when he said if he didn't split the books he wouldn't be able to do the story justice. All the side adventures Eragon went on made sense and in fact made me more excited for the 4th book then I previously was for the series to end. Characters are stronger, gaps in the story are filled and now all that's left is how it will end. Great set up book and I'm glad its four books now. I wasn't really ready for the series to end anyway.
