B001O1O71C|4.0|The book is so moving and a tale well told.  However, the author uses a child's psyche to tell it, which means the confusion and difficulty of understanding genocide.  As a result, it left my child unclear as to what was meant by words and scenes that only someone who already knows the truth would understand.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|What can I say other than The Dark Knight Rises lived up to my expectations and then some. The Christopher Nolan Dark Knight trilogy comes full circle by the end of it and it easily holds up with The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and is more epic in scope than both.<br /><br />This is Christian Bales best outing as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He just feels more central to the story and he gets to show more of his acting chops here. Anne Hathaway turned in a performance I didn't know she had in her as Catwoman and Tom Hardy was as physically scary as any villain in the series. While Heath's Joker will always be the best in terms of performance, you fear for Batman's life when Bane is around. For the record I understood about 85% of what Bane said, so the rest will have to wait for Blu-ray subtitles. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine (given the hardest job with some heavy emotional scenes) and a great new addition in Joseph Gordon-Levitt round out another stellar cast.<br /><br />The fight and action scenes are grounded in reality for the most part and very little CGI is used, which is always a plus.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer nails another loud and powerful music score.<br /><br />I saw this in IMAX and it was well worth it. About 40% or so was shot with those really expensive cameras and those scenes are pure eye candy.<br /><br />More than half of my sold out theater clapped at the end. The Avengers got maybe a dozen or so. I loved both films, but I think only one will last the test of time. I'm sure I'll be seeing TDKR at least one or two more times before it leaves theaters. Thanks Nolan for not letting us down.

Fairly easy to use and in a short amount of time I was handwriting my little fingers off, eh eh? I myself enjoy using stylizing.

B0086700CM|5.0|great game would regimens to everyone. super addictive. hard to put down the game. you will love this fast paced game
B0073PPKNM|5.0|This is as wonderful as ever from this absolute treasure of an artist. How people like Melody Gardot happen is a great and wonderful mystery. There are countless treasures in this album. I was strongly affected by it. Something very interesting happened. Ms. Gardot, if you are reading this, perhaps you will find this story interesting. Your artistry like certain other ones came to inhabit me in certain ways. Well anyhow, as odd as that sounds, so I had a dream. Now here's the thing: I fell asleep listening to a kind of Irish Fantasy by Arnold Bax, English composer. Now, I had a dream. In the dream, Ms. Gardot was singing. The Bax was rendered as it played on the radio, but with jazz figuring, accompaniment, but orchestrated as well. This is not so far a stretch, really. Ms. Gardot sang along in some longer passages that were part of a developed whole. Her voice would go between singing and longer passages of spoken word, some of which was actually a bit quick, some slower. This was what I call \\"characterological\\". I do not have a word for this, so I am using that. It is a bit like a longer drama, say, or a concept album of a person with a longer story perhaps. So anyhow, that I guess would be my fantasy album! Mixture of spoken word and Bax/cum/Jazz/cum/Gardot. Someone would have to write it first.<br /><br />Anyhow. The problem with her new album is that Gardot's voice is simply not prominent enough. It just needs to be out slightly more. This has as much as anything to do not so much with music but \\"persona\\", Melody's character, or I would say her Being that she becomes in singing, in some way. I think my language sounds a little -- what to call it, either fantastical or too fanatical. I mean this in neither way, but it is a simple fact that Melody Gardot is not just a singer but a Being. So in any case, the voice is just slightly too lost in the music. I think it should be remastered and re-released. It was a big mistake to lapse in this plane of her voice in this way. I can not say this more emphatically. Nothing would have to change, probabl, simply the space around Gardot's voice and its prominance/volume would be increased slightly and come to the same level, more or less, of her previous albums.<br /><br />Well I have said my 2 cents. I am glad for the album, but I feel fairly certain that this dimension has this problem in this particular way.<br /><br />Well if Ms. Gardot has read this, which I am not expecting, I would welcome the opportunity to thank her for her work. I refer to both Gardot's. The artist, and the Being.
B004CURZFC|5.0|This was truly a good movie. My son loved it and is still taking about it. The graphics are great and the story was good even for adults.
B000ICRKT4|4.0|Don't take the word of one disgruntled reviewer and avoid this episode. While this may not be the most action-packed episode, there's nothing wrong with it. True, there is a new-agey vibe, and yes, the overall tone is slightly different, but in many ways it's a nice reprieve from the predictable \\"everyone's-about-to-die-right-now-but-Shephard-will-fix-it\\" theme of the previous episodes. Have a watch, and form your own opinion. It's in no way tantamount to contracting an STD (as reviewer 1 claims), and the acting is every bit as good as the former episodes. Relax and defy.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I hadn't really been in the market for an android office program but when this went on sale for 60% off (4.99) I jumped on the band wagon. Which I supose is the reason why they run sales in the first place... So their marketing ploy worked on me and I've now had this program for a few months now and so far it's done everything I've needed. I can't complain about any needed features that aren't there or anything like that. It does have more features than the office program thats native to my android device. So all in all, if you need an office program on your android device our happen to get a good price on this, it will fulfill your needs.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|Bought this probably not for intended use of recording vocals or rough cutting music/audio capture.  Instead I was looking for an inexpensive way to primarily do 2 things:<br />1) Improve/tweak sound coming out of my Asus Xonar DG sound card for my computer.<br />2) Have a portable way to tweak music for my Ipod Touch while traveling or at coffee shops etc.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) Noticeable distortion at higher volume levels.<br /><br />2) Cannot be pushed too hard to fine tune larger speaker setups.  This exact little mixer used to be paired as a bundle for Harbinger APS 12 speakers but can't really handle them.<br /><br />3) I have been told from the salesperson from *cough cough* \\"A Center for Guitars\\" (from where I actually purchased this unit) to be VERY careful of the power connector in the back.  It's a weird proprietary connector and the replacement plug costs almost as much as the unit itself if you were to break it.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) For upto mid level volume work, INCREDIBLY clean sound separation and in very good stepping.  Tweaking highs, mids and lows is wonderful on this little baby.  I use this primarily to listen to music through headphones for both IPod music and connecting the out of my Asus Xonar Sound card from my PC to the in of this baby...and man is the sound really REALLY good.<br /><br />2) Knobs have EXCELLENT feel and just the right amount of resistance as to give a high quality feel and allowance for minor tweaking.  The knobs STAY PUT so no drift...wonderful!<br /><br />3) Holy cow batman, this thing has a lot of inputs for something so small, which gives a lot of connection and output options.<br /><br />4) FANTASTIC for small sound production like pickup music sessions or podcasting.<br /><br />5) Two phantom powered mic inputs, very useful and allows for attachment of above average mics.<br /><br />6) Small footprint with negligible weight.  I throw this puppy in my laptop bag with headphones (while carefully protecting thepower supply connector) and can literally go anywhere, plug in and have AMAZING sound on the go.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  I'm giving a very qualified BUY THIS....IF....you want really good sound in the low to mid volume range and don't want to pay an arm and leg to achieve it.  People at coffee shops have walked up to me curious to see what the hell I was doing and when they heard music with just IPod and then Ipod attached to this sucker...WOW their faces melt with astonishment at how vastly improved the sound is.  If you are expecting to produce PRO work out of this, look elsewhere.  But for music improvement, simple jam/music sessions and all basic spoken voice/podcast work, this thing is a solid buy for the price.

0525952616|4.0|I need to say first off that this is a very good book, just not another \\"daemon\\" which I absolutely loved. I was really looking forward to this book and pre-ordered it.  As soon as it arrived, I eagerly dove in and started turning pages. The first quarter was dry so I looked to see if there were any reviews. Within the first hour of the book being released, there was a glowing five star detailed review. Seems a little suspicious and Suarez himself addresses these issues in the book. I guess the first quarter sets up the technology and context which pays off in the rest of the book. I am glad to say that the last half of the book is very exciting and I could not put it down. This may not be as innovative as \\"Daemom\\" and \\"Freedom,\\" but it is highly enjoyable and worth your time.<br /><br />Update,  while I will leave my review at 4 stars, I must report that this book has sat really well and my appreciation has grown for it.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|I heard the movie sucked. But then just last week I saw thos DVD still sealed on the wrapper at a GoodWill shop. I just gave in and decided to give this flick a fair shot.<br />I was pleasently surprised!<br />The visuals are stunning. Especially the race tracks.<br />The cars look exactly like they do in the anime.<br />The character's costumes look very true to the anime and magna.<br />The story line pretty much close to the anime. I understand that not all of the elements from the show and comic could fit into a 2 hour movie.<br /><br />If you loved the anime and comic then get this DVD!
0143121316|1.0|For people who have some knowledge of China, the book is of NO interest. Other books by James Mann (About Face), Jonathan Fenby, not to forget Spence (In Search of Modern China), are clearly superior.<br />Kissinger's admiration for Mao is a disgrace. Mao was a murderer! and Kissinger's repetitions admiration for China's civiliztion is non-sence. Over the centuries, China has been a mess, with short periods of success, but mostly calamities. Because of its size, China should have been a success, but it is not. Japan was must faster on its feet! China's isolation was a huge mistake. It is only recently, thanks to Deng and Western support, that China at last is emerging!<br />Kissinger acknowledges that China has always played one \\"barbarian\\" against the other. It is very true but he does not draw any conclusion. To-day China is gaming both Europe and America: Just look at the \\"free\\" transfer of thechnology. The West is stupid and we should unite ton face China...<br />The last point is Climate Change. To write about China and not discuss the catastrophic impact of climate change, is a major failure of the book. China - and Asia - will be destroyed by climate change.<br />The combination of bad governance, corruption, and climate change is DEADLY. It is a Chinese and Asian disease.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie really shows what our servicemen and women are doing to keep our great nation safe. This movie must be seen to know what Navy Seals do to protect us.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I enjoyed this book and liked the interview style format. Really seemed to capture the characters thoughts and feelings about WWZ. As you read each interview, you really have to visualize the situation and the region it took place in. I could see how that could be a challenge for those inept in physical/cultural geography.<br /><br />What I didn't like was all the footnotes.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is one of the best apps in the world along with all the other angry birds games. great for passing time by.

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This John Ford masterpiece is a gritty  story of a family's struggle for survival during the Dust Bowl of the Thirties.  Ford has taken the Pulitzer Prize novel by John Steinbeck and with a brilliant screenplay by Nunnally Johnson, captured the utter despair and hopeless situations and barriers erected against the Joad family.<br /><br />After losing their farm in Oklahoma during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the movie details their misery as they travel to California in search of work and opportunities. Ford has always been a master of geographic realism, and his powerful shots of the dust storms, the  rickety truck that carries the Joads west and the intense acting scenes played against vivid backdrop sceneryare gripping.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath has long been recognized as a great film, perhaps the best, that illustrates the Depression and the despair experienced by so many Americans.  Whether students of history or students of film, The Grapes of Wrath belongs in your library.
B00884GR0W|3.0|The game is good but,  as in the title,  it glitches all the time. I can only play for a minute and then it shuts off. And when I get back on it turns out I wasn't on long enough for it to save.  It would be great if they could fix that glitches.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have finished reading all three books.  There is only one recommendation that I have for the writer is that after reading Christian's thoughts on the last chapter I would have liked to have his inner thoughts throughout the whole book.  These were the best books that I have read in many years.  I felt that her writing was very easy to read and I could not stop reading the books.

B0014KFV6I|5.0|If you like classic Carole King, you will enjoy this CD.Takes me back to those dreamy days in the summer.
0345803485|5.0|Yes the trilogy is hot.  A book about cars has ... cars.  A book that talks about sex has ... sex!  But that's not all these books have.  EL James is a good story teller.  She presents the characters, the atmosphere, the walls, the drapes, the rugs, the fireplaces ... you really see a great narration.  Then the author introduces Anastasia's \\"Inner Goddess.\\"  This character acts as a pseudo Greek Chorus, marching along the story in the background, mirroring Anastasia's reactions.  Great addition!  I love the books.  I will read them again.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Hi I am an intermediate when it comes to aerobics this is an oki DVD I was  able to follow along some modifications needed not a big deal. Jillian is irritating to listen to after a while when you get the routine down you may want to turn up your tunes! She does not cu at all so beginners I advise watching it first and try not to get discouraged.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|What a great following to the first Fifty Shades. Turns out to be a lovely romance about true love and destiny.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Basically a decent feature rich photo editor for the phone. I wouldn't call it photoshop yet but it's a very good program. Let's you adjust photos to make them richer and sharper. Works great on SGS3 and incredible 2.<br /><br />It saves the edited photo as a separate file from the original so you can always go back if needed. Great idea. One complaint is that not all the functions have an undo button. Often your only choice is to discard all changes made which can be a hassle. Otherwise awesome all around app!
B004EPYZQ2|2.0|This is not a good movie, it's meant for kids but surprisingly given the pg13 cert. because of profanity and coarse language spoken by the child actors. It's shocking to hear that fat movie director character in this film bossing the other ones who are smaller and thinner than him around and that's why I would not recommend it to parents for a Sunday afternoon viewing with their kids. Very similar to cloverfield except the main characters are all tweenagers. Maybe it was intended as a prequel to cloverfield. No ones noticed it but me.. Yeah I think I'm the only one who does. mr Abrams must stop all this friends stumbling upon aliens type of idea.. It just doesn't work anymore. Don't buy the movie, rent it instead. Bluray pict quality 5/5, audio quality 4/5

B004SUWR2C|1.0|It offers single player game but doesn't work. Had to download something else for it to work on my Fire. Too confusing, like the original board game much better. I uninstalled it, glad it was free.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|How can you not like this show?  The complexity of characters is great with the main character and plot gripping and entertaining.  Between Mad Men, Walking Dead, and Breaking Bad - AMC is doing something right.  As the series progresses, the storylines have become darker with the main character becoming more and more of a bad guy.  The question now is how will AMC end the series?
B0000A36J5|5.0|it's amazng have this edition with figure Gollum .. it's more value than anything. I loved Figure Gollum but i have blu-ray edition too. But i think pciture still the best for blu-ray edition

B002C949KE|4.0|For those interested in a different perspective on how we make everyday decisions, Dan Ariely's book is a worthwhile read. His well researched text cites numberous human behavior experiements, many of which are his own, yet is a fast and easy read for all, even those not trained in behavioral economics, his specialty.
0312427999|5.0|I wish everyone would read this book-- it would be an eye opener to most.  Other reviewers have summarized the book better than I can.  I just wanted to recommend it to anyone who envisions a world-wide \\"brotherhood of man\\" that eventually triumphs over the corporate imperialism that so far seems to be winning.

B005ETA5K2|1.0|The Alfa High Gain USB wireless adaptor (AWUSO36H) should not be sold by amazon or anyone else. Should have listened to other buyers that had a problem. I bought the device in May and it flat out quit on July 19, about 1 month out of warranty. This is a rip off item that should be discontinued.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is really fun and I play it all the time! In a lot of levels you have to really think in order to complete it, or just use a hint or two. Ok so here's a secret: if you tap on the paintbox on the home screen three times, you get four SECRET levels!!!!! I just found that out! Hope it helps!
B001GQACGE|2.0|I was disappointed to find that my CD was scratched pretty bad.  I put it and and was happy that it at least plays.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this because it looked intriguing and boy is it ever!  It is fantastic!  As you progress through the puzzles, you learn techniques that make it easier.  The flip side to that is that as you progress through the puzzles, they get more and more difficult.  The puzzles get large and complex, and sometimes it is tricky to highlight the cells without fouling up others around the one(s) you want to change.  because of this, I would not suggest getting this for use on a phone or a small tablet.  In my opinion, it would be a source of frustration and would tarnish what is otherwise a fantastic puzzle game and a great way to pass the time.  Five starts all the way!
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I adore this movie, and after renting it three times from RedBox, I knew I needed to just buy it. I got a \\"like new\\" warehouse copy from Amazon, and watched it over the weekend - GREAT, as expected.
B0042ETJU2|4.0|If you're looking at this item, odds are you already know whether or not you like these movies, so I'm not going to waste time talking about the artistic merit of them. While I enjoy them quite a bit, Predator is essentially 2 hours of Arnold screaming, Predator 2 is Danny Glover and Gary Busey chasing a Predator that's also maybe chasing them and oh man drug wars, and Predators is Adrian Brody trying to be Not Adrian Brody while things die horribly. These movies shouldn't be nearly as enjoyable as they are, really.<br /><br />Anyways, the picture quality and audio quality is what you would want from a blu-ray collection. Everything looks quite nice, and the sounds, while not superb, do have some high points, such as the sheen of a sharp object being thrown.<br /><br />My reason for purchasing this was to have a matching set to the Alien Anthology. While it has nothing on that in terms of the sheer volume of content, it is definitely a serviceable companion, albeit one that clearly had next to none of the love that AA had put into it.<br /><br />As for the negatives, the digital copies that are included of all three films are troublesome. For one, they're practically advertised to you even though you've already purchased the product. Half of the back cover for each individual case is dedicated to the digital copy, and each case contains a second disc. Make sure you are strapped in, folks, because this might just blow your mind.<br /><br />If you put the second disc into your computer, a window opens that lets you enter in the serial code for that films digital copy.<br /><br />Of the 6 discs in this set, 3 of them are simply another layer of DRM. On the plus side, you now have three discs you can try to make a Predator Disc out of once you've redeemed all your digital copies.<br /><br />The larger issue with the digital copy is that most people are going to try to redeem it through iTunes. Well, unless you live in the UK or Ireland, where this is originally sold, you can't. The discs are region free, but your codes won't be region free if you use them with iTunes. I went through Fox customer service and they were actually pretty easy about the whole thing. My suggestion is to redeem the code for the Windows Media Player copy, which IS region free, and use a program of your choice to convert it to a format that plays on your device of choice.<br /><br />To be clear, this review is for the white set with the cover art depicting the sideshot of a Predator mask.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|There are lots of levels to keep you entertained and a great app to get your mind working. Plays great on the Fire.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|As compared to quick office pro this seems one step below.  It's okay but a bit less straightforward and adds extra steps but it was free so I really can't complain.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I like it but whenever you get in the mid or high 4tys of the game that's when its impossible to get iny higher in the game but I was detekined to beat this game but it impossible newed to be able to beat dis game!

0312106122|5.0|The book is based on a translation of ancient scrolls discovered in Egypt that were written by a slave.  The slave was obviously gifted in many ways, perhaps a God himself in that his abilities were extraordinary. Clearly not the average mortal. I have heard many stories from many walks of life and this is in my library of favorites. I was able to smell the smells in this story.  I have never done that reading a book before. I was able to feel the magic and even the scrolls the slave wrote on. I was able to see it all as if I had been there, even more. Most of what I read made perfect sense, at least 70% I could perfectly believe. Of course as with any work of historical fiction there were parts I had to discount but even then, I did not loose affinity for the story. Wilbur Smith is in the same category of story telling skill with Victor Hugo. I loved this book and am glad for the friends who encouraged me to read it!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I absolutely loathed this book. It was poorly written, repetitive and BORING. E.g Why was it necessary to mention his 'grey' eyes over and over again?....and what woman would refer to her genitals as her 'sex'?!!
B007TML4EI|5.0|A great value for $1.  This engineering game is fun and challenging. If you like games like Link, X Construction, Wooden Bridges, Gold Rush etc, then you will love this game. I Highly recommend it for those who don't mind thinking a little.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this type of game. Haven't found anything too annoying yet! I will plan to update my review. We'll see!
B00884GR0W|5.0|The game is great. love how you can alter nearly everything but you tend to get lost...there needs to be some sort of map or direction other than just a pause menu compass.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Works as advertised, I am very impressed.  Will connect directly to 18 dBi yagi antenna using sma connector.  Yagi only improved range a little (1/2 mi+) but made it much more directional making it easier to locate signal. Long range requires line of sight.
B007WFR0QS|4.0|Heard this on a tour of the Highlands in Scotland. Good variety and great artist. Love her voice...Good music to drive by and to sit back and relax by
034580404X|5.0|I've heard so much about these books. Saw them reviewed on several talk shows. All my friends were talking about them, I had to find out for myself just what the excitement was all about! The books did not disappoint. I'm almost done with Book 3, and then I intend to start over with Book 1. I just can't let the characters of Christian and Ana go.
B0000714BP|5.0|I love this movie. I remember seeing this in the movie theatre when first released. Lots of great fun but also great take away of tolerance. I which everyone could be as non - judgemental as the small town in the movie. A must buy for all.....
B007P06DJK|5.0|25 years later this album holds up. The last vinyl album I bought was Graceland 25 years ago. The cd version sounds just as good.
B008MEM24S|4.0|just found out about it is fun but it is a little to tricky. great grafics for a game like this. you must try!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I have spent many hours playing this game and love it just had a new and improved upgrade so it 's like a whole. new game...!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game!!!!!! I could play it all day!!! it is my fav. game on my kindle!! love it!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game (I mean games) you earn points to earn new games . But I hate the fullscreen ads I wish they made a ad free verzion
B0083GR6Y6|2.0|no worth watching.  not the typical Liam \\"kicking butt\\" movie I expected.  very disappointed....this should have been free from prime members.  I don't mind paying a few bucks for high rated movies, but this was a one or two star movie.
B008MEM24S|5.0|even if you have no clue about this character the game has eenough unique aspects apart from where's my water that its totally worth a dollar
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have apparently matured a lot since my early 20s - I attempted to read this shortly after it was first published in '98, but was only able to get through the first few chapters. I decided to give it another try after all the recent hype and the TV show (still haven't seen it). I'm glad I did - this book is fantastic. The story is incredibly engaging, very true to the medieval period, and despite the unexpected killing off of some great characters, a very fun read. Recommended.
B008CP93S0|4.0|Clearly this is not \\"great cinema\\" or a deep film in any way, but so what...it's a comedy and it does have many funny scenes. I assumed that because of the 3 * rating, it would be one of those 2 laugh movies that are mainly just boring filler. I kept passing it by for that reason. Well, I finally gave it a try, and it was actualy pretty entertaining. Now, let me say this- I have never done a movie review before, and I don't generally enjoy artsy ,introspective films, per se. Primarily, my favorite genres are thriller/mystery/suspense films. I find it difficult to go by people's reviews because everyone has different tastes. Product reviews are more cut and dry- it works or it doesn't, it has these features, etc.  A film is subjective. Usually, if it has 1 star and a bunch of reviews, you can assume it is something to pass up, but what about something like this, where it has a middle of the road rating, a mix of good and bad? I liked it, but there are some films I like that you might loathe,so I'll say this:<br /><br />It was funny enough to keep my interest and make me chuckle here and there<br />There is some nudity, portrayed in a comical light, definitely some dirty language<br />It's certainly not a movie where I just had to know how it ended, I was just enjoying the quips.<br />If you like Paul Rudd, this has plenty of his style of sarcastic humor- love that<br />lots of funny characters, not just one or two<br /><br />I just wanted to add a positive review, because I think there may be some people out there, like myself, who passed this up because of the rating and don't realize that it is actually a funny film worth renting. I'm not at all sorry I rented it, like I am in the case of a movie called \\"9 June\\" which also has a 3 * rating- that was something that I can't believe I sat through, just waiting and waiting for something to happen. So, you never know, both films with similar ratings, and I had completely opposite reactions to them.
B008MEM24S|5.0|its so fun I love playing it I'm obsessed! (:<br />I always am playing cant stop love you Perry. ur tottaly awesome I love this...
B0087YYHZU|4.0|When I got the 2 DVD edition a few years ago and watched this movie on a HD 32in TV, I could tell that this had to be one of the best looking DVD-s out there. I don't think Criterion could have done a better job on the DVD. Everything on the image side was perfect. Fast forwarding a few years to the new blu-ray edition, and although it looks in general very good, it seems a little uneven. The second part, especially the Broadway episode, looks terrific. Clearly superior on a 50 inch TV when comparing to the DVD edition - a lot more detail, same great colors. However, an earlier scene, when various types of dresses and costumes are presented with one of the songs, have an unusual amount of color pixilation - it is possible they may have overdone the saturation. The DVD did not have that issue.<br /><br />All in all, this is considered by many the greatest musicals of them all - and this includes the prestigious Sight & Sound magazine. I think it can also be considered one of the happiest movies ever. Worth the upgrade? If you are in the 40-46 inch window, you might be in the grey zone. Keep in mind that you'll have black bars on the sides - since the movie was shot in 1:1.37 aspect ratio. Smaller TV, I'd say stick with the DVD if you already have it. Larger, go with the blu-ray.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Playful touchscreen beauty-maker.  Colors bouncing off the physics engine.  I would only ask that the creator keep creating these.  I don't need a ton of options (recording or changing speed).  I like the simplicity.  Hand it to a child or an adult, they will be equally rapt.  If I were to offer any suggestion for the next app, I'd say let us play with more than just pixels at a time, give me shapes or bubbles to play with.  Love the gradient color schemes.<br /><br />Just all sorts of awesome.  Thank you!
B00634GHJA|4.0|This is a  great app. It saves a lot of time transferring photos between my laptop and Pc. My only regret is that it can only transfer 100 photos at a time. Otherwise very handy.<br /><br />customer service is very helpful.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|mix and match, toil and boil , a blend of smarts and whimsy. I love this and can't wait to see what match I find next !
B007V2UGPE|5.0|After this latest update, this game has become a must own for anyone that likes anything zombie. Even without spending extra cash, the levels are challenging, but manageable. Highly recommend.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|You're in command of a vessel with no radar, cut off from all reinforcements, and seriously outmatched by your opponent. Your opponent being aliens. Do you panic? Do you surrender? Do you pay more than ten dollars to see it?<br /><br />  In 2005, NASA has discovered a planet outside our solar system with conditions similar to those on Earth. Hoping that it contains intelligent life, they construct a powerful array of satellite dishes in Hawaii to transmit a signal to that planet. Simultaneously, unambitious Hawaiian native Alex Hopper (played by John Carter from John Carter Taylor Kitsch) meets a beautiful woman in a bar he wants to impress. The woman (played by Brooklyn Decker) wants a burrito but the bartender won't accommodate her. Hopper (Kitsch) hears this, introduces himself, and goes so far out of his way to impress her that he breaks into a minimart and is tasered by the police just as he's approaching the beautiful woman, burrito in hand. Alex's older brother Stone (played by Alexander Skarsgard) has had it with his brother's antics and makes him join the Navy. Seven years later, Alex is a lieutenant and tactical officer on a destroyer and the beautiful woman, Samantha, (Decker) has accepted his marriage proposal, pending her father's approval. Her father (played by Liam Neeson), an admiral whose character isn't given a first name, is Alex's superior who has disciplined him on several occasions and has grown just as frustrated with him as Hopper's brother has. Then, during an international exercise with the Japanese Navy, the world and the island come under attack by the very same aliens they hoped to contact.<br /><br />  Now, this isn't the first movie ever to be based on a board game. Clue came out in 1985 and had a much better cast. Also, Clue is a game with characters in it. Battleship, on the other hand has none. It also doesn't have aliens. While there is an actual battleship late in the film, the alien munitions resemble pegs, and the crew is forced to fire blind once they've lost radar, this movie has nothing to do with the game. Other detractors seem determined to lay the movies failures at Rihanna's feet, this being her first acting role, but she really doesn't have that many lines and the failures in Battleship are so much bigger than this one minor character. Whether Transformers turned out the way Michael Bay and Spielberg wanted it to, it was a box office smash. Battleship is an inferior imitation, and I say that as someone who doesn't even like Transformers. Given how it's performing at the box office, I probably don't have to say this, but skip it.to fire blind once they've lost radar, this movie has nothing to do with the game.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|Hard to know if it beats Adore, but it´s certainly a great rock album done by one of the best rock singers and multi-instrumentalists of all times.  Billy really pulled it off again. After Adore (Best SP album), Zeitergeist was a low point in SP history, but Oceania is overwhelmingly good! Keyboards, guitars and incredible vocals make this album very special.<br />Come on people, listen to the rock albuns that are been put out these days.....and compare to the quality of a SP album! Name the best rock bands nowadays...most of them are from the 80´s and 90´s such as U2, Depeche Mode, Placebo, REM, Pearl Jam, Metallica, System of a Down, Alice in Chains, Radiohead...etc...and of course, Smashing Pumpkins. I am not saying that there aren´t good bands from the 00´s, but listen to Oceania with patience and care, and you´ll see what I am talking about!! Refreshingly awesome! Definitely, a must have!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I started playing these mini games one night at about nine thirty and played until about midnight when I had to work the next morning at seven...<br />and I'm still playing days later.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|Watched the movie via the PS3 Amazon Instant(HD)video feature. The quality of the video stream was great and uninterrupted.<br /><br />The movie itself is what you would expect from a mission impossible movie, a great summer action movie!

030758836X|5.0|Nothing I say will describe the journey you are about to take in reading this cleverly structured story. It is anything but a formulaic plot. Great writing, well-developed real characters. Everyone can relate to many aspects of this couple's relationship. But, hopefully not everything. They take it to a new level of complication. Hyperbole? Yes. I'm left with a conflicted reaction about these two people. That's good.<br /><br />After you've read it, this is my final thought. For all of you who hated the ending- Spoiler Comment!!!<br /><br />Spoiler Comment: The ending was an extension of this book's brilliance. It was consistent with the characters' dynamic and sick dance. He felt trapped by her escalating psychosis and had to keep her close to protect himself and his loved ones; she needed to stay ahead of her own mind games by keeping him as a possession. One of them will end up killing the other.<br /><br />Carol Colitti Levine<br />thesidetrek
B006YM9JSW|5.0|No problems so far, everything works at it should! I'd definitely recommend it to anyone! The price was good too!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game was a great download. runs well. becomes very addictive. great brain teaser. would be nice to have a solve option for when you get stuck but I that would defeat the purpose I'm sure.

B0086700CM|3.0|this is such a boring app it is no good at all<br />won the other hand it is just great
B006JPS1OM|5.0|This is a game that keeps me interested.  I only wish my eyes were better for finding objects. Its a great way to fight boredom. Unfortunately I was playing the free version so it stopped after a while and told me I had to purchase the full game to continue. Since they had not told me this up front I opted out.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great concept, well-executed game! Way too easy for the first 40-50 puzzles, but really fun. Plays great on my kindle fire.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is not just a time pleaser it it also a mind teaser which keeps you sharp. I strongly recommend this app for everyday enjoyment. keepind you occupied for hours on end.

B0072NWJRK|2.0|I bought the Kindle edition based on a review in the Washington Post. The book deals with the murder and mutilation of a young Englishwoman in China in the 1930s. The case was never solved, but the author does a thorough job of telling the story while adding some speculation about the perpetrators of the murder. Frankly, I found both the story and the telling somewhat less than compelling.
0393325172|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I'm tempted to give it 5 stars.  It has action, adventure, humor, and a wonderful glimpse of life in the British Navy in the early 1800s.  The culture is fascinating.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars because of the language.  There were so many words and phrases I didn't understand, I feel like I only \\"got\\" 3/4 of the book.  It was difficult to keep up with the action at times.  Plus, O'Brian has a tendency to change places or circumstances without alerting the reader.  I would give the book 5 stars if it had a glossary in the back.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the next book in the series!!
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|How lucky we are to have a glimpse of Fiona Apple's soul through her music.  Just incredible.  She is back with a vengeance.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I bought this song without knowning anyting about the song or the artist.  I liked the beat and the song was cheap.  After I paid for the song I played it for my daughter and her friend.  Apparently the song is pretty popular.  Last night I say the artist singing this song on an awards show.  I am surprised we were able to obtain the download at such a cheap price.  Thanks Amazon!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|In my opinion the book was written for adolescent males, who have little or no understanding of love or sex. As an adult male, I find it difficult to believe \\"women\\" are reading or even interested in books of this nature. I will not read the next two books in the trilogy. Personally, my desire to read the book was based on the idea the book was about a love story between two adults, not a story that debases women, I can't understand why a woman would write such a book.
B000TETM7Y|4.0|If you are in the mood for some mellow soulful musice this album is your answer.  This album is great.  I used to listen to it as a teen.  I was glad to see the album was so affordable.  It was easy to download.
1451627289|5.0|This is an excellent book.  If you're concerned that you might not be that interested because it's more of a history book, or that you're going to follow JFK's every move for over 800 pages, toss that idea immediately.  Yes, it's about JFK's assassination, and the protagonist's attempt to thwart it, but it's also a great deal about the late 1950's, early 1960's, life, love, loss, persistence, and more.<br />As for another reviewer who said that he liked it '... until King used the book as a political vehicle', I couldn't disagree more.  Yes, he gives a few slaps against Dallas during the book, and explains that a bit in an afterword, but in the vast majority of the book it's all about the story, and the times, and King isn't raving about how great (or not) JFK was or wasn't, nor is he pro/con about Oswald's views, etc.<br />Even though I say 4.5 stars in my title, I'm giving it 5 because i saw someone else giving it 4.5 but who actually gave the book 4.  Just trying to even things out!
B007IXGUG0|5.0|Drake seems to be a household name.  This was the first album that I bought from Amazon.  The album was marked down to a low price which quickly went up after I bought it.  I was glad that I bought it when I did.  There are many popular songs on the album that are played on the radio.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is so cool..... it is the best ever...... who ever likes where is my water its just like it but better....... i recommend  that you get it!
B00000K2UX|5.0|Classic 80's music takes me back to a simpler age. Great summertime soundtrack, perfect for BBQs and beach parties. Extended version is nice as these songs had great scenes in the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a very fun game it it challenging and cool at the same time this is a great game all around
B002QH2NUA|5.0|If you like the Beatles and/or Paul's solo work, you will LOVE this CD/DVD combo.  The songs are a good variety from both the Beatles catalog and Paul's solo work, the band is tight, and Paul sounds pretty darn good for someone who is over 64 (I guess we will still need him and feed him!).  It is also cool to see Paul play different instruments--of course his Hofner Violin Bass, but also lead guitar, acoustic guitar, mandolin, ukelele, and piano!<br /><br />The DVD has the whole 2.5 concert in living color!  A nice package!

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Reviewers who disliked this film felt it was too slow and could have been edited and improved by deleting a third of it without harming the plot. They also disliked the acting which they felt was too laid back. I can understand that they felt this; however, I agree with the reviewers who saw these facts as positives. I felt that I was being drawn into the film little by little, wondering what was going on, who were these people, what were they after, who were the good guys, and why was the bad guy bad. These questions were not off-putting, but to the contrary, they added to the suspense. I also liked the acting, the scenery, the glamour, and the surprise ending.<br /><br />The only criticism that I see is that the plot is unrealistic. If a very rich man, a billionaire, wants to evade capture by the police and the man he stole the billions from, he wouldn't need to go through the elaborate sequence of shifty and sly maneuvers that the film's character goes through. But this really doesn't bother me. I also like sci-fi films which are not realistic. One should allow story tellers to tell stories in their own way, as long as there is internal consistency and the story is entertaining, and this film was entertaining.
1402786360|5.0|Just rcvd the book through the post. The book is amazing at first sight, the pages are full of colorful tastes. I have not read the book yet, but i have no doubt regarding Heather's writing & baking & arting skills, since i do follow her blog. The reason why i post this comment is its super-fast delivery. Living in Turkey and rcvd in 12 business days though with the cheapest international freight. It was supposed to be 18-32 workings days, so i was just suprised and much happy with this delivery. Thanx !!!
0670023329|5.0|Shin's story ripped me apart.  This is George Orwell's 1984- in vivo.  Shin's sufferings mock our daily quibbles.  I felt guilty yet fortunate just having a bowl of rice for dinner.<br /><br />David Graham's review provides a fine summary:  a North Korean born in an internment camp suffers through  a lifetime of torture and manages to escape through audacity and luck.  Rather than approaching Escape from Camp 14 as a memoir (Shin already wrote one in Korean), Harden approaches the story from a journalist's perspective, and I think it's a good move.  Almost no one will understand Shin's lack of 'normal' emotion (particularly regarding his family), and not until a few years after his escape does Shin realize this vital fact.  This book is a quick, easy read, and Harden adds just enough background info on North Korea to augment rather than interfere with Shin's life story.  Additionally, Harden and Shin courageously depict his inability to assimilate to a new world.  It's not a happy ending, at least not now.<br /><br />In addition to the text, pictures are placed in the middle of the book, contrasting a gaunt and diminutive Shin with the pudgy North Korean dictators who caused so much suffering.  The illustrations, drawn by Shin, are devastating.<br /><br />I hope Shin can find peace, however elusive it may be.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|spend way too much time playing this game! I find it easy to forget work problems while improving my memory and observation skills.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|How about blocking in app purchases instead of blaming the game for something your kid did.  My five year old plays on my kindle all the time and is not able to purchase anything BECAUSE I HAVE THE BLOCK ON.  Imagine being responsible for yourself instead of having a game babysit your kids.

B000GLDOXS|5.0|I think this is a great movie. I like it because it is a true story. I am a fan of true story/history movies. This movie can also be very heart breaking, but it can also make you feel proud of all of those man.<br /><br />My husband has been wanting to join the Navy since he was a kid. He still does till this day, but now there seems to be a waiting list here in Abq to join the Navy doing Medical. There are day's I wish he was in the Navy. Just because it is something he wants to do. But then there are thoughts of this movie that makes me happy he isn't in the Navy and I know that he is a lot safer at his job then out in the battle field. Which is where he would have been because he is a medical.

B00004YRQA|5.0|This is an excellent little memory card, it never fails me. The package wasn't sealed properly when it was mailed off because when it got to the post office they had to tape it shut due to it being open when they received it. But that's the sellers fault, nothing to do with the actual product itself.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|i thought this book and the other two were fantastic. they opened my eyes to other peoples points of view and that its okay to be different, and to be who you are sexually and also that sometimes people are arseholes because of something thats horrible thats happened to them that has effected them badly, we may never know what that is but maybe we should keep that in mind when dealing with people who have walls up or are using anger as a means to push people away. as a child abuse sufferer i went through all these things and this book gives me hope that their is still someone out there for my crabby angry sexually devient self ;) lol. it may be childish fantasy to some people but who ever said it was reality???? i dont remember anyone saying it was.... i love christian cos hes my guy equivelent and he was written well, im pretty sure lots of child abuse sufferers could relate to him greatly and i love ana cos she sticks with him through his bulls#*t to get to the real deal, which so many people wont do these days but at the same time she doesnt let him disrespect her which is a fine line to walk and takes courage.
B001GCUO5M|1.0|I will be happy when Martin Scorcese realizes that Leonardo DiCaprio is not the second coming of Robert DiNiro.<br /><br />I suppose that my dislike for this movie came from the fact that about 15 minutes into the movie, I \\"Got\\" it. I'm sure that many others did also. I knew what the big secret about SHUTTER ISLAND was, rendering the movie tedious and boring. I stayed with it until the bitter end anyway because I am a big Scorcese fan.<br /><br />The central theme and the movies' big surprise reminded me of Roger Kay's THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI from 1962 with its screenplay by ROBERT BLOCH.<br /><br />I'll give this movie two stars; one for the gorgeous visuals and another for the gallery of fine supporting performances.<br /><br />This movie is way too long for its plot.<br /><br />This project would have been better if it had been directed by Brian DePalma.

B0087240Z4|3.0|I was expecting more from this album.  I heard an interview with Billy Corgan and he said how he thought this was more along with lines of Siamese Dream, so I rushed to buy it.  The last Pumpkins album I really listened to was Mellon Collie, and love that one.  But this one fell short.  It has its moments - I really like 3 songs, but overall its just okay.  Some of the drum arrangements actually made it tough to listen to.

B007704HO6|5.0|A Street Cat Named Bob by new author James Bowen is the most heart-warming book I've read since Vickie Myron's Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched The World. Bowen's story of his misadventures, mistakes, culminating with his falling through the cracks of modern society and ultimately his rescue by new-found friend Bob is the epitome of the modern fairy tale. Instead of the knight in shining armor saving the day, salvation comes from the most humble and unexpected place. Bob is a Frodo for animal lovers everywhere.<br /><br />  Without giving away the entire book, James is a man who grew up in England and in Australia. He had a rough childhood because of moving so much and this created in him many difficulties in socializing normally. This drove him ultimately away from family and into drugs and, as is often the case in these situations, the streets. Along the way he made a few attempts to save himself but never could. That is until a cat named Bob showed up on his doorstep. This new friendship proved to be the spark that got him back on his feet ultimately.<br /><br />  The anecdotes that Bowen gives make me reminisce about my own cats through the years as well the general adventures that all pet owners experience when they have a good relationship with their quadruped friends. This journey not only documents a beautiful and epitomizing modern-day fairy tale come-true but also strays in a political direction. I felt it shows how social programs that provide a hand-up are better than those that just give a hand-out. That is my thought, not necessarily the author's. All around, this was one very heartwarming adventure.<br /><br />  I strongly recommend this book and give a five star rating. The Kindle edition which I read seemed almost entirely typo-free with but one exception that I noticed. The book reads fast and should appeal to all cat lovers, most pet lovers and anyone who is a fan of the triumph of friendship and the human err... feline spirit. If you buy no other book this month, buy this one!buy no other book this month, buy this one!

B007HC3LHS|5.0|I just happened to buy this book knowing nothing of the author or her style and it was excellent! The beginning was a bit confusing until I got used to going back and forth between the past and present but it became easier to read and became a page turner. I'll look forward to more books by this author.
0345803485|2.0|The poor quality of writing apparent in this book suggested that it was drafted by a fifteen year, and the knowledge of what a sexual experiences (especially for a virgin) really is seems to suggest the same thing. It seems more like Twilight fanficiton than an actually novel, and I am surprise the author isn't sued for plagiarism because some of the sentences appear almost verbatim in the Twilight books. Regardless, neither series is worth more than a passing peruse.

B007H7XJD4|2.0|This movie was basically an imitation of 300 (both in the style of the settings used and the action sequences) dropped in a Hellenic setting.  Honestly, if you want a movie about the Greek Gods, watch Wrath of the Titans as it's story is a bit more engaging.  It also has much better actors and the fight scenes and settings themselves are much better.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch this for free elsewhere, preferably while you're doing something else.

B001QWBM62|4.0|It is an awesome gadget, very handy, extremely fun and easy to use; inspite of the numerous features. I take one star out because the phantom power on the mic makes it a bit noisy (fixed with alternate phantom power, but not portable). Overall an incredible product for the price, its like a portable studio, and the internal condenser mics are awesome.

B008HI7BMW|5.0|The soundtrack for The Dark Knight Rises is finally here, and it is EPIC in every sense of the word. As with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Mr. Zimmer has created another masterful score. Though the film is almost 3 hours long, the music clocks in at just under an hour (that is, if you don't include the five bonus tracks-the remix doesn't count). Right from the beginning, you know that it will be very heavy and gloomy, and Mr. Zimmer doesn't disappoint. Interspersed with the new material for the film are sections from Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. For example, There's Nothing Out There includes a reprise of the love theme between Rachel and Bruce from the first two movies, the only time this occurs in the entire soundtrack. Mr. Nolan knows exactly what he wants in terms of music for his movies, and with good reason. When you listen to the score, and watch the movie, you'll see why. I highly recommend this soundtrack.<br /><br />Out of the ashes in Batman Begins and into the horror with The Dark Knight, A Fire Will Rise.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Series Five of Doctor Who introduces us to the Doctor (Matt Smith) fresh from regenration and a chance encounter with a little girl named Amelia Pond.  Amelia asking for help from anyone who would listen to her meets a strange man called 'The Doctor'.  Still in the final stages of his regenration he gets to know the young girl and discovers that she is afraid of a crack in her room.  A crack that somehow has a connection to another point in time and space.  The Doctor tries to figure out why of all places a little girls room would have a connection to a prison and something or someone called \\"Prisoner Zero\\"?  With the TARDIS still malfunctioning he makes a quick jump and tells Amelia he will be back in just a second.<br />  What the Doctor didn't count on was a jump almost twelve years into the future and schocked to discover that little Amelia Pond has grown up and goes by Amy Pond now.  She on the other hand has been trying very hard to forget about that night and what the breif encounter with him has done to her.  While the Doctor tries to convince her he isn't some mad man Prisoner Zero has been in hiding within the home of Amy and using the time to camoflauge itself by the guards who just happen to locate it on Earth.  The Doctor without his TARDIS, his sonic screwdriver broken and less then fifteen minutes to save the planet he has to think of something to save it and get Amy Pond on his side.  All this plus Rory Amy's some time boy friend, the reutrn of River Song, The Weeping Angels, The Daleks even the Silaurians.  See what happens when the Doctor and Prime Minster Winston Churchill meet up and discuss the going's on of WWII.<br />  All that plus a dire phrophecy of the Pandorica opening and with it the most dangerous being in the universe shall be unleashed upon an unsepecting universe.  Will the Doctor be able to stop it in time or is it something far closer to home then he ever imagined?  Check it out in Doctor Who series Five to see.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I liked the movie although my wife said it could have done more with character building. I loaned the Blu-ray to my friend and he too liked it along with his son but his wife was only lukewarm to the movie. It's an action movie so guys will like it and gals probably won't. This movie would have done better if Cowboys and Aliens didn't come out first.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|So I have an android phone and don't need to walk around with my kindle 24x7, however I do want it protected from normal use. After reading reviews and looking at the pictures this seems like the right compromise between protection and not walking around with something the size of a book. As was said in other reviews here this case is light-weight, but that's what I was looking for. The back shell is thin but doesn't flex much when pressed in the middle while off the kindle. The front flap is a little awkward when it's new and stiff, but after a few days of use the hinge points  loosened up and it was much more fluid. The stand works well and stays put. I also plugged the kindle into the charger while I was using a touch heavy app, and while I expected the back to get hot, it was no more than without the case. The soft feel on the outside of the case makes it very comfortable in the hand.<br /><br />If you need to protect your kindle from a ballistic missile attack keep looking. Otherwise this is a great case that protects the kindle & screen and is non-intrusive.

1936608898|5.0|I just finished It Starts with Food-wow! It is a very easy, straightforward read that provides the science behind their plan, along with a very simple approach to getting started as well as life long tools for success. I especially appreciate the section \\"Fine Tuning for Special Populations.\\" I have been on a mostly whole food diet for a little over a year and a half and have been healthier than ever before in my life but with a few nagging issues I've been trying to tweak. I thought I knew how to do this diet without the book but learned that I had been making some very basic mistakes. I love their plate guide and have been using it since getting to that part in the book with great results. I have my family, including my teenagers, on a similar protocol as well. Using similar ideas in this book, my teenage son was able to get to his desired wrestling weight class without \\"dieting\\" or dehydrating himself and ended up being the regional champ his senior year of high school. The most magical changes are what we saw with my very spirited youngest son that had serious challenges with attention and sensory processing. Nothing helped as significantly as a Paleo type diet. I wish I had It Starts with Food when I got started, it would have saved me a lot of time and effort. Read, It Starts with Food and CHANGE YOUR LIFE (and the lives of your family members too!).

B001E3AXGS|5.0|As the author of Lincoln, Inc.: Selling the Sixteenth President in Contemporary America, I've read at least four-score and seven Lincoln biographies out of the roughly 18,000 books written on the Great Emancipator. But Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals ranks in my top five. There are some other biographies that offer more comprehensive details on Lincoln's life, and there are some that offer more complex analyses of his childhood, his political philosophy, his rhetoric, his moral compass, and his personal relationships. But to my mind, no other biography does a better job of bringing the context of Lincoln's presidency to life. The book offers intimate and memorable portraits of Lincoln's friends and \\"rivals,\\" helping the reader understand the particular traits that set Lincoln apart. The book is not without its flaws and limitations (which have been addressed by many professional historians), but in my opinion it is essential reading for anyone interested it better understanding Lincoln and his age.

1612130283|1.0|I like to try new authors so I thought I'd give this trilogy a try being that it's on the list of top books to read. After reading book 1 I pulled out my receipt and returned all 3 books with no desire at all to read books 2 and 3.  These books are listed as \\"erotic romance\\" when in my opinion they should be listed as \\"erotic fantasy\\".  This book was in no shape or form romantic and I feel sorry for anyone who thinks that it is.  You could tell that the book was written by an author who hadn't written books before.  She used the same words and phrases over and over again so much that it was really annoying.  I was repulsed that Ana found being painfully tortured sexually, physically and mentally a turn on.  I literally found it laughable that she was able to orgasm over and over again on every page of the book by a man who was so creepy that it was disturbing.  Being the mother of three kids ages 16, 19, and 21, I found myself very concerned that these books are being read by our younger generation and hope that my kids steer clear from this Fifty Shades Of Crap.  Thank you Sams Club for returning my money!
B003L0VJF6|5.0|This recording of the 2008 New Year's Day concert in Frankfurt is very much a celebration of Julia Fischer's undeniable talents as a musician and, at the same time, a recognition of her position as Germany's youngest professor of music - a position held at Frankfurt's own University of Music and Performing Arts and appointed in 2006.<br /><br />All of this is made clear in the detailed accompanying 'bonus' feature which is a 48 minute documentary film focussing on Julia Fischer's achievements, her current status and her future aspirations. It naturally dwells on her joint skills as a violinist and pianist and makes use of copious extracts from the two performances on this disc.<br /><br />Julia Fischer can always be relied upon to give musically sensitive and alert performances of her repertoire on the violin and she has made several very fine recordings from the violin repertoire over the last few years. This current performance of the Saint Saens marks a return to the piece with which she had previously won the Yehudi Menuhin competition years ago when still a child. It is as fine a performance as anyone is likely to hear and one which maintains an exciting forward pulse combined with more reflective moments as appropriate.<br /><br />She brings the same level of musicianship to the Grieg piano concerto, also coupled with a technique that is clearly up to the task. As with the Saint Saens, this also keeps a generally forward moving pulse but, as before, coupled with sensitivity to the many gentler moments. It is not surprising to suspect that she she seems to find the piano capable of greater expressive reward than the violin as implied in the documentary and may even prefer it as an instrumental way of expressing her ideas. She has been playing both instruments equally from an equally early age and, as she states in the documentary, it is the piano that she apparently most frequently turns to for sheer musical pleasure.<br /><br />The recording offers crisp imaging and engaging camera work The sound is presented in excellent DTS 5.1 as well as stereo.<br /><br />This then, is a totally enjoyable concert of two popular works and played extremely well by a fine musician. The documentary is an interesting extra feature. Both performances are, in my opinion, capable of being compared favourably with the best available in this format especially and so the combination makes this a very desirable disc. It should give most purchasers a great deal of musical satisfaction and therefore, in my opinion again, well worth a 5 star rating.<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />Thanks for the most informative review here. Although your production review was brief, at least now we know something about the sound and video quality and the sound format.

0345803485|1.0|I was so surprised how highly this book was rated. This book made me feel awful. The main character was controlling and mentally abusive - not to mention a stalker. How could anyone find this psycho attractive? The sex scenes were erotic but not worth the games and mental anguish. I think this book must rate highly with bored housewives/women who have no life.
B007SGM084|5.0|The trilogy of Fifty Shades was well written and kept you wanting to read more!  Told a great story of a person whose dark childhood affected his life.  Would suggest to read!
B008HI7BMW|4.0|The score is a solid work of art.  It isn't transcendent like the soundtrack for Inception, but Inception was more of Chris Nolan's pet project, while Batman Rises is probably more limited by management.<br /><br />My only fustration with this purchase has nothing to do with the cd.  It has to do with Amazon's stupid cloud service.  I just want to download my music Amazon, and not be forced to use your crappy cloud player that's never going to gain any market share.  JUST GIVE ME MY MUSIC I PAYED FOR!!

1439192812|5.0|I should preface this with the fact that I don't have any personal beliefs that conflict with what Dawkins says, and I'm not an academic in the conventional sense. I'm also in my 30's, so I'm a bit out of the target audience; but I still love this book.<br /><br /> This is an explanation of various facets of what Science has to say about Evolution, Earth, The universe, The nature of light and sound and other things that I never spent much time thinking about. Reading this, I feel like someone showed me the \\"trick\\" to this stuff and made it seem magical for me. Dawkins writing style is accessible, and makes the mind boggling seem beautiful and fun. I'm inspired to learn more about how \\"everything\\" works and am only hope that I can find other authors that can explain these things as charmingly as Dawkins does.<br /><br /> Some of the criticisms that I have read of this book state that Dawkins has a hidden agenda of putting down religion and making it seem silly to believe in those kinds of things and I think that he does make it very very clear that he views things of this nature purely as myth, not to be taken very seriously as evidence that you can build beliefs on. The agenda really isn't that hidden. Like I said, this doesn't bug me a bit, but I can see some people being bothered by this and one should keep that in mind if you are deciding whether or not to read this book.
B0084I9QIW|3.0|It says it is the complete show, but it only runs 60 minutes?  Can this be correct?  Was this just a one-off special performance, or an actual BAD Tour show?  60 minutes seems quite short to me.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I think Magic Puzzle is a good start for senior citizens to work on brain stimulation.<br />It also helps with finger and eye control.
0345803485|1.0|I fell for the hype about this book too.  It was so awful I couldn't force myself to read beyond the point where Christian's mother showed up.  After that point in the \\"story\\" I don't know what happens, and I don't care.  I gave the book away to someone else who was dying to read it.<br /><br />But...if you want a treat, find Gilbert Gottfried's inspired reading of this book on the internet!!  You'll love that!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought the hype, then I bought the book.  BORING and unbelievable.  The sex scenes were awful, unbelievable and uncomfortable.  The rest was blah, blah, blah.  I could barly finish it.  I will not be reading the second too!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I loved the first three books in this series. But after a feast for crows, I was about ready to give up. Now, having read a dance with dragons, I do give up. This series could've been wrapped up a few thousand pages and several thousand trees ago. We are now hopping and skipping from character to character without any real advancement of plot. I no longer care what happens to any of these people. There are a few characters I might have still cared about, if anything interesting had ever happened in this book.<br /><br />In other words, if the next book ever comes out, I'm keeping my money and saving my time.
B005LAIHKY|1.0|If You think Tim Burton and Johnny Depp can do no wrong, then you will probably love this film. If however, you would like to see a really great theatrical adaptation of the classic TV series Dark Shadows - well, better luck next time. Alas, this is not so much \\"Dark Shadows\\", as it is \\"The Tim Burton movie\\" - pretty much the same one he's been making over and over for more than a decade now. Tim was great back when he was doing projects that were not remakes, but as soon as he started \\"Re-imagining\\" classics, he fell into a rut, and hasn't been able to climb out, and Johnny Depp is stuck down there with him. The film starts out promisingly enough, with a similar origin story to the series, but when Barnabas wakes up in 1972, and meets his Addams Family wanna-be relatives, it all starts to come unglued. A bunch of not so funny 1970s pop culture gags follow, then we get to see Barney battle the evil Witch who vamped him out in the first place. This ain't no Hammer film, so instead of the edge of your seat Undead Nosferatu taking on a Satanic Sorceress monster clash, we get a quip spouting pale skinned goofball, competing with a Yuppie Itch-Bay in a bad wig, to see who's company can sell more Fish sticks. Yea, there is Gothic window dressing, and some Monster and Ghost lip service, but this is not your Parent's Dark Shadows - their's was way better! There are some good things that this movie has helped to bring about. Apparently, because it flopped(deservedly so), some other classics may be spared the same fate. Depp's next Victims were to be The Thin Man, and Kolchak the Night Stalker, and the former has already been shelved, hopefully, the latter will follow. Also, the REAL Dark Shadows movies(House of, and Night of)are finally being released on Blu-Ray/DVD to coincide with Burton's folly. I'm rooting for the originals to out sell Burton's, that would be sweet revenge indeed!
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I saw this on a list of top fantasy and sci-fi, believe it or not. Presumably, some fantasy fans need a refresher in some basic requirements for good reading. Tortured prose? Not it. Banal characters? No. Incomprehensible plot? Uh-uh.<br /><br /> I was an editor for over a decade, and this would never have made it past me.  And if you want to protest I need to read umpteen more books to \\"get it\\", let me reply quite loudly, \\"If the author does not get me on page one, why should I read pages two through infinity?!\\" I should at least be intrigued, interested, if not enraptured, by page twenty...not Book Two. Yes, I was that editor, and yes, I no longer am an editor because I valued quality over making a buck. I maintain it is silly to demand someone read half a series to understand the first book.<br /><br />I fear too many people mistake density and difficulty for creativity and innovation. No. Innovation was Joyce with \\"Ulysses\\". Creativity was Tolkein. This was just a waste of my time. Fortunately, I borrowed it, so I am not out a penny. God bless our public library!

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Taubes wrote this book as a follow-on to his previous book, hoping this one would be more \\"user friendly.\\" And it is.<br /><br />The subject of dieting is a complex one. There is a lot at stake. First and foremost, one's health. But there is a lot of money to be made in the whole diet industry and so, like many other things in this country, it becomes very difficult to get the big picture or to know what is true or not. Magazine ads, TV ads, multitudes of \\"products\\" bearing multitudes of claims...all aimed at the American people, many of whom are getting fatter and fatter, many of whom have developed diabetes, or whose health is even further compromised by obesity in a myriad of ways. A medical industry which has lost its way, swallowed up by the pharmaceutical industry. The agriculture industry which has a stake in what people eat, and the easier it is to grow and get to market, the more money they can make. The food industry itself which has super-sized everything, which has promoted a dizzying array of processed food meant to save the busy American some time. Food that is processed for shelf life, food that should mold after a few days, so loaded with chemicals that it is still sitting on the counter weeks to months later...is this what we should be putting in our bodies?<br /><br />So we are fat. As a nation, as a society. We have been fed so much information for so many decades now, that it is impossible to understand what to do. How to do something real and useful to bring back our health, to help us lose weight.<br /><br />Why We Get Fat is a big book. There are a lot of pages to read. When your life and your health is at stake, the information is riveting. It gives you a perspective like none other. I read it in one night. My husband read it in one day. We came away with an accurate perception of the diet research over the 20th century, and where the research and advice veered away from a healthy approach to what we have all been sold for the last 50 years,namely to eat low-fat and high carbohydrate...It is clear that in the last fifty years something has gone very wrong with nutrition in the US. How else would the staggering increases in obesity and diabetes have occurred?<br /><br />Taubes does a good job explaining the physiological and hormonal  basis for metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance...the underlying reasons for the explosion of Type 2 Diabetes, even in children. And he does a good job of saying what a person can do to reverse this process.<br /><br />Keep in mind, though it is not in this book, that there is new thought out there that is saying that there may be a reason to call Alzheimers Disease \\"Type 3 Diabetes.\\" It would make sense. How else could there be such an explosion of Alzheimers across such a broad swath of our country.<br /><br />Taubes does a great job of pointing out the reasons for the fattening of America. A good job of pointing out a way to reverse the process.<br /><br />Since following the recommendations in this book, I have lost 30 pounds, and feel so much better. I no longer crave sweets, or starchy carbohydrates. I have good, steady energy. I sleep much better. For the first time in five decades of yo-yo dieting I understand how this way of eating will be a delicious way to live out my life. We essentially eat a Paleo diet, we do not eat processed food at all, we spend a bit extra for pasture raised meat, for wild-caught fish, and we get our veggies at an organic farm...we have decided that \\"food is medicine.\\" And the bonus is, real food doesn't take much time to prepare, is actually very delicious with out all the sauces and processed ingredients. I would rather spend my money on healthy food now, than a lot of medicine later.<br /><br />Bravo Gary Taubes for tackling this subject and taking on the diet and food industry in the process.

Even as I laughed over some of the crazy anecdotes Feynman tells, I was impressed and inspired by his never-ending intellectual curiosity. After reading Feynman's story, I hope to incorporate more of that into my own life.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Hmmm, what to say. I will say that I did enjoy this book. These are not normally my types of books but I thought I would give them a try to see what all the hype was about. I enjoyed them enough to finish. I will read the 3rd one next. I really didnt care for how this one ended though, Just a little strange but I will admit, it does make me want to read the last one just to see what happens. They are very interesting books and very creative. I can say that i am glad that i decided to read them. I feel a little funny sometimes because I feel like they are more geared toward teenagers. About how i felt when i accidently bought Traveling pants and didnt realize it was for young adults.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's memoir of hiking through the Pacific Coast trail after the death of her Mother, and the dissolution of her marriage iis simply terrific. I won't go on to recount what so many before me have done, especially now, since the book has garnered mass attention due to Oprah Winfrey. I will say personally I had to have a little patience at the start of the book which dealt a lot with the death of her Mother, but a hundred pages in was hooked, and found myself incredibly moved and rooting for her and her journey, both physical and emotional.

0345803485|1.0|As an avid reader I can honestly say I've never been unable to finish a book...until now. I generally hate when people review things they've never read/seen/tried etc. completely but I feel like people should be warned against the terrible writing in this book. I tried to power through it but I just couldn't. I cannot fathom why this book is a best seller. I thought for sure there would be some redeeming qualities to this book but I couldn't find any in the parts I read. There's nothing entertaining about it, unless you enjoy childish phrases repeated over and over. The sex scenes don't even make the book worth reading. That ten bucks could've better been used as toilet paper.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Americans' sources of knowledge about life in North Korea are limited to journalistic accounts of the diplomatic antics of the ruling Kim dynasty, which reveal practically nothing, and a tiny number of credible and highly readable books written by Westerners with rare access to the facts. In recent years, two stand out: Nothing to Envy, by Barbara Demick, and, amazingly, a novel, The Orphan Master's Son, by Adam Johnson. With Escape from Camp 14, veteran reporter Blaine Harden has contributed the latest of these reports, and in many ways the most revealing.<br /><br />Escape from Camp 14 chronicles the life of Shin Dong-hyuk, only of only three people ever known to have escaped from a North Korean labor camp and made it to the West. Shin was born in the camp, his mother \\"assigned\\" to his father by guards to bear children. Both were prisoners. A superficial reading of Shin's story might suggest that he is a monster. Reading the book will help you understand how he could commit unforgivable acts as natural and necessary steps in a ferocious day-to-day struggle for survival. \\"His context had been twenty-three years in an open-air cage run by men who hanged his mother, shot his brother, crippled his father, murdered pregnant women, beat children to death, taught him to betray his family, and tortured him over a fire.\\"<br /><br />As one of Harden's North Korean expatriate sources explained, \\"`guards were free to indulge their appetites and eccectricities, often preying on attractive young women prisoners, who would usually consent to sex for better treatment. `If this resulted in babies, women and their babies were killed,' [the source] said, noting that he had personally seen newborns clubbed to death with iron rods.\\"<br /><br />When Shin fled Camp 14, it was not a vision of freedom that gave him the extraordinary courage required. It was thoughts of grilled meat. To understand this extraordinary statement, you'll have to read the book.<br /><br />Blaine Harden appeared recently in San Francisco at the World Affairs Council of Northern California in a conversation with Philip Yun, Executive Director of the Ploughshares Fund, a former U.S. diplomat who is Korean-American and has studied the peninsula for many years. Harden's soft-spoken, sometimes light-hearted presentation underlined the surreal quality of Shin's experiences inside the North Korean gulag. Responding to Yun's questions, Harden spoke at some length about the many steps he had taken to verify Shin's story.<br /><br />As Harden relates, \\"North Korea's labor camps have now existed twice as long as the Soviet Gulag and about twelve times longer than the Nazi concentration camps. . . There are six camps, according to South Korea's intelligence agency and human rights groups. The biggest is thirty-one miles long and twenty-five miles wide, an area larger than the city of Los Angeles.\\"<br /><br />The author asks why there is so little awareness in the West about the North Korean camps, and why nothing has been done about them. As the Washington Post editorialized upon publishing Harden's first account of Shin's life: \\"High school students in America debate why President Franklin D. Roosevelt didn't bomb the rail lines to Hitler's camps. Their children may ask, a generation from now, why the West stared at far clearer satellite images of Kim Jong Il's camps, and did nothing.\\"<br /><br />Blaine Harden's journalistic credits include the Washington Post, the Economist, the New York Times, the New York Times Magazine, and PBS Frontline. He reported for many years from Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia for the Washington Post, and it was on assignment to write the unwritten stories about North Korea for the Post that he encountered Shin Dong-hyuk.<br /><br />(From [...])e World Affairs Council of Northern California in a conversation with Philip Yun, Executive Director of the Ploughshares Fund, a former U.S. diplomat who is Korean-American and has studied the peninsula for many years.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good game, great for killing a few hours. It becomes easier when the writer believes it's supposed to be more difficult.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I have never, ever read a book about such self-absorbed, uninteresting people in my life!  I can't say if the author is good--if she wants you to intensely dislike every one of the major characters, then she has succeeded.  I haven't been this disgusted/outraged/disappointed with a book since my one and only venture into the Nicholas Sparks dementia.  I love a good thriller, and I enjoy psychological twists and interesting characters.  I can say, with complete honesty, that this books contains none of this.  I know it's getting rave reviews but this is one reader who sincerly wishes she had her time and money back......

B008JH5CVS|1.0|The special effects were good, the concept of prisoners being lock-down in outer space, you would think they would had better security measures. Look at the security they have earth, way beyond security in this movie but again the screen writers did a half the job require if they even did that. Hell, I'm not screen writer but I would have had you holding onto your set and wondering WHATS COMING NEXT? You have such a big playing field that should be full surprises and instead your boring people, I figured it was a love story right in the beginning But I get it, its a mystery, gee couldn't figure that one out with the guy dying and given-en him his lighter, the suitcase misdirection was really stupid.
014241543X|5.0|I've been letting this book sit in my head for the past few days because I really can't put my feelings about this book into words. So I'll settle for a very vague word: indescribable. If I Stay is purely indescribable.<br /><br />The characters in this novel could be my best friend, your best friend, someone's best friend's best friend ... They are so realistic that I think that if I tried to touch them, I'd feel living flesh. The complexity of these characters just astounds me. Mia is quiet, shy-but she's incredibly dedicated to playing cello. I don't often read music geeks in novels anymore, but I always love when I do. I'm a violin player myself, though I'm not very devoted to music; however, my best friend has been in love with her piano since she was 4. And since I don't have that kind of connection with my own music, I'm curious: I want to know what that special kind of happiness is. So far, I've only been able to compare it to my love of reading and writing. I'd say that it's this wonderful feeling that trembles in your body; it's something you can cherish and makes your heart burst. Utter joy.<br /><br />Mia's relationships with others are also incredibly unique, and you know that I'm a big fan of unique. She and her best friend, Kim (who is the queen of sarcasm), were originally mega-enemies; they didn't like each other just because everyone thought they should be best friends. But after one fight, they became instant buddies. Mia and her little brother, Teddy-who is absolutely adorable, let me tell you-are thick as thieves. And Mia and her parents are practically polar opposites; her dad was once a rock band drummer, and her mom is a total rocker chick. Obviously, with Mia's interest in classical music, their tastes clash. But the four of them make a hilarious family.<br /><br />Here is a description of the typical young adult book boyfriend: dark, steamy, handsome, hawt ... you get the point. They're supposed to knock you off your feet. So guess what theguy-Adam-does in this book?<br /><br />No, he doesn't knock you off your feet. But he is so incredibly sweet. Little things here and there just make you fall for him-like Mia did-before you even realize that you fell for him-like Mia realized. Their relationship is so un-clichéd that I want to leap for joy. Because they get in fights too. They have their differences too (Adam plays in a rock band). They are just a regular teenage couple-but the two of them are just so deeply in love I want to cry.<br /><br />But the part I loved the most about this book: the lesson. `Cause the cover pretty much sums it up with that one question: what would you do if you had to choose? If you were in a car accident, if your parents were dead, if your little brother might be on the verge of death, if you were stuck in a coma, if you knew that there was nothing for you if you came back except for a boyfriend and a best friend and a few relatives ... would you choose to live or die if you had the choice?<br /><br />It's a deep question. Right now you might say, \\"I'd choose to stay, of course,\\" but think about it. Take a deep breath and sit back and just think. You would be a seventeen-year-old orphan. Your life would definitely not be the same as it was before the accident. Would you really want to stay? Because, remember, you can't take back your choice. You're stuck with it.<br /><br />And before you say, \\"Of course Mia chooses to stay; I mean, after all, there is a sequel,\\" I'd like to point out that the sequel takes place from Adam's point of view three years later. But you might not want to read the synopsis for that, because it'll definitely spoil If I Stay.<br /><br />Deep and engrossing, If I Stay is a must for any reader. Such an emotional novel is guaranteed to kindle a response to the biggest choice one could possibly have: to live or to die.<br /><br />Source: Paperback received from giveaway

0307744434|5.0|The Night Circus is one of the most brilliant novels I have ever read! And I say that with all honesty. To not have a novel in my hand at all times would throw off my balance. Its part of me! With that being said, I have read ALOT of books. There are a few books out there that were so memorizing to me that I continue to reread them over and over again. The Night Circus is definitely one of those! I wish I were able to give a review like the ones below but I can't. All I can say is that when you read this book, you escape into a world that will have you on the edge of your seat with every turn of every page. You long to know more! It ia just .....brilliant! I hope everyone enjoys this novel as much as I did, and I hope that Erin Morgenstern writes many more magical novels!
B005CMSDKA|1.0|I borrowed the movie (Blu-ray version) from my cousin. I watched it to see what it's all about.<br /><br />The only story behind it: A young girl genetically enhanced is on the run. We never really find out why, but she is on the run from something.<br /><br />The action wasn't even spectacular. If you want action; look for Jackie Chan or Jet Li movies.<br /><br />Save 2 hours of your life and pick out a different movie to watch.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I felt the need to write a review after reading all the scathingly negative reviews here. I gave the book 3 stars because it's a good story, but not great. I felt like some of the reviewers were looking for something to hate and not really giving the story itself a chance. For me this is a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />I won't go into great detail here since so many other reviewers have already done so, but I want to point out some of what I thought made it good (and maybe put a positive spin on what others thought bad).<br /><br />The book is about a very naive and innocent, 21 year old Anastasia Steele. Ana is days away from graduating from college when she is dispatched by her controlling roommate, who is too sick to go, to the office of Christian Grey to conduct an interview.<br /><br />Ana immediately pegs Christian as a control freak and although he's quite handsome and she is attracted, she is in another league and knows it. Christian is a 27 year old self made billionaire, he's over the top handsome, and he makes her feel nervous and inadequate. What she doesn't realize is that Christian now has her in his sights and he is intrigued.<br /><br />Ana has made quite the impression and Christian starts popping up in her life (at work, at a hotel, at a bar, at school, etc.). He doesn't realize the extent of her innocence, but he knows he's no good for her, he just can't seem to stay away from her.<br /><br />One reviewer likened the story to Twilight. In as much as you have 2 people that are overly attracted to each other, but the relationship could be dangerous to one of them, I can see that. The difference here is that Ana wants to be with Christian, but she doesn't want to change herself for him, she wants to fix him.<br /><br />The best part of this story for me were the email exchanges. They often had me smiling and I enjoyed the humor. I liked that they also addressed the problem of the written word being unable at times to fully express your mood, whether angry, sarchastic, playfull, etc.<br /><br />I agree with many of the reviewers that the repetative actions described can become distracting, but bonus, you could listen to the book with your friends as a drinking game and everyone chooses an action, i.e.:<br /><br />  He cocks his head - Joe drinks<br />  She rolls her eyes - Beverly drinks<br />  He or she smirks - Donna drinks<br />  She bites her lip - Gary drinks<br />  She wants \\"more\\" - everyone drinks<br /><br />You get the picture.<br /><br />There is much more sex than any real hard core BDSM, but I would say that this is a pretty tame book when it comes to erotica. I also feel dutybound to those looking for a love story with an HEA to warn them that this is not it. If I were to recommend it to anyone, it would be someone curious about the lifestyle. The contract introduced throughout the book spells a lot out for someone unfamiliar with subs and Doms and the lifestyle.
0062206281|5.0|The Prisoner of Heaven by Carlos Ruiz-Zaf&oacute;n, translated from Spanish by Laura Graves<br /><br />The last installment in the Zaf&oacute;n trilogy that deals with the \\"Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\"--the other two being The Shadow of the Wing, and The Angel's Game.<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />The book is narrated by Juli&aacute;n Sempere, son of the owner of Sempere Bookstore in Barcelona.  It's Christmas 1957 and sales have not been good.  Mr. Sempere starts a Nativity scene on the store's display.  Things pick up.  One day, when Juli&aacute;n is left alone to manage the store, a stranger buys the most expensive book in the store--300pesetas--with a 1000 peseta bill and leaves the change.  The book is for Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres, Juli&aacute;n's best friend and co-worker in the bookshop.  The stranger leaves a note: For Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres, who came back from among the dead and holds the key to the future.<br /><br />Juli&aacute;n can't resist his curiosity and follows the stranger back to an hourly hotel where the man has rented a room for two weeks.<br /><br />The strange man plunges Ferm&iacute;n--who's about to marry Bernarda in two months--and Juli&aacute;n into a dangerous adventure that will take them back to the 1940's and a prison in the early days of Franco's dictatorship.<br /><br />The terrifying story deals with the governor of the Prison--Mauricio Valls--an evil man responsible for Juli&aacute;n's mother death, Ferm&iacute;n as prisoner number 13, his infamous escape from that prison, and David Martin--The Prisoner of heaven--who masterminds Ferm&iacute;n's escape and writes The Angel's Game--as a gift to Juli&aacute;n--and tells the story that transforms all of their lives.<br /><br />Comment:<br /><br />The three books can be read in any particular order and are the best I've seen come out of Spain.  They read easily and once you start them, you can't put them down.  I strongly recommend them to everyone....

B008645YEE|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1ETV97HNST0QV]]Director Christopher Nolan wanted \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" to bring his Batman trilogy full circle, and Hans Zimmer's score is no exception.  His music references the scores from [[ASIN:B0036B8WIC Batman Begins: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]] and [[ASIN:B001BZF9UY The Dark Knight - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]] quite a lot.  As soon as you hit play, the music instantly sounds like a Batman movie should - the themes and ideas present within the first two films can be found here as well.  This means that not all of the music is original - some tracks sound very similar to ones on the previous albums (although I'll admit it is very appealing to get to a track like \\"Rise\\" and recognize a variant of \\"A Watchful Guardian\\" from The Dark Knight score).<br /><br />Where \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" score really shines in in its new material.  In particular, \\"Gotham's Reckoning\\" (used in the film's opening plane sequence) is an absolutely brilliant piece that builds slowly into a truly terrifying theme that represents the villain Bane.  The track titled \\"Mind If I Cut In?\\" is a welcome departure from Zimmer's usual style - it is a quiet yet effective piece used in the film to introduce the cat burglar Selina Kyle.<br /><br />Another personal favorite of mine is Track 11, \\"Why Do We Fall?\\".  It is such a striking, powerful cue with tons of emotion.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you purchase the physical CD, but this album is also available as an MP3 purchase: [[ASIN:B008HI7BMW The Dark Knight Rises: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]<br /><br />EXCLUSIVE BONUS TRACKS:<br />* With the purchase of the physical CD, you can unlock two exclsuive bonus tracks online -- \\"No Stone Unturned\\" & \\"Risen From Darkness\\"<br />** iTunes also has two exclusive tracks -- \\"The Shadows Betray You\\" & \\"The End\\" (these are both spectacular, I purchased them from iTunes for $0.99 each)
1401923127|5.0|Easy to read and understand, every person should be required to read this book before any other. The book helps you understand your cells, and maybe you can finally get to know your cells. Many thanks to you Bruce Lipton for making this a better world to live in.
159514188X|1.0|im 13 years old and i read this book..i didnt like it at all....i couldnt get past the first 40 pages of it...i dont suggust this book to anyone because it is so pointless..unless u like hearing someone talk about why certain kids were the reason for her death...it drags on...the one character, clay, he got these tapes because he was one of the reasons why hannah killed herself...i wish this book just got to the reasons why she killed herself because of clay but it has to drag on about why the other people were the reasons she killed herself...i wouldnt read this book...it sounds so good in the description but its really not...sorry i repeated myself so much i just didnt like this book...
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|While I consider this album #11 as far as studio others might take 'Then and  Now' and 'Archiva - Vols 1 & 2, as some sort of studio albums also.  Whatever, this is a great release from the guys and I, for one, am well pleased that they have decided to keep releasing new music. With Wetton at the helm, maybe there isn't any stopping them at the moment.  While it will never measure up to their debut, it certainly doesn't disappoint.  Then again, I don't want it to the sound like their first.  Nothing major here as far as being different from the last and I am still missing some progressive pieces from the band as they did on their album 'Phoenix' as in 'Parallel Worlds' and 'Sleeping Giant'.  With the ensemble here it wouldn't be a stretch to do, but then again, maybe they don't want to at this stage in their careers.  The only complaint I would have is that if I had listened to it as is and not knowing it was Asia I might come away thinking Wetton had just released another solo album.  By no means does that mean I'm not enjoying this album, it's just one of those observations.  If you love Asia (minus John Payne) and love John Wetton on vocals you will be glad you picked this up.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Is it the gratuitous and copious amounts of sex? Is it the BDSM? I'm trying to understand why this is the new big thing. The writing is poor, the characterizations laughable. And yes, knowing the background of this novel, I can tell you which of the Twilight characters are whom (since this was originally an alternate universe Twilight fan fiction).<br /><br />I'm no fan of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series (though, I have read all the novels), but even that is superior to 50 Shades of Grey. It's Twilight, minus the supernatural elements, all grown up and kinky. There was no real plot whatsoever. And though I am not a connoisseur of romance novels, I have read a few--and all of them had actual plots. Not just sex. Lots of sex.<br /><br />The fact that this is the big seller... Well, it kind of makes me depressed. This is the best we have to offer in fiction nowadays? This is what people are itching to read? Wow.<br /><br />But, whatever. Go ahead and laugh your way to the bank, E.L. James. I won't begrudge you that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read. It captivates you the reader from start to finish. It is a trilogy, so don't stop reading until you have read the last book. Simply awesome. I told my husband that I need him to be my Christian Grey, dominant, rich, hot and those smokey grey eyes. Yes, I definitely need Christian Grey to tell me what to do and be in total control.

B007JWKLMO|5.0|I just spent a rainy Seattle Saturday July afternoon watching LITMW.  & I'd say it's a 5 star documentary all the way.  This is a two disc 2:13 minute Martin Scorsese film about one of the most influential people of our current times.  George's quest for self enlightenment & musical genius is so well documented, I find it hard to understand how anyone could give this less than a 5 star rating.  But like George, I'm a humble person who loves all & practices forgiveness no matter what the opinion. Peace, love & understanding.  After all, I don't want to come back as a Seattle Meter Maid... lovely Rita, Rita Maid....  No Sir.  But I digress.  This is a remarkable story about the heart & soul of The Beatles.  The man, our Fab 4 guitarist & his personal quest to find the meaning of life in this crazy world.  We miss you George.  But we know you're here amongst us. Just no longer a part of the material World.  You lucky man.  Our guitars gently weep.  But my sweet lord gives you peace.  After all, all things must pass.

034580404X|4.0|Can't give this the full five because of all the \\"Oh my!\\" \\"Holy crap!\\" and \\"His mouth presses into a thin hard line\\" repeated over and over. Ana gets a strong hand to guide her; I don't understand why E.L. James did not have the similarly strong hand of a good editor.<br /><br />In spite of this, I couldn't put 'em down, and I keep re-reading my favorite parts, trying to fathom why this series has struck such a primal chord with so many women, myself included.<br /><br />I suspect it goes back to mythology: in coming-of-age tales the world over, a boy's initiation into manhood requires that he conquer something. Sex is usually not part of that process, although he does have to learn to master his baser impulses along the way.<br /><br />But when the protagonist is a girl, her initiation into womanhood IS her first sexual experience. It's ALL about the sex. (See my video interview about the myth of Psyche, based on Paul Dobransky's theories, recorded before I read 50 Shades, on Julia Widdop's \\"Hero's Journey TV\\" site.<br /><br />At a deep, subconscious level, maybe women (no matter how old they get) long to be the vulnerable \\"maiden\\", experiencing the discovery of sex all over again. E.L.James' genius, if it can be called that, resides in Christian Grey being so sexually imaginative and inventive, that every time he does something with Ana, every time feels to her as if it's the first time. Maybe that's why the books \\"work\\" in spite of themselves.<br /><br />Give her credit too, for not making Ana a total pushover, in spite of her irresistible attraction to Christian. Feminists have been complaining that the depiction of their relationship pushes progress back by 50 years. But look again: In the face of Christian's overwhelming need for control, Ana fights to keep her boundaries intact, every step of the way. This is a psychological skill that all women must master (again, pun intended) in order to become emotionally mature.<br /><br />You might even consider it to be two coming-of-age tales in one: Parallel to Ana's constant redefining of her boundaries and her love, you have Christian's process of finding his own emotional maturity: mastering his baser impulses so his lust is elevated to love, without giving up his independence or masculinity, and still having just as much sex as both of them want, so they end up with a genuine glue that will sustain them through old age.<br /><br />At the end of the day, isn't that what most of us want? Men and women both?
B000W93CHC|5.0|I could not put World Without End down. No one does love, betrayal, evil, in a such acompelling, truthful historical setting better than Ken Follett. Be forewarned the Catholic church is ripped to shreds along with the nobility.  No wonder there was a religious Reformation. Thank you Amazon for an instaneous purchase on my kindle. I want more of this medieval saga!!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I started with the free version and soon upgraded. I love puzzles and these will make you so frustrated  that you will want to kick things. But when you solve a level it is sooo satisfying.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this whole series! Its really good and keeps you interested! I recommend reading at least the first one before you see the movie!
0061692042|5.0|This novel is full of subtle profundities and while it's pace is slow, it really to me almost screams out for a second reading.  The characters are complex and deserve the fuller understanding that is available by re-reading.  The story line is sound and quite plausible but it's Ford's view of the world that jars you to think.  And that is something to be grateful for in this era of so many trash novels.
B008JDAC7G|1.0|I hats this app it is a whole waste of money don't get it and if u don't listen you will regret playing. it
1594744769|3.0|This book started out being very suspenseful. Next it turned kind of like Harry Potter.. then it got boring with a battle against an evil being. The first half was excellent and I loved the photos. But by the end I was bored. Also this book contains violence and swearing. I don't think it's suitable for young readers.
159514188X|5.0|This is a great book! It keeps you guessing. You can connect with the character and it really makes you think about things and how you treat people.

B000M2E42G|1.0|Received this CD with Bruce Springsteen packaging and in a Bruce Springsteen box however the music on the disk is not Bruce, discovered this error too late to return. I own a copy of this album purchased from a record store many years ago, ordered this copy for a friend. Also the CD comes without liner notes; however there is a link to a website where you can download them. Highly recommend this album for someone just getting into Bruce. A hardcore fan will likely already have all these songs and versions. Recommend buying this disk from AMAZON [[ASIN:B000002B30 Greatest Hits]] not this eco-friendly packaging from a 3rd party.

B0002OERI0|5.0|It's hard to write a review for a CD, it all depands on what you like. As for me, I have listened to pretty much all Green Days albums, from 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours to 21st Century Breakdown, and I have to say this is by far there best,the songs \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" and 'Holiday\\" are the best songs, in my opinion.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It's just like Mario and I love these types of games. I like having easy stuff but I also like being challenged at least a little bit.
B00005JLKB|4.0|I was really excitied to get this show. But i was a little dissapointed. The show is good, but i just expected more. I think it is just a teen show more. But dont get me wrong its good. but sucky theme song<br /><br />p.s does the show get better (more addicting)
B005WFWVL4|4.0|Kinda reminds me of a movie that I really liked called \\"Outbreak\\" with Dustin Hoffman.<br />Not bad, and maybe not as exciting as Outbreak, but quite realistic and unfortunately, quite possible.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is awsome why do so many people hate it but monkeys scare me do they realy eat people that make them angry?????????????
0345803485|1.0|My mother had ordered this book and I borrowed this from her as there has been so much hype about it and how erotic it was. The characters were boring and the writing was so bad that I started skipping huge sections of the book.  I can't believe any one would find this book sexy.  If Christian was so successful, educated and man of the world, what in the world could he see in Ana? She is stupid, plain and simple. I quit reading the book as I didn't want to waste any more time when there are much better books to read. Even the comic strips are better written. Absolutely hated it.
B003I55BIA|4.0|I liked this book, but I wanted to love it (so three stars). Perfect Chemistry had been on my list for a long time, but for some reason I had managed not to read it. I kept coming back to it, looking at it, debating it, and probably building it up into something it just could never be. There were even times I was afraid of this book. How does that make sense? I grew up in a small town about two hours from Chicago in Illinois. Our town had a large Latino population and has a pretty bad gang problem. My school had a divide between those who have and those who have not. The lines were not clear and the lines were not necessarily racial. You could cross the lines in my little town and it really wasn't that big of a deal. Ah, so now you get why this story scared me. Could Simon Elkeles write a story so close to my reality and get it right? Could she do it without insulting me or my former community? I'm happy to say that for the most part, I did not feel insulted. There were times I had to laugh at some of the Spanish used and some of the over the top situations. There were also times I had to laugh about the way the rich (white only) kids spoke or acted in certain situations. I even had to text someone and ask if \\"people really thought that way,\\" which just showed that I only really understood one side of the community Ms. Elkeles created.<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry is a young adult romance novel. I have to mention this fact because I had to keep reminding myself what I was reading. Sometimes I wanted it to turn into a gritting novel about life in a divided community, but it wasn't that kind of book. It was a love story and a decent one at that. A story I wouldn't mind letting my pre-teenage daughter read a year or so from now (she's in jr high). As a teen romance, it is a good star crossed lover's story. The story has depth. The characters are three dimensional and I cared what happened to them.<br /><br />I believe I was nearly three quarters of the way through the book before I figured out that Alex had immigrated as a small child/baby. I'm not sure why this wasn't made clear or why it was even a part of the story. This small bit of information was almost insulting. It was as if most readers wouldn't or couldn't understand a Latino community unless it was full of immigrants. However, I didn't get the feel that all the kids from the \\"South Sided\\" were immigrants but I'm not sure if that was me or the writer projecting that onto the story. I'm not even sure why it bothered me, but it did, even though I knew plenty of people with this background. The Spanish was a little forced in some parts. I would have preferred the story to have more Spanglish, which would seem (to me) to be more common language for Alex and his friends.<br /><br />The gang stuff was almost comical. I had the impression that the only research about gang activity was obtained from watching Gangland on TV. Thankfully there wasn't enough of this content to make that big of an impact on the story. I will give Ms. Elkeles credit for not going too deep and for keeping things believable for most people. My biggest issue was Hector. At him all I can do is smile and shake my head.<br /><br />The rich kids were one dimensional to me. I looked at them as if they were the soc's from The Outsiders, but with more plot. Brittany, Cherry, the same person in a different time frame. Their clothes, their language, their cars, and their attitudes (especially the boys) all seem borrowed from the Outsiders. This isn't an issue for me though. I have probably read that book more times than anyone should admit publicly. It was a nice way to flesh out the characters, but I highly doubt anyone, more or less any group of people, are really like that. There were a lot of times I found myself asking my friends and sister if people really acted like these characters. I was shocked on one occasion to find that I was wrong and the situation I asked about was common around \\"naive girls thathave never been around poor people.\\" *scratch my head* \\"Really?\\"<br /><br />But I did like a lot about this story. I loved Alex! For the most part I understood the way his character thought and acted. As intended by Elkeles, Alex broke my heart at times. His hopelessness, his fear, his macho attitude, and his heart encompassed his situation perfectly. He's the intelligent gang member that could be anything in the world he wanted to be if it weren't for life getting in his way. I knew that guy, hell I knew several of him. That was what was great about the story, I put real faces with some of these characters. But the motorcycle was a little too much! Isa, our crossover character who bridged the gap between gangs and poms was hands down the most realistic character in this story for me. This is the person I knew in dozens of real life people. Paco was also a realistic character, so much so that I wanted to change his name in most scenes. Then there is Carmen. Oh Carmen, you scare me and you make me laugh in that good way. I liked her so very much and of all people in this story, I think I'm going to miss her most.<br /><br />Then there was Brittany. She was certainly believable. Didn't we all have that one girl in high school? That Regina George (Mean Girls reference), we all wanted to drop off the face of the earth? Who knew that she just wanted to wipe off the eyeliner, pull on some sweats, and fall in love with the motorcycle riding badass Mexican gang banger in the leather jacket (the Latino Fonzie)? But wait a minute she isn't Regina George, she's Cherry Vallens with a plotline! Her mom is crazy, she hates being \\"forced\\" into being \\"prefect\\", and she has thoughts and feelings. I wasn't expecting that! I loved how she cared for Shelly and how Brittany did everything because of how much she loved her sister. It really was a beautiful addition to the story. I don't know if her character was real, but I'm going to pretend she could exist. I'm not prepared to believe the Romeo and Juliet aspects, but THIS IS A ROMANCE NOVEL (again, said for me as a gentle reminder). I even liked her best friend Sierra. I want to believe her friend was pulling for her and could grow to like Alex. Is that too much to expect? Is this my personal prejudices showing, yet again? Probably. I really liked that little co-captain witch friend of hers. Darlene wasn't it? That one I can believe. Wait a minute, she was Regina George! I liked who Brittany became and I can appreciate her struggle even if I don't quite get it. I even like that she made mention of Sandy's sexy black outfit from Grease and then later the pom uniform thing. I like that Brittany tried it, even if it was stupid (her reasoning, not the seduction!).<br /><br />This story touched me. It made me think. It made me revisit a time and place I sometimes forget. I think Perfect Chemistry is going to stick with me for a while and I'm not even sure why. Maybe it isn't a three star book after all. Three stars cannot make me write an opus of a review. Four it is, I guess. The extra stars for making me want these things to be possible, for showing the world a piece of reality, and for selling the fantasy wholeheartedly.<br /><br />My favorite quotes:<br /><br />College is just a dream. Senior year for me is like a retirement party for a sixty-five-year-old. You know you can do more, but everyone expects you to quit. (pg 5)<br /><br />To Luis it's a bandanna. To me, it's a symbol of what is and will never be. (pg 7)<br /><br />I put on a hell of a show to the outside world; sometimes I even surprise myself.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|Since this book is written from the perspective of the child, I was intrigued right away.  I wasn't annoyed like some of the other reviewers, I just thought it was a clever angle.  I have recommended this book as a book club read.  Most liked it - there were a few that were frustrated by the writing style.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The Sound of Music is a classic for a reason, because it never loses its appeal.  Even my kids love this movie, they really enjoy it and enjoy the songs in the movie. I thought they would not be able to sit through the whole thing because it would be too boring, but not so. My kids are 10, 12, and 14 and they have loved this movie for years.<br /><br />As for this 45th anniversary pack, I was a little skeptical because I figured it was just another way to squeeze some more money out of the movie. Well, of course they have to get people to buy the movie again because most people already have the movie. However, the box set really impressed me.<br /><br />The booklet has pictures and writings from not only the movie, but it also includes history on the actual family. There were some really neat facts that I had no idea about. This family eventually moved to Vermont up in Stowe where one of the HGTV Dream Homes was built.<br /><br />All the neat little things that were included in the box set made it very special. Any Sound of Music fan would really appreciate this and find it a great investment!
B000GCFY0I|3.0|I thought the concept of the book was interesting - the idea of everyone changing to be \\"beautiful\\" at a certain age and the main character wanting to be beautiful and then going against it and then realizing that superficial beauty isn't what makes you beautiful.  That being said, the book wasn't memorable for me and I didn't purchase the next books.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well, I feel like I was the last woman on the planet to read these books!  It seems like one of those things you have to read so you know what everyone else is talking about.  I thought they were interesting - not the best writing, but I knew that based on the previous reviews.  I read all three - but I doubt I will pay to see the movie version.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|this game is fun and helps me release tention! highly entertaining as you can organize or smash stuff! lots of levels and prizes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i really liked the first book in the series, but this one is very good also, and i have just begun!!  i am sure the 3rd will not disappoint.  thanks
1577314808|5.0|I heard about this book in a small article written about a college kid who lived without social media and electronics for 3 months (I believe). They asked him if it was a hard task to achieve and he mentioned that a lot of things helped him along the way including this book. That peaked my interest enough to look it up on Amazon and after reading all the positive reviews and comments about it \\"changing peoples lives\\" for roughly $10 It was definitely worth a shot.  Bought the book and began reading, didn't start reading it EXPECTING anything, was all based on curiosity but this book is truly incredible! Every question I had along the way while reading was answered, everything was explained easily and completely understood. The things he has you try genuinely work 200%.<br />I don't know if this book will work for someone not ready to read it but I think it's worth a try to read it at least once. The benefits of learning the stuff in this book will change everything inside you if you're ready for that!  My life wasn't bad when I started reading but it has literally made every aspect of me 100% better! More then worth it !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow!!!  What a wonderful book.  Not quite what I thought but once I started reading it I could not put it down!  Perfectly completes the first two books!!  Hopefully E. L. James will write more books like these!!!
0345803485|2.0|I would normally not write a bad review, but I have to save other people some money or at least see them spend it in the right place. Anyone who read this book and liked it has not been reading this genre for long. the only good thing i can say is that a lot of attention has been brought to the other authors who have been writing good erotica for years. i got to the end of the first book and said, where are the love scenes? this was so non-erotic it could have been put on the Romance Novel shelf. Yes, they do have Naughty bits too, lots of them!! If i read the other books it will be because i got them from someone else, becasue i won't buy them.
B008K8U13K|5.0|If your game will not let you play don't send in a bad review, just lodge a complaint. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW READ AHEAD. How you lodge a complaint is very easy. All you have to do is press the &quot;report an issue with this app&quot; button under the description. Once you get there, there are many categories in which you can lodge your complaint. So please don't send in bad reviews just because your game doesn't work. You should only send in a bad review if you bought the game and didn't like it. And for all you cheep people out there, sending in a bad review saying it costs too much, please don't. I hope further bad ratings will be prevented because of my review.
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|I thought this was a very suspenseful movie with a few startling moments but I thought the ending was terrible.  Why would you produce a movie with an ending that make people come away feeling bad and telling others not to bother!  which is what I tell them.  It seems like you'd want your audience to feel good and tell others how great it was.  wish I would have just rented it so I could have returned it and forgot I ever bothered.
0345803485|5.0|I resisted and fell.  This trilogy is really one book in three separate parts.  I couldn't put it down, it's not just sex (although I can't lie, there's alot of it)but it's Christian and Ana's interplay, their personal dynamics and banter.  I love a great ending, I love someone with a tortured past being redeemed and loved instead of going psycho..I guess I love to believe in the miracle of real Love and the amazing power it has. I have read and listened to these books on Audible - at least 3 X each!  Powerful epic story!<br /><br />Thank you for these books, E.L. James
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I am blown away by what I just saw. Christopher Nolan concludes the trilogy with perfect thoroughness and yet makes you think at what you had just seen after you've left the theater. Nolan throws curve balls galore throughout this film, and I actually gasped in awe and excitement at a few particular moments that would be blasphemy if I told you.<br /><br />Taking place 8 years since the events in \\"The Dark Knight.\\" Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale)is a broken recluse, taken care of by maids and hobbling along on his cane, he has put the Batman behind. Until Bane arrives(Tom Hardy),with an army and as the current leader of \\"The League Of Shadows\\" to finish what Ra's Al Ghul(Liam Neeson)failed to do in \\"Batman Begins.\\"<br />Bane is a monstrous brute, a man born in the darkness and destined to burn Gotham to the ground, releasing all criminals from Blackgate Prison and trapping the city's police force underground. But where is Batman?<br />After an epic battle between Batman and Bane, Bruce ends up defeated and placed in the bowels of a Ukrainian underground prison, body broken, while Gotham citizens are unprotected by the anarchy and under the watch of Bane.<br /><br />Will Bruce \\"rise\\" one last time, and will \\"Catwoman\\"(Anne Hathoway)quit her clepto ways and help Batman? And who is this Lt.Blake(Joseph-Gordan Levitt)and why does he know Bruce so well?<br /><br />Solid performances from everyone, and surprisingly Tom Hardy himself, who played Bane. His face is never seen, but his eyes and menacing tone made me shiver. The new \\"Bat\\" toy is pretty damn sweet. Of course Anne looked stunning as Catwoman, but I wish she had more screen time.<br /><br />As always, Nolan doesn't just make superhero action movies, he makes films. Lots of emotion in this film, which even had, IMO, an \\"Inception\\" like ending, making you wonder, Is that? That's Not? Could it be?  And that is the splendor of a Nolan film. Easily the best superhero movie ever, which was \\"The Avengers\\" until now.<br />Nathan Cranes(Cillian Murphy) appearance as a judge of the citizens was a perfect addition to the insanity of the character and the situation. Very humorous and dark, it reminded me of Frank Millers Batman.<br /><br />And thank you Christopher Nolan and everyone involved in the making of the greatest hero trilogy of all time. This is the way Batman is done, DARK, AWESOME, and EPIC. No need EVER for a reboot.
034580404X|5.0|E.L. James offers wonderful insight throughout these three books to amazing characters, Christian and Ana.  Anyone who says this is just about sex just doesn't get it. Reading about serial killers doesn't make you one, any more than reading these books makes you kinky.  This is about the miracle of love and being redeemed.  Christian could be just another tragedy with all he has had to face in his very young years.  He was adopted, he was loved and still just rode the fringes....  Realizing these people do exist and deserve love - that's what it's all about.  Thank you thank you for all the Epilogues E.L. James, love all that detail and information - I couldn't put these books down. I look forward to more from this author!
B00499QUK2|5.0|The only thing better than this series is the fact that I didn't start watching it until there were three seasons. I got to spend an entire weekend watching all the episodes! This series is funny and smart. The actors' are perfect for their roles and the writing is out-of-this world. For a good rainy weekend in, rent this series!
0345803493|5.0|All people can dwell on is sex - these books are about soo much more than sex!  Yes, it's a major part of it but it is a major part of life!  Reading it doesn't make you kinky!  (Does reading Grisham make you a spy or a killer?) Out society is so compartmentalized, I never dreamt I'd be sympathetic to this type of character but he tears at my heart!  Christian and Ana have a special dynamic and all I can say to E.L. is thanks for the miracle of their love and the power that it carries.  Christian could have been a tragedy and instead, he has a chance in Ana that he clings to for dear life - and there are predictably bumps along the way, many but they seem to manage to get through each hurdle life throws at them.  And - I could read their emails all day!<br /><br />E.L. James is a genius!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it&iexcl;!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!&iexcl; it is one of my favorite apps kn my kindle.. I play it almost every day and that is non stop
0062213423|5.0|AAAAHHH!!!!??? I LOVVVE this book! I spent hours staring at all the pictures of the boys! Haha! Im almost positive that every directioner will find something that they already knew in this book. Most of the info in here is new to even me! The baby pics are super ADORABLE! <3 For all directioners out there, this is the book for you!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book has been my book club favorite so far. The story creates magic and imagery that take you away and allow you to delight with wonderment you haven't felt since you were a kid. A great escape!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am a regular teen who wants to read what my friends read. So I read fifty shades. I really enjoyed the beggining because it brings suspence, but as I read more and more i started getting really disapointed. I don't like he way the author put so much sex in the book. The writing is awful, and its not easy to understand. i would put it like this: the man  had a troubling past and  she would save him the right way.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thanks for the great read. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series! Wool Omnibus definitely deserves all of the 5 star reviews.
B0038LB4TE|5.0|This is another gripping read in the Jack Reacher series.  They have all been fantastic.  There is a bit of violence but it isn't intrusive or over the top and it is necessary to the story.  Jack goes to a lot of trouble to avoid violence but he doesn't run away when it comes at him.  The story lines in Lee Childs' books are fantastic and each one is so different to the last except for the ongoing family connections and memories.  I really love reading these books and the intricacies will keep you enthralled.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game; very fun and easy to use. would recomend it to anyone. everything runs smoothly and fast
B0072OFM28|5.0|I ordered this season before it even finished airing on tv, so needless to say I have not received it yet. This is by far my favorite season! There is  a lot of action and totally unexpected events! Just wait until the last episode!
B005LAII1C|4.0|This movie was great. I love these comedies and I do get the humor it has.<br /><br />You got to really get the kind of cruel and stupid humor to really enjoy the movie, if you don't than you will hate it from start to finish. The humor they use mainly involves drugs, sex, or alcohol use. If you like family guy, it's like that but much more! If you don't like that stuff, please don't watch it as you would be wasting your time.<br /><br />I also loved Mark Wahlberg performance, he did a great job working with a pretend bear on screen. He really pulled it off with his acting skills. Mila Kunis was good, but she didn't really do much as all she was there was for mostly eye candy for the audience.<br /><br />The story itself is very simple and that's good as they didn't need to make it complex in any way. They just wanted to make a great comedy out of this.<br /><br />Watch it if you like what I said above. Don't watch it, if you don't like what I said above. lol
B007SYWFRM|5.0|easy to use entertaining. and an all around fun game. delightful my 5yr old is enjoying playing the game fun for all ages
0307891372|5.0|This is truely a very helpful guide for playing Skyrim. The fold out map alone is a huge bonus to helping find those side quest, out of the way spots.<br /><br />Do you have a question about the cave you just cleared? Want to be sure you cleaned out all the loot? A quick check in the guide and you'll know. I use it alot for this. After I work my way thru a place, I go back to the guide and see if I missed anything. Sometimes finding that a good item was overlooked.<br /><br />It's also very helpful in learning about things such as followers you can get to help you. Knowing what their primary skills are better helps you equip them to be most effective for helping you. Many other extras are contained in it as well that can greatly expand your abilities and improve your game. Much of the information in the guide is not readily known from just playing the game, so it is in fact a super help in getting the most out of what is available for you to do in the game.
B002VHI8HC|5.0|I strongly recommend reading Dexter. Hooked from start to finish. I personally recommend this book to those who like a story of good and bad character at a time.<br /><br />See you ,<br />Toni
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome my highest score I 5 million something I recommend this and temple run brave best game ever in history
B006VFQGFQ|4.0|If not for some minor flaws, I would've given this film bio five stars but nevertheless it's an impressive production by Eastwood and boasts one of DiCaprio's most impressive performance(a pity he didn't get an Oscar nomination for this one) and fine supporting turns from Judi Dench as Hoover's domineering mother, Arme Hammer as Clyde Tolson and Naomi Watts as his long suffering secretary.  I thought I would be bored by the length but I wasn't and Eastwood's direction hooked me in.  The only flaws in this film are the horrible makeup job on Hammer's aging Tolson and the actor playing Nixon---he doesn't even come close to looking like \\"tricky Dick\\" (couldn't they have used Philip Baker Hall for the disgraced President?).  But outside of these flaws, this is still a worthwhile film into the complex life of \\"J. Edgar\\".
0345803485|1.0|I do not understand what all the positive buzz was about this book. I had to stop reading it halfway through because it was giving me nightmares. I found the story upsetting, disturbing, and sickening. The only redeeming quality about the book is it makes a decent paperweight.
B003NTSBUG|2.0|First the good: Excellent production values. Very artistic.<br />Now the bad: Pretentious and stilted. Music is almost comical - it's so over the top awful.<br />Conclusion: Don't waste your time.
B008A1NSTG|4.0|A really beautiful movie.  I love movies about animals. It was sad once and turned about to be a happy ending and I love this.
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Fiona has delivered an amazing album with non-traditional arrangements and unbelievable hooks that will catch you and stay with you. Could anyone else deliver a song where the word \\"brain\\" is stretched out to create a sing-along chorus?<br /><br />She plays around with unique and different sounds that work for the most part - sometimes not as much. Either way, it leaves you with an opportunity to listen multiple times and catch different nuances.<br /><br />As you would expect with a Fiona Apple album, the lyrics are oftentimes poetry containing neat-fitting sounds and rhymes clashing together in a pleasing way. The word phrasing is a little more obscure in parts than previous albums but the emotional tenor of her voice conveys the feelings fairly clearly throughout the album.<br /><br />Of course, in some songs, the words and emotions are extremely clear.<br /><br />Regret: \\"I've run out of white dove feathers to soak up the hot p-ss that comes from your mouth when you address me.<br />Left Alone: \\"How can I ask anyone to love me when all I do is beg to be left alone?\\"<br />Valentine: \\"While you were watching someone else, I stared at you and cut myself.\\"<br /><br />Awesome album with an awesome coda in \\"Hot Knife\\" which was a real stand out upon the first few listens. It fades in its standing next to the other songs upon multiple listens. This may have more to do with the complexities of the other songs than with \\"Hot Knife\\". Regardless, this unique duet reflects an amazing testament to Fiona's vision as a songwriter and artist.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and spring for the $10 and buy this album.
B0036X09LS|4.0|Neil takes the lead on this case, and the FBI is less involved than they usually are.<br /><br />I thought this was one of the funnier episodes so far.
B003YOXIVW|3.0|This is the album where the dam burst open and Gabriel became a bona fide, arena level superstar.  Prior to the release of \\"So\\" Gabriel had a solid loyal cult following of old Genesis heads and fans of his more sparse solo materiel.  \\"So\\" burst on the scene with the smash single \\"Sledgehammer\\" and Gabriel's career was off to the races.  A lot of people love this album and think it is the high point of Gabriel's career.  For me it is the continuation of a downhill slide that would culminate in his next disappointing release \\"Us\\" a few years later.  \\"So\\" is not a bad album, but I don't think it is a great album either.  Gabriel's timing just happened to be perfect as he exploited the use of the music video to promote the singles son this disc.  Gabriel was a true pioneer in this regard, and his videos for \\"Sledgehammer\\", \\"Big Time\\", and \\"Don't Give Up\\" were truly groundbreaking for their time.  It is just too bad that the actual songs were not as good as the videos were.  Ok, maybe I am being too harsh as these songs are all ok, but compared to the deeper more thought provoking material of his earlier career much of this could be seen as fluff.  The album does contain some great tracks however including the opener \\"Red Rain\\", the brooding \\"Mercy Street\\" and the closing love song \\"In Your Eyes\\" which will forever be associated with the famous scene from the movie \\"Say Anything\\".  \\"So\\" is far from Peter Gabriel's best work, but it is not his worst either.  I would rate it around 3.5 stars as I find it a rather mixed bag.
B007FU1OH6|4.0|I love all the books in this series and reading this final book made me want to go back to read the other 2 now I have more information, detail and history on the background of the characters from the other 2 books.<br />Carlos Ruiz Zafron's style is fabulous - humour, fast flow yet nothing is rushed. Each chapter is to be enjoyed. I can't highly recommend his books enough.
B0000009S3|5.0|I came a bit late to the Zappa party, never really appreciating him while he was alive.  I have been recently discovering some of his catalogue and just picked this one up.  \\"Hot Rats\\" is generally considered to be a classic in the jazz / rock genre, and I would have to agree.  This album is outstanding from beginning to end, and really shows off just how accomplished a guitarist Zappa was.  5 out of the 6 tracks on the disc are instrumental including the jamming \\"Gumbo Variations\\" that clocks in at over 16 minutes.  The only vocal track on the album \\"Willie The Pimp\\" is sung by non other than Captain Beefheart who does a great job with it.  The short instrumental \\"Peaches In Regalia\\" was a minor hit from the album and \\"Son Of Mr. Green Jeans\\" is also a highlight.  I have seen several comments regarding the re-master and changes that were made to the mix.  I never had the original album, so cannot really comment on that, but what is here sounds very good to my ears.  One thing I am finding in my exploration of Mr. Zappa is that his albums are all over the place and can be very different from each other.  If you like the rock / fusion / jazz side of Frank, you should love this one.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book and couldn't spare a moment to savour it as I was too intrigued to find out what happened and what was going to happen next. Loved the style of writing, could picture the characters and the scenery. What a great read.
B000002KE2|5.0|yo yo yo. volume 4 is bad to the bone. i dig every song off the album. black sabbath=heavy metal. even today, they sound heavier then 98% of whats out there. it just prooves you dont need gutteral vocals,scream every 2 seconds, have blast beats,double bass, and the lowest or fastest guitars in every damn song. all you new guys in bands should take note. i like the first 6 albums with ozzy all the same. i cant pick out a favorite one..buttttttt, if i was forced to choose though, it would be either this one or master of reality or sabbath bloody sabbath, or sabatoge. no the first one. see what i mean. haha. i cant pick. one of my favorite bands, right up there with pantera,black flag,meshuggah,clutch,tool,and the doors.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app everyday. and I must say...its pretty darn accurate. comes in handy when we put the top down on the jeep. I also like the radar and the daily n hourly updates.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|\\"living things\\" is a great record. the last 3 releases by linkin park are my favorite ones.very glad that rick rubin came into their lives and the band themselves realized that nu-metal is a trend and a thing of the past. im sure the people who were soo into the first two records will be dissapointed. well guys, sorry to say but the newer stuff blows the older stuff away musically. the first two were dope records but you got to realize bands evolve in order to stay fresh and keep things interesting. i couldnt listen to them anymore if they put out 5 records of the same style as the first two. linkin park and incubus are the only two nu metal bands that really evolved and thats why they are still relavent to this day. if you are still hung up and stuck on the first two records and cant understand what happened to linkin park then dont buy this record. go listen to limp bizkit and papa roach or somethin. buttt if you dig the new style and understand good music with texture and layers then pick this disk up.later
B008N1V11U|3.0|This game is beautiful. Graphically it's just amazing but the space needed for it on the kindle is just absurd. Your gonna need to be deleting all other apps just to run this game. Which isn't ok with me. They either need to expand memory with the cloud for apps or just stop making such HUGE games.
B000002HJR|5.0|i bought this cd when i was 12 cause i was and still am a huge pantera fan(favorite band). at 12 years old i liked it but it didnt have that groove of pantera. but now at 23, i fully understand it.  and now days out of over 600 cds, down is one of the most played bands in rotation. every song is damn amazing. down 2 and down 3 are equally amazing in their own right. there is just something about the man phil anselmo and his vocals. when i think of heavy metal i think of phil anselmo. if you love black sabbath, pantera, or just metal in general i would highly suggest you pick this monster of an album up, along with their other 2. if you dont dig down then you really dont like metal.later
1400096936|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book since I never read this author before. I was sucked in, chewed up and spit out. The relationships between the countries in the so called war on drugs, the characters, the great personalities and real dialogue is superb. I started and didn't put it down. I'm reading Savages next.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|Perfect example of what pusses gang members are. They cant take on anybody one on one. It has to be five on one. And they have to have a weapon. A really good caring movie. How he knew he was dying so he gave his life to get revenge for the girl. Best Eastwood movie since Unforgiven.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books of this series alright; they were light reads typical of the YA genre, and while they weren't masterpieces, they were fun. Mockingjay, however, has earned my unmitigated exasperation. I didn't like anything about the book. Unlike the first two, this was a chore to read. I had to force myself through this book.<br /><br />I hated Katniss the whole time. I understand that she was traumatized, but it felt incredibly contrived. She kept getting knocked out, and when she would wake up, people would tell her about important advancements in the story that happened while she was unconscious. That's lazy writing. Even when Katniss is conscious for important events, her thoughts aren't very lucid. After the way Katniss acted in this book, I don't want to hear anyone describe her as brave or strong again. She actually spends a good amount of the book hiding, and she doesn't face her problems. When she does finally pull it together to go on the battlefield, it's to hurry up and end the story.<br /><br />I also didn't like how anyone died in the book. They would be killed off in a sentence, and I couldn't bring myself to feel any sympathy for them. It wasn't a numb feeling from shock; I just couldn't have cared less.<br /><br />Overall, this book isn't very good. I am so tired of people praising it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Do not trust this product to protect your iphone underwater like it claims it can. I used it once underwater and then second time, it leaked like crazy, completely shorting out my phone and requiring me to buy a new one. Water resistant, maybe, waterPROOF, it is not.
B007G92QGO|4.0|I could not put this book down; it was such a gripping story.  It had a dark edge to it, that was sustained throughout.  It is nightmare stuff for a parent, but raises the awareness levels of what parents go through when they suspect, or refuse to suspect, that their child is a killer.  It brings disbelief, awareness, horror and responsibility felt by parents in the circumstances.  Also felt by the reader as the story progresses.  This was the first book that I had read by this author; will be reading more.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|I like the game, it's different and fun to play. It gets three stars because it has way too many add permissions that are used to collect your information and track you.
B00785P2QC|4.0|kind of a boring game to m e if you like keeping track of your city this is the game for you
0345803485|1.0|So poorly written that made me sick and sad to think that so many people fall for this piece of crap. After page 50 I started to feel that my brain was shrinking so I literally threw the book to the wall, but not with enough force to destroy it, just to punish it as it deserved, something the main character would be proud about. That felt really good. Hope the library doesn't mind. My recovery mode included some of the best classic reading, starting with D.H. Lawrence, so I think my brain cells are back to normal now. Unfortunately there are not sub-zero stars to rate this one, but a -10 would sound appropriate.
0099579936|1.0|Let me start out by saying that I am no prude.  This book was so ridiculous and repetitive.  Predictable and without a plot Fifty Shades of Grey reads like a Harlequin romance.  All that's missing is Fabio on the cover.  Don't waste your time (unless you are into smut).
1451683405|3.0|I wanted to be convinced by the book, actually to explore the claims of \\"non-doership\\" in religious traditions such as Advaita Vedanta.  But I was left dissatisfied.  The experiments showing EEG registry before actual conscious awareness is more suggestive about something to wonder about.  But by itself, even at this level, it doesn't totally kill some version of the notion of \\"free will\\", though not in terms of micro behavior or singular behavior, but a whole series of behaviors in as in the description of \\"choices leads to habits, habits to character\\", in other words, an *emergent property* of what seems to be a self reflexive dynamic system that lends credence to the notion about responsibility and possibly \\"karma\\".<br /><br />On the level of philosophical argumentation, the main reason I'm not convinced by the book is that it's not clear to me what \\"free will\\" actually is, what it would mean independent of any condition, in the abstract. Such a notion would seem foreign to human life in the concrete. On the other hand, \\"cause and effect\\", or \\"chance\\" as an explanatory framework seems a priori not to leave any room \\"free will\\". If your explanatory framework is mechanical, then the conclusions cannot be otherwise than mechanical.<br /><br />We are then left with the notion of free will as a some vague social \\"useful fiction\\", something that one should not look too closely at, but we all have an intuitive sense of \\"roughly\\" what it means, even though we can't place our finger on exactly what it is.  This is the \\"man on the street\\", \\"common sense\\" meaning that may be useful in courts and child rearing.  But this is a different level discussion than than the level of mechanism.<br /><br />We don't oftentimes confuse discussions on art and literature with discussions on physics.  The frameworks for discourse for these disciplines are very different. It would be a travesty to explain a Beethoven symphony as simply vibrating sound waves at different frequencies. This also begs the question what is \\"real\\".  I suggest the same separation should be made for \\"free will\\".  This is not to deny that there will be \\"hard cases\\", places where both disciplines meet (e.g. brain tumor and changes in personality and behavior).  This reflects the inadequacy of our frameworks which are imperfect grasps at reality.  As the saying goes, \\"the map is not the territory\\".  But we can clear up some (not all) confusion by looking at \\"levels of discourse\\".<br /><br />A possible framework to begin to bridge the gaps between explanatory frameworks may be some form of \\"systems theory\\" with it's notion of \\"emergent properties\\".  As scientific understanding of biological \\"life\\" expands in the 21st century,  and if computing power continue to follow an exponential curve predicted by Ray Kurzweil,  the rise of self reflective artificial intelligence,  a possible understanding of  what can be termed \\"free will\\", even if as an epiphenomenon, may be possible.  These are possible glimpses of how the conversation can move forward in a scientific way.  We may live in interesting times on this question.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Reads like a REALLY BAD version of an erotic adult Twilight novel, except Twilight was good and Fifty Shades of Grey is terrible. Poorly written and very repetitive.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific is a documentary style mini-series that captures the essence of the epic struggle of the island fighting campaign during WWII.  Tom Hanks and Stephen Spielberg are to be complemented on bringing this story to life and doing it in such a way that the viewer can better understand just how horrific that struggle was.  As the story unfolds and we follow the lives of the characters as they face unimaginable situations, we the viewers are confronted with our own fears and are forced to ask...how would I have reacted under the same situations?  HBO has done an outstanding job in capturing these kinds of stories.  The mini series format is the only way to provide the kind of depth and character development this large of a story requires.  The Pacific is truly an epic not only in the telling of the Pacific war, but in bringing to life the characters who lived it.  Most other movies and even documentaries tend to dwell on the strategic efforts of the war.  This series tells the story of the individual GI...Marine...Sailor...the men who had to fight it...the men who had to die for it. It's their story placed within the context of actual events...times...and places. The historical accuracy is pretty good, even so...as a movie series, certain generalizations had to be made for story continuity and brevity.  I loved the way at the end how we were told how the lives of the characters continued on after the war...but what most impressed me about this series was how much better now can I visualize what my dad went through during his adventures on Okinawa.  Although I've always had great respect for our WWII veterans...that respect was elevated to a higher platform because of this series.

B005J3IEZQ|3.0|The main thing that stuck with me from reading this book, was how different my perception was of Steve Jobs from reality. I had little knowledge of who Steve Jobs really was and his role as a businessman, so was really surprised to hear about his abrupt personality and sometimes bizarre personal hygiene.<br /><br />I admire him for allowing a biography so honest and forthcoming about all his achievements and short-comings - both in his view and of others. This biography was really well-rounded thanks to so many interviews with people he came in contact throughout his life, both good and bad, and you got the feeling that nothing was held back, but surprisingly little was given from Steve's wife, especially with regard to their marriage, so it would be really interesting to hear how she coped being married to him for 20-something years.<br /><br />Another thing I found really interesting was the role he played in both Apple and Pixar. After reading the book I realise he was a really great business executive, rather than an engineer, and he was able to make great imaginative leaps while valuing the end-to-end process of a product, and this is what sets Apple apart from its competitors. You really do need to admire his ability to evolve and advance technology, and in the book he often says that \\"people don't know what they want until I show them\\".<br /><br />I found the second part of the book more engaging as I was more familiar with the products and company. Steve seemed to be portrayed more harshly in the first half of the book.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of technology or Steve Jobs, but it is not an easy biography to read if you are not a tech-head, and I found myself skim reading some paragraphs due to this. I'm glad I read it its but probably not one I would ever read again.

B006O6FK2W|3.0|The design of this aircraft was awesome in the movie and should have lended itself well as a toy. The contstruction of the body seems durable enough to last. Two immediate complaints after having it for only couple of hours however leave me and my son disappointed. First, the canopy sometimes locks into place and sometimes does not. Second, the missles that fire out do not always lock into place. So when you recover a missle and put it back in it can unexpectedly shoot out again often in a direction you do not intend. If we got this for free or for cheap at a garage sale, I would be very happy with this toy. The fact that my son spent 32 of his hard-earned dollars on this hurts. To be fair, he has just simply resolved to not using the missles and continues to fly the Bat around the house.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Fun easy game. You do not need to \\"share \\" when you complete a goal. There is a small x in the upper right hand corner. Just close the box and move on.

I 'm just learning to navigate all the little features in this app but for the most part, quite simple to use and the features are very helpful when making notes or highlighting scripture plus the different highlight colors make it easy to seperate your notes or points of interest. Love it and it 's all right there for ease and convienence. Love it. Thanks amazon for making this and bringing me closer to God every time I use it.

0385360169|2.0|I have to admit that I got the trilogy based solely on the hype floating around about this new \\"erotic\\" novel. And I chose the audio book format because I like to \\"read\\" books while crocheting, eating, exercising, etc. and my hands are otherwise occupied. Audio books can suffer from a bad reader, which I have had before, but my bad review is not because of the reader in this case. In fact, she is perfect for the character of Ana, though her trying to lower her voice for male dialog or doing accents such as Jose's leave a lot to be desired. But the almost Valley Girl sound to her voice goes well with all of the author's \\"Jeeze\\" and \\"Holy Crap\\" comments that pepper this sophomoric novel delving into the Dom/Sub lifestyle scene.<br /><br />Since all the buzz I had heard about these books had been about them being \\"erotic fiction\\", I'm not really certain what audience this was written for. All of the characters are adults, past legal drinking age, yet the main female, Ana, is a virgin, had never experienced an orgasm, never gotten drunk, and talks and dresses like a 16 yr. old tomboy. Was this meant for Young Adult? But then immediately, the first man she ever gets sexual feelings for is an enigmatic billionaire control freak that wants to make her his submissive. For those familiar with BDSM, either through real life or previous fiction, this will be a disappointment. Almost from the start, billionaire Christian Grey breaks all his \\"rules\\" and sleeps in the same bed with her, has \\"vanilla sex\\" and likes it, and concedes that Ana makes good points against the contract that he has written up to outline the roles he wants them to take. Oh, and he was a submissive from age 15 to 21 also to a friend of his mother's which leads Ana to suspect has damaged Mr. Grey and made him the bipolar control freak that he is. (And what is it with him and food? she says REPEATEDLY, and makes that rule a deal-breaker). Also Christian hunts her down, shows his dismay when she doesn't fall in line immediately with his proposal, feels guilty for showing a virgin his \\"red room of pain\\" (as Ana calls it), and despite holding her to the confidentiality clause talks to his lawyer, former mistress, and even his driver/right-hand man who seems to know the score. So if this is written for people enamored of the BDSM scene, it will  probably fall short (I'm only half-way through the first book and not sure I can force my way through the rest) and you should stick to classics like \\"The Story of O\\", and movies like \\"The Secretary\\" with James Spader or \\"9 and 1/2 Weeks\\" with Micky Rourke, to name a few.<br /><br />I won't go into the writing as much as some of the other reviewers did, except to say that it is just as annoying to hear it on audio as it is to read it, and a lot harder to skip over when listening to it. And I certainly can't imagine how it's going to be drawn out into THREE books, as it would only take a pamphlet for me to tell the creep to get lost. But the signs are there that Ana will want to \\"save\\" Christian. And Ana's bossy room-mate Kate will at some point try to come to the rescue. And if Ana and Christian are smart and mature, they will find that that lifestyle can make for exciting role-playing occasionally in the bedroom but abusive and stifling as a way of life and come to a compromise. But I don't think I'm enough of a masochist to subject myself to the rest of book 1 let alone all three, so I guess I'll never know.n line immediately with his proposal, feels guilty for showing a virgin his \\"red room of pain\\" (as Ana calls it), and despite holding her to the confidentiality clause talks to his lawyer, former mistress, and even his driver/right-hand man who seems to know the score.

B000XZ3YH8|1.0|I bought this for my three year old niece as an introductory guitar to start getting her familiar with it and see if it even interested her. This is about the cutest guitar I've ever seen. It is sturdy enough for a young child to use and the extra small size makes it really nice for small hands. The frets are much too small for my average sized adult hands, but that is fine because I wanted it to fit hers.<br /><br />Unfortunately it has no value as an actual instrument. If your child just wants to strum some strings to make random noise then they will probably be happy. But as a guitar player myself, the first thing I tried to do was tune this and have it at least sound somewhat decent. Sadly, it simply cannot be tuned. The tuning pegs function in turning but as soon as you find the note you want and let go of the peg it unwinds itself enough that it is way out of key. I could not even get close to a tolerable tuning to play a single simple song that anyone would recognize. The strings are also strange, they have the appearance of bronze but when I tried to tune one up to a higher note it snapped easier than a nylon string. I was able to sort of repair it since the rest of the instrument doesn't actually function so no one will notice but all in all, for such a cute looking instrument it was a big disappointment.<br /><br />If you want a sturdy and cute toy just for fun then this is inexpensive and cute enough and to please any little girl but if you want a guitar with any real musical value, this is not it.<br /><br />**update**<br />Just broke a second string and they are unique to this guitar so I cannot simply replace the string like a normal one. It's headed for the trash, I am afraid.
8866131369|5.0|Moleskine definitely met my expectations. I never knew what the rage was about for this brand, but I absolutely love it. The paper's so nice, and everything writes on clean, and the planner's layout is great! I bought this black one and the red one, but I noticed that the red one's layout is different. Where this black one has horizontal blank week on one page with lined page on the other, and my sister's red one has columns with lines of the week. I personally like the black one's layout, but my sister likes the other, so it worked out perfectly.
B007MJSSCY|5.0|This is one of those films both children and adults would love.  It is very sweet.  There are a few harsh, short moments, so parents should watch it first to decide.  Lovely.
B007BZM3HK|4.0|This song is nice to listen to while it's still popular, but I'm fairly sure that I'll eventually tire of it and move on. It's a fun, upbeat song that for some reason has attracted the attention of friends and thousands of others, including me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is nothing about this book that seems rehashed. Every part of the story is new and inventive. The plot moves in unexpected  and intriguing ways. The character development is first class. The pacing, at least through the first 4 sections, is brisk and taut. I can not recommend this book more highly.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I had so much fun playing! Can't wait for more levels! I hope everyone else has as much fun playing as I did.

B003274QH6|5.0|It's fantastic. If you're intimidated by it's subject matter...you should be. I have never EVER loved a television show in my entire life. This show is just SO well made. It has some amazing acting. I recommend it to anyone and you can watch it or not watch it and miss out on one of the most badass stories in entertainment history. 5 Stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|an excellent novel- good storyline even though you question as such in the beginning. couldn't wait to read second in trilogy
B006VFLIYK|2.0|I have read several of Baldacci's books and loved them.  Not this one.  I really had to suspend my disbelief to follow the plot.  Lots of adventure and no real logic.  Very, very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this one.

B0052RE4MQ|4.0|The thing about this series is that it has a great story within, but the books are just slow paced. Slow paced to the point of where you tend to get bored. But if you overlook the slowness, the story itself is amazing!<br />Crossed is way more slow paced than Matched. But like I said before, if you overlook the slow paced way of the book you will find the wonderful story that lies within. The characters that we already know and loved in Matched are all the same. Xander, Cassia, and Ky are still going. They face many struggles, but have so much determination that they face everything head on. There were tons of emotions running through this book. And I really love that we see so much more of Ky! Yes, team Ky all the freaking way :D<br /><br />Also in this book, we are introduced to some new characters who make the story all the more interesting. I still don't know how I feel about Indie. She's too secretive. But I have this hope with her stealing Cassia's microchip that something there develops between her and a certain someone. But maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part. Eli and Vick were also some amazing characters and I was glad so meet them.<br /><br />This story had a new purpose to and there were MANY shocking secrets reveal that left my mind boggled! I have some questions answered, but now there's a whole new set of them that needs to be answered. The whole thing with the Rising, how will things turn out?!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this sequel (besides the slowness) and if you liked Matched, I hope you give Crossed a try and pick it up! I can't wait to see how this series concludes in the final book, Reached :D
0783225482|3.0|A black comedy that is not really entertaining. . .<br /><br />The special effects are very good--e.g., a woman with a huge gunshot opening through her stomach. Other than that, I find the movie grotesque without being really entertaining.
0446613444|4.0|This is my second Harry Bosch novel and I have to say, I'm really starting to like the guy! I don't like giving away plots with crime novels, but know that the story moves along very quickly and there are plenty of twists and turns. Much of the action takes place in parts of the U.S. and Mexico that I am unfamiliar with, so I was pulling up a map quite a few times, which turned out to be more than a little fun!<br /><br />I'm glad to have followed a suggestion to read the Harry Bosch series in order, as there were references to events in The Black Echo. By no means does the reader need to have read The Black Echo first, it was just neat to be \\"in the know\\" on a few things.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very enjoyable read. It seems Michael Connelly will never fail to entertain me, and I cannot wait to start reading The Concrete Blonde.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the series as did all of my girlfriends. Was it real, no, was it the best writing in a book I have ever read, no....BUT the character development, interactions and plot was very intriguing and kept me wanting more and more. I have read the series twice and will likely read again. As with any book I read I realize that it is not real...and meant for enjoyment...and I thoroughly enjoyed them...Were there parts that had me cringing yes, but it they were all worth it...I hope the author writes the series from Christian's point of view...
B000JQUZCI|5.0|The classic original story by the original author. Read the book that inspired so many other writers and film makers. It still holds the attention even after all these years.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I liked this book...good girl likes bad boy, but maybe good girl isn't so good after all. I appreciated that it was an easy read and the author didn't dwell too much on unimportant parts of the plot and scenes. I enjoyed the character developments and interactions. Well done. I would (and have) recommended this to friends and am looking for other similar books to read.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I agree with other reviewers - some of the photos and letters in the book were very hard to read/see on the kindle. This is why I am giving 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Otherwise, I truly enjoyed this book. A great story and I want to learn more about how Jacob and the kids get along in their battle for peculiar children! The reading style was great for me and the characters so fun.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book opens with our heroine off travelling the world, spending much time in the Caribbean, taking on a lover and protecting a woman from an abusive husband and his murder plot.  When she gets back home she becomes involved in a human traffiking case as well as being hunted down by goons hired by her 'guardian' and rapist.  Mikhail is making lots of money, publishing a book about human traffiking and trying (in vain) to get in touch with Salander. When Salander is accused of murder, Mikhail and Salendars old boss at Milton Security try to find out the truth.<br /><br />This is a must read book and I can't wait until they make a movie about it. It's gonna rock.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book two of the fifty shades trilogy was my favorite of the three books, yes the trilogy was somewhat sophomoric, and a lot repetitious but i found them to be entertaining and held my interest.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|It's been a while since I've seen Caviezel in a film production since Passion of the Christ. James Caviezel and Sophia Myles play excellent roles.<br /><br />The idea behind Outlander is basically man of the future crashes among Vikings and join them in the fight to kill an alien (dragon). This idea had the potential to be a really cheezy film. Thankfully, the script writing is good, the supporting characters are interesting, and the music is good.<br /><br />On a side note the Cinematographer took some experimental shots by using unique lenses in the final action scenes. Sets are interesting and believable.<br /><br />This is a great action movie--if you're into sci-fi or anything with a hint of history. If you like \\"Cowboys vs. Aliens\\" you'll like this film.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addictive game. Can't put it down. It would be awesome if amazon could get more games like this because these types of games are what the people want.
0345803485|2.0|I don't even know where to start. There are too many problems to list, but the other reviewers do it well. Very repetitive, silly vocabulary, OBVIOUS Twilight ripoff. All of the characters are so one dimensional, really Christian? A self made 27 year old BILLIONAIRE?? Do yourself a favor, SKIP IT!

B000O8OTNC|1.0|I don't see how this received so many good reviews!  I'd like to see EVERY reviewer describe the item and blade thickness in their reviews for reference. I've seen some reviews for sharpening scissors, which is different.  I tried the fine v notch on a Leatherman multi-tool and it did NOT improve it's sharpness, but made it more dull because it cut too much into the blade. A sharpening stone works MUCH better, but you need a round file for serrated edges.  Cons: The diamond coating on the rod does not last very long. The rod mount is wimpy and easily breaks. The carbide v notch is ONLY for repairing thicker/heavily damaged blades!  The angle of the blade edge determines sharpness and longevity. The sharper you want it, the more often you will have to sharpen it. Obviously steel quality affects durability as well.  Compare blade thickness, sharpness and angle to an axe and a razor blade. Axes are more durable, but not 'razor' sharp. Razors are very sharp, not durable. They are the smallest degree angle possible.  Failed on my paper/arm hair test after using this! This sharpener just doesn't 'CUT' it! I went back to sharpening stones; so much easier.  For in depth information on blades and sharpening, look up Straight Razor on Wikipedia/other.

0345535421|4.0|I must say, I enjoyed this one even more than the first.  I had mixed feelings about that one.  A Clash of Kings is the second book in Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series.  As it is the second you have no hopes of understanding it unless you've read the first.  And I can't even begin to summarize the first for you as there is so much detail, characters, etc. packed into each of these novels.  So, if you haven't read it, you need to go start there.<br /><br />For those who have read the first book, Clash of Kings starts where that one left off and takes up the storylines of all the characters.  Sansa and Arya each have their struggles renewed while Sansa remains a prisoner of the young King and Arya joins a band of people headed to take up the Black of the Night's watch.  Daenerys has her dragons, and now seeks to take back the kingdom that was her families, but is having trouble finding the help to do so.  Four kings all try to rule the seven kingdoms, Joffrey the young King, Stannis and Renly, brothers of the slain King, and Robb of Winterfell in the North, who was proclaimed by his own men.  They all have reasons for wanting the throne and must look to their backs as there are traitors everywhere.  The Game of Thrones is still played, and played more deviously by some more than others.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters in this book.  So much so that it's hard to keep track of them all the time.  My favorites by far are Tyrion and Daenerys.  Tyrion is just so cunning and amusing and you're never sure of his motives so he stays interesting.  And I root for Daenerys to get her kingdom back.  The other kings aren't doing a very good job of it and I think she could be much better.  Plus she has dragons, which quite frankly is awesome.  I'm not a big fan of Joffrey, the Queen or Sansa, but I don't think I'm supposed to really like any of them, except for Sansa anyway.  The others I don't really care either way, which is probably a good thing with the high mortality rate in all of Martins books.  It isn't a good thing to become too attached to a character.<br /><br />The plot was almost kind of filler in this book.  Yes, things happened, battles were fought, but it didn't seem like the book ended any plotlines.  There was just more stories found and different adventures started and always more and more intrigues.  It is hard to follow sometimes.  It did make me look forward to the next book though, I have to see what happens and who wins, etc.  It should be warned that this book doesn't hold back on violence, sex, murders, language, etc.  It's all there and not for the reader who doesn't enjoy these things. (Or rather not enjoy but tolerate).  But it serves it's purpose, the book is gritty and realistic because of these things.<br /><br />A good continuation of the series.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The book is hard to read because the writing is so poor.  The dialogue is trite and the author's use of words makes it sound like she had a thesaurus handy at all times, but not in a good way.  Definitely not recommended!

B004YOEFG8|1.0|I wanted to love this video. The stunning clarity of the visuals are incredible. The shots taken from the Hubble are completely mind blowing. But, please, 3/4 of the film is about the astronauts and their telescope repair. Ok - 1/4 could have been about that, but where were the additional extraordinary images from the Hubble - isn't that what we are paying to see?  Big, big mistake! Could have been a phenomenal DVD, instead of OK

B000002UVX|5.0|Stunning album, every song is more than gem! I'm not going into a deep review, I was just saddened to see some folks who put down Buddy Miles playing? Are you kidding? The power & force of his drumming is incredible! He beat the living sh**t out of that kit, my arms get tired even thinking about all the energy and force he put in to those drums. During Machine Gun, he sounded like a bazooka, and Buddy is a also soulful terrific singer as well! He could sang! I will admit that sometimes he try to add too much singing into some of the BOG's other gigs, but not on this particular record.<br />As far as Hendrix's playing, it just dumb founding and other worldly. No other guitarist has ever touched me the way he has! Technically, this is one of his greatest pieces of guitar work, especially when you consider it was live on the spot, it's an unbelivable record, and ALL of the performers (Jimi/Buddy/Billy) were totally on point as far as I'm concerned! Jimi Hendrix IS the best rock guitarist of all time! There isn't any single guitarist (past or present) as significant or important as JMH, I don't think there ever could be! Thanks for reading!
0393338827|2.0|I picked up this book because I wanted to read something new and different, and I could check it out for free with Amazon Prime.  I didn't know anything about the world of finance, but from the rave reviews about the author's wit and writing ability, I thought I might learn something and be amused at the same time--a great combination!  I did learn something, which is why I gave the book two stars instead of one, but the book failed to amuse.<br /><br />As an author, I believe that people who write books ought to have enough vocabulary to communicate their point without profanity. This book disappointed me on that score.  I also needed better explanations for words and phrases commonly used in the finance world that lack meaning to the rest of society.  As a storyteller, I found the narrative repetitive, lacking in cohesion, and without good structure.  The author introduces several characters and gives descriptions and personal information about their lives and their participation with Wall Street, but he repeated himself to the point that sometimes I felt like I'd read the same paragraph or page in an earlier section.  He finally began to weave the narratives together and build tension, and the book gained interest.  Then he brought the flow of the book to a screeching halt by going back to introduce yet another character: one Howie Hubler, who \\"grew up in New Jersey and payed football at Montclair State College.\\"  Honestly, I didn't care, and I didn't want to have to wade through yet another rendition of the greed and avarice of Wall Street before the crash.  I skimmed the next chapter and decided that the remaining 20% of the book wasn't worth my time.<br /><br />I appreciate the reviewers who recommended other books on the subject.  That was considerate and helpful.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I love 'slice of life' movies.If you want a beautifully executed movie heavy on character, light on distracting special effects, Hollywood glam, then this is the movie for you. Simply shot, the characters are complex and hauntingly identifiable. Beautiful movie...
B007STXHTM|5.0|This housing is more valuable underwater than you can imagine! The pictures are wonderful at depth! It's just as simple as the original housing, closes securely, works great with a red filter. The only thing I haven't figured out is where and how to get the from part of the housing open to place the filter inside, but rubber bands and duct tape have worked so far, even in strong current, so......it's actually probably better the way I have it so it is easily removed when in shallow areas. Otherwise, it's perfect for anyone that wants to take pictures under water in any conditions. Very convenient, but you still have to get pretty close to small fish, because there is no zoom. Still worth it!
B000HAB4KS|5.0|I picked up The Matrix this past weekend (July 21, 2012) for my Kindle Fire.  I already have the Blu-ray and have watched this great sci-fi action classic many, many times.  But now I have access to The Matrix anytime (thanks to Wi-fi).  I watched this movie yesterday and it looked and played great on my Kindle Fire.  I added an app (Volume+) to boast the sound in the Fire speakers and put it to the test with all the action in The Matrix.  I could have converted a DVD to play on my Fire, but I picked up this movie for only $3.99.  When I do not intend to watch it I just leave it on the Cloud.  I might take this movie with me next year on a cruise.  5 Stars for being a thrilling movie and looking/sounding good on my Fire.
B007XNAPNY|5.0|Keep it simple!Top notch Blu-ray,from DD of course!Watched it over the weekend over and over.Like fine wine gets better with age!Of course like their hits(Planet Earth,View to Kill,and even Careless Memories).Their new songs are great too,and I like the way they added a hook or two to their older songs,instead of playing them the same way for the last 20, 25 years.Yeah I miss some favorites,but like someone else said,pull out a past DD DVD,or YouTube them,there you go.Now I know why their set is the way it is now,it was the same when I saw them in Munich in January.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app works about 75% of the time. The other 25% of the time it can be utterly useless. Thee are problems with connection and certain videos cannot be found. When it works, its great. I've tried other youtube apps that sucked. The other youtube app by this company has the same title. but is a lot worse.  I think at most it can get four and a half stars when it's functioning well.
0425263908|5.0|I saw people talking about this book off the back of conversations about the Fifty Shades Trilogy so I thought I'd check it out. I was pleasantly surprised! There are many similarities to the Fifty Shades in that a young woman stumbles into the office of a very attractive and wealthy businessman and he wants to \\"make love\\" to her straight away.<br /><br />There is a story to this book and to me the characters are slightly more believable. Both the male and female leads have been scared from childhood experiences which become clearer as the story progresses. I think I understood Gideon a little more than Eva as I had trouble with the repetition of her \\"running away\\". Whilst there is less \\"sex\\" to this book than others on the market, what there is very real and \\"normal\\", it doesn't venture into the S&M area therefore some may find easier to read. I would point out that what there is extremely detailed and may make those that blush easy do exactly that!<br /><br />Sylvia Day has written a very descriptive and erotic book that may not interest everyone. It stands alone as a single book however, there are still some things that are not explained and if you felt some connection with the leads I am sure this would make you want to read the other two books that will be published by Penguin - Deeper in You will be available in October 2012.<br /><br />I believe that this book has a lot less hype in the UK, however it has been a huge success over in America. Overall, I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I am not totally sure if it was the story I enjoyed or the subject matter!!! (This is a genre I never thought I'd get into but it's the fourth book like it I've read in less than 3 weeks!) For those that can't decide if they want to read such genre may I suggest you try this one first over others in the Market.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great books!  As soon as I finished the trilogy I googled the author to see what else they had written!  I can't wait for their next book series to come out!

B003VANOFY|4.0|I was at best buy and the only wireless headset I found with 7.1 surround was Turtle Beach and they wanted around 270 bucks for theirs with 7.1 digital Dolby. And couldn't get them to work with my PC no matter how I tried. The sound is incredible in this Logitech. Only problem I have so far is that if I don't use full 7.1 than I only get mono sound through one speaker of the headset. Probably something I haven't set up right though. Otherwise I am extremely happy with my purchase. And it works off of the same program that goes with my Logitech G19 keyboard too.

B005MYEQ4U|1.0|A HUGE disappointment, especially after hearing how wonderful this film was supposed to be. The cliches were sad....mean-spirited fiancé, Ugly Americans, beautiful French Girl, etc. The time travel deal is an old Woody Allen stand by....BORING!!!!!! I couldn't wait for this film to end, and I love much of WA's body of work. I can't express how truly horrible this film was.
1416914307|5.0|Finally all is write for Clary and Jace,kind of. I really loved this book the way it rounded out the Valentine chapter of this series. It would have been a stretch to keep him alive and causing trouble much longer and I am happy Clare decided to end his story line in this novel. I'm not too pleased about the odd sibling kissing with Sebastian, but was very pleased to see Clary and Jace finally learn the truth. I thought the battle scene with Simon could be a little longer with him not fumbling around so much, but it was good the focus was on what was happening on the ativities at the lake since that's where our main characters were. All in all, I thought this was a great middle peice for this series with a great ending.
0007189958|5.0|I absolutely love this book, but I don't understand why it's published under three different titles.  Rosie Dunne & From Rosie with Love are two other names.  Really a wonderful book though.  The story is told through notes, instant messages, emails, and letters.
1416972242|3.0|Although not as good as the first and third book in this series, I still really enjoyed reading this story. Magnus becomes one of my favorite book characters of all time, and this book really expands on the quirks of these fun and dynamic characters. It is exciting near the end to think Clary and Jace will finally learn the truth but leaves you begging for the third book when they don't quite get there. I thought this was well written andfun to read. This series is one of my all time favorites.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love her books so far, this one i thought was great.  It's such a different and original storyline, i couldn't put it down.  I'll admit the ending was a little disappointing, but it's probably what would happen in reality anyway.
1416955070|4.0|I really loved this book and couldn't wait to get my hands on the next one and the next one. I think the plot and the characters are pretty creative and Clare creates an imaginitive world full of new creatures and language that is easy to follow along with and fun to imagine. Her descriptive and detailed imagery creates a great visual as you read along through Clary and Jace's adventures. The plot twist at the end is exciting and heart wrecnhing at the same time. A great read for any youth fantasy lover!

B007JNR4WI|2.0|This review will be short and to the point.  If you are a studio and you have a wonderful movie like \\"Phenomenon\\" in your catalog, why not release it with some EXTRAS!!!???  There are ZERO extras on this disc.  It is a BLU RAY.  It can hold tons of information.  How about releasing Thomas Newman's SCORE on CD?  The only CD available is the Soundtrack of the songs during the film and ONE of Newman's songs.  The soundtrack is worthless.  I love this film, but I am not happy with a blu ray release that is only there to take more money out of my pocket while giving me the same thing I had on the DVD which is JUST the movie.

B004Q0R7FG|3.0|My son is just now getting into the Chuggington series, and I have two older sons who adored the Thomas series when they were his age.  I kept all of those tracks, so I was excited to see Chuggington would be compatible.  BUT as another comment stated, they are not compatible with the old tunnels and bridges as they are just a bit taller and cannot fit.  I would love to see a few more additional tunnels and such for the Chuggington line so that we can update what we have to make it more compatible with both sets.  As it stands....I don't need track pieces, so I don't want to buy whole sets to upgrade......but maybe that was their plan?!
B004A8P2HE|5.0|I recently finished reading this AMAZING book! Portia is very open and honest while writing about her very personal and deep emotional struggles with eating disorders; Anorexia and Bulimia. She describes the internal voices and the driving forces behind the issues; being a model and actress. Portia also writes about coping with her lesbianism and the acceptance or feared rejection as an actress in Hollywood.<br />If one has ever seen pictures of Portia, her beautiful public images, you would never imagine she suffered in silence or lived in darkness for so long. Portia truly is an inspiration to anyone who has (or knows of others dealing with) body image issues, eating disorder issues or may be questioning his/her own sexual-identity. Portia opened her heart and soul in this book and I am grateful for having the opportunity to read it. I highly recommend reading this book!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Like everyone else I had heard the hype about the book, and even listened to someone's rave review.<br />I trolled through the three books, blushing and biting my lip and thinking 'oh my' at practically every opportunity. The only conclusion I came to about this book was is that the time spent reading these books is time I won't get back.<br />The writing is absolutely atrocious. The author is constantly repeating comments about the heroine blushing and looking at her hands, she's consistently biting her lip as well. As a character Anastasia is nothing more than a weak willed woman, willing to let some sadistic power hungry man control her. Apart from the odd moment when she finds her spine and stands up to Christian there's nothing about her that's remarkable.<br />As for Christian, does he have any hair left, seeing as he's always running his hands through it.  And is he really the kind of man anyone would be interested in, he's only interested in denegrating women.<br />The sex scenes are somewhat interesting in the beginning, but after the third or forth episode, I found myself flicking through the descriptions and hoping to god that I'd find a paragraph that would describe what the furniture was like, or what they were having for a meal.<br />Honestly, only read these books if you have absolutely nothing to do, including watching paint dry.  Beleive me, the paints got more going for it.

0307956350|3.0|Kate is a woman with a secret. For the decade of her marriage, she's been a CIA operative... but she hasn't seen fit to tell her husband. Dexter, her adorably clueless computer genius husband, has bought her story about working for the State department hook line and sinker. She always felt a little guilty for lying to him, though, so when he gets a chance of a lifetime job in Luxembourg, she jumps at the chance to get out of The Company. But then another American expatriate (the Expats, natch) couple enters their life, and something just smells fishy...<br /><br />First off, let me say that I'll be surprised if this book hasn't already been optioned for a movie. I'm not saying that the story is all that (though it isn't awful), but this is a very visual book, and the action scenes are particularly well written. The characters are sketched clearly, very stock, and Hollywood might see some possibility of drawing in female viewers to an action movie, as it would feature 'one of their own'(think Stephanie Plum, but more competent and far less funny). Maybe it would work in film form.<br /><br />As a book, though, it has issues. The very 'stock' nature of the characters that make them perfect for the broad strokes of film make them unbelievable in a book. I never felt connected to Kate, the stock bored SAHM; it's not that I can't understand where she's coming from, it's that the descriptions of what bores her and how she feels could have been cut and pasted from many other books. Pavone has some nice turns of phrase, but he never quite 'gets' the women he's writing. Those sections that deal with social and family matters drag--in fact, though a key past action in the book hinges on Kate's supposed 'mother love', there's very little indication of her having much at all to do with her kids in the now. They are little cyphers, going from playground to preschool; I had no picture of them at all. The interactions between the women in the book are similarly shallowly drawn. I would never say that men can never write a primary female protagonist (or the opposite, for that matter), but it takes a deft touch to make those characters ring true. The narrative device of jumping from Luxembourg to 'today'(complete with time of day defined) sometimes worked and sometimes did not. At times the time flip served to advance the narrative or inform the reader, but at times it was just jarring. Again, I think this might go over better in a film. The most unbelievable thing to me is how very blind Kate is to what is patently obvious from the beginning of the story. I don't want to have spoilers in this review, but her refusal to see what is right before her eyes--repeatedly--was a bit unbelievable. It leads the reader to think that she must have been a singularly unsuccessful spy, but we're told repeatedly how good she was at her job. I've never read a character so determined not to trust her instincts or her reason.<br /><br />Where Pavone excels is in his action scenes. They are crisply written, exciting, and very clear. I'm a very visual reader, so I appreciate it when I can see the 'blocking' of a scene in my head on the first read through and it all makes sense. In this area, he gives Tom Clancy at his best a run for his money.<br /><br />Although I think The Expats misses the mark more often than it hits the darn thing, I was able to finish it. I probably wouldn't read this book again, but I'd try something else by Pavone (preferably centered on action and with a male protagonist).would never say that men can never write a primary female protagonist (or the opposite, for that matter), but it takes a deft touch to make those characters ring true.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|So many people get caught up in the sex parts of this book, the sex scenes are part of the sickness. You should really look beyond them and into this true love stor. A story of hope, and combating an abusive childhood. Books 2 and 3 are a must read to really get the entire story.  These books are amazing and I am going thru Christian Gray withdrawal!

0345803507|5.0|The story of Christian and Ana finally wraps up in this third, and final installment of the wonderfully entertaining story of a man caught in a web of dysfunction, and his love for the woman who freed him.  If you've read the previous two book in the Fifty Shades Trilogy, this last book is a very satisfying ending to the story that has captured the world's reading audience.<br /><br />I read the last two books while on vacation in Canada, and every woman I ran into had read at least the first in the series.  Fifty Shades turns out to be much more than just a light, romantic novel.<br /><br />I have to say that I've enjoyed the last book more than the first two books.  E.L. James has allowed her intriguing characters to grow, which is nice, although the minor characters are barely cardboard cutouts.<br /><br />Christian's adoptive parents and siblings are beyond perfect.  They adopt Christian as a young, and very troubled boy, and then put up with his constant bouts of trouble without once hinting that he's too much for them, and that they'd like to ship him back to the foster home before he ruined the rest of the family.<br /><br />I found Ana just a little too wonderful as a heroine.  This plucky-without-a-single-flaw heroine managed to cure Christian of a lifetime of dysfunction using only her sexual prowess.  Pretty remarkable considering she had zero sexual experience, but I let that go and enjoyed the last book which read more like a suspense novel(finally) than a how-to guide to dominate/submissive sexual practices.<br /><br />Christian really is the intriguing character in the story, but we don't see inside his head until the last pages in which see Ana's original meeting with Christian when she interviews him.  This made me want to reread the same first meeting from Ana's point of view to enjoy their varying accounts.<br /><br />There's some suspense as far as Jack Hyde goes, yes he appears again to stir up trouble.  His story has some depth, and causes this last book to show off how E.L. James has improved as a writer.  I'm sure we'll hear from James again, and I'm equally sure she's going to have another bestseller on her hands.  Nicely done.last book to show off how E.L. James has improved as a writer.

B007D2XSW0|3.0|It is a great app, but it has many problems. The new version doesn't load images from the Gallery.  When saving images, the date is not set right.  Very promising.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|SEE MY FANBOY REVIEW BELOW.  There are times when I really hate being obligated to a star rating system, because some parts of the movie were 5 star caliber and other times it was 1 star caliber, and everthing else in between. The pacing was relatively good, but still could have done with out a few scenes here and there. The main villian's presence did offer that ominous impending doom that was absent from The Avengers movie, but TDKR hero payoff was somewhat shallow. And after a while it got pretty old watching the same method Bane would rid his helpless victims. As I was watching this I was wondering \\" Is this movie a bit too apocalyptic for a Batman movie?\\" For many people the greatness of a movie is measured in the number of explosions, how big they are, and how fast and long chase scenes are. So for those people this movie will rate very high. But for people like me who place story, intense drama, and great scripting first, and action and great visual effects to move the story along second, Batman Begins is by far the superior of the trilogy and the best Batman movie ever made. Watch it again, for the first time.<br />FANBOY REVIEW:***** 5 stars. I wish it could be 20 stars. This is the greatest movie ever made. It's equal to The Dark Knight, only better. But The Dark Knight is better. Bane was just as awesome as the Joker, but he wasn't as awesome as the joker. The Joker wasn't as awesome as Bane. I can't believe how awesome this movie is. I'm going to throw away all my other dvds , and only keep my Dark Knight. Then when The Dark Knight Rises comes to dvd I'm going to buy two TV sets another dvd player and play both movies side by side all day everyday for the rest of my life, because after seeing these movies I simply can't make up my mind which one is awesomer. Or is that awesomest. Oh I simply can't get over how perfect these movies are. Especially this one and especially the other one. You know what I'm going to do I'm going to take as many days off fromwork while the TDKR is in the theatres and watch it over and over all day long. Then I'll go home and watch TDK on dvd all night long until TDKR comes to dvd. Then I can watch both at the same time like I mentioned before. : END OF REVIEW. There. I hope I made all you fanboys very happy with my awesomeserestest review of The Dark Knight Rises.
0345803485|2.0|My sister harrassed me and my husband for weeks about getting this book. We were in Costco and my husband pointed the book out to me so I decided to buy the first book to see what all the fuss was about. I decided against the 3 pack bundle and I am so glad I did.<br /><br />First off the book is an extremely easy read, however, it is repetitive as other reviewers have stated.  Also, unbelieveable as other reviewers mentioned....a 27 year old owning a company with 40,000 employees?  Come on now...I work for a company with 50,000 employees and my company is several decades old.  You don't just start up and own a business of that magnitude in just a few years...I have my MBA but it doesn't take one to figure out that it is total B/S. I am all about willfull suspension of belief but geez... make it a little more believable.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the book, however, it is just too adolescent for me.  I am 33 years old and I couldn't get over the fact that a middle aged woman who is an executive in the television industry wrote this. It makes me wonder how in the heck she got an executive job.<br /><br />Ok...about the book: Sex, sex, sex, and little plot.  This is my first erotica book and I found myself wanting more of a storyline.  At first the erotic scenes were hot but then they became repetitive like the rest of the book. I wanted to find out more about Christian in the first book and wanted to find out how he felt about her (Ana) but the ending entailed him beating the shit out of her (Ana) with a belt because she wanted to see \\"how bad it could be\\". Then finally she stood up for herself and left him. As a strong woman myself...I decided I liked that ending and decided not to read the other books. I am a hopeless romantic and \\"The Notebook\\" is my favorite book which is also an easy read but not to the degree of simplicity and repetitive nature of this book.<br /><br />Am I mad I wasted my time reading the book...no atleast I know what all the hype is aboutnow.  It did make me realize how lucky I am that I have my loving husband so I gave it an extra star for that. I won't bother reading the other two books...I will just google the ending to find out instead of reading through all of the repetitive jargon and lip biting, frowning, smirking, etc. I don't have much time to read...I have 2 small children and I work so if/when I do read a book, the next one will have more of a storyline.<br /><br />I don't recommend buying the book...borrow it or get it at the library if you want to know what all the fuss is about.
B005TKD8ZK|5.0|I've heard about Haruki Murakami before, but this book was suggested to me by a cousin, who is herself a runner. She told me that I would be interested in it because of the connections Murakami does between running and his life, including, obviously, the effect running has on his writing. Being a translator and always interested in literature (and the things people do to get inspired to write), I decided to give Murakami a try and I was impressed by his personal and almost conversational tone. His prose sounded like a conversation over coffee at a cafeteria, with a new friend, talking about his views on life and the things we like ad believe in.<br />And that means: heart-warming.

B008645YEE|5.0|[Arggg....this is no less than the 6th time I've re-edited this review. Reason being: for one reason or another -- including reading others' reviews and repeat listening of the album -- I'm changing my opinion of how much I like the music on the std. album + bonus tracks. Bottom line: it's growing on me! ***]<br /><br />Definitely the weakest of the trilogy scores -- IMO -- was 2008's ADK. TDKR, OTOH, returns to many of the emotional elements I found attractive in BB. Curiously, this time there is no JNH co-composing the score. As much as I like JNH's solo scores, I'm wondering whether some of the rumors about him being the \\"junior contributor\\" to Batman scores are true? **<br /><br />Back to TDKR ... and on to a sort-of \\"review\\" of the album-version score....<br /><br />I like the precociousnesses, SERIOUSNESS and darkness of the Nolan-trilogy scores -- and maybe that comes with the territory. I think Zimmer can competently do light-hearted scores (PoC, Sherlock Holmes) but they are not for me because that genre is personally not interesting.<br /><br />IMO, best by far, is bonus trk \\"The end\\". Very ambient, low-key, haunting, precocious and MOVING... none of that tiresome and now-overused 'Zimmer percussion' (loved it ORIGINALLY in BB's Molossus, but when it is recycled over and over, things get boring). \\"The End\\" is a MATURE conclusion, and ranks up there with the best Nolan-trilogy tracks.<br /><br />I should note that while I'm a huge filmscore fan, I'm not a film buff. Even tho' critics and audiences found Nolan's saga respectable, I could not sit thru more than an hour into the DVD. Indeed, I collapsed the video window in my PC's DVD player, worked on other things while I simply LISTENED to the film on headphones ... all while doing other tasks on the PC ... the scores are way more mature: In fact, the OSTs (even at their weakest), to me, almost seem out of place -- i.e., precocious, serious (which the movies' characters -- along with acting efforts, visuals,plot and story -- simply aren't). So this maturity mis-match makes one wonder how much HZ (and JNH, other composers in other STs) DELIBERATELY use ample movie-industry $/resources to push their pure-stand-alone art? I know Jerry Goldsmith commented on this issue in the Hollow-Man DVD suppl. commentary audio track.<br /><br />Anyway... whatever it takes to get GOOD art out .... including $250 million budgets !!<br /><br />NOTES:<br />**  One can wonder if JNH + HZ would have made this a better OST -- or might it be a Zeitgeist thing (e.g., a right combo of being at the right place at the right time, etc., etc., resulting in projects that really click together)? An example of this is 2005's BB -- IMO, a superb collaborative effort, and the best score of the three. I thought TDK**** pretty much fell apart although the two composers were involved; I like HZ's solo effort TDKR much, much better than TDK. Given these \\"inconsistencies\\"/unpredictabilities, at least as far as my opinions are concerned, I can't extrapolate any \\"rules-of-thumb\\" other than generalities:<br />-HZ is good.<br />-JNH is good.<br />-Listen to all stuff they release.<br />-Judge each project INDIVIDUALLY.<br />I thought JNH's Snow White/Huntsman had more better tracks than DKR, but DKR's \\"The End\\" may be my fave OST track of this year (thus far).] [EDIT 2012-07-24_a: I've changed my mind: on this: extended listening to TDKR now tips the favor to it over JNH's Snow White. Like I said above, TDKR seems to -- for one reason or another -- be favorably \\"growing on me\\". ]<br /><br />*** I AM NOT A FILM BUFF. I AM NOT EVEN YOUR ORDINARY-JOE MOVIE WATCHER. I have not seen the DKR film, nor am I planning on seeing it theatrically. I may watch it on home video one day, but a home watch of BB (if you've read my BB OST review) was quite disappointing. Not all films I've watched has there been such a qualitative discordance between the score and the rest-of-the-film. Nolan's Batman trilogy -- apart from its score, of course -- remains (IMO) the usual, immature, appeal-to-the-mass, overrated tripe.<br /><br />****Putting things in perspective: Even tho' I consider 2008's TDK the weakest of the three Nolan-trilogy scores, it's WAY, WAY better than most OSTs by other artists. All IMO, of course ;)!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I started reading this book with no idea what it was about.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This was a great court room drama about a son (Jacob) and his DA father (Andy) that just gripped you from the first page.  It was a who dunit for sure and you simply couldn't put this book down.  I thought it was slightly dragged out but I liked the style of writing as well as the ending. Having a son of my own I could relate to the mother's feelings.  Disturbing story on many levels but it was a great read.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|Let's start with the only big positive from this movie - Ann Hathaway as Selina Kyle (the name of Catwoman never appears in the movie) was just terrific - lithe, athletic, slinky, sexy, cool, empowered, and better at fighting than Batman.  She's probably the best and most dynamic Catwoman ever, displacing Michelle Pfeiffer's more neurotic version from first place at last.<br /><br />And she is the only reason not to give this movie zero stars.<br /><br />Some terrific actors are in this movie, which drags back characters from the previous two movies, either freshly on camera or in photos or flashbacks (e.g., Liam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul, Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow).  Curious, only Heath Ledger's Joker did not re-appear in any form or even in a brief mention.<br /><br />Unfortunately most of the characters get wasted in this tedious, overly long and complicated plot which absolutely makes no sense at all.<br /><br />Yes, I like plot and logical character development and there was none of that here in this movie.<br /><br />****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Worst of all, for an action movie, the action scenes were poorly done.  OK, the opening sequence with the air to air hijacking was mildly interesting, but I got distracted because during the scene I kept wondering, hey why is that agent torturing the prisoners to find out which one of them is Bane, when one of the prisoners with a hood on turns out to be Bane, mask and all?  Presumably his captors saw him that way BEFORE THEY PUT THE HOOD ON.  And Bane is massively bigger than anybody else, so it's not like he's hard to pick out from a crowd, right?<br /><br />Lots of gigantic plot holes like that in this movie.<br /><br />Two really cheesy fight scenes - one where Batman flies in with his Batplane, shoots off the cannon of one of the stolen Batmobiles, and then GETS OUT OF THE BATPLANE to fight Bane mano a mano.  Huh?  Why not just stay in the Batplane and mow him down?<br /><br />And then the charge of the blue brigade fight at the end - ahem - one does not charge en mass down a street packed shoulder to shoulder when your opponents have automatic AK-47s and you are armed only with pistols.  Human wave attacks against machine guns went out of fashion in the Western world at the Somme, 96 years ago.  Even more stupifying, the crooks armed with automatic weapons don't just take cover and mow down the charging cops, THEY STOP FIRING AND CHARGE OUT TO FIGHT HAND-TO-HAND WITH THE COPS.<br /><br />A seriously cheesy CGI moment in this film - I wish filmmakers could figure out how to do a nuclear blast properly.  Try doing some research for starters.  There are archival films of scores of nuclear explosions over water that are more terrifying than the one in this movie, which looked like it was part of a beginner art student's matte painting of a stereotypical mushroom cloud.<br /><br />Alfred is reduced to a blubbering nag, Commissioner Gordon is reduced to fumbling and stumbling around, and the two main new characters introduced - Joseph Gorden-Levitt and Marion Cotillard undergo way too many plot twists that again leave me asking, Huh?<br /><br />Bruce Wayne's story arc here in this movie is just a total mess.  Can you spell Deus ex machina?  Miraculous to have somebody paraplegic from massive spine trauma suddenly get up and start walking, much less regain full form fighting skills.<br /><br />And Bane, poor Tom Hardy - did he really bulk himself up with 40 pound of muscle only to show this muscle in just a few seconds of film footage?  The rest of the time, Bane could have been played by an extra like David Prowse, behind that mask and that bulky clothing, and nobody would have been wiser.  What a waste of talent and muscle.  Bane's story arc needless to say is also all twisty and barely makes sense.  And his ending ... wow, the very definition of anti-climax ....<br /><br />One of the final scenes, with Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a cafe in France, now thatwas touching, and reflected well the sexual tension between the two that flashed only occasionally in this movie.<br /><br />Too bad, this could have been a terrific movie if it had just focused more on those two.was touching, and reflected well the sexual tension between the two that flashed only occasionally in this movie.<br /><br />Too bad, this could have been a terrific movie if it had just focused more on those two.

0786958731|5.0|Who am I:<br />Middle aged married guy who loves Sci fi, video games and fantasy novels. Used to play D&D and then AD&D around twenty years ago. Haven't been involved with any serious groups since then so I have no experience with any editions of D&D that cause such a rift in the community. This means that I am not hopelessly in love with any specific Edition of D&D.<br /><br />-Note for various D&D Edition FanGirls and FanBoys- If you are a 4th Edition Hater and can't get past that, you most likely will not enjoy these games as they are based, in general, on the 4th Edition rule set. If you don't know what that statement means, or if you are capable of enjoying what each Edition has to offer, you should have no problems.<br /><br />Why I love the D&D Adventure Systems:<br />Castle Ravenloft(CR), Wrath of Ashardalon(WoA) and Legend of Drizzt(LoD): They work as a stand alone product and offer a dungeon crawling, limited leveling, monster slaying experience with no previous knowledge of how D&D works. And all in sessions that can be finished in an hour or two. The minimal time commitment involved is fantastic.<br /><br />Or, if you find yourself filled with nostalgia and desire a fuller, longer campaign with further leveling options or new characters, these games can be tweaked to allow for that. Especially with some of the user created content online, the photoshop templates on boardgamegeek.com in particular are wonderful. Also this [....]<br />address has a plethora of new content. The extra leveling options are definitely my favorite. The truth is that I screamed in happiness when I ran across them. I sounded like a ten year old girl getting a pony. A unicorn pony. with wings. A Unicorn Pegasus Pony that appeared in a shimmer of rainbow colors. And now I am deeply ashamed...........*sigh* I am such a nerd.<br /><br />The game system totally allows for expandability in many ways. It's kind of a gateway drug for D&D honestly. I find myself consistently wanting just a bit more of the actual RPG experience. We tweak the game a bit and suddenly our experience is just a bit fuller and more satisfying. Not nearly as detailed and time intensive as an actual D&D or Pathfinder game though. Such a great balance for us.<br /><br />They don't have to be expanded upon though, to be immensely enjoyable. Any of the three games are enough in and of themselves to be hugely gratifying and offer much re-playability. The expandability is just something that makes them extra cool and versatile in my opinion.<br /><br />All three systems use totally interchangeable materials. Some of the cards may be context sensitive and not seem to fit in a particular environment but other than that you can use everything in each of the games. This provides Awesomeness Bonus of +2.<br /><br />The map tiles and figurines both are an unbeatable value and can be easily incorporated into a \\"real\\" D&D session.<br />Everything in the box, other than the manuals, is of superb quality. The figurines alone would easily cost you double what you pay for the set here. And if you paint figurines, which I do, you will have just gained around forty new minis to paint. Joy in and of itself there.<br /><br />Possible Cons:<br />I saw in the review for one of the three games that some dude was just totally disgusted with how these games \\"punish\\" the players for almost every activity they engage in. The guy was totally a Hater. However, he wasn't necessarily wrong. The game does seem to be constantly throwing things at you that often don't feel fair. Notably, the Encounter cards. Which brings me to the next con and a solution to the \\"punishment\\" issue....<br /><br />The instruction manual will not answer every question that will come up. It is left up to the players to decide how certain things should work. Which is how a \\"real\\" D&D game works. Your group plays the game the way they want to play it. If you simply cannot function without every rule spelled out for you, this may bea problem. Otherwise you'll be fine. And in terms of rule tweaking and the punishment issue- we decided to change how often we draw encounter cards as well as a couple other minor aspects of the game. This has served to make our sessions a lot more fun. Don't be afraid to tweak the rules in order to play the game how you want to play it.<br /><br />The manuals are pretty cheaply put together. They may not hold up well to use by younger players or spilled drinks. I took ours apart and put the pages in plastic binder inserts. We now have all the material for all the games in a single, sturdy, custom decorated notebook. Which is awesome btw. (Disclaimer for claim of awesomeness: I created the custom artwork:)<br /><br />Space. With all the cards and map tiles and bags of monsters and tokens that get used in a typical session, you may find you need a bit more space than an average board game. All of the aforementioned items can quickly end up being a mess. As a solution we have everything securely contained in varying sizes of ziplock bags. Including the map tiles in a 1 Gallon size bag. Perfect for storage and during play.<br /><br />There is no actual role playing or in town scenarios. If you want to get into a brawl over the serving wench's honor at The Yawning Portal Inn in the city of Waterdeep, then you should just find a gaming group and play Pathfinder or D&D(any Edition). Or perhaps, after stumbling into a gathering of Dirty Orcs in the Gloomy Forest of Gloom and Terror, you want to attempt to use an illusion to convince them you are a deity and sell them into slavery in the Land of Thay. As opposed to just killing them. Again, just go find a full-on game of D&D. These systems can be worked to allow for things like that to some degree, but they aren't designed to be open world or allow for anything other than a dungeon crawl with combat and a final, combat based, objective.<br /><br />So:<br />If you want \\"real\\" D&D, then you may be more satisfied finding a group and getting involved.<br />If you want a game that allows you to engage in D20 based combat, with figurines, that represent a character with minimal leveling capacity. And that can be played by anyone. These systems may be just the thing for you.<br /><br />Also of note: The Dungeon Command games have interchangeable map tiles, monster cards and figurines that can be used seamlessly with the Adventure Systems.

B008MEM24S|5.0|great game, love Perry. easy to learn and keeps changing to make more challenging. Disney does a great job keeping kids and adults interested.
B00005ARS9|3.0|This CD is a U.K. import, and, like Sounds Of Summer (which was released in America), has 30 songs. Six of the songs on this CD (\\"Little Honda,\\" \\"Then I Kissed Her,\\" \\"Caroline No,\\" \\"Break Away,\\" \\"Cottonfields,\\" and \\"Lady Lynda\\") are not on Sounds Of Summer, and six of the ones on Sounds (\\"Shut Down,\\" \\"Be True To Your School,\\" \\"In My Room,\\" \\"Getcha Back,\\" \\"Come Go With Me,\\" and \\"Good Timin'\\") aren't on this CD.  I think this is a very good compilation, but I prefer Sounds, for three reasons: One, it includes several \\"new\\" (or newER) stereo mixes, whereas this CD only includes previous mixes (mono in certain cases, stereo in others); two, I prfer most of the songs that are on Sounds but not on this CD to most of the ones that appear on this CD but not on Sounds (I really would have liked it if \\"Break Away\\" and \\"Lady Lynda\\" had been on Sounds); and three, Sounds has better quality of... sound (in my opinion). If you don't have this CD, my advice is to skip it and get Sounds Of Summer (if you don't have it already); if you have Sounds Of Summer, I really don't see much if any reason to get this CD too. I'm giving this CD three stars, but that doesn't mean I think it's a bad CD; like I said before, I think it's very good. If the sound quality had been a little better, I would have given it four stars, which is probably the maximum number I would have given it; even with better sound, I'd probably have still thought that Sounds Of Summer was a star better.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Christopher Nolan puts the human element front and center, taking the cartoonish out of super heroes and making \\"The Dark Night Rises\\" seem a lot shorter than 2 ½ hours. The aches and pains of being a super hero or super villain one wouldn't think compelling but in the hands of Nolan and an all-star cast it's riveting. Nolan is producing Superman \\"Man of Steel\\" for 2013 release. I can't wait.<br /> Erstwhile political commentator Rush Limbaugh saw something nefarious in a \\"Dark Night\\" villain being named Bane in the same year that the Republican presidential nominee is a Bain Capital alumnus. Leaving aside that Bane dates back in the comic books to 1993 and that Nolan and Daniel Goyer wrote their script in 2010, Rush is right that the film may do damage to neoconservatives/establishment Republicans but not in the way that he thinks. The fact that Bane's act of love and protection is the reason for his damaged face/mask does damage to the neocons' simplistic view of evil. That Batman, too, wears a mask because of love and acts of protection and factoring out megalomania and unconcern for collateral damage that he's very much like Bane (they both had the same mentor) is more firepower directed at the unthinking neocon intellectual edifice. Yes, Rush, be afraid, be very afraid.<br /> Perhaps Rush can relax because \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is the third in Dolan's trilogy although I got the sense that this excellent movie will be seen historically as the end of the beginning. At film's end Detective Blake is ready to pick up the mantle as Robin/Nightwing. Nobody calls him either name until five minutes before closing credits but those with soul to see can tell early on that Blake is on his way to Robinhood.<br /> Gary Oldman (\\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\") is at his usual tortured excellence as Commissioner Gordon, hiding the terrible secret of District Attorney Harvey Dent's descent into Two-Face madness for the good of Gotham City. Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale)goes along to his own psychological detriment/physical endangerment.<br /> Dent's legacy reminds us of the double-sidedness of the law - essential for social order yet an instrument of oppression when taken too far (as rigorous enforcement of drug laws today falling disproportionately on the poor demonstrates). Glory-seeking by some police is given respectful, honest treatment.<br /> Conservatives will appreciate the treatment Nolan and Goyer give Bane's \\"power-to-the people\\" revolution. That thievery and kangaroo courts are the main offspring of \\"people's\\" movements is not something that should surprise any serious student of history although these tendencies are neatly camouflaged by the \\"civilization\\" we take for granted. Bravo to the script writers for their astuteness about the human psyche.<br /> Additional kudos for leaving off the super hero titles which further displays the brokenness of the people. Bruce Wayne doesn't don the Batman suit until at least 30 minutes into the movie. At his heels is Alfred (Michael Caine) pleading for Bruce to help Gotham in a different, more lasting way. Alfred issues a Clubber Lang-type (see \\"Rocky III\\") warning about Bane that is ignored and their friendship isn't the only thing that gets broken as a result. Selina Kyle is a cynical, reluctant heroine as Catwoman. The fact that she isn't labeled Catwoman makes us listen to her heart.<br /> That Noland and Goyer didn't just retell the DC Comics classic \\"Knightfall\\" tale (available in graphic novel and hardcover book) is in keeping with The New 52 movement launched by DC last year. Both endeavors take pieces from the classical canon and arrange them in new and compelling ways. As the folks at Bain Capital might say, this adds value.<br /> Nolan hits it out of the park with a late plot twist revealing that Bane is not the central villain and that the central villain has been hiding in plain sight. Backs are important in this movie - I urge you to study them. The body language communicates itself subtly but assuredly - a pretty face or a mask can hide an evil mind and the key to combating wickedness is to understand what's gone before (or at your back as some might say) and stand boldly for your truth.

And that is not meant as a compliment.

This means that I am not hopelessly in love with any specific Edition of D&D.<br /><br />-Note for various D&D Edition FanGirls and FanBoys- If you are a 4th Edition Hater and can't get past that, you most likely will not enjoy these games as they are based, in general, on the 4th Edition rule set. If you don't know what that statement means, or if you are capable of enjoying what each Edition has to offer, you should have no problems.<br /><br />Why I love the D&D Adventure Systems:<br />Castle Ravenloft(CR), Wrath of Ashardalon(WoA) and Legend of Drizzt(LoD): They work as a stand alone product and offer a dungeon crawling, limited leveling, monster slaying experience with no previous knowledge of how D&D works. And all in sessions that can be finished in an hour or two. The minimal time commitment involved is fantastic.<br /><br />Or, if you find yourself filled with nostalgia and desire a fuller, longer campaign with further leveling options or new characters, these games can be tweaked to allow for that. Especially with some of the user created content online, the photoshop templates on boardgamegeek.com in particular are wonderful. Also this [....]<br />address has a plethora of new content. The extra leveling options are definitely my favorite. The truth is that I screamed in happiness when I ran across them. I sounded like a ten year old girl getting a pony. A unicorn pony. with wings. A Unicorn Pegasus Pony that appeared in a shimmer of rainbow colors. And now I am deeply ashamed...........*sigh* I am such a nerd.<br /><br />The game system totally allows for expandability in many ways. It's kind of a gateway drug for D&D honestly. I find myself consistently wanting just a bit more of the actual RPG experience. We tweak the game a bit and suddenly our experience is just a bit fuller and more satisfying. Not nearly as detailed and time intensive as an actual D&D or Pathfinder game though. Such a great balance for us.<br /><br />They don't have to be expanded upon though, to be immensely enjoyable. Any of the three games are enough in and of themselves to be hugely gratifying and offer much re-playability. The expandability is just something that makes them extra cool and versatile in my opinion.<br /><br />All three systems use totally interchangeable materials. Some of the cards may be context sensitive and not seem to fit in a particular environment but other than that you can use everything in each of the games. This provides Awesomeness Bonus of +2.<br /><br />The map tiles and figurines both are an unbeatable value and can be easily incorporated into a \\"real\\" D&D session.<br />Everything in the box, other than the manuals, is of superb quality. The figurines alone would easily cost you double what you pay for the set here. And if you paint figurines, which I do, you will have just gained around forty new minis to paint. Joy in and of itself there.<br /><br />Possible Cons:<br />I saw in the review for one of the three games that some dude was just totally disgusted with how these games \\"punish\\" the players for almost every activity they engage in. The guy was totally a Hater. However, he wasn't necessarily wrong. The game does seem to be constantly throwing things at you that often don't feel fair. Notably, the Encounter cards. Which brings me to the next con and a solution to the \\"punishment\\" issue....<br /><br />The instruction manual will not answer every question that will come up. It is left up to the players to decide how certain things should work. Which is how a \\"real\\" D&D game works. Your group plays the game the way they want to play it. If you simply cannot function without every rule spelled out for you, this may bea problem. Otherwise you'll be fine. And in terms of rule tweaking and the punishment issue- we decided to change how often we draw encounter cards as well as a couple other minor aspects of the game. This has served to make our sessions a lot more fun. Don't be afraid to tweak the rules in order to play the game how you want to play it.<br /><br />The manuals are pretty cheaply put together. They may not hold up well to use by younger players or spilled drinks. I took ours apart and put the pages in plastic binder inserts. We now have all the material for all the games in a single, sturdy, custom decorated notebook. Which is awesome btw. (Disclaimer for claim of awesomeness: I created the custom artwork:)<br /><br />Space. With all the cards and map tiles and bags of monsters and tokens that get used in a typical session, you may find you need a bit more space than an average board game. All of the aforementioned items can quickly end up being a mess. As a solution we have everything securely contained in varying sizes of ziplock bags. Including the map tiles in a 1 Gallon size bag. Perfect for storage and during play.<br /><br />There is no actual role playing or in town scenarios. If you want to get into a brawl over the serving wench's honor at The Yawning Portal Inn in the city of Waterdeep, then you should just find a gaming group and play Pathfinder or D&D(any Edition). Or perhaps, after stumbling into a gathering of Dirty Orcs in the Gloomy Forest of Gloom and Terror, you want to attempt to use an illusion to convince them you are a deity and sell them into slavery in the Land of Thay. As opposed to just killing them. Again, just go find a full-on game of D&D. These systems can be worked to allow for things like that to some degree, but they aren't designed to be open world or allow for anything other than a dungeon crawl with combat and a final, combat based, objective.<br /><br />So:<br />If you want \\"real\\" D&D, then you may be more satisfied finding a group and getting involved.<br />If you want a game that allows you to engage in D20 based combat, with figurines, that represent a character with minimal leveling capacity. And that can be played by anyone. These systems may be just the thing for you.<br /><br />Also of note: The Dungeon Command games have interchangeable map tiles, monster cards and figurines that can be used seamlessly with the Adventure Systems. I love this as it ads even more expansion options.a problem. Otherwise you'll be fine.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love everything about this app! I wouldn't trade it for the world it has so many options all in one place instead of having more than one bible!
B008N1V11U|1.0|kinda sucks that the maximum allotted space for apps is 1 Gb and this needs 1.6. kind of a bummer.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I totally loved these books. I originally bought these books based on other reviews and now understand why those were so good. I love the way the book starts and leads us through the following books through individual characters. Loved the way the story unfolded. Just finished his last book #6 and it was a perfect follow up to the five.
0131103628|5.0|This book is a historical document written by the actual creator of the C language back in 1978. You will get some surprises, such as that \\"garbage collector\\" is a concept known in those early days of structured programming.<br /><br />The book describes C in a way that I haven't found in previous readings. Remember, those were the days of PDP11 minicomputers, not PCs, and the infancy of UNIX, no Linux. And still, the C language were already what it is today.<br /><br />If you have read Denis Ritchie before, you may be familiar with his good style in technical writting. Either you want to learn C or to have a taste of the early days of C and UNIX, I will recomment this reading to you.
B007PKSN6Q|3.0|Music is fun, but better with original groups/artists singing. It put all the songs on from the movie that made us sing along (those who grew up in the 80's) but the cast toned down the music in the movie....just different
0439023513|5.0|The last book was a great success, one of the cool things about it was that, even in the end there were still surprises that were not overly foreshadowed. The books are a great series, and am super glad I purchased the books hard cover, I can't wait to re read them!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|like the fact that on my kindle the buttons are huge and it is so easy to use!  Use it a LOT!

B0000VCZK2|5.0|skipping the same thing over 700 hundred other people have said about this set i will just skip to the facts, 8 disks,1 special features disk per movie, a sweet case that folds out and pretty much the best space series ever, if your a fan just buy it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use it to fall asleep or while I'm stretching or just to reduce stress. It comes with a variety of sounds including: slow waves, night, medieval, piano, music box, and many more. I recommend this app to any one that likes yoga or just calming sounds. This app deserves 5 stars for its variety and its many uses (don't forget its price) . Buy this app!!!
0307592731|5.0|Reviewing this book is a bit like reviewing your best friend, or the love of your life.  It's pretty hard to be objective when something speaks to the deepest, truest part of you, and then changes you forever.  Wild did that for me.<br />Wild is one woman's coming of age story.  In a society where we don't have a ritual to help young people learn what it is to be an adult, to trust their instincts, and to find and honor their strengths and weaknesses, Strayed creates her own.  In the summer of 1995, at 26 years old, reeling from the death of her mother, the slow dissolving of her family, and the failure of her marriage, Strayed commits herself 1,100 mile trek on the high-altitude Pacific Crest Trail, solo, repeating her mantra the whole way:  I am not afraid.  Along with her 60+ pound pack, she carries with her a broken heart and devastating mistakes, heavy burdens to be sure.  And while this book talks about those burdens, they are never about them more than they are the trip itself.  Unlike Eat Pray Love (which Wild resembles in the sense that is about a woman's search for meaning) Strayed's voice is not neurotic, frantic, or laced with self pity.  Strayed's is the voice of someone who has walked slowly over the bed of hot coals (barefoot) and stands at the other side, transformed.  Contrary to Eat Pray Love, there is no happy ending here, as there shouldn't be.  No one is ever relieved of the burden of suffering by any other person or by achieving a goal, Strayed seems to say, we just grow strong enough to bear it, and come to find comfort in its weight.<br />For me, that is what makes this book a masterpiece.  Strayed doesn't shy away from the truth, which is known to all of us in our heart of hearts:  life is not easy.  It's hard.  It's a long, hard, impossible journey that none of us are ever prepared for and, as crappy as it seems, there may be no reward for completing the journey.  So, she seems to say in Wild, make the journey something spectacular.  Make it something fine and true and real.  Make it something so wild that you will be proud, when you walk out of the wilderness at the other end, to have it called it your life.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome you MUSTdownload it!!. My sister has it on her kindle fire my mom also has it on had Ipad.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a holy Bible app why would you not give it a good reveiw ur not supposed to boast about praying or reading the Bible but this is great way to read
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|all the angry birds apps are super awesome!!! I don't really care if it has the adds cause the game's still really fun :)
0307593495|4.0|I enthusasitcally selected the Mankell galleys from the Vine list as I have enjoyed his work and the Wallander mysteries so thoroughly. This is another great read. If it weren't for the brooding, grey, snowscape that Mankell so ably creates, this would be a great summer read. It is often brisk and the mystery is \\"can;t put it down\\" engrossing.<br /><br />One of the great things about Wallander - and this series - is that he is an evolving character. Things don't just happen to Wallander, he takes them on board, the events of each story change him, often in ways that are not significant to plot until much later in the series. Each book rewards and as a series they work so well.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Troubled Man. Again, Mankell finds a way to bring themes and issues of particular contemporary importance into the travails of Kurt Wallander.<br /><br />A great book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is so addictive!! I cant get away from this! this app also helps develop your brain in many ways.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|this book is an easy read , but too much sex to the point i am skimming over the parts with sex, not because it offends me but just because there is so much , it is like really again please,

B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! This book follows up the first very well. I had to stop myself from reading a few times because it began to draw me in. Very good and leads straight into the third book! I highly recommend reading this book.
0062183591|2.0|I always find Dan Ariely's titles interesting and find myself thinking that if the book can deliver on the promise of the title it will be insightful and helpful. Unfortunately, I have not found that to be the case with the books of his that I have read. I am not a social scientist but I find that the research methods that he describes lack adequate (or applicable) controls for the many variables that are outside of the scope of the research. I have also become very skeptical of much of the pop lit social science that has been crowding shelves and Kindles since Freakonomics. As self-help, this may help; but, if like me, you want to know more about the nuts and bolts of the behavioral science that go into the conclusions and recommendations, you may want to stick to journal articles.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is soaddicting the first day I got it It was beat or at least the easy levels get it now.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game! !!!!!<br /><br />this is one of my favorite games and it is awesome a great boredom breaker :)<br />not to mention the awesome price...... it oz very easy to play but yet still challenging..,.
B005LAIGWS|4.0|The movie is excellent and it made great timing. Everything was exceptional as far as price and how quickly it arrived. My only problem is when it arrived the case was damaged. There was a tear on the front of the movie case. I feel like since everything was perfect, I shouldn't review too harshly and it would have been a 5 star review if it weren't for that minor imperfection
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was a great book. The author did a good job of keep your attention from one book to the next.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|As many others have stated, some of the discs WILL NOT WORK!  I have tried purchasing this set numerous times hoping to get a functional complete series, to no avail.  My wife is terribly dissapointed as this was to be a birthday gift.  I guess we will have to wait for the Blu-Ray version and hope the discs are functional.  [[ASIN:B000ASDFJU Sex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset) [DVD] (2005)]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great I live this game so much I def give it 5 stars it is amazing and I will play it forever
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy playing these games.My grandson and I play for hours.The games are not to hard and I had no trouble understanding the directions to each one. we are having fun with it.Some games are a challenge and some are simple but overall they just are fun.
0345803485|1.0|Having read and heard all the hype about this book, I gave in and bought it thinking that something this popular couldn't bee that bad. I'm 150 pages in and honestly, it's astoundingly terrible. How did this get published? Was it not edited for basic literary style? How many times can you repeat the same words \\"impeccable\\" \\"immaculate\\" and the same expression \\"oh my\\" \\"jeez\\" etc!<br /><br />The characters are poorly developed, completely unbelievable!<br /><br />If this woman can write a best seller, anybody can.
034580404X|5.0|This set of books was worth every penny and every second of reading time.  I loved how all 3 books played out.  A fabulous read!!!!!!!
0099579936|1.0|I am so glad that a lot of you feel the same way about \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\" as I do! I haven't read any literary reviews, maybe because it just doesn't qualify as literature, or even good, engrossing writing. Apparently, the author wanted to make a \\"Twilight\\" love/sex story, but without the fangs, or the bite! The premise is totally unbelievable, the Gray character even more so, the dialogue is ludicris...he talks like a 17th century count,\\"You have bewitched me, Anatasia...\\" so dumb. He contradicts himself constantly, \\"stay away, but be my submissive.\\" Yet he's so enamoured with Anatasia, he shows up at her house more than Mr. Roper at the apartment on \\"Three's Company!\\" The ONLY thing that is selling this book is the sex scenes,which are not especially hot, and though Gray SAYS he doesn't sleep with with women, or do the \\"girlfriend\\" thing, Anatasia seems to be able to get him to not only sleep with her, hold her, buy her expensive gifts, as well as be fiercly possessive over her... who is the REAL dominant here?IF I can stomach finishing this book, which is doubtful, I hope to God she gets with Kate's brother, or some other guy, ANY other guy, that's real flesh and blood! Bid Count Gray adieu, fair Anastasia, and run from the castle as far as you can get!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|very fast results.! 100% better than the dictionary that originally came with the kindle fire. I'm reading a bunch of classics for school and this is really helpful.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked it for what it is, but I did wish it was a little ... more.  It was a fast and crazy car chase of a book.  You feel yourself with Katniss, climbing trees, trying to out think the game, trying to out think your opponents.  It exhausts you, in a good way, because you totally invest it with them.<br /><br />What I wished for though, was a little more about what goes on in the minds of the adults.  I'd hope to get that in the next two books as our girl grows up and starts her own family, but from what I've seen, we never really do get to that place.  I want to know how the adults cope with this utter lack of freedom, the inability to feed their families and make their lives.  What goes on in their heads about that?  How did they get to the place where they just accept the situation instead of fighting back?  How do they lose that sense that drives Katniss to not only compete, but survive and conquer, even defying all the powers that be all by herself?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a very interesting book. It grabbed my attention from the beginning to the end. I would recommend this book to a friend to read.
B008MEM24S|5.0|fun game that is very similar to where's my water. this is great especially if you like Perry the platypus
030758836X|5.0|I had such fun reading this book!<br /><br />The plot is genius, the characters are complex, the wit is sharp and original.<br />I cheered mostly for Nick, but toward the end started to cheer as well for Amy (during her trouble with the mountain folks.)<br /><br />There were a few things that I had to suspend disbelief for, but that is a small sticking point for such an overall powerhouse of a novel.<br /><br />By the last several chapters, I was breathless. While still engaged in the narrative, I found that I just wanted it to end! I felt worn out by the twists and turns and tension. The end was disturbing, but at the same time it was PERFECT !!<br /><br />I enthusiastically assign 5 full stars for this exciting adventure into madness.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I LOVE this app! I wish I didn't have to download so much for it because I don't always have Internet but this app is so easy and simple to use but makes Pics look awesome.
B00493E1GI|2.0|The plot revolves around a selfish, unhappy woman who decides to travel to Italy and India to \\"find\\" herself and discovers others who have problems of their own. Had she been traveling to suburban America, it would've been a 1 star movie.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />I'm not sure if Julia Roberts' character simply chose the wrong person to marry or really didn't want to be married to anyone, but thought she had to be. She's a career woman, who finds it beneath her to have children, which should have been discussed with her fiance before marriage. She should have told him she didn't want to have kids, which was one reason she filed for divorce.<br /><br />She also was upset that her husband wanted some home-cooked meals. Again, if she hated cooking, she should have told him before getting married to him, such as, \\"I hate cooking, so if you want a home-cooked meal, be prepared to do it yourself.\\" Cooking is a responsibility that can be shared as well, but she felt it necessary to divorce over that issue too.<br /><br />Then she decides everything is about her and what she wants, never mind what her husband wants. But he's not entirely innocent either, because she talks, and he doesn't listen. Both of them needed to sit down and discuss what they wanted out of life and what they wanted from each other before getting married.<br /><br />So to make herself feel better she travels, meets people, and gets happy. Who wouldn't be happier after spending a year's long vacation without worrying about the cost?
B008MEM24S|5.0|you should download this app if you have a child or children! my little sister is 1 years old and she watches me play
B007SGM084|5.0|This was the first trilogy I read that consumed me.  I was not able to concentrate on anything other than wanting to read this book.  I have to say this...the third book was may absolute favorite.  I hope to read more books by this author in the near future.

B004FOA84A|4.0|Puzzles are interesting and challenging enough to be fun but not make you pull your hair out. Worth. 99 very entertaining!!
B007FH9GA6|4.0|Without having read the books nor having seen the Swedish versions of the story, I found this movie very intriguing and complex with dozens of characters to keep track of. Rooney Mara who plays the female lead role is very believable and steals the show from Daniel Craig. The dialogue is well written, but sometimes the actors mumble, so be prepared with the rewind button.<br /><br />PLOT:<br />  A journalist (Daniel Craig) is hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate the disappearance of the man's niece forty years ago under the pretense of writing his biography. As the case unfolds, he decides to enlist the aid of a computer hacker (Rooney Mara) to assist in gathering more information.<br /><br />WARNING: contains scenes/themes of rape, incest, torture, homosexuality, and consensual sex. I fast forwarded through several disturbing scenes, because it's easy to get the gist without having to sit through it.
B004FDPOHC|5.0|Love the movie and soundtrack. If your driving with the album playing it feels like your about to cross over to the Grid!

B007V5XT1O|5.0|I love this album! Carrie recorded a variety of songs on this one from the up-tempo summer tune \\"One Way Ticket\\" to sweet ballads like \\"Forever Changed\\" and \\"See You Again\\" and small town loving \\"Thank God for Hometowns\\". She is an amazing vocalist and her talents are certainly showcased on this entire album.

055338466X|1.0|Physicists have been caught up with string theory and M theory for quite some time and this book ends with a focus on M theory.  It doesn't really explain M-theory because quite honestly no one can, it's just a possible theory with some large gaping holes in it.  But these theories have yet to be proven in any way.  Actually even the theory of quarks has yet to be proven.  We have no idea what quarks are or that they even exist yet so much of quantum theories are even more abstract than quarks.  The book wants to explain the grand design of the universe but contradicts itself or leaves out explanations at every turn.<br /><br />One of the main points is that our universe came out of nothing and other universes could do the same therefore God had nothing to do with it.  That begs the question that if universes spontaneously generate then why haven't we had another big bang that started in the center of my living room?  So want controls how spontaneous this is and where it happens?  All of this quite honestly is philosophical theories of physics rather than hard physical reality.<br /><br />I should mention I've always had problems with the normalization of Reyman sums which seems like an equivalent of pharmaceutical drug and vaccine studies, they just fudge the numbers until they get what they want.  I can't see physicists going even more into an abstract deep explanation of things when they're already standing on shaking ground.  They need to go back to where things still need to be proven experimentally and get hard facts then they can start branching out into abstract theories.  As it stands we have too many abstract theories and little to no experimental proof.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have enjoyed this game.  There are lots of different games. As you progress and earn points you can unlock new games.
B008CJ0JTI|4.0|I got the HD DVD of this long time ago and it was mediocre.This was teased awhile back and I totally forgot about it until about 10 minutes ago while browsing through Criterions site hoping to come across a hint for Rian Johnson's \\"Brick\\". The Game  happens to be in my top 10 of all time and top three Fincher films along with Social Network and Se7en. Really looking forward to this. And it happens to take place in one of the greatest cities on the planet!

0307730697|5.0|While Adam Brown never appeared to be bathed in prosperity while growing up - he certainly overcame, or at least battled his share of adversity.  What a true inspiration for anyone.  Everyone at one time in their lives will be tested with darkness.  Some walk away, some dabble and move on, some dive in head first never to be seen from again.  Adam made it all the way to the bottom with a head first dive and by all accounts should have remained there until he was just a forgotten memory of wasted talent.  How he was able to battle, overcome, achieve, and leave such an indelible stamp on his family and our country is truly a testament to the Devine hand of god.  I've read many books on war and warriors - but none stand out as does the story of Adam Brown.  Amen to him and his family for their belief in his abilities and not ever giving up on the person they KNEW he could become.  Thank you for your service; and thank you to all of Adams family, friends, and teammates for your service and belief in Adam Brown.  This book will remain on my shelf until my young son is able to understand that adversity is the diamond dust Heaven polishes its jewels with, Adam Brown certainly being one of them.
0062082353|5.0|This was an awesome book.  I loved every minute of it! It does have a few bad words that could have been left out.  I am glad that we have the Elite on our side!
0345803507|5.0|50 shades of grey was great book.. I've read all 3 and love them all.. Just wish she had more books out there to read.  Seems she is a new author, I couldn't find any more of her writing here.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app! Simple and it works! I am glad kindle did not over think this app. Thx KF. Although this review proces is a bit much 20words to much.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|THE CD/DVD, I NEVER SEEN SO MUCH HIGH<br />ENERGY IN MILEY CYRUS'S LIVE CONCERT<br />IN MY LIFE. IT'S AMAZINE, AND THE CD<br />AS WELL.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I love the open world and the ability to go anywhere I want. It is pretty good on kindle fire...not too laggy and has easy controls. A fun game. :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun simple and free. games are pretty basic but they will keep your attention. I enjoyed this app a lot.
B0086700CM|5.0|Ive been playing it for a few weeks now and its awesome! One of the BEST apps EVER!!!! I highly recommend it :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great time consumer. I love the variety of games to play. it definately rivals bored.com. I will definately recommend this to all family and friends.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|I think that this game is really fun. the only thing that I didn't like was that the tasks that you had to do were repetitive but it must be a good game since I played it for three hours straight ;)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is a amazing app everybody should get<br />it really helps me with math problems a need a calculator for
0143119680|3.0|Although, I'm an occasional vampire/werewolf/super-hero/whatnot saga reader, I would never bought it, it's just too long. Yet you can't refuse if you've got it for free from your friends, so be aware.<br /><br />Shortly speaking, it's at least 2-3 weeks of reading if you have a social life and a full-time job. Six hundred pages is not a joke.<br /><br />From time to time it gets very cheesy like each story within this genre. But excuse me, is there any other fiction vampire who also practices yoga, appreciates good wine and loves slow and tragic sex? I know, this is a perfect combination and every girl's dream. Besides that, there's a lot of drama, classic \\"my parents died when I was little\\" case, good guys and bad guys, as well as a storyline we're never tired of, called \\"How I was living my semi-ordinary life and always knew I was destined for something bigger\\". From what you already understood, the book's not humorous too.<br /><br />Granted, it was indeed written with a good sense of language. I suggest it to the ladies and Harry Potter fans. Don't expect the book will change your life. Read it and forget about it. Overall enjoyable piece of supernatural action.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I got this just before the movie came out so I could know what was going on when my kids wanted to see the movie. Honestly, I liked it quite a bit. This book really works. My children also read it and they loved it. Funny thing is none of us have seen the film. We'll have to wait for Bluray. Recommended.
0743243153|5.0|Good marriage book for when the grass in your own yard starts looking dull (don't judge, after 15 years anything can look dull). very effective at changing my perspective. didn't tell me anything i didn't already know, but gave it to me in a clear, precise way i could use daily, gave me tools to focus and keep perspective. it does refer to God but not so much that i would call this a religious book. very subtle references to God and not preachy at all. i'm an atheist and i was not bothered by the spiritual references because they were far outweighed by practical thinking and logical approaches to situations regarding love and relationships. read this book 3 years ago and the lessons it taught me are still with me. i'm much happier and feel like i can see the bigger picture. helped me find the compassion i'd lost under a mound of daily annoyances, mediocrity, and the effects of \\"familiarity breeds contempt\\". this is a book every couple should read together at the onset of marriage, in my opinion.
0984074422|5.0|The images are very meaningful about the culture of other people around the world. I recommend this book for students and teachers.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|I'm through the third in the series.  Vivid writing, and aside from the dragon sideline, very engaging.  But, I'm giving up, because every character I get vested in, George kills off.  I'm for traditional hero-establishment and triumph, and this just doesn't do it for me.
B005KR6NS6|5.0|A quietly moving story featuring Sally Potter, who becomes entranced with the Tango and seeks lessons. It is a delightful story and filmed in a beautiful way. Slow moving, but entrancing. I recommend it to anyone who loves dance and music. some may find it lacking action though, so not for them. A serene art house film will beautiful cinematography.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|You can never have too many classic books in your e-library and you certainly can't beat the price. Free is nice.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I bought quell reflect hoping for a continuation of quell game play but the intro of the new elements make it quite worthy of being the sequel to a gorgeous game like quell. Will be buying whatever u guys come out with next!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|big numbers and easy to use. love it! makes paying the bills a breeze. thanks for the no frills free app.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I loved it when I got where's my water. when I heard about Perry I could hardly wait. it took a while to get it on my kindle. I'm. not disappointed. it is much the same with a little different feel.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This is an excellent book on habits, how habits are formed, some neuroscience basics, and how they can be be modified, with plenty of anecdotal evidence to support the author's ideas. However it is very light on the details on what to do about it. Instead of just the Appendix, I wish the author had spent as much time, if not more, on the prescriptive \\"How to\\" aspect of behavioral modification.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|You can never have too many classic books in your e-library and you certainly can't beat the price. Free is nice.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have had my pair of Sony MDR-7506 for four years now, with really no end in sight. I use these for both small production and DJing and they have been wonderful. The sound is great and packs a pretty good punch. I do own other pairs of headphones that are better in different ways, but these have the best all-round package. They are super durable and very reliable. I'm not sure if these will ever give out, but when they do I will definitely scoop up another pair. I completely recommend these.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I love this movie!  The plot, the acting, the music, the water- does it get any better when it comes to blockbuster movies?  I would love to see this in Imax.  Can't wait to see what this looks like in blu ray,and with the ability to watch it in 3d, should be a good experience.
B001OGTQRC|5.0|This album has made this band legendary. It is absolutely ridiculous of not appreciating this album as one of the stepping stone of TESTATMENT into the thrash metal stage. This album rocks from the beginning to the end. I have the album and still listens to it just like i did almost 30 years ago. NOW THATS THRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book! Could not guess what was going to happen next. Definitely a psychological twist that you never see coming.  It was a nice change of pace from my ususal preference for sci-fi books. Highly reccomend.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It's a fun game you sometimes get stuck but it's fun. I already done all of it and all of the gnomes.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This game is extremely easy. After doing the first 20 levels I skipped to the hardest level and it was still only mildly challenging. Although visually pleasing, the game has the same level of challenge as a \\"word search\\" puzzle.
B001OGNOES|5.0|Most people say that this album placed Testament on the front page of metal scene. But I have to disagree. Even though this album has better production then The Legacy, the first album is like the \\"first strike\\" and \\"is still deadly\\". By no question, this album is a perfect masterpiece, and to some extent it continues the legacy with no doubt. This is a must to your \\"TETSTAMENT\\" collection.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I delly like this game it is just like weeds my water but it hasr elly charters talking to u doring the game and its really funny so get this app
B0053TMP24|4.0|I have read all of the other books that have Percy and the other characters from camp half blood and found this book to be on par with them.  Although I find some of the phrasing that Riordan uses to be a little juvenile, that is more or less what it should be. I think that anyone that has enjoyed his previous work will likely enjoy this as well.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great game! There are 3 different versions and it is just so cool! You should totally get this app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. its challenging and fun. its great for passing time. I would like it if it was easier to get the games unlocked
B006WXHJNU|5.0|I gotta tell you, the visual effects in this movie are excellent. Yuo will love every second of this action packed HULK movie. No reason why you should not have it in your BLUERAY collection.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Much must be explained about why Christopher Nolan, who put together a trilogy of the most celebrated Batman movies of all time, would say that this one, \\"Dark Knight Rises\\", would be the last. It is most likely because he is now producing the upcoming \\"Superman\\" series as well, or maybe it's the typical Hollywood excuse of, \\"I'm more than just Batman. I want to be more than just this.\\" Whatever the reason, it's a shame. Apparently, fans showing up in drones and giddy with glee isn't good enough for some.<br /><br />For the third and final outing, the anticipation may be better than the movie. It has a lot to follow up on after the second movie. \\"Dark Knight\\" blew up beyond recognition behind a posthumous Oscar winning performance by Heath Ledger. With a larger than life storyline and some characters existing only to make small stories come to life, Nolan has a lot on his table and was trying to make a gigantic splash for his last trip to Gotham.<br /><br />The entire trilogy, beginning with \\"Batman Begins\\" has always been more about the man behind the mask than the man wearing the mask. \\"Dark Knight Rises\\" is no exception. Why does he do what he does? Why is he so special, other than the costume he wears that most of us would get laughed at wearing? Nolan answers all the questions and that may be part of the problem. For most of the movie, it seemed he was trying to cram every Batman apologue into his final hours before he left it. At one point, we know that Gotham's fate is on a timer, yet Batman stops to kiss the girl and reveal childhood secrets to Commissioner Gordon before taking off.<br /><br />Batman has been around since before World War 2 and many have taken liberties with the back-story and characters since. Nolan is no exception. Forget everything you've seen in the past or your expectations of what the villains Bane or Catwoman should be. I found the liberties taken here, were good ones, although Anne Hathway's Catwoman was way too interesting to be way so underused. Along that same line, there are many surprises that you won't see coming.<br /><br />You really can see the wheel of fortune of story-lines fluttering by in the first half of the movie as scenes jump from story to story. All of the story-lines come to form eventually and mostly begin to flow better toward the middle. Yet, like \\"Batman Begins\\" and pretty much every other Hollywood superhero movie, you have to wait for Bruce Wayne to rise to the occasion as he battles with demons and sits in a hole for most of the movie. I'm starting to think that this is a superhero movie tactic to save money on budget costs and shoot just enough action to make a great trailer and get money carrying patrons fired up.<br /><br />As a Batman fan, I'm not sure if I'm disappointed that I know that there is no more future to Nolan's Batman universe, or if the final trip there was less than I expected and I'M GLAD IT'S OVER. \\"Dark Knight\\" managed to be Dark and fun, \\"Dark Knight Rises\\", did not. We waited for most of the movie in \\"Dark Knight Begins\\" to get a taste of Batman and you get to do that again for the grand finale. For a Batman trilogy finale, I wanted Batman and he sat in a hole. \\"Dark Knight Rises\\" leaves you unsatisfied in more ways than one.so underused.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was frustrating and addicting all at the same time! I read the entire book in one day and stayed up until the morning to finish the book because I just could not put it down! I have to give the author a two thumbs up for creating such CRAZY and LOVABLE characters. I cant wait until the second book Walking Disaster... I will be counting down the days!
9626348666|2.0|...when she listened to this on a car trip.<br /><br />I know, it's a classic, important book. It's well-written, and the narrator does a beautiful job. But I made the mistake of listening to this in my car on a long trip, and had to pull over several times because it kept putting me to sleep. I also had to keep restarting the CDs to figure out who the characters were, and never did understand why some of them were there at all.<br /><br />And whatever happened to the reddish-brown stocking?
B00633W614|5.0|I am a READER. Voracious, insatiable, a lifelong reader. At the age of eight I read every fairy tale book in our public library. The books were mostly a comprehensive set, books three inches thick, in small type. My summer vacation was spent under the spell of Scherehezade, learning the meanings of such terms as \\"grand vizir\\" and joining the adventures of youths \\"off to seek their fortunes\\". The rest of my nearly sixty five years have been spent exploring every genre of fiction.<br /><br />Jeffery Archer is among my top five favorite contemporary authors. I particularly love his short stories, and have read every one he has written. His novels are totally engrossing, woe be unto the one who rings my phone or doorbell while I am in the middle of one<br /><br />I read The Sins of the Father in three days, mostly due to the fact that my young granddaughters were visiting and I had limited quiet time. I have just finished it and I am quite angry with my former \\"friend\\", Mr. Archer! I have experienced cliffhangers before, however, this one is totally unforgiveable. If only I hadn't read this book until the next was available!!! These characters are now a part of my family. How can I wait to discover their fate when it is so close to being revealed?<br /><br />Who Shot J.R. had nothing on this one. I will be thinking of you, Jeffrey Archer, and wishing you good speed in the writing of the third volume of the Clifton Chronicles. I know when I have my answer I will forgive you, but just now you have frustrated me.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|BATMAN in blueray is absolutely astounishing. You must have this action packed Batman movie to your collection. My son loves it and got glued to the TV when watching this movie. Great acting from a well diserved actor. Too bad he is not with us anymore (RIP Heath Ledger).
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun and addictive! slow at first but it gets better the longer you play! very happy I downloaded this app
B007SGM084|5.0|I totally enjoyed this erotic fiction!!  I will miss all the characters in these books-  After reading all<br />three a person just wants to know what happens next.  It was a very nice change from all the other types<br />of books that are out their for our reading enjoyment.  I hope this author continues to write such wonderful<br />and enjoyable books as these three were!  A very refreshing read I must say
B007BZM30M|5.0|Snap, Crackel POP!  it's HOT!  Lovin it. If you gonna Pop you may as well send it to the top of the charts!<br />This is definately a number one hit!  It actually is 5 months old according to the release date.  Everybody is singing it..............So Call Me Maybe---
0061711292|2.0|Miss Brodie is not at all like the other teachers.  She teaches her students by telling them stories about her life and travels and taking them to art museums and concerts and the like.  This sounds all well and good and it could have been, but there was much more to Miss Brodie than this.  She hand picks six of her students that she basically considers \\"hers\\" and trusts her control over them so completely that she confides in them even about her love life.  When all is said and done, one of her girls finally betrays her (not a spoiler, we are told at the beginning).<br /><br />I'm sorry, but this story just gave me the creeps.  It's kind of scary to think that teachers can have this kind of power.  That they can take these young, impressionable minds and basically control and use them to their benefit.  I'm not naive.  I know it can happen and parents can do the same thing.  I guess it just hit me a little harder having two little girls in elementary school.  I should probably rate the book higher because it was well written and the story was interesting, but thanks to the creep factor, I just can't.
B0010DGYJW|5.0|This is a classic metal album which contains great ballads. It is a great story that is implanted into a musical scenery. Lawless delivers his best theatrical musical composition better than any other metal masterminds has done over the last 30 years.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have always liked this game on Apple and I am happy that it is on Kindle now. I have had no problems with it and now I don't have to share my brothers Ipad to play it. Definatley one of my favorite Kindle games!
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I just finished another book with about 50 shades of dysfunctional characters, and I have to say there are a lot of similarities in this book.  Not every college student is healthy, and this story is about some who are definietely not healthy, but learn to love despite that fact.  I enjoyed the story!  It was dark, the characters weren't perfect, but I connected with them, and I wanted them to be happy and have the fairy tale ending.  I think if I had read this book before the other one mentioned above, I wouldn't have been so accepting of Travis' anger issues, but unfortunately, there are dysfunctional kids out there who were dealt a bad hand in life.  Though this wasn't remotely like my college years, I think sadly the drinking, smoking and promiscuity probably is as prevalent as the book describes.<br /><br />3.5 stars.  I didn't take away for editing  this time (I must be getting used to filling in blanks, and substituting words), but I couldn't give it 4 stars because I just felt there could have been more there.  I would have liked to see Abby encourage Travis to work harder to control his anger, and the ending was a bit too over the top.<br /><br />Would I recommend this to my teenagers to read? Heavens no!<br />Would I recommend it to a friend? Yes, if they wanted to read a fairly predictable dark fairy tale romance.<br />Would I read this author again? Yes.  The story was engaging, and the characters unique and likeable.  (Loved Finch!)
B000002IV8|4.0|Even though this album does not have the fastesy thrash songs Overkill have previously come out with, this album have great riffs and good drums. Blitz masters the vocals and settles well for this album.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The delivery was fast. There's really nothing else I have to add. Ladies, you will love this book. Fellas, get this book for your ladies and you'll be in for a happy surprise!
031620157X|5.0|\\"It doesn't matter how greatly you've been hurt or how much you're hurting, it's what you do with the pain that counts. You could cry for years, and rightfully so, or you could choose to learn and grow from it. Take it from me: I spent years hiding in a hole, afraid to come out because of what people would think of me. But one day I decided to leave, and I ended up saving lives!\\"<br /><br />\\"The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell\\" is the most incredible book I've read since \\"The Never-ending Story\\", and that was the very first book I read when I was little. I've read plenty of books in between, and many of them I truly loved and treasured, but when I read The Land of Stories a feeling came back that I didn't think I could still feel, being a twenty-something and all.<br /><br />I was feeling young again. Not that feeling of being young, where you are feeling overly excited about something like when it was Christmas. But truly young, back at the age when you lived in the fairy tale world. When you were begging everyone at your house to read to you, or when you learned reading before you even went to school only because you wanted to read all those wonderful stories all by yourself.<br /><br />When you wanted to have all those characters for yourself and imagined what their \\"happily ever after\\" was actually like. You imagined what happened to all the princes and princesses after they got married? What happened to that kingdom after it woke up from 100 years of sleep? What could have possibly made the Evil Queen so evil?<br /><br />I'm a twenty-something now, and I haven't really thought much about fairy tales lately. Things happen when you grow up and you stop believing in them, or stop seeing them in the way you did back when you were little. Discovering them again thanks to Chris Colfer was one of the best things that could have ever happened, and I could almost hate myself for forgetting how much fairy tales helped me grow and be the person I am today.<br /><br />\\"'Conner,' Alex whispered close to him. 'Look around this place! It's like we're having our  own Lucy and Mr. Tumnus moment!'<br />Connor looked around and saw what she meant. 'If he offers us Turkish delight, I don't care what you say: We're getting out of here.'\\"<br /><br />And Chris didn't just help me remember about fairy tales. He also painted a wonderful picture of \\"The Land of Stories\\" of the big \\"what happened after happily ever after\\" question that every passionate reader of fairy tales carries in their heart since they were a child.<br /><br />His imagination of the kingdoms and the land, how they fit together and what all of the fairy tale characters have grown into over the years is more beautiful then anything I could have ever imagined as a child and the twins Conner and Alex (who get lost in the fairy tale world) are just the cherry on top of it all. All of the characters are really magnificent and even if you never imagined them to be like Chris has written them, you will have an unforgettable time travelling through the world of Chris' imagination.<br /><br />You know some books you read in one night, because they are so intense, interesting or funny, you can't put them down. It took me a little over a week to finish \\"The Land of Stories\\", not because it wasn't intense, interesting or funny, it is all of those things. But because I didn't want the book to end.<br /><br />I didn't want to say goodbye to Alex and Conner. I wanted to stay on the journey with them, meet more interesting people, see more of the wonderful Land of Stories. After a couple of chapters I always felt like I had to give my head a little time to digest what I had just read; walk through it again in my imagination; make up my own little picture of the kingdoms, the landscape, the people, remember how my younger self sometimes imagined all of these things to be.<br /><br />I know, some might not be as passionate about this book as I am, but that's probably because they never experienced fairy tales the way I did when I was little.<br />All I can say to \\"The Land of Stories\\" is: Thank you Chris Colfer, for bringing fairy tales back into a world and into a generation that truly needs them. Thank you for letting us wander around your imagination.<br /><br />I hope everyone picks up this book, not because I said so or because it's the \\"Chris Colfer\\", but because you loved fairy tales as a kid. Because you know the characters like Snow White and the Prince Charmings and Cinderella...., because you miss them and want to have another adventure with them. Even if you are a twenty-something like me.<br /><br />\\"Do you think it was magic?\\"

B000M341QE|1.0|This is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />I was drawn in at first, but the storyline never gelled, and was eventually completely buried in extraneous garbage and ho-hum acting.  The main plot could have been interesting, but none of the details made any sense, and none of the characters came close to being fully developed.<br /><br />- Who IS Costello?  A small-time thug?  A big fish?  A guy trying to crawl out of the ghetto? A psychopath who just likes to partake in ridiculously risky money-making schemes? What other crimes has he committed?  Why does he hate the church?  The film never answers any of these questions.<br /><br />- Who IS Costigan, and what motivates him? He's got an uncle who was bad, and I think his dad was good.  So what?  Why, exactly, did he become a cop? Why do all of the bad guys know his bad uncle, but not him (and vise-versa)?  They know he was in the police academy, yet decide to let him join the gang!? After he's only been in the gang for 4 months, they learn there's a rat.  They have no problem shooting others in the head in cold blood, so why don't they do that to Costigan?  They don't just fail to kill him, we find out later that he is inexplicably the Costello's MOST TRUSTED!?!  Huh?<br /><br />- Why does Sullivan risk his entire life and career for Costello?  Because he bought him groceries once? Why do we care that he was an altar boy?  What was his family life like?  Why does he enjoy lying so much? Why does he show no emotion ever - is it part of the character or just bad acting?<br /><br />- Why is everybody else so one dimensional?  The weak, weak girlfriend caught up in a complicated subplot, who eventually learns the deep secret at the heart of the movie and does NOTHING about it. The token black cop from Costigan's police academy class who speaks exactly ONE line to set up that credential. The Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen characters with zero depth - both actors phoning in their performances. The other gang members who have almost no discernible personality.<br /><br />- Why are the state cops running a high-budget, low manpower sting out of the city police station with no interaction with the city cops?<br /><br />- Are we really supposed to believe that an erased file on the computer system can't be recovered and is really the ONLY evidence that Costigan is an undercover cop?  REALLY?<br /><br />Added to all this are the thousand subplots that go NOWHERE.<br />- The baby.<br />- The envelope given to the girlfriend, never to be seen again.<br />- The very important, but never shown, FBI-informant angle.<br />- The relationship never explained between the Sheen and Wahlberg characters.<br />- The unexplained attraction the girlfriend has for violent men with psychological problems.<br />- The innumerable undercover people on both sides that we only find out about AFTER their deaths, which we don't care about because we hardly noticed them when they were alive.<br />- How and why did Costigan record all his conversations?<br />- Is the oft hinted at pederasty directly related to any of the characters?<br /><br />Not since \\"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\\" have I been as let down by a movie.  Like that movie, none of the characters in \\"The Departed\\" have any motivation or redeeming qualities.  None of their actions or reactions makes any sense.  It's OBVIOUS who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, but I didn't like or hate ANY of the characters. The strongest feeling I had toward them all was WHO CARES?<br /><br />I need to stop thinking about this movie.  The more I think about it, the dumber it seems, and the angrier I become for having wasted time watching it.  The fact that it gets rave reviews simply adds to the anger and confusion.members who have almost no discernible personality.<br /><br />- Why are the state cops running a high-budget, low manpower sting out of the city police station with no interaction with the city cops?<br /><br />- Are we really supposed to believe that an erased file on the computer system can't be recovered and is really the ONLY evidence that Costigan is an undercover cop?  REALLY?<br /><br />Added to all this are the thousand subplots that go NOWHERE.<br />- The baby.<br />- The envelope given to the girlfriend, never to be seen again.<br />- The very important, but never shown, FBI-informant angle.<br />- The relationship never explained between the Sheen and Wahlberg characters.<br />- The unexplained attraction the girlfriend has for violent men with psychological problems.<br />- The innumerable undercover people on both sides that we only find out about AFTER their deaths, which we don't care about because we hardly noticed them when they were alive.<br />- How and why did Costigan record all his conversations?<br />- Is the oft hinted at pederasty directly related to any of the characters?<br /><br />Not since \\"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\\" have I been as let down by a movie.  Like that movie, none of the characters in \\"The Departed\\" have any motivation or redeeming qualities.  None of their actions or reactions makes any sense.  It's OBVIOUS who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, but I didn't like or hate ANY of the characters. The strongest feeling I had toward them all was WHO CARES?<br /><br />I need to stop thinking about this movie.  The more I think about it, the dumber it seems, and the angrier I become for having wasted time watching it.  The fact that it gets rave reviews simply adds to the anger and confusion.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love these kind of games.. plus use to play this is grade school so cool please be my friend.... not sure what else to say but I wish we didn't have to wait to get more enrgy
B0086700CM|3.0|kindle fire - the game was good when I first started, but I uninstalled. it lags and causes you to run off the path and die despite swiping for the turns. I really didn't see the point in playing if I couldn't get anywhere. just glad i didn't pay for it.
B008MBXFEM|2.0|These tracks worked awesomely in the movie--the only reason I bought this album right after seeing the movie.<br /><br />But I'm reviewing a music album here, not a DVD. By themselves, these tracks are just redundant :) they should've released the album with just one or two tracks. Long notes and rhythmic patterns are pretty much the theme (if there's any at all).
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this daily to keep an eye on my battery. I have it set on my main screen so just a quick glance lets me know how my battery is doing. I also use it on my aneroid phone.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|This app doesn't seem to do anything but crash on my GSM Gnex.  Just running pure JB, no custom roms or anything special... haven't managed to load a single page.  Very disappointing.  :-(
1591795230|1.0|You are not \\"unleashing the power of consciousness, matter and miracles\\"...<br /><br />you are taking a post grad biology course.  3 DISCS ABOUT evolution, chromosomes, cells, energy, matter - truly a science class on what comprises humans.<br /><br />Way too scientific with almost ZERO instruction on using the mind and consciousness.  Informative SCIENTIFIC information but a very misleading title - nothing applicable to everyday life nor does it even attempt to teach you HOW TO practice or apply anything.  Just hours and hours of scholastics.<br /><br />Deeply disappointing.
0470449756|5.0|The content of the book is great, very good explanations and very good practice exercises. The methodology is great too.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I really liked this movie. Without giving away the premise, for those who haven't seen it yet, the Butterfly Effect could be active in our own lives, but we're not even aware of it (until you see the movie). Any choice we make at any time in our lives may have a profound effect on our future. I especially liked the  Infinifilm Edition that showed the many different ways the movie could have ended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I started to read this book I thought is was not written very well.  Very high schoolish if I must.  However, once I read a few chapters, I just couldn't put the book down.  Of course it was too hot, hot hot!  But isn't that what the book was supposed to be about, a Dom and a Sum.  Will be reading the next two.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is AWSOME u should gst this game i play this game 24/7 yall should get this game :) put if kinda harrd but still its good
B005MVF65G|5.0|Excellent packaging and prompt shipping.  The product arrived as described almost immediately after placing my order.  Because of the low price I was worried that I was possibly going to receive something other than what I expected (a documentary, or 'making of' disc with the same name), but the movie arrived in its original packaging.  Definitely very satisfied and would purchase from again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun and relaxing without being too frustrating to enjoy the challenges. we have both games and have yet to regret the reasonable prices we have paid. thx 4 the fun!!! :)
0345803493|5.0|The book arrived on time and in great conditions<br />I like this book better than the first<br />Now off to read the 3rd book!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so asome I blunt it _by . I love it . I got  it for free.that is my asome reveiw
B000K4X5XA|3.0|Though a bit corny at times, this movie really holds up well. Great cast and script, classic John Williams score and innovative special effects. Even with the barrage of great superhero movies that have come out over the past decade, 34-year-old \\"Superman: The Movie\\" remains one of the best.<br /><br />As far as this Blu-Ray is concerned, however, I'm not very impressed. Compared to VHS and 90's television broadcasts, this offers a lot of improvements. Most notably would be the color corrections on \\"flying\\" shots, but these updates were already available on DVD. In this edition there is grain across the board, and the colors and contrast look highly compressed, as if they were intended for a medium-bandwidth broadcast. If you're watching on a projector like reviewer \\"Achilles\\", you might not notice the contrast issues, but anyone with a recent LCD or Plasma television is going to see grey blocks where there should be black as well as narrow color bands. The audio quality is also disappointing, especially with dialogue. Fuzzy and undefined, lacking the clarity of other 70's film transfers.<br /><br />Movie: 9/10<br />Video: 7/10<br />Audio: 7/10<br /><br />If you don't already have a DVD version of this film, I'd say go ahead and get this Blu-Ray. If you DO already have a previous edition, I'd hold off: \\"Man of Steel\\" is coming out in June of 2013, which means you can bet a MUCH better quality release of the 1978 film will be appearing soon, probably early 2013.
0143119680|5.0|I give this book 2 thumbs up.  I just finished reading her second book in this series too.  I thought they were both great reads.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun and not complex. A good program to stimulate your noodle. Some really make you think. Not so complex that you cant watch Tv and play at the same time.
B00843TZJ2|5.0|The last time I saw CSN live was in St. Louis, June 2009. They didn't get along on stage and the  tension between them was palpable. That being said, I was dubious about what I would find on this DVD/CD combo set. Not only was I pleasantly surprised, I was blown away by the stellar delivery from the infamous trio. Stills in particular is over the top in his performance. He looked like he was having a blast. And those guitar riffs...incredible! Crosby and Nash are equally as talented. All three men really poured their hearts into the concert that night. Yeah, they're older. But if you're a fan of CSN then so are you. I'm sure the Lady Gaga crowd would guess Crosby, Stills, and Nash is the name of some law firm! And on a personal note, I'm glad that they're getting along once again. Whatever hurts have passed between them have seemingly healed over. They compliment each other generously on stage and in the interview portion of the DVD. Nice to see that happen. Anyway, drop the 17 bucks and buy this set. It's incredible. You won't be disappointed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is great but energy runs out quick.<br />you have to spend alotto keep energy till you are level. 8 theneverything gets better. Overall it isgteat though

0345803485|3.0|Finished book 3 this morning from the grey series. Sad it is over. However here would be a good ending:<br />Anastasia wakes from what she thinks was an awful blackmail and kidknapping fiasco. \\"Is mia ok? Where is jack? Why do i feel ok, jack kicked me so hard. I should be in pain. And christian, where is christian?\\" As her eyes come into focus she sees her beautiful husband looking down at her - \\"Miss Steele, are you all right miss steele?\\" But he isnt her husband, he is THE Christian Grey and she has just woken from being knocked out from clumsily stumbling into his office to do this crazy interview for kate. \\"Miss Steele, miss Steele, are you hurt? I would feel terrible if you were hurt because of me...\\"<br />And Anastasia upon waking from the craziest, most amazingly wild dream can only respond, \\"No Christian, i know you would never hurt me...\\"<br /> i mean if it was all a dream  then maybe some of the redundancies could be thought of as \\"stream of conciousness/unconciousness\\" instead of just bad writing. And the reader wouldnt have to explain away such unrealistic parts like multimillionare at 26 and a guy coming 4 times in one hour : ))))

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great read! I picked this book up in response to my students who have finished the series. While I enjoyed the literary ride, I don't think it is suitable for kids wide stream. The book is very well written but depending on the imagination of the child, the death and killing may be too much. Know your kid, that's my advice. There are so many other books available that don't have the foundation of survival that this one offers.
B0025W68JI|5.0|It's John Williams. 'Nuff Said. Great Composer, great music, great themes. What a combo. I only have to say more because Amazon requires more words. If you can't hear the name John Williams, and know it is really good, you have been sleeping under a rock for the last century.
B008DM4OTA|3.0|My 4-year-old neice really enjoyed playing this game.  The graphics are adorable (even though the sound the germs make is a little unsettling).  Unfortunately, after a fairly short period of time both the patients and the diagnoses begin repeating and my niece lost interest pretty quickly.

B007XH6BPG|5.0|Yes' Chris Squire  and Steve Hackett, former Genesis guitarist, have become Squackett.  \\"A Life Within A Day\\" is the result of  their collaborations over the past couple of years in between both musicians' tour schedules.<br /><br />The CD starts off with the classic big sound of progressive rock in the title track.  Some might immediately compare the sound to GTR, but these power chords and rhythms speak for themselves.<br /><br />Chris Squire has earned his reputation as a sterling bassist.  A listener can find themselves falling into his engaging, addictive bass lines.  They don't distract, but add so much to the melody  He and Hackett provide lush, layered lead vocals and harmonies to the mix.<br /><br />Hackett's guitar work outs are an aural treat that fill out the songs beautifully.  Whatever atmosphere the song employs, Hackett's guitar work seems to grow organically out of the melody.<br /><br />\\"Tall Ships\\" chugs along with a walking, funky bass bottom over a light, bouncy tune.  It's got a great groove with  in-the-pocket drumming from Jeremy Stacy and lead vocals from Squire.<br /><br />Both Squire and Hackett like powerful rhythms and this CD has plenty of that.<br />The drumming by Jeremy Stacy never overwhelms the music, but keeps the beat solid through some powerful rhythms.  Stacy also adds a nice, light touch to the more airy melodies.<br /><br />Roger King adds just the right balance of keyboards to songs.  The man blends in his sound with whatever the music requires.  He also engineered and produce the album.<br /><br />The songs feature some wonderful high-energy Hackett solos.<br /><br />Squire begins \\"Stormchaser\\" with a chunky, bass line full of funk and even takes a turn with a bass solo.<br /><br />They offer an island-flavored change of pace with, \\"Can't Stop the Rain.\\"  Songs like \\"Divided Self\\" and \\"Sea Of Smiles\\" are catchy tunes with strong hooks.  It becomes hard not to sing along to the indelible choruses here.  The latter track is now available as a download on itunes.<br /><br />There are no tricky time changes to throw the listener off; just some, good  music to tap your toe to.<br /><br />The CD ends with \\"A Perfect Love Song\\" with a chorus that continues to swim around in your head long after the song has ended.<br /><br />Overall, this is a exceptional collections of songs from two of rock's best artists.  You don't have to be a progressive-rock fan to like this.  You just have to like good music.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game just as much as my daughter does! We play together everyday and sometimes three or four times a day!
B00160FBWK|5.0|I have seen this movie several times over the years and I wanted a copy for my self. It is one of those movies I can watch over and over again as years go by. I made a mistake of ordering the video to watch on my laptop. What I wanted was a DVD copy. Immediately after ordering it I realized my mistake and tried to cancel the order. I found it impossible to do so. So I bit the bullet and paid the $9.95 for the instant video and did not watch it. I have purchased items from Amazon for years and found the website very user friendly but this was ridiculous. It should be easy to cancel an order if an honest mistake is made. I am greatly disappointed in Amazon with it's great number of tools for selling and ordering to not have a cancellation tool that can be used.I think it is a cheap trick and I will be extra careful when selling or ordering in the future. Looking forward to seeing a change on this in the future.
B001S86J1C|5.0|An unusually sprawling, giddy production from John Hughes's most fruitful period as a director. Where his preceding efforts like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles were rich, moody tales set almost unanimously in small high schools, Ferris is a plucky, enthusiastic fantasy that breaks free from the confines of an institutional setting and celebrates life outside the walls. Matthew Broderick brings the brash, popular title character to life with an energy that's so infectious it's easy to overlook a few ridiculous twists and turns, and the plot takes full advantage, pushing the envelope as far as it can feasibly get away with. Great comedic timing, an astoundingly deep, versatile cast of characters and the rocketing pace of an out-of-control avalanche help make this a timeless comedy that's aged extremely gracefully. The only sticking point, really, is the totally '80s wardrobe.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is amazing and is truly worth what it's priced. I've only played for to days and now its the only game I play. If your trying to save up for minecraft stop. this game is far better.
0345803507|5.0|After reading these reviews and realize I am not the only wanting more, makes me hopeful there will be another one soon! LOL The whole time I read this book I shook my head thinking good god put this filth, horribly written smut down!! I read all 3 books within a week, found my self reading at every chance, even if two pages at a time! Definitely left wanting more! After reading the part from Christians point of view, I would love to read all the books from his point of view! She also left it where she could pick up and from there... ? I sure do hope so! Great books :)
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I didn't even try this game on my kindle as it set off my antivirus program as an adware security threat. be warned...
B004LWZWGK|5.0|A perfect fit alongside Christopher Nolan's preceding Batman films, with no single chapter standing clearly above the others. Where The Dark Knight played up the conundrum of Bruce Wayne as a public mask for Batman, this installment flips the script and focuses more intently on a well-rounded civilian identity at the expense of Wayne's more notorious alter-ego. That shifted focus fits snugly alongside the presence of a more grounded, topical-tinged foil in Bane, whose grand plans aren't all that different from those of his two predecessors, but reverberate in the modern social atmosphere. The strict black-and-white nature of the very real debate at the core of Bane's scheme is my sole disappointment, really, as the shades of gray I so appreciated in the first two episodes have been subtly brushed aside. Tom Hardy performs admirably in full pantomime as the big bad, with Anne Hathaway playing a fine Catwoman (though the role seems inessential for the majority of the film), but it's Michael Caine who steals the show in a very brief, emotional final turn as Wayne's infamous butler Alfred. Although he enjoys only five minutes of screen time, when the curtain falls it's his vivid performance you'll most remember. A brilliant, daring, explosive climax that expertly puts the lid on one of modern film's finest action/adventure trilogies, it surprised and impressed me from the very first word.
0307716511|4.0|The novel Sister is a mystery with many twists and turns that keep the reader guessing what the truth actually is from page to page. The story takes place in London, where Beatrice, called Bee, is searching for her missing pregnant sister, Tess. Tess is a flighty, artist type, and at first everyone believes she is off somewhere, but eventually a more sinister and dark story emerges.<br />The police find Tess's body in an abandoned lavatory and rule her death a suicide. Athough Bee insists that her sisteer would not commit suicide, that she must have been murdered, the police tell her there is nothing else they can do.<br />The author has constructed a very interesting tale which is hard to pin downs from one moment to the next. What is most fascinating here is Bee, who completely transforms throughout the story. At the beginning, Bee is living in Manhattan with her fianc&eacute;e, Todd. Right from the start, we feel that Bee is not in the relationship she should be in,  that she is constrained mostly by her own doing, from love and passion and excitement.<br />Bee admits that she is lousy at her relationships with her family back in England; her parents divorced when she was young, after the death of Tess and Bee's brother from Cystic Fibrosis. Bee has become closed off from emotion, but her relationship with Tess is a strong one. Bee comes to realize that she is a lousy sister, daughter, fianc&eacute;e and friend, but she changes.<br />While this story is a tale of suspense, it also a study of love and family relationships, how we relate to others and how grief and sadness shape who we become and how we interact with the world.<br />Sister has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing throughout the entire story which is what makes it such a good read. I would recommend this story to all readers.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Such a good book. I had recently put my dog down because of his old age and other complications he was having, so I felt like I could really relate. Definitely would recommend for any dog lover out there.

B008MEM24S|4.0|after reading all these reviews I wanted to buy it but since it wasn't free my mom said no and some reviews say yay and some say boo but I say it doesn't sound so good because of the reviews and I wont get it now do what YOU want to do
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very hard to put down,  you can play for hours and not even realize it.  I love passing levels and unlocking new levels.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am very bad at math and was in need of a calculator.  This was the first one on the list so I tried it.  It is great.  As soon as you tap on it, it gives you instructions on how to use it.  It has a couple of extra editions that really com in handy.  I recogmend this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is fun...well I gotta do a 20 word minimum Soo I'm gonna try and think of some good stuff to say..ummmm well you can do a review like this and get points to get more games..and I guess that's cool..well I'm done now so bye and get this app its cool..wow its cold in here..do you think this is 20 words?? I hope so..bye
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I don't care what some of the reviews out there say. When you look at today's music, a lot of it is pop. Some is pop-rock, but mainly pop. However, this album is Rock with a little bit of pop in it. This album has drive in the songs and Avril shows us that she can sing without the use of auto-tune and other similar effects. Yes, this was made in 2004, almost a decade ago, but it was still around that time that artists began using stuff like that. But anyway: Avril's music here is very strong, has meaning, and is legit. Legit meaning that it's not all electronic (in fact, this album is all real instruments; there's no electronic influence in it that I can hear. I listen to lots of rock and metal and I can play some of this album's heavier songs with those rock/metal songs and it's not out of place.<br /><br />The music:<br /><br />1. \\"Take Me Away\\"- This song starts off the album right. It starts off with a simple little guitar part and then she comes in and starts singing. It just progressively gets heavier and builds into the chorus. I like her voice. It sounds very powerful and inspired and the heaviness doesn't sound forced at all either. It also has a certain degree of darkness to it that makes it very interesting to listen to. The song is very strong and I love listening to it very much.<br /><br />2. \\"Together\\"- This one is an interesting and unique song. I like the piano part in it and while she's singing about relationships and stuff that lots of pop singer sing about, this doesn't sound cliche and \\"written for the sake of writing it\\". This sounds good! While it's a subject we hear songs about daily, it's done in a way that probably can't be duplicated. Once again, her voice is strong here and she's created another song I've listened to numerous times.<br /><br />3. \\"Don't Tell Me\\"- This one follows in the footsteps of the previous song. This one is more of a power ballad than the previous one, but it again follows the same type of typical subject matter delivered in a unique way that only she can pull off. That's something I truly love about listening to her music: It's gonna be different than what other people are doing. Very nice song.<br /><br />4. \\"He Wasn't\\"- I'm actually not too big a fan of this song. It's not bad, but I don't really like it. It's catchy, yes. But this one has a punk type vibe to it. I'm not calling it a punk song, but I'm not gonna say that there's no hints of it in here either. I'm just not a fan of that style is all. If I was, I'd probably like this song more. And again, yes, the lyrics deal with typical pop song-type subjects, but it's delivered in a unique way.<br /><br />5. \\"How Does it Feel\\"- This one is a soft song. It's a very relaxing song. This song is one of the stronger points of the album even if it is softer. The lyrics may seem a little cliche at first, but after a few listens, they become a bit more meaningful. Great song!<br /><br />6. \\"My Happy Ending\\"- This one is more pop-rock. This one is a good song, but this one is one of the songs on here where the pop influence comes across as stronger than the rock influence. Even so, though, it's still a pretty good tune. Her vocal performance still comes off great and the music behind her is still better than your average pop artists nowadays. And the drums sound surprisingly cool! I actually like the beat that the drummer is playing on here (A rarity in today's music, let alone pop music in general. As a drummer, this is a very rare thing to come across). Good song!<br /><br />7. \\"Nobody's Home\\"- This one is one of my favorite songs on the album. I like the softer vibe of the song, but yet, the song has a darker sound to it and I find this unique. I can't really describe this song very well because it's just something so interesting! It's beautiful! Avril is definitely a talented artist. The vocal performance on here is phenomenal! The emotion is just so there! I love this song!<br /><br />8. \\"Forgotten\\"- This one follows the previous track in the darker sound. This one is heavier and just as intense as the opener and the previous song. I feel the anger/sadness in her voice when I hear the previous song and this one. And the music while it is simple pop chord progressions, has a complexity to it that adds a level of intensity to it. Good song.<br /><br />9. \\"Who Knows\\"- I actually am not too big of a fan of this song. This song is pretty upbeat and I usually like upbeat songs...but this one interrupts the anger and intensity of the previous two songs and this one actually has weaker lyrics in my honest opinion. I mean, if this song came on either a different album or was in a different place, I think I would like it a lot better, but nope. I just feel that it lacks the intensity of the preceding songs and it just fails to impress me for that reason.<br /><br />10. \\"Fall to Pieces\\"- The opening to this one sounds sad again and it's a softer rock song in the verses. This one is just a simple little rock-love song. This one is still good and has a certain level of originality to it, but isn't the most unique way lyrics like this could've been delivered. I like the song though. It's got the emotional intensity of the better songs here, but the pop influence is a little stronger in this one too. But this one definitely puts the album back in the right direction with the emotional intensity. Good song.<br /><br />11. \\"Freak Out\\"- This is a nice pop-rock song. The emotional intensity still flows through this song very well, yet it is more on the positive side too. This one strikes a good balance between the two vibes. I do like this one. Her voice is still strong, the music is still going great on this album, and the chorus is pretty catchy on this one.<br /><br />12. \\"Slipped Away\\"- This song starts off sounding sad and dark, but the chorus sounds a little more upbeat. This one is a nice closer to a great album. It's just a nice little tune dealing with, again, stuff that's usually cliche and overdone/not done well. This one is a pretty good song, and I like it. Avril really knew what she was doing when she made this album.<br /><br />Note: As a musician this album doesn't off much technical things, however: The musicianship on this album is the BEST I've heard on a solo artist's album at this point in time. The drums have beats that aren't too complicated for the pop vibe in the songs, but they also have the drive in them to make me want to air drum along to some of the songs. The guitars have some cool stuff, but it's mainly chords. She's got a good amount of talent and she has writing credit on all the tracks. Yes, she collaborates with people, however, on most of the songs, she collaborated with only one other person and most times that other person is a musician and not a producer.<br /><br />Verdict: If you want pop music with some edge to it, this may or may not be your album depending on how much edge you want. If you want metal, this isn't what you'll get. If you want some good rock music, this is definitely your album. If you don't care what kind of music it is as long as it contains emotion and feelings, then GET IT! This was my first album from her and certainly not my last.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|I love the package and all the extras, it has a great picture and sound.

B00843TZJ2|5.0|CSN has not exactly flooded the market with new releases - the latest release of the 3 together being the CSNY release of \\"Deja Vu Live\\" which was extremely Neilocentric, to say the least. So for all fans this is a very welcome occasion to hear an official, brilliantly recorded concert.<br /><br />And thankfuly they deliver a profound evening, mixing the old classics with newer songs, including Graham Nash's controversial and poignant tribute to Bradley Manning \\"Almost Gone\\". And diving deep into their impressive back catalogue, specially Stephen Stills who come up with the rarely performed \\"As I Come Of Age\\" and \\"So Begins The Task\\" (both played at the CSNY 1970 tour). Especially the first is truly magic, providing one of the moments of transcendent (vocal) beauty that is unique for this trio.<br /><br />As for the backingband it's almost the same as on the [[ASIN:B005I4HNTY Crosby-Nash: In Concert]] with the addition of Todd Caldwell on the Hammond B-3. a band who knows how to respectfully lay back but also can rock with the best of them all anchored by the drumming of Steve DiStanislao (known for his work on David Gilmour's \\"Island\\"-album and following tour).<br /><br />Much malign has been said about Stills's vocal, but actually his singing is better here than it has been in many years really enabling him to hit the higher notes. And his legendary guitarplaying as firery and riveting as ever. Graham Nash - probably one of the all time most underrated songwriters - and David Crosby still delivers their trademark harmony vocals.<br /><br />This band has for whatever reasons always attracted a certain animosity and some decisevely unfair criticism. But they also have a dedicated fan base and this DVD clearly shows the strong bond - and deep rapport - between band and audience.<br /><br />Sure the day when they were the vanguard is long gone, but what they deliver 2012 is very far from nostalgia and cash-in. So their broad and dedicated fan base should delight in this. And for new fans/listeners this might be the perfect introduction to one of the most adventurous and prolific bands ever.is. And for new fans/listeners this might be the perfect introduction to one of the most adventurous and prolific bands ever.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a fun and challenging game. Keeps you thinking. Not for someone who hates puzzles. Great for all ages. Enjoy :)
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Love my Kindle Fire Vibe Case Cover!  Mounts easily & securely.  Unique design allows for viewing at almost any angle on any surface - even a pillow.  Hubby is jealous - my cover is so much better than his fancy iPad cover that only has 2 fixed viewing angles. Purple color is subtle ... not the bright dayglo that appears in the photo.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Love to play this game.  Quick download with no problems.  As you get further into the game it gets more diffucult to fill the bag.  A real challenge.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If period pieces are your \\"cup of tea,\\" this series is just the strong, carefully cultivated, lovelying picked, and perfectly brewed beverage; it satisifies completely.  I can't wait for them to do a season 3!
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are the first books that I've read in a long time that have kept my attention! Not very well written, but the shock and awe of what you are reading keeps my attention! Love it!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This cover is great. It sure lives up to the other reviews I read before purchasing it.  It is lightweight, which is really nice since the Fire is heavier to begin with than my 3rd Generation Kindle (which is now called the Kindle keyboard). The smooth cover is very comfortable to hold for playing or reading and seems very durable so far.  I would recommend it to others.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best CD's I've ever listened to.I didn't know Patti was still around!This is a very soulful/spiritual/melodious work I'm sure most people will like;only wish lyrics for songs were written somewhere in the sleeve.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If there was such thing as a ten star rating that is what the book would be. amazing and wonderful!
B004LROMX4|4.0|When I heard this show was being produced by Steven Spielberg (sp?) I bought this on impulse. I loved War of the Worlds and I saw this being his second stab at it by bringing us a full on tv show. I have to say... I love it!!! I've always been a fan of alien invasion films, so a tv show for it made me jumpy. The acting by everyone is top notch by all means. And the plot development is superb in my opinion. The theme of hope never escapes, ranging to never give up to find lost loved ones. It's all here. To say the least, it's an addicting show with a great cast and great writers. I can only hope that this show can last, seeing as how all great shows get canned. It's been renewed for a third season already, so here's to hoping!<br /><br />With all that being said, the Bul Ray is not so great.No matter how much I changed the sharpness on my tv, the grain would still be there in heavy amounts. But after changing settings for a bit, it wasn't so bad. Some moments grain was non existant, and others it was all too noticable. And the audio is not that great. My tv had to be on 60/100 to hear anything. And then, when there would be an explosion in the show, I couldn't really hear it, but the speakers on my tv would vibrate louder than the soud itself. Anyways, it's an okay transfer. DVD would look and sound the same honestly.<br /><br />All in all, a mediocre transfer but an amazing show!
B007SGM084|2.0|This is not a. Page turner book for me. It moves a little slowly I between the raunchy sex.  Really a sad story about an abused boy and is struggle to be normal. Not sure what the point is, and I'm in the middle of the second book. Of this were. Library book I wouldn't be reading it.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I have only tried the sd card connector but that seems to work fine.  As another reviewer said, if you are going to transfer pictures and videos over from your computer (or someone else's) you need to make sure that everything is a folder called DCIM, and that the file name is 8 characters.  I am using an extra SD card so that I don't have movies hogging room on my iPad yet while traveling I can still put more on to watch (or for my kids to watch).  You cannot watch right from the card but you can download it to the iPad and when you are done watching delete it off to keep the space open.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game it is one of my favorite games.I love the movies and this game is a good way to pass the time. get it:)
B00454U1NS|5.0|The only Pink song I knew really well was \\"Get This Party Started,\\" and then my friend played this CD for me. I immediately went out and bought my own copy of \\"Pink - Greatest Hits... So Far.\\"<br /><br />I would call this feminist pop-rock with a good dance beat. Starting with F*ng Perfect, this music is about women taking care of themselves. Even though the music is dance-floor fast, the tempo upbeat, there are serious messages in the lyrics of every song. \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" is a great song. \\"Never win first place, I don't support the team. I can't take direction, and my socks are never clean... I'm a hazard to myself... I wanna be somebody else..\\"<br /><br />Another great song is \\"Who Knew.\\"  Everyone tells her the guy she loves won't be the kind to stay around, but she refuses to believe them.<br /><br />\\"If someone said three years from now<br />You'd be long gone<br />I'd stand up and punch them out<br />Cause they're all wrong<br />I know better<br />Cause you said forever<br />And ever<br />Who knew...\\"<br /><br />Now, it's three years later, and the guy is long gone.<br /><br />\\"You promised me you'd be around<br />Uh huh<br />That's right<br />I took your words<br />And I believed<br />In everything<br />You said to me<br />Yeah huh<br />That's right...\\"<br /><br />This is a song with a lot of meaning. I don't know much about Pink's personal life, but listening to \\"Who Knew,\\" it's obvious she's been there and done that already, lived the lyrics in her songs, and there's something authentic and deep in this song.<br /><br />I absolutely rate this music 5 stars.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I really like that I can download a lot of songs and videos to my kindle but I can only watch 2 or 3 videos until it force closes its really helpful though for getting music
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I can say is buy this book. The entire trilogy was a great read. One of those \\"OMG I can't put the book down!\\" types. At first you will think what the heck am I reading but surly as the story develops its hard to tear your eyes away from the pages. I loved every bit of it and I hope that the author plans on continuing the saga!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book Two was even better then Book One I loved this read it was Soo juicy and full of BDSM Ana & Christine are just too much to handle ...only thing negative thing the Author over used words ...but it's a must read
B0084IG7KC|1.0|I am deleting this from my pre-order.  This would have been the 2nd time AMAZON has lied to me.  I will never buy UV (ultraviolet) copies.  After the last fiasco, I chatted with customer service and they told me that 'no the description (for my previous purchase, not this one) *ALWAYS* said it was an ultra-violet copy\\".  It didn't from my memory as I do not sign up for them until they will give it to me in iTunes, but assumed it was MY fault and kept that worthless \\"digital copy\\" (which is really a right to play from a remote server -- until they decommission that service).  Unlike iTunes copies that *are* portable without network connections, which is why I want them in the first place.<br /><br />Anyways -- they customer service agent assured me that Hunger Games was NOT an ultra-violet copy.  But I went back and checked today and low-and-behold.... NOW it says 'ultraviolet digital copy'.  AMAZON -- STOP USING THIS TERM!  USE ULTRAVIOLET COPY or some such.  \\"Digital Copy\\" should have some (but assume it does not) legal protection implying that you actually get a local, resident copy.<br /><br />Needless to say, my pre-order is cancelled and I am not buying any more blu-rays without *ITUNES* codes.  I don't want you to force me to buy them from apple as I strongly prefer the physical media -- did you notice above the desire to use without an internet connection???  and even iTunes versions are not as convenient as I would wish when you lack that.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I LOVED this series. i didn't want to read it first because it really wasn't my type of genre but after some convincing from my cousin i bought it on my kindle and from there i was hooked it only took me a week to read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, but it took me long to read Mocking Jay because i didn't want to end. It is a must read its such a page turner and you always want to read more.
B002U6CJCO|5.0|I must say, it is an incredibility good ACTION movie.... Going by JCVD's reputation and personally I love his movies, I decided to watch this one but believe me, Andrei Arlovski stole the show. His punches, jabs and upper cuts just looked very PRO .... The hand to hand combat in the movie is very furious and brutal. Not to mention, JCVD's knife fighting skills showcased in the movie. Reminds me of \\"The Hunted\\" ... Given the budget the movie had, it has been superbly made.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|This movie has never recieved its just due. Often called confusing by casual horror fans, the entire point is missed. The film isn't supposed to make any real sense.<br /><br />Through the eyes of young antagionist Mike (played by young A. Michael Baldwin), the viewers of this film take from it what they will. Was the entire movie a dream shown through the eyes of a young boy who has expierenced loss and anguish or is The Tall Man and his minions real? That's up for the viewer to decide. Even with the plot progressing through the three sequels that followed, we're never quite sure what's real and what isn't. This is what makes the Phantasm series succeed.<br /><br />The dialogue is as times cheesy and the low budget in making this film is quite noticable, but the moody atmosphere, epic musical score and sense or surrealism more than make up for the minuses.<br /><br />Highly recommended from somebody like myself who loves a good horror movie.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|A must read. My one complaint is that book two isnt out. I found it amazing that this book even had an end to it I was so engrossed in it.

B0031SCV46|5.0|This is my first MIDI controller and I have a lot to learn. I know what I want to do but knowing HOW is a challenge. I am plugging along. I've done a lot of reading and watching tutorials on YouTube. I have progressed quite a ways, but I have a long way to go. The Oxygen 49 is doing its job; I just need to learn how to do mine. ;)I've tried several DAWs and each has its quirks. Reaper seems to be the easiest. I'm not spending a ton of money on software with my limited ability. If I can't get the free versions or lower cost versions to do what I want I definitely will not be spending $500+ on software. Wish me luck!

B008JH5FZ6|4.0|\\"Lockout\\" is an entertaining action Sci-Fi movie that is very exiting and actually quite funny. This is very reminiscent of [[ASIN:B003O7I6L6 Escape from New York (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]], and I liked it for many of the same reasons.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: Set in a future where criminals are placed in cryogenic sleep and are warehoused in an orbiting prison. The story follows CIA agent \\"Snow\\", who has been falsely accused of murder but is given the chance to redeem himself by rescuing an important hostage from the prison. The plot is fairly straight forward, with a few twists, and has decent special effects, but this is mainly an action flick with a lot of snarky one liners. The actors are all well cast for their parts and there are actually a few memorable rolls.<br /><br />This goes into my lazy weekend movie list since it is one of those that can be rewatched and enjoyed anytime.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B008KP6ENE|5.0|paper monsters is one of the best games I have ever bought in three months so I sudgest 4 u to get it
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Too basic for an adult reader. This book is so full of cliché that it becomes painfull to read it. I do not understand be buzz about it either
B004KA9VGA|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B008N0GWVA Coffin Girls (Elegantly Undead: Book 1 of the Coffin Girls Witch Vampire Series)]], I love paranormal novels. The first thing that grabbed me was the clever title, the next was the possibility that the mysteries surrounding the paranormal would be revealed in the story. The title is misleading though - it is so much more than a novel about witches. The writer introduces her readers to a variety of supernatural characters with insights into their origins, motives and even angst. Throw in a dash of debonair potential lover and you have a making of a wonderful tale. This book is just that to me, a story told in the way of old...it reminds me of when I used to curl up with thick, paranormal fantasies and delve into a world cleverly created, engagingly told.
0345803485|2.0|I agree with others, surely a teenager wrote this.  I think this book could have been atleast tolerable if we didn't read what she thought, every other sentence. I wish I could word count how many times she said \\"holy xxxx\\".  Editing would have been so useful.  The only part I liked about the book was the very end.  The dude spoke like a cave man.  She was so naive about it all.  I have NOOOOOO idea how this book became the talk of the town.  If you are gonna read it - get it from the library.  It is not worth your hard earned money to waste on such a badly written book.
B008MEM24S|4.0|really cool game lots of levels and interesting challenges but its not much different from where's my water maybe a little more variety
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are fun and helps pass the time. and its free! I like that you have to complete games in order to play more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is great. challenging without being too hard. this game is a great way to kill time and satisfying  to play.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Personally, I was really excited when I saw this available for pre-order even though tvshowsondvd reported they won't be the extended cuts.  And here's why:<br /><br />#1. I already have every episode on DVD (The extended cuts).<br />In my personal opinion, any self respecting Friends fan would ALREADY have every episode on DVD.<br /><br />#2. Even though some of the extended scenes are hilarious, I would also like to see the episodes in original broadcast cuts.<br />I was too young to really pay attention to any show that was not a cartoon, however this was my mother's favorite show.  So, about 6 months after the show ended, I bought my mom \\"Friends: The Complete Tenth Season\\" on DVD as I'd always known her to watch the show.  I watched them with her and I started to love the show and eventually collected the rest of the season on my own.  This means the only versions of episodes I know are the extended versions.  I'd personally like to see them as they originally were, because for me, any factor about a TV series (whether it be cut scenes, original edits, unaired episodes, any history whatsoever) is really cool, so being able to see one of the best shows of all time in the many formats the episodes come in will be awesome!!<br /><br />#3. The Blu-Ray is all that matters.<br />The only thing that really matters about the set is the fact that we finally get to see our six closest friends in high-definition.<br /><br />Overall, even though I already have the extended cuts of every episode on DVD, I will DEFINITELY be buying this set!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game so fun! I finished it. Loved it so much I made my mom buy angry birds Rio. If you did not like it your crazy!
B0082LUEW8|5.0|This is the best album they have done.  No more southern rock, just metal on this one.  I was getting a little worried after Stampede, however this album has renewed my confidence in Hellyeah.  Don't listen to the negative reviews, If you like the first album, you will love this one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game, clear land, build new buildings, heal sick people, hunt animals, plant and harvest crops, tend to and raise farm animals and much more
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Contrary to Amazon's claims this app is not compatible with the Acer A510.  There is no access to playing music from \\"the cloud\\".  I can browse my music and purchase music but forget playing music.<br /><br />Update - Turns out the issue is with the device.  A reboot and the app works fine.  This is also the case with a few other apps that were included on the device.  So I'll be knocking a star of my Acer review.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|in my opinion some of the games are fun but they require way too many points to unlock. takes way too much time to get going
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This poor girl.  My goodness.  And her poor family.  She really is holding her head up high - somehow.<br /><br />You can tell that she still talks like the 11 year old girl that was taken away.  It is a very easy read but difficult at the same time.  I just still cannot believe this happened to somebody and almost makes me lose faith in any sort of God or higher being that this could happen to anyone.  Pretty much we all know everything that happened.  And it is all just terrible.  I couldn't sleep for nights on end after reading this.<br /><br />I would however - like to read what her mother and family and friends went through - her missing, the searches, the long days...  I would also love to see a follow-up with Jaycee in many years to come.  Bless you.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was a reccomended read turned out to b the worst book I ever read.I couldn't even get halfway thru. I wish I wouldn't have wasted time and money!! Don't waste your money.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|(Review of an ARC )<br /><br />  This would be my first time receiving an ARC, and I was beyond excited. A fan of The Forever Girl since I first read it last Feb, like any other fan of any awesome book series.. I was just waiting for the next. Thanks to the novella - I'll survive the wait till the next in the series is out.<br />It's short and you will be able to finish it in one sitting. In book #1, when you meet this mysterious woman Ophelia who helps Sophia, you begin to have this strong urge to know more about her- who is this stranger who comes and help Sophia at the near end, what's her story? And why did she help Sophia?, and grabbing 'Her Sweetest Downfall' is a perfect way to know this lady.<br /><br />The story begins with Ophelia, an ordinary girl working for Lady Karina and then as if discovering  the ouroboros  mark wasn't something to be worried about, she gets kidnapped by a stranger while on her way to deliver a letter for Lady Karina. The stranger introduces himself as Ethan,  a man who would tell her she is no ordinary and what that serpent mark on her really means and what her mission should be, little did he know that his bound SO strong towards his duty would come in conflict with the matter of his heart. I loved how he is strongly determined on his duty/mission and not letting love come in between.  So is Ophelia once her mind is set. Aww.. I don't wanna say more and spoil the fun for other readers. Just GO, grab it !!<br /><br />Her Sweetest Downfall takes you to another side of the world of The Forever Girl... here you get to learn more of the dual-breeds.  It was a pleasure to meet Lenore and Queen Callista again.... I could never get enough of them. That's the thing about Rebecca's writing- you fall in love with EVERY character.  Learning more about the world of the elementals through the eyes of Ophelia, and how each dual-bred has to be what they are, was so fun. I absolutely enjoyed reading Her Sweetest Downfall, it just kept me wanting for more, how I wish it was a full-length one instead of a novella.<br /> And yes, just like the other reviewers mention, if you want to have a glimpse of the world of The Forever Girl and still not ready for a full-length novel, this novella is just the right one for you.<br /><br />All I can say right now is - I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT INSTALLMENT and marking the dates on my calendar.<br />(Note: It is true that I own an ARC, but it doesn't affect my review in any ways. The thoughts are my own)or more, how I wish it was a full-length one instead of a novella.<br /> And yes, just like the other reviewers mention, if you want to have a glimpse of the world of The Forever Girl and still not ready for a full-length novel, this novella is just the right one for you.<br /><br />All I can say right now is - I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT INSTALLMENT and marking the dates on my calendar.<br />(Note: It is true that I own an ARC, but it doesn't affect my review in any ways.

B002M9WW30|5.0|This review will be short and to the point.<br /><br />The first movie is Rocky, an undisputed classic. Nuff said.<br />The second movie (Rocky 2) is also very good, not a classic... but still very good.<br />The third movies (Rocky 3... detecting a pattern here) has Mr. T in it. You'll like or hate the movie based on your opinion of him. I thought he handled the part very well.<br />The fourth movie (Rocky... you get what I'm saying)... Russians. Just Russians. A good message trying to be broadcast. It falls short in the hands of Rocky though.<br />Wait... THERE WAS A FIFTH MOVIE?!?!?<br />The sixth movie (Rocky Balboa) is a look back at the first five basically. I found it to be full of heart and a fitting send off for a beloved character.<br /><br />The transfers from film to Blu Ray are awesome and the Special Features on disc 7 are really informative. If you love Rocky, it's a fitting set all around. :D
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game to pass time with.. I enjoyed it .. I play it st anytime when I'm bored .. my brother also likes the game we have friendly competitions lol
B00005JSGK|5.0|Hatari is one of John Waynes' best non cowboy movie. It is action packed and has a great supporting cast.This movie is hard to find and is rarely shown on TV. It was a great buy.
034580404X|5.0|I was really hesitant about reading these books because I had heard they were racy & graphic.  These were not my normal read but I totally fell in love with the characters in this trilogy.  There are some very detailed sex scenes & yes there is even bondage but it is not the core of the books.  I really enjoyed the fact that it was written through the eyes of the main character Anastasia.  I am truly glad that I purchased these and hope that the author would do a total rewrite of the trilogy through Christian's eyes.  that would be an interesting read.  I really recommend these books.  They are not your typical romance novels but very enjoyable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|hours of fun and building. just gotta get those acorns!graphics are good and the sounds are funny. great addition to the movie.
1908538694|5.0|I love history and this is one book that I didn't have.  I've been taking my time reading it so haven't gotten very far in it.  Very interesting reading.
B00006G8K0|5.0|For me this dvd represents great value. This film is the best rendition of Dracula. The film has wonderful atmosphere, elegance and style and the special effects have dated in a way that makes the film a kind of charming and retrospective pastiche of modern horror films. Excellent. Stewart West.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a really fantastic weather app. Easy to use and very straightforward. I use it every day and absolutely love it.
0465068367|5.0|This book is well written about a terrible incident committed the Imperial Armed Forces.of Japan. The pictures are Very Graphic & if pictures are worth a thousand words than the photos here speak Volumes. It's Japanese soldiers who are shown bayoneting Live People, or cutting their heads off with samauri swords. What about the 2 officers who had a « friendly » competion to see how many heads they could lop off. Who could chop off 100 heads first. It was widly covered by the Japanese press, so you can't tell me it didn't happen. I'm also a little disgusted with some of the veterans interviewed for the book & others as well who claim it's Chinese propaganda & never happened. I guess they'd also tell you the Bataan Death March was US propaganda & never happened. If you are wanting to learn more about ww2 besides the battles this is a good book for you. But beware it's contents in words & pictures are very descriptive & graphic.
B007RI56NY|4.0|I don't like all of their songs but I like most of them, they have an amazing sound and I have been looking for 50 ways to say goodbye because I heard it on the radio and could never find it! So glad I decided to get new music to workout to.
B007ZZKWHY|4.0|Wow this is a ridiculous movie. Nazis who fled to the moon at the end of WW2 come back to conquer the earth. If you like the sound of that then this is the film for you.<br /><br />Good things:<br />Completely ridiculous and over-the-top concept. The actors never wink at the camera and say it's all a joke. It's played completely straight (except for Palin and her aide) and derives its humour from the absurdity of it all.<br />Nazis are so dumb its funny. When they capture a black guy their first thought is to turn him white so that he'll be on their side. And their compulsion to salute at the worst possible times is wunderbar.<br />The graphics. There are some truly awesome space battles here with Nazi zeppelins, giant spaceships, and even the Mir Space Station involved. The design of these vehicles is amazing.<br /><br />Bad things:<br />The script. It just seems to be all over the place. And the opening half hour just isn't funny, at least not once the two Nazis are on earth. The whole subplot with Palin's aide made no sense. What did she think they were that she was giving them help like that? This isn't funny, it's just vague and confusing. It gets better once the Nazis attack but there are still a string of odd moments that just suck.<br />The acting. I know they were on a budget and all so I won't go too hard on them for this, but there was a lot of bad acting in this film. Even some of the leads were just not right. Standouts in this respect are Pres. Palin and her aide. Palin could be fun at times but the actress seems afraid to go all out crazy. Her aide is worse since she's trying to act tough by yelling and it just doesn't work. A lot of this is bad writing but the performance really ruined it. I couldn't stand it when she was on screen. The lead guy is entertaining enough as are the bad guys and a lot of the cheesy acting works. But those two especially just don't.<br />The editing. This really should have been a fast-paced movie. With a concept like this there's no point with a lot of slow dialogue scenes. Which is why those really stand out, especially near the beginning.<br />The graphics. Again, low budget so I understand but some of these shots could have used more work. The cg background shots especially tended to be bad.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think that it is fair to say without any possibility of contradiction that this is the best movie about Space Nazis trying to destroy the earth. Certainly in the top ten. I do think giving it a four is a bit generous though. It deserves something more like a three and a half. The painful Nazis on earth scenes that added nothing to the plot and the inconsistent pacing make this a lot less enjoyable than it should be. Still, it's better than a three so I'll err on the positive side. Entertaining film, go see it.s there's no point with a lot of slow dialogue scenes.

0143035711|5.0|This is fantastic! I think it's the first book written by someone who has flown helicopters in war. My uncle flew  «Slicks» & « dust off» helicopters in Vietnam. He's never talked much about his experiences there. I saw this book & got it in the hope it would give some some insight into what he did. I'm so glad I did! It has helped myself & other members of the family understand him a little better as well as stop some of the questions that anoy him so badly. Thank you so much for writing it. Eventually he read it & has since opened up somewhat about it. He says the book is fantastically accurate in everything it protrays. I think the guys who flew those choppers then & the ones who fly them now are some of the bravest people out there. They keep the ground guys supplied, fly out the wounded, & bring in reinforcements. Without their courage our guys on the ground would be in a world of hurt. Just as the book brings out, they fly in all kinds of weather & situations. I absolutely love this book!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Once I'd started this book I couldn't put it down. I want me a Christian Grey :) Read the whole trilogy in less than a week. Make sure you've got Book 2 ready to go at the end of Book 1!
1439102732|1.0|Prior to the last 2 books Ms. Picoult has written I was a huge fan. Sing You Home had to be the worse book I have ever forced myself to finish. As others have said it was so fairytaleish, then all the political views, I read for pleasure if I want to hear about politics I will listen to the news. Sadly disappointed in this book and will not read anymore by this Author in the future.
B004FEL6GO|3.0|This toy is not for five year olds, unless he has an IQ of 200!  The directions are small and hard to see for the transformations.  I would say 8+!!
B007WA56SC|5.0|Whether you're a long-time fan, a casual fan, or just curious about Kylie Minogue, this CD/DVD is perfect for you. Us long-time fans already have all of these songs, but it's nice to have them in one pretty package and even nicer to have the accompanying music videos. It's a great mix of songs from Kylie's 25 year career, even if it merely skims the surface of her work.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|In the search for a good book to read, I fell prey to the marketing hype before this book was released.  The order placed on Amazon, I decided to read another Stephen King book while I was waiting for the release of \\"11/22/63\\", so I ordered \\"Under the Dome\\" as a time filler and to get me in the mood for \\"11/22/63\\".  Unfortunately, I gave up on \\"Under the Dome\\" about 1/2 way through, because it was too ugly, gruesome, depressing, and too vividly portrayed man's inhumanity to man. \\"11/22/63\\" finally arrived and sat unread on my Kindle as a result of my experience with \\"Under the Dome.\\" When I finally started \\"11/22/63\\", I was carried away by it and could not put it down.  The writing was classically, beautiful Stephen King's writing, with a plot and story line that captured me and would not let go.  After more than a thousand pages, I was still not ready for it to finish. For me, this was a beautiful love story woven around time travel and vivid characters set in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  I believe that this is a book that Stephen King fans and non fans alike will relish.  After all of Stephen King's successes, he certainly doesn't need to prove that he is one of the best story tellers ever to entertain us, but he proved it again with \\"11/22/63'. I do hope he keeps on proving it as long as he can.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this books for the iPad version, so I read them with the kindle app, and the quality is very good. There are somethings that I can't figure out, but I am still getting used to using the app.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is just like pet shop and games like that. I like this much better because you can earn more animals, gold and acorns through a game so you can still achieve goals without buying things with actual money. you can still use actual money to get things quicker if you want. I stopped playing other gamed like this and play just this. sometimes it is very glitchy though.
1595828753|5.0|I was tickled to see these books existed and even more tickled when I got them (and I'm out of college)! It was like reading episodes of Avatar! I read the book the day I got it then turned around and ordered the other two. If you like the show (or your kids do) get them! You'll be happy!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I play this game none stop and play where's water when I'm done playing Where's My Parry and one more thing AWESOME:)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game! Starts out so easy but don't become complacient. Each level gets harder. Addictive game for those with good spacial awareness.,
B005LAIISA|5.0|I don't know what some people have against this movie. i thought that it was better than 2 and 3. don't get me wrong i loved 2 and 3 but this one out beats them. the characters get more loveable each movie. sid was my favorite character. granny bumped him to number two. wanda sykes did a good job brining that chracter to life. and i like the fact that they put a real villian in the film, it made it more exciting even though his goal of stoping our loveable trio was out right dumb, but the actor who voiced him did so well you had no choice to love to dislike him. all in all this was a awesome movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. It's entertaining and not too difficult to play. I love it! It is a blast!

B0086700CM|5.0|it was a great game lots of and very. challengeing always trying to beat your scores!  also a great pass time for kids of all ages and adults too!!!
0307957934|5.0|I won't spoil this book by getting into the last half mechanics.  I do not usually go for page turners and being a technically trained person, the ideas were familiar.  You do not have to totally identify with the main character to try understanding the pressures he come under.  The main character is believable and you are pushing to understand him through the book.<br /><br />I just found this book very engrossing.  A bit scary too as I do a fair amount of investing and am not a trader but not a neophyte either.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book presents a man that every woman wants in a man, plus some. Do you want a man that can cherish you, protect you, love you, be romantic, and be a gift giver? Do you want a man that has enough money to take care of your every need? Are you looking for a man that takes control? Would you want a man that can please you in the bedroom beyond your widest dreams. Most women don't find a man that can do all of that plus more. That is what I saw in this book. The author really understood what a women wants. This book is for everyone. It will test your limits and seduce you. Here's the deal, how much control is too much control for one person to have over another person? I personally wasn't offended at the sexual encounters, it made me think out side of the box and see that submission doesn't mean that you give up!
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in our Stars was in my reading list for books to read for school. Initially, I was NOT at all excited to read this book because it was not something I usually read, and I did not want to read about someone who seems cool and ends up dying with lung cancer. But this book was such a SHOCK to me! It was a quick read for me because I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this book. After finishing the book, I could not stop thinking about it. I told my mom, dad, grammy, EVERYONE that they HAD to read this book. Hazel, in the novel, is not depressed at all having cancer, but is totally cool and real with everyone and who she is. I LOVED Augustus in this book, he made me laugh and cry to the point where I  almost sobbed! I NEVER cried when reading a book, and I'm a REALLY sensitive girl. This book is now one of my favorites, and I want to read more of John Green to see if he can captivate me like the way he did with the characters and this story. I'm SOOOO glad this book was on my reading list or I would have never read this masterpiece! I don't care who you are, but EVERYONE has to read this book! It shows you no matter how bad life can be at times, it's best to strive forward with your head up and a smile! :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The three books were at the very least entertaining , it was one of those books, that I would savory, read slowly, just to save and stretch it, I didn't want it to end.<br />Someof the parts...it a little unrealistic, but, hey, a girl can dream!! When i first started the book, I thought it was going to be for college kids, or just real trashy, but to my surprise, I reconized feeling and expereiences that where similar to my own...  I fell in love with the two main characters, and I can't wait for another book by the author. I really enjoyed the way the two characters loved each other, and their dedication, It almost made me feel there  IS that kind of true love.... but lets face it... It was a novel... Its nice to imagine, and if your a Christian Grey out there.. please email me...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is addictive. I have problems loading sometimes but I love the game.  I hope the keep the updates coming and it sticks around for a while.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I've beaten the game 2 times! it never gets old, I would recommend this to anyone who likes Mario because it's practically the same thing but in my opinion better! there is nothing wrong about it! on an overall review I would say this game is awesome! (;
0307592731|3.0|I found the premise of the book to be interesting, and enjoyed it for the most part, but then felt let down at the end, like I was wanting more how her life played out as a result of this journey, what did she learn that she would use in her life.  The ending just seemed too abrupt to me. I like a start, a middle, and a definite end. I guess we could look forward to Wild II??
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Maybe it's just me, but it feels like this is fairly easy and, as levels progress, doesn't get any harder. I passed through 25 levels in 10 minutes.
B00843TZJM|5.0|I loved the recent Nash/Crosby concert DVD but honestly knowing<br />about the erratic Stills outputs in recent times, I was a bit<br />skeptical about how this new CSN DVD would play out. Having such<br />a deep love for CSN however there was no way that I wasn't going<br />to pre-order this one.<br /><br />After watching the entire concert plus the added interviews feature, I have<br />to say that it exceeded my expectations by a million miles. The<br />main reason? ... STILLS! The old cliche \\"so and so is back!\\" doesn't<br />even do justice. In my opinion, Stephen has not looked, played or sang this<br />good in a very long time. His hoarsely mumbled vocal delivery of recent times<br />is gone ... suddenly his harmony and lead vocals are clear, clean, accurate<br />and very passionate. His acoustic and electric guitar playing is stellar<br />and as soulfully seasoned as any recent work of Clapton.<br /><br />Both Nash's and Crosby's performances here are off the charts and in step with<br />their recent brilliant DVD release. But again I need to re-emphasize that with this<br />resurgence of Stills, this is maybe the best ever CSN show I have ever seen on<br />video.<br /><br />Without paying much attention to the back of the package before watching,<br />I didn't even realize there were two sets in this show. I was very satiated<br />after the first set and happily surprised when realizing there was another set.<br />Well the second set is even better than the first with its emphasis on classic<br />acoustic oriented nuggets from each member's catalog and collective catalog.<br />I was totally not expecting to hear Stills perform \\"And So Begins The Task\\"<br />or \\"As I Come Of Age\\". The final encore in the show is the kicker though and<br />worth the price of admission here. It is an amazing rendition of Suite For Judy<br />Blue Eyes that is not to be believed.<br /><br />The supporting band which appears to be most of the group that backed Nash and Crosby<br />on their recent DVD is as pro as you will ever find anywhere and their ability to<br />switch between blues, rock, country and jazz treatments is spectacular. The sound<br />mix on this Blu-Ray is stellar and the camera work is very intimate as well. Even<br />with highly anticipated releases, I usually watch them and then don't revisit them<br />for a while. This one I wanted to watch over again immediately. For the deep or novice CSN fan,<br />this DVD is a treasure and not to be missed.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|\\"The Way of Kings\\" by Brandon Sanderson is the first book in a 10 part epic fantasy series. If your hesitant about reading this novel don't be. \\"The Way of Kings\\" is the best novel that I have read to date. This book isn't 'merely' escapism. The story's characters captivated me. The characters develop organically based upon their experiences. The world is thoughtfully laid out, functional, and unique. If you enjoy solid characterization placed into a dynamic world that jumps off the pages, please read this book. I look forward to next 9 novel, and I have added another author to my reading list.
1451678193|5.0|This is one of those mystical, wonderful one-of-a-kind books that I'll never get tired of re-reading. First read as a child, and multiple times since, it makes me feel like I am traveling to a beautiful other planet. And then Bradbury shows us how mistrustful, conniving and human-like the martians are, too, in his own inimitable way.<br /><br />Bradbury's description skills are unparalleled with such vivid descriptions like \\"gold-coin eyes.\\" Oh, to be in those strange, eerie martian canals! What an outstanding, terrific book that should be required reading for every young reader and won't hurt us older folks either remember to keep dreaming big. This is my all time favorite short story collection containing inter-connected stories by a single author. Captivating, bold and sensational. I could carry the hyperbole on for another paragraph--it's not hyperbole to me--but I'll stop with: read this already.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|He is just awesome, lot to learn from Steve... Though he was arrogant he created amazing products for the world...

B005D0RDO8|5.0|I don't care so much about films like \\"Saw\\" or \\"Hostel\\". Maybe these films fit in our desensitized times, maybe we simply don't care that much anymore. We have Canadian porn killers and Batman massacres these days, all turned into huge media spectacles. In my opinion, the one and only true film about the state of humanity is Pasolini's last ever film. \\"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom\\" is a destructive masterpiece, anything but feel-good but extremely important. It's easy to focus on the torture and killings, but I guess the true horror of the film lies in the disturbing reactions of the youngsters. The victims betray each other, the four high ranking government officials' helpers don't care about what's going on. Desensitized behaviour is what Pasolini shows us here. People who call this 'the most grotesque film ever made' have no idea what they're talking about. Pasolini does not sensationalize sex or murders. The film offers an aesthetic detachment. It's anything but grotesque, it's a classic film. An uncomfortable experience it is, nevertheless. But then again: the truth is always hard to swallow. It's mostly hard to accept and most often unpleasant. Don't blame the messenger.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|This set features the \\"traditional-style\\" Batwing (not the Bat from \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\") and Joker helicopter, just as they appear in the Lego Batman 2 video game.  The ladder on the helicopter is a whimsical reference to one of the final scenes from the 1989 \\"Batman\\" film, and the Joker-face \\"bomb\\" is hilarious.  This is the only current set with the Joker goon, and the lower-cost and easier-to-find way to get the Joker, whose redesigned look is the ultimate payoff.

B005LMEB8E|2.0|I fell in love with Demi when her second album came out. I listened to it all the time and I was very impressed with her voice. It's strong and natural and honestly, she's much better than Selena. I think this album fell short on talent and dedication. Demi's usual passion isn't apparent in these songs--in my opinion, these tracks are empty, except for a few that captured my attention, like Lightweight. This was supposed to be Demi's \\"comeback\\" album from her struggles and hardships. I can definitely sense the bitterness and scorning in some of her songs, something that artists like Kelly Clarkson do very well, but Demi failed. Therefore, all we got was an album that was loosely put together by her record company. While I feel that artists like Taylor and Kelly are getting progressively better with each album, I feel that Demi will only get worse. This album was evidence of that.
067144901X|5.0|cute little book. I love singing it to my son. I love the whole series and would recommend them to anyone. I'm a book lover and hope to instill the same in my children. This is fun for mommy and hopefully a great start for my son.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|An enjoyable game that's highly addictive. A word of warning, though: don't start playing too close to your bedtime or the next thing you know the sun will be up!
B007EW9ISM|5.0|This is just an all around amazing stylus. It's size and width just feel perfect in your hand, and writing or drawing with it is a really pleasure. Like others have said, it does require slight pressure which meant for me that sometimes my swiping motions or quick taps on the screen were not registered, but that was rare. As for writing and drawing the slight pressure is no different than the way I would use a real pen or pencil, so I can't say I felt any difference. The price is a little steep I guess, but it's made in America so definitely worth it. It's hard to find anything these days that is, really. Also, the packaging is very cool and simple. it reminds me of the boxes that wands come in in the Harry Potter movies.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I loved this film.  It was really sweet and inspirational, which isn't something you see a lot of, especially if it's based on a true story.  But this was such an unexpected surprise.  Would highly recommend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is the most addicting app on the appstore. I played the game for 2 hours straight. And I'm still not done. It is worth the space and can keep you playing for HOURS. I strongly recommend this app.
B0001I561E|5.0|I saw this movie and loved it.  Aladdin is a commoner who is homeless and steals what he needs in order to survive, along with his trusty monkey Abu.  He is tricked by Royal Viser Jaffar into stealing a lamp.  Jafar tries to turn the tables on Aladdin by double crossing him and killing him while stealing the lamp back, but Abu bites Jafar causing him to lose control of the lamp.  Aladdin befriends a genie and the adventure goes on from there.  Eventually Aladdin does fall in love with a princess, but also makes a promise to the genie to use his last wish to free him.  I thought this movie was really sweet in many areas.  I would recommend this film to anybody.
B0045HCJGC|4.0|Demolition Man(released Oct./93)stars Wesley Snipes as killer extreme Simon Phoenix and Sylvester Stallone as Sgt.John Spartan of the LAPD.The movie is a rollicking good ride,with a very good blend of intense action mixed with a good sense of humour.<br />The plot takes place in a slightly futuristic LA,and it has Stallone as a no nonsense LAPD officer trying to capture the notorious killer Snipes.The confrontation ends in a warehouse,but Snipes won't come clean as to the whereabouts of some hostages.The building is rigged to explode as Stallone barely makes it out alive with Snipes on his shoulder.Post explosion other officers discover the remains of the hostages and Stallone is charged,put on trial and sentenced to cryogenic freezing,the punishment of choice in this world.<br />In 2032 Snipes,who has been refrozen for his crimes,is thawed for his parole hearing.Society has become awash in political correctness and pacifism during this time and there has been a slowly  building underground movement led by one Edgar Friendly(Denis Leary)to turn things back.The leader responsible for this new society is Dr.Cocteau(Nigel Hawthorn)and he has been unable to rid LA of pest,Friendly.To this end,and unknown to the parole board,he has enhanced Snipes abilities for killing to even more extremes,in order to help him rid Los Angeles of the underground movement.Snipes,while sitting strapped into his chair at his hearing ,suddenly becomes loose and ends up escaping the facility.<br />Snipes goes on a killing spree but the ineffectual LAPD are unable to mobilize,as they do not have the capabilities of handling such a criminal.The police chief comes up with the idea of unfreezing Stallone in the hopes this old bad-butt can lasso this varmint and return him to the cryo chamber.<br />Re-animated Stallone is a fish out of water.Every time he swears he is fined,as he is as far from the current societal state as he can be.To assist him in this new environment is Lt.Huxley(Sandra Bullock),who just happens to be into old pop culture.She trails Stallone around as he picks up Snipes trail.But Stallone is soon piecing the puzzle together that there is more behind Snipes release than meets the eye and Cocteau is connected to it.Stallone finds a manhole cover and descends into the underground of LA only to find an entire counter society that only wants equality and proper food to eat.He meets Friendly and instead of arresting him he is sympathetic.Suddenly shots spray the area they stand in,as Snipes and some followers also have found Friendly and his group.Snipes escapes with Stallone in hot pursuit.<br />A car chase ensues and the two end up back at the cryo facilities for the final showdown.Stallone learns from the maniac that the hostages,those many years ago,were already dead before the explosion occurred.So Stallone was sent up for something he didn't do.Snipes gets frozen again but decapped by Stallone.The facility is totally destroyed as the police chief wonders how they are ever going to get along.Stallone suggests they reach a compromise with Friendly and his myriad of followers,to reach an amicable solution.<br />This film is chock full of adrenaline pumping moments,especially when its two stars go head to head.Stallone is the intense cop while Snipes is the perfect over the edge psycho criminal.Bullock,as Stallone's sidekick,offers up some good funny moments as she gets old sayings screwed up and makes plenty of faux pauxs where Stallone is concerned.Rob Schneider is also on hand as one of the cops with his\\"He doesn't know how to use the sea shells\\".How DO you use those darn sea shells?<br />Technically the film is in is in its original a/r of 1:77:1 and looks clear and crisp throughout.There are really no extras other than commentary.<br />In conclusion,yes this IS a good movie,no two ways about it.Stallone and Snipes offer up the goods and worked well together in this futuristic good vs evil flick.Recommended.k),who just happens to be into old pop culture.She trails Stallone around as he picks up Snipes trail.But Stallone is soon piecing the puzzle together that

B001VLBDD0|5.0|This is an extremely rare movie, in the sense that most movies have trouble being as good as the original.  In the case of this movie, it was actually better the the original, in my opinion.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfect as The Terminator.  In the original movie they didn't seem to know where to go or how to go about it, but this sequel was bigger and badder and more of what you would expect than the original was.  I would absolutely recommend this movie.
034580404X|5.0|The product arrived on time, in perfect conditions, is very recommended and also the story is great. I recomend the reading
B00007KGCW|5.0|I thought this film was terrific.  It's a rare film that explores things like the fish in the sea and how they live and interact.  In this film, Nemo can't seem to understand his father, and ends up being caught by a fisherman.  Now the quest is on for Nemo's father to find him, and boy does he do everything to find him.  I think this movie should be watched by everyone.  It really shows just what a parent will do to help their child.  Excellent!!
B008JH5FZ6|1.0|Poor script.<br />I want to add poor acting; however I do not feel that Guy Pearce, Vincent Regan nor Maggie Grace had a good script or direction.<br />This is my first movie review. I am only reviewing it because it was so bad.<br />A complete waste of time.<br />Poor me for purchasing.
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|I have only been a Fiona fan since \\"Extraordinary Machine\\", but in comparing the two I think this one is better. It's worth the 9 dollars just to own \\"Hot Knife\\", but \\"Valentine\\", \\"Daredevil\\", and \\"Werewolf\\" are a few more of the highlights. I hope that you enjoy this album as much as I have!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Gotham has, against all odds, become a prosperous metropolis, a safer place to be. The Commissioner's anti-crime Dent Act has put a serious crimp on organized crime. It's been eight years since the Batman was last seen, eight years since he was accused of murdering Harvey Dent and the Commissioner allowed the lie in order to serve the greater good. Except there is no dearth of cowardly, superstitious lots. On the rooftops of Gotham and in the secret dens of the priveleged, an elusive cat burglar begins to prowl. And, compelled by a terrifying agenda, the zealot Bane begins to exert his insidious influence over Gotham City. It's been eight years since the Batman deemed his work done. But today his city is once more threatened. Retirement's over-rated.<br /><br />Never mind that one dude snoring away in the corner of the movie theater late Sunday night. Everyone else walked away fairly impressed. Christopher Nolan has done a wonder. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES caps off one of the best ever cinematic trilogies. Put it right up there with the original Star Wars trilogy and the Lord of the Rings and the Indiana Jones and Toy Story franchises. Is it perfect? No. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is a tour-de-force but with a few flaws, a masterpiece with scuff marks. It's still unmissable.<br /><br />Eight years after the horrific climax of THE DARK KNIGHT, we catch up with a hobbled Bruce Wayne. Wracked with guilt over his inability to save Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, Bruce has abandoned the Bat suit. Once regarded as Gotham's favorite son, Bruce has become an eccentric recluse, his wealth steadily seeping away. This allows Michael Caine's faithful butler Alfred to deliver several emotional motivational speeches. And maybe one of them finally resonates with Bruce. He straps on a brace on his busted leg and steps out. Whispers of a monster named Bane circulate, and Bruce, who had shied away from his base of operations, ventures down to the Batcave. Good thing he'd long ago installed an advanced copy of Windows 2010, because, even after eight years of neglect, the Batcave's computer system is still cutting edge stuff.<br /><br />Okay, plot SPOILER in the last sentence of this next paragraph.<br /><br />Nolan applies elements of BATMAN: YEAR ONE, KNIGHTFALL, and NO MAN'S LAND to his narrative; longtime Batman readers can draw certain plot points from that. This film's scope is amazing. Nolan takes advantage of his near three-hours-long running time to tell a story that is rich and sprawling and occasionally breathtaking, never mind that the staff of JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine are probably rolling their eyes at how rapidly Bruce resolves his grievous medical ailments in such a constrained timeline. Unless, of course, you really can remedy a broken back just by pushing a protruding vertebra back into the spine.<br /><br />Nolan is masterful with the technical bits, from cinematography to sound to score to use of the color palette to help establish mood. We're watching a great director at the height of his powers. Let's enjoy this guy. The acting performances, as expected, are across-the-board superb. There were doubts going in about Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, but remember that people also scoffed when Heath Ledger was cast as the Joker. Hathaway pulls it off. She makes a convincing Catwoman, although no one ever calls her that in the film. I like her character arc, although it's an obvious one. She lends depth to the role, serves as a fantastic foil for Batman. I love Selina's quicksilver personality shifts and that she's razor sharp with her delivery, and that she comes across as equally playful but dangerous. Hathaway's is miles ahead of Halle Berry and Michelle Pfeiffer's interpretations. Hells, she may even be the film's breakout character, although Joseph Gordon-Levitt's resourceful rookie cop also effortlessly commands the screen.<br /><br />In the excessive neck snapping portion of the discussion, I predict that Tom Hardy'sominous big bad will be the most slighted performance. But Hardy exudes presence, and, contrary to the early trailer, I understood most of his dialogue. But why did Bane have to go out with a whimper? He deserved a bigger finish.<br /><br />THE DARK KNIGHT RISES isn't as good as THE DARK KNIGHT. How could it be? As solid as this cast is, no one reaches the sublime heights of Ledger's Joker. But this is a deserving finale that, judged on its own merits, achieves its own measure of brilliance. Nolan had \\"epic\\" in mind when he closed the books on his franchise. His Batman is traumatized and gets put thru several kinds of hell. Even Frank Miller wants to give him a hug.<br /><br />There are scenes heavy on exposition, yeah, but only rarely did I feel they were slow. There are at least three twists in the third act, one of which we see coming from jump. But never mind. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES meets expectations but doesn't exceed them. Predictably, it combs the darker psychology of the superhero. It's even a bit of a social commentary. It is brooding. It is epic. Its scale is ambitious. It builds its hero into a grand mythic figure. It's not as \\"fun\\" or bright as THE AVENGERS, but it's as equally rewarding and, at times, goosebumpy. Okay, Christian Bale's harsh Batman voice still aggravates.<br /><br />Stay for the post-credits scene in which the Batman is in a diner eating shawarma.<br /><br />No, don't do that.ominous big bad will be the most slighted performance.

B007N6NGYG|4.0|this game is very addicting. I like it a lot. there is one problem though. I cant get past the wild west theme. it says &quot;more levels and eras will be available soon&quot;. but I got the game 4 months ago and still...no levels. I don't know if it is a glitch or if it is just my kindle, but still it is a fun game and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle/stratagey games.
B004HUE57S|2.0|I could not get this mouse to install properly, even after having a tech person assist.  I was able to left click, but not right click.  Having said that, I liked the feel of this evoluent mouse in my hand (although too tall and wouldnt allow my keyboard shelf to slide under my desk), and was hopeful that this mouse would offer some relief for my strained wrist and arm.  However, since it was not compatable with my computer, I was unable to fully assess it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I hate football, much like the disturbed Tiffany in this fast read. But football becomes the perfect metaphor and touchstone in the life of Pat Peoples, a recent mental patient with a questionable grip on reality as he embarks on his misguided quest to fix his life by winning back his wife.<br /><br />The book covers a lot of ground for such a short, simply written story told by a narrator who often sounds clueless and crazy: loss of love, death, mental illness, literature, modern dance, undrafted rookies, promiscuity, God, Parcheesi, marital politics and Kenny G. You feel for Pat as he is alienated by his father, whose only displays of affection revolve around whether the Philadelphia Eagles win; as he is stalked by a beautiful but bizarre acquaintance who wordlessly follows him on his daily runs; and as he tries to improve himself through therapy, working his way through high school reading lists and compulsive weightlifting.<br /><br />Quick's novel manages to be quietly funny, sentimental without being trite, and with surprising twists despite a simplistic premise. Anything else I say will give too much away. Read this on a quiet afternoon and prepare to feel warm and fuzzy and ready to hug the first person who comes into your line of vision.
0425263908|5.0|I loved 50 Shades of Grey, but I felt it had a lot of repetition and words that were over the top.  I shouldn't have to pull out the old dictionary to read erotica.  \\"Bared to You\\" was much better written even though it did seem to be a lot like 50 Shades.  I still loved the story and cannot wait for the next book to come out.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love puzzles and this is an awesome game. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes puzzles also :)
0062197258|5.0|I was blown away by this novel. At first, the 2 storylines are a little difficult to sort out, but when you do, it goes along fine.<br /><br />In one, our heroine is at first carefree, looking to fall in love when she encounters Lee.<br /><br />In the second, something has clearly gone terribly wrong and she has turned into a terrified woman who can't stop checking her locks. The story unwinds and we found out just what happened.<br /><br />This is a terrifying novel, and a look into the world of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is the book that got me hooked on fantasy. the whole concept is brilliant. cant wait for book three. please go with the majority reviews, forget the haters.
B008MEM24S|1.0|it is the worst game! it shouldn't just be free, they should pay us to play it! the only good thing about it is if you get in trouble, your parents can use it as a punishment and make you play it. and thats just the tip of the iceberg.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|Well worth the money to protect your kindle. Variety of colors. The Salmon or Pink color is beautiful. Good protection
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Enjoyable games but you do have to unlock them. There are a lot of ads which can get annoying. Overall a fun time waster.
B0065FEVDQ|5.0|I was dying to see this episode and wanted to give Prime Instant a shot so I did, very happy with it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It has all 8 of the discs in the box and is the best value I was able to find anywhere!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun game! play the time challenge mode to really get the old neurons firing!  I feel smarter already.  my best is 5 @ 5x5 in 30 secs (10 in 1 min).
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a fun and sometimes frustrating game.  but it passes time and is so far one of my favorites. I say you should get temple run.
B00065MDRW|4.0|Recently I came across an article, I think it was like \\"The Top 30 or 50 Rock Recordings or Albums\\". Listed high was this album. The only cut off of the album that I had ever heard was the title cut. So, I decided to go for it and order it. I've listened to it twice now, and it would say that it's definitely in there!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun but very addicting! I honewtly didn't think I would like it until a friend told me to try it...
B0055SWM08|5.0|Amazing game, beautiful art, and love the music. Love everything about it. Honesty you need to get this game. It's totally worth the money a most have.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Okay. I have seen a lot of good reviews on this game but a lot people say it glitches a lot and I don't now if I want to spend that much money on a glitchy game
B001F12J48|5.0|I thought this would play on my 3D TV with my 3D blue ray player.  The 3 D version (DVD, not blue ray) does not play with a 3 D TV, it is only good on a regular TV.  I guess because my LG 3D TV does the conversion in the TV and this movie was made for a regular TV.  The price was good, so I will give it away to my Grandson. Shipping was fast and condition of the movies were good, just my mistake.  But I do now know you cannot play the old 3D movies made for the paper glasses.<br /><br />Continued:  I did send the DVD Polar Express movie to my Grandson.  I found this in true 3D, so just remember that you need to see the specifics of the  movie before you order.  This movie is great in 3D blue Ray version.  The effects are as I expected them to be, and I always loved the movie in regular 2D format.  I am just spoiled with my new 3D TV.  Used the Prime service and arrived as promised.  Condition of the movie was perfect.
B004ZQRFGM|4.0|Again, while browsing thru Amazon library of music, I came across Ana Popovic.  No question that the cover graphics caught my attention but after listening to a few samples, I realized this was not window dressing, she was the real thing.  Great mix of rhythms, Reset Rewind sounds alot like The Band's The Weight.  She does a great job on guitar, singing, and writing her own material on this album.  After seeing the album cover and listening to her music, I can only dream of being her Fender guitar (LOL).  For me, she is a can't miss musician.  This is a sit back, tap your feet while listening album.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is so great!!!! when I first saw this app it blew my mind awesome people should use this its good for your kindle
B005MW68RK|5.0|Had never heard of Beth Hart before but I did have some of Joe B's music.  I listened to only a few previews but was immediately sold on the combination of her voice and his guitar work.  This is as natural as bacon and eggs or peanut butter and jelly.  Great vocals with great emotion, a must for blues songs.  Sinner's Prayer, Chocolate Jesus, I'd rather go blind-all of the cuts on this recording are first rate.  This is one cd I would say is a must for any serious collector of blues.  These two need to do more recordings together.  Sit back, close your eyes, and just enjoy the musical magic these two make.  Get the whole album, not just a few songs!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I knew that bad writing filled with cliches, fantasy sex and BDSM would make *me* a millionaire I would have done it long ago.  No wonder the author is camera shy and uncomfortable at appearances.  I'd be, too, if I wrote this c**p.  Well...if she's smart, she'll invest well and live off her royalties because a career as a serious writer is not happening.  Envious?  Yeah, but only because so many good writers struggle to be recognized and this hack makes a fortune all because she took the easiest way out -- writing smut.  Go figure.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|It was about a year ago that I first heard a recording by JB-Black Night-and it blew me away.  I grew up in the 60's and have been fortunate to have been exposed to so many guitar greats, Clapton, Page, Beck, Vai, Van Halen, BB King, Buddy Guy and so on (can't quite agree with RS on Keith Richards being in the same class) and Joe Bonamassa is yet another blues virtuoso.  Slow Train, Dust Bowl, Meaning of the Blues, you can't miss on any of the songs on this album.  His guitar work is fantastic and he is blessed with a voice that fits his genre of music perfectly.  He embraces the Blues and makes you do the same thing while listening to him.
B0063IH60K|5.0|On my Kindle Fire.  Really nice game, annoying pop-up ad at start,  but one touch skip so not too bad.  Game plays well,  can custom cards with any picture in your files and as good ss any other solitaire game.<br /><br />Dave
0061692042|1.0|The first sentence of this novel says that the narrator's parents rob a bank. One hundred pages in and they still haven't robbed the bank. Boring. It's beautifully written, but I could only stand so many repetitive descriptions of the parents, the relationships, the family dynamics, etc. Good writing cannot overcome a lack of plot. I was really looking forward to this book but chose not to finish it. Life is too short for uninteresting books.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|pic shop is intuitively designed , great for quick fixes, memes, and instagram looking shit. for those who are too lazy for photoshop but too vain for unedited photos.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The only thing I don't like is you can only do things as long as you have energy, which is also kinds good cause otherwise I may not stop playing.
1466401885|5.0|I loved Beautiful Disaster. I had just finished 50 Shades and was looking for another story that would engulf me. \\"Pidgeon\\" and Travis' love story is so addicting. I only reluctantly put the book down when daily life made it absolutely necessary...i.e. work :) I promise you'll love this book! It's a real life love story that isn't just perfect and easy. The guy isn't perfect and neither is the girl. They make mistakes and learn how to grow together. Do yourself a favor and just trust me and buy this book!
B005LAIGWS|2.0|This movie sucked compared to the first one. The bike was junk compared to the fist one (when transformed). The special affects looked like something from 10 yrs ago. The plot was semi silly, the primary bad guy with the power of rot was stupid. I wasted 2hrs of my life I can't get back watching this film, do not recommend unless you have absolutely nothing else to do for 2hrs.
0425263908|1.0|I cannot believe how similar this is to 50 shades of gray! I couldn't even finish reading it. Skip it and read 50 shades instead
B007KAJG3K|4.0|Hope they make a dozen more of the Sherlock Holmes movies with the same cast. All great actors, and great plots and twists, with plenty of action, and thought.<br /><br />deducted one star for Ultraviolet, I hate this crap who thought it up. It never works for iPods, or iTunes. It also requires signing up to another something I don't need or want to keep up with. Just give me the digital copy I paid for so i can put it in iTunes, money hungry studios.
0345803485|1.0|Thank goodness I did not pay for this. Tons of women where I work were blogging on a work sanctioned website about this book and how great it was , they could not put it down etc...SO... I borrowed from Kindle Lending Library and yes, OK the first chapter was interesting and I liked that main girl despite her incessant holy craps, which at first were sort of endearing... then as the story slogged on and she meets this rich guy, blah blah blah.... I lost interest, did not care one whit what happened between these two quite boring characters, and returned it.  Never even cared enough to skim towards any of the so called juicy parts. It was too yawn inducing to care.  I will say the author is a very lucky person,  she is set for life for writing a book that took off word of mouth but whose mouths were actually raving?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Even though it is a very intense book it is a great book to read, I am so glad I desided to read it.
B001I9OI9Q|1.0|I admit, this is what I thought the Richard Donner cut to be. After I purchased the 'Richard Donner' cut, I was sorely disappointed. The deleted scenes listed in the comments above were what really made Superman II a great movie. One deleted scene nobody really mentions was when the 3 super-villians were wrapping up their conquest of the little town of Houston and this kid mounted his horse, thinking he was riding to go get help. Zod declairs 'Nobody leaves!!!' Well, Non, posssessing a light from a police car, hurls it in the direction the child went, and we see an explosion. One of the Houston residents, in shock, says to the villians, 'He was just a boy' to which Ursa replies, 'Now, he'll never be a man!!'

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this one for awhile and I love that you can easily choose a version and download it for offline use. They have tons of Bible reading plans to help you be dilligent in reading God's word daily as well. Unfortunately those require Internet access from what I have seen. I ran into that problem recently while on vacation.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I love this CD and love the 80's music!! Can't wait to get the movie![[ASIN:B008764ZQ4 Rock of Ages: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]
B0058VW36U|5.0|I lovelovelove this game!! especially when my 3yr old cousin comes; he loves it!!!!! this is an awesome game and I totally reccomend it 2 every1!!! @(*_*)@
0061128562|2.0|I love this series of books and so do my kids (2 & 4 yo).  Unfortunately I didn't read the product description very well because I didn't know it was a mini-book.  The book is so small I can barely read the words myself and we have no use for the CD.  So I'd really recommend the story but get the full size version of the book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's frustrating to accidentally buy things you don't need, but this game is a fun time waster. There are plenty of sales throughout the week so saving in game money is easy.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love his app the only thing I don't get is that the 99 cent one was the same thing but just cost money. I totally recommend this app but just dont waste your money on the 99cent version because this version is exactly the same.
B006PKQQJS|3.0|i dont really like it.i think its just trying to incorporate good rulings for children which take them away from REAL jobs such as lawyers, doctors, etc.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a good game when you are bored and need something to do. young children can be entertained for a while to keep them quite
B0034G4P4O|5.0|It is superb animation, storyline and characters follows the Tin-tin comics, and overall, I loved it! It is a bit TOO action-packed, but when animated characters get all teary-eyed and dramatic, it is sooo cheesy...SO Five stars from me!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love weres my Perry it is an awesome game so yeah to me I like it way better than weres my water but yeah it has way more levels
B006RUJST6|4.0|This book really surprised me as I was expecting a quick story about young love. I am not the type of girl who typically cries while reading a sad story or even laughs out loud, but I found myself with tears in my eye at some points and grinning from ear to ear at others.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|cute little games. most of them are fun. a few are annoying. I enjoy playing and would recommend for killing time.
B001QVFDA4|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but it is not as good as Ritchie's earlier films such as Snatch and Lock Stock. Same type of setting... if you are a fan of the earlier ones this is worth at least a rental. If you are a big fan then you probably won't mind the purchase.
B00275EGX8|5.0|While set in Iraq, this is not a political film, it examines the psychology of men in  danger, and how some<br />men become addicted to it.<br /><br />Mostly critically lionized, but attacked by many, especially soldiers for being inaccurate.<br /><br />I didn't take the film that literally, or think of it as documentary realism, but more a stylized almost poetic<br />look at the insanity of wars and what can happen to those caught up in them, much like `Full Metal Jacket'.<br />This felt real on a meta level, not a literal one.<br /><br />There were a few logic lapses that bugged me, and the impact emotionally is (by choice I felt) muted.  It's<br />more a disturbing picture than a moving one.<br /><br />But it made me think and made my heart race, and images and moments have stayed with me for a long time
B002O5M4SA|5.0|I upgraded from the DVD and it was worth it. Picture and sound are strong.  If you haven't seen the film... you are in for a treat. It is for mature audiences but it's a fantastic combination of compelling character development (fantastic performances across the board) and action. Easily one of the very best in the action genre.  Besson's best by some margin.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have had some fun with this game. I just wish more people played it would be nice to have a couple neighbors.
B007SO31BQ|4.0|If you are a Senna or Formula 1 Fan you really need to see this documentary. Also be sure to watch the interviews in the extras section-- they are quite good.<br /><br />I give it four stars only because, despite it being very good, it could have been better from a racing fan's perspective. I would have liked much more in car footage (some complete laps would have been nice!), more mention of some of his extraordinary drives (although a few were included) and more interviews with his contemporaries and current F1 personalities (although the documentary is not done from an interview perspective except for Senna himself (and a few of his sister's insights).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|just downloaded yesterday. Already addicted! Starts off easy then progressively gets harder. Works great on my Kindle Fire. Has nice vivid colors.
B004PHE9F6|3.0|This movie is for race fans. If you aren't a racing fan, specifically an F1 fan, I do not recommend it.  If you like historical or contemporary F1, I think you'll enjoy it due to the racing footage.<br /><br />The footage is well done (particularly at Monaco) although the director cuts out from the in car camera at some inexplicable spots from a racing fan perspective (such as right before Eau Rouge!) and they didn't film at the Nordschliefe at all :(

B0027MJU00|5.0|I've heard the words often in reviews: wonderful, beautiful, mesmerizing, etc, etc, etc. Adjective after adjective of positive qualification heaped upon the word prose. To be honest, I'm an avid reader that's never really appreciated that word, regardless of how many adjectives smothered it. I've only really understood beauty as it's related to poetry, and even then, only rarely. But Gillian Flynn really, truly deserves every one of the adjectives thrown at her prose. It's hard to even find the right words to describe the way her metaphors and descriptions slap you in the face, honest, simple, and elegantly perfect. \\"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.\\" Seriously?  \\"I was not a lovable child, and I'd grown into a deeply unlovable adult. Draw a picture of my soul, and it'd be a scribble with fangs.\\" It took me a good chapter or more before I could stop obsessing over the incredible perfection in the way her words move. I actually had to go back to the beginning of the book because I'd been staring at the words so intently I'd forgotten to back up and take in the story. It was like being in a state of shock. And that's the way I drank up the rest of Dark Places. In a state of wonderfully perfect shock.<br /><br />  Dark Places is the story of Libby Day, the sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out everyone in her family, save herself and her brother Ben, the murderer. The story takes you through 30+ year old Libby's life and her reluctant journey to piece together the truth of that horrible night. At 7, when the massacre occurred, she had testified against her brother and lived her life sure that her finger was pointed in the right direction. But newly broke and without any real skills other than celebrity pity case she's forced to make money the only way she knows how; through the nightmare she survived. As perhaps the only person that can truly get answers from the cast of characters involved in the events of that night, she's tapped by a strange group of murder case fanatics looking for answers to their favorite mystery. Motivated solely by the desperation for money Libby finds herself for the first time in 25 years confronting the reality of that night. As the story unfolds she finds herself drawn deeper and deeper into the people and events of her horrible past than she'd wanted, the uncertainty of her brother's guilt growing inside her. Told through shifting perspectives from Libby, Ben, and Patty (their mother), Dark Places lives up to it's title in all the right ways. As past and present collide, the truth of the Kinnakee Kansas Farmhouse Massacre threatens to destroy it's sole survivor once again.<br /><br />  When I was finally able to get past the shock of Gillian Flynn's surreal prose Dark Places quickly became a story that I couldn't look away from. The train wreck that is Libby Day and her horrible life, was in every way the literary equivalent of it's namesake. Ms. (Mrs.?) Flynn pulls off an incredible feat in making her central character, Libby Day, equal parts wounded and wounding. Well, maybe not equal parts, but certainly a clever balance that makes her angry, bitter, and cold, and yet somehow soft and innocent. The perpetual child -damaged angry and bitter- but still a child. Don't get me wrong, Libby Day is anything but soft and innocent. But somehow Ms. Flynn has crafted her character so that innocence trails her bitter angry nature like a soft, barely visible mist. The story shifts from present to past and back again, from Libby to Ben to their mother Patty, unraveling all the events of their last day. It sounds like a jarring jump, back and forth, but it's pulled off so fluidly that I can't imagine this story being told any other way. Even as the jump is made from Libby's present to Ben or Patty's past, the story builds and moves forward; the present leading us into the past and the past leading us back to the present. Genius. It was like watching a droplet of water roll slowly down the length of a leaf, pause just at the tip, roll over and fall to the ground. This is the way that Dark Places' story moves; fluid and natural. Of course, Dark Places is a story of massacre, brutality, anger, and desperation, so I suppose that droplet of water would more accurately be described as a droplet of blood. Not that there's much of a difference.<br /><br />  I'd say that you'd be missing out if you didn't pick up any one of Gillian Flynn's books, but there's no way to truly say that without sounding like a smitten little fanboy. It's true of course. I am. But that doesn't make her brutally perfect and genius use of the English language any less remarkable. As soon as I was finished with Dark Places, I immediately jumped back into the Kindle store and purchased Sharp Objects and Gone Girl. My only complaint about Gillian Flynn at this point is that she doesn't have a hundred books so that I can just keep reading. I'm not a mystery fan or a thriller fan, or whatever else it is that they call these type of books. Before Dark Places all I did was read classics: Camus, Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, Dante, Blake, Poe and everything in between and around. My mantra was why bother with modern writers when there are so many incredible classics that I haven't yet read. Gillian Flynn has completely changed my mind. I don't even really know why I took the leap to be honest, but talk about sheer dumb luck. I stumble out of the land of literary gods and land smack dab on Gillian Flynn. When it comes to literature, I get lucky like that sometimes.<br /><br />  As a book in and of itself, Dark Places is a violently smooth tale of a shattered and broken girl piecing together the real story of the horror that's defined and destroyed her life. At it's core it is a mystery wrapped around a massacre, wrapped around a search for the tragic truth of a bloodied and battered life that beganand became very, very wrong. The midwestern setting and it's poverty stricken midwestern characters are living and breathing beings in Gillian Flynn's hands. You are quite literally surrounded and devoured by Dark Places in all the absolutely best ways. But it is words that Gillian Flynn does best. Words and the way they move both within and without the page. Structure, character development, pacing and mystery all move perfectly in Dark Places, and every one of her books; but it's words and the way she moves them that you really have to see for yourself. Opinions are just opinions, and this is just mine, but if you are in any way a fan of literature and all it's moving parts, you will truly be missing out if you don't pick up Dark Places, or for that matter, all of her books.

B000Y0VV5Y|1.0|Could have been a good episode but SG1 acted extremely self-righteous and ethnocentric throughout the whole episode minus Teal'c and Doctor Jackson. You would expect that a team of elite Military explorers would be amply trained in cross-cultural awareness yet Samantha consistently doubted and look disfavorably upon the indigenous populations belief. O'Neill was just as bad, constantly acting arrogant towards the leaders of the indigenous population which is unacceptable for one an officer of his rank who shows so much respect towards General Hammond. Instead of acting cooperative, they were hostile which made everything sour.<br /><br />SG1 are supposed to be the good guys, the best America has to offer; yet in this episode they acted arrogant towards others which really made the episode weak!<br /><br />Good thing the aliens were the tolerant ones here or we would all be dead.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|This film was in the press late in 2011 for being very \\"sexually explicit\\" and landing a NC-17 rating.  This, however, undermines the depth of the character known as Brandon and the message that director Steve McQueen is trying to convey about addiction.  Michael Fassbender gives an Oscar worthy performance in what most would call a dark, twisted film directed towards mature audiences.  I highly recommend this film for mature audiences that enjoy dramas.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I previously used the Logitech G35 headset and was very happy them until they literally fell apart after about 2 years of heavy use.  I went to buy a new pair but couldn't find any locally but saw the new G930 and decided to 'upgrade'.  The good news is that they seem to be built better than the G35, are more comfortable, the battery life is pretty decent at 7 hours, the sound is just as good as the G35, and the wireless is great when it works.<br /><br />That said, the bad far outweighs the good.  The headset cuts out for 4-5 seconds very often at irregular intervals.  I use these for teleconferencing and this means for the most part that these are incredibly annoying at best and unusable in reality. To make matters worse, when you connect the wire it still communicates with the computer wirelessly so there's no workaround for the intermittent communication.<br /><br />Second is the random powering down.  Less often than the communication disruption, but still fairly regular is that these things will turn off for no obvious reason.  (Note: this is not turning off due to running out of charge I'm talking about. That is actually handled pretty well with audible beeps to warn you of the impending shutdown.) Again, to add insult to injury, whenever this happens they won't simply turn back on.  The headset plays a game with you for the next 10 minutes or so where they will turn back on for about 10-30 seconds and then turn off again, until finally they decide to stay on for good.<br /><br />Finally, and this is less of an issue, the G930 seems far more susceptible to wind noise than the G35.<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend avoiding these unless you really need the wireless connection and don't mind if the audio cuts out regularly and the headset turns off at random intervals.

0375507256|5.0|You open the book to the first page and begin reading a section entitled \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\". Mr. Ewing, you learn, is a public notary from San Francisco. It is the mid-nineteenth century and Mr. Ewing has been sent to the South Sea islands to settle an estate. The journal talks of the islands and then of Mr. Ewing's journey back to San Francisco. After nearly forty pages you turn the page and discover that the next one is blank. The journal has stopped in mid-sentence. You didn't accidentally turn two pages at once, and the your book isn't misprinted -- this is how the novel is written. Unusual.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas: A Novel is comprised of six stories which are linked by themes and, to a lesser extent, characters. The structure is unusual in that a narrative is begun and then dropped in mid-story when another is begun. Five narratives are presented in this fashion and then the sixth narrative is presented as a whole. Then the fifth story is completed, next the fourth is finished, and so on until at the end of the novel we have the conclusion of the first narrative, picked up in mid-sentence. An usual structure for a novel but it works.<br /><br />The novel's structure is an adaptation of a musical structure. The key to understanding this is found in the second narrative which centers on Robert Frobisher, a young twentieth century composer (as well as something of a cad). The phrase \\"cloud atlas\\" appears several times in the novel, but it is central in the Frobisher narrative. \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is the title of Frobisher's magnum opus, a sextet. The appearance of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" here, as a title, and it's centrality to the narrative, points to the relevance of this appearance to the structure of the novel. Frobisher's \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a sextet, a piece for six instruments, or musically speaking, six voices. Cloud Atlas: A Novel has six narratives, or six voices. The narratives are linked thematically, just as voices in a musical piece are linked. One narrative echos another, or it picks up a point presented in another narrative and develops it.<br /><br />There is one theme which is central to all the narratives in Cloud Atlas: A Novel: power -- power in governments, corporations, social groups and personal relationships. One could say that this is what the book \\"is about\\". Each narrative, and most characters, deal with power. They experience and describe the use, misuse and abuse of power. Some of the characters are misusers and abusers, of course, while others are victims. The theme is presented and then is developed and varied in the several narratives. A very musical presentation of ideas.<br /><br />This description may make Cloud Atlas: A Novel sound like an \\"intellectual novel\\" which, as far as I can tell, means that one is supposed to admire it rather than enjoy it. But this is not the case; Cloud Atlas: A Novel is very enjoyable. Some of the stories pull you in deeply and at places the novel is a real \\"page turner\\". But to enjoy it thusly one must adapt to the unusual structure. More than one person has remarked that it required 50 or so pages before they became truly engaged by the novel. I also found this to be the case. I persevered in the beginning, became hooked, and when finished was very satisfied with the literary journey.

B006IDG2T6|5.0|This book, along with V.S. Ramachandran's \\"The Tell-Tale Brain\\", literally changed my life.  I experienced a complete paradigm shift.  I am much more forgiving and empathetic now that I know that free will is an illusion.  I'm also more humble because I realize that my accomplishments are not so much my own, but rather the result of random chance.<br /><br />It's hard to explain the positive influence of this book without reading it for yourself.  It's liberating, fascinating, and IMPORTANT.  There are truths in this book that would dramatically change the structure of our legal system.  If only we would embrace them, this world would be a much kinder, more rational place.

B0000028RR|5.0|It's all perspective of where you were in life, but as a high school kid fresh off grunge taking off, along with the hip hop scene, there's no doubt that this is the best mix you can possibly get.  With all due respect to Beastie, Rage was a genre unto itself.  This album is the most memorable CD I ever owned.  Lineup was phenomenal from top to bottom, except for \\"Settle For Nothing\\" which is an automatic skip.  But \\"Killing in the Name of,\\" \\"Freedom,\\" \\"Know Your Enemy\\" (with a terrific cameo by Tool's Maynard), \\"Bullet in the Head\\", \\"Wake Up\\", and \\"Township Rebellion\\" deserve to be deemed the \\"Class of the nine-deuce\\".

B0064NTZQ2|3.0|*spoilers* You kill that many people, and in the end, when you have nothing left to lose, you leave the money, probably for someone else to come and take for themselves? I can understand (maybe) helping out the husband out of love for the girl. I can (maybe) understand taking half the pay at work that you know you deserved. But, I'm just lost. The guy seems sane and even compassionate toward the right people. I understand that. But, as far as the money, did he not take it because he'd feel guilty with the girl not having it? If so, why not get it to her somehow? And, why did she slap him for basically trying to save her husbands life and her son's and her own? Her husband probably would have died without his help, anyway, in addition to them being hurt.<br /><br />Sorry, I don't understand this. 3 stars for the action and suspense. Story doesn't make sense to me. Guy seemed a bit Terminator to me, but with some human traits. Strange.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|first i want to say more's the pity the 2-disc version is not available on blu-ray - although i didn't inspect the disc menu that closely - perhaps the same features are there.  I'll revise this review if they are.<br /><br />The blue-ray version is good - great quality transfer of video and sound<br /><br />Second - as far as the film goes: actually the character development is 1) consistent with the original bond novels, which actually do explain why (the old) bond is such a misogynistic womanizing s.o.b.; the Craig movies offer considerably more than any Bond films that precede them; to say there's no character development is a short-sighted criticism. Niven, Connery, Moore, Dalton, Brosnin -- have i overlooked anyone? Who can possibly say that \\"character development\\" was even attempted with any of these?  Did that impeded the fun of watching Sean Connery swagger across reel after reel?  I think not!<br /><br />However I liked this the first time I saw it and it improves on re-view.  Bond's character definitely develops, playing out the sequelae to his relationship with Vesper; M is at her authoritative best; many of the supporting characters are a little cardboard-cutout and the girl-being-rescued is - at first blush I found her boring, but by the time the film reached it's climactic scene, which is pretty eye-popping, I liked her a lot better.  I won't say why.  Ultimately there's still a lot of big-strong-man protecting beautiful-helpless-woman dynamic (*yawn*) but hey - it's Bond.  You can only change so much. And only so much has really changed since the \\"pussy galore\\" days - it's pretty contemporary.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem this film suffers is that it IS more of a regular Bond film.  There are plenty of action-packed scenes, typical bond women, a coherent story-line, quippy one-liners.  I loved the complexity of the first film; I loved that Bond was both tough and vulnerable.  On the other hand, if you look at the reviews of Casino Royale, half the people are complaining about that very element.  Just goes to show you can't please all the people all of the time.  But it is true that in the original novels, the whole reason Bond treats women the way he does is because of the pain in his broken heart.  Men; they never do deal with their feelings, do they?<br /><br />My final word: I never thought I'd find myself saying this, but Daniel Craig is the BEST BOND EVER.  I am an old, old Bond film.  I've seen every Connery film at least five or ten times.  Sean Connery to me WAS the epitomy of Bondness; he had a rich combination of animal magnetism combined with smooth manners, quick reflexes, athletic and intellectual credibility, as well as... well let's say that voice is enough to reduce me to a puddle of jello (and yes, I am female).  But Connery was ALL swagger.  Craig is a delicious balance between bad-boy machismo and the sense that he needs a little rescuing himself.  The dialogue and plot development in this film capture that quality well.<br /><br />I never in a million years would have believed any actor could out-Bond Connery, but Daniel Craig IMO has done it.  He brings a comparable level of unbridled masculine energy as typified Connery, and combines it effortlessly with a truly three-dimensional presence.  He is both more sophisticated and rougher around the edges - truly Bond for the new millenium.<br /><br />Bond films are still a feminist's outrage, but at least these have been updated to our current cultural norms, which are unfortunately not much less sexist, but certainly a slightly smoother cocktail - no vermouth this time, shaken, not stirred.alf the people are complaining about that very element.

B0073XV2W2|2.0|I loved Daemon and really liked Freedom and so I was expecting Kill Decision to be a great ride also, however it didn't live up to my expectations.  It seemed like the book was geared towards a military audience instead of the general public (because of the exuberant use of acronyms and military lingo...I didn't understand some of what was being said and trying to figure it out took me out of the story). I also just didn't care about the characters...they seemed pretty paper thin.  I have to admit that I skimmed the last 25% of the book just to get through it.  I think this would have been a far better more compelling story if the author had just focused on the drones and left the weaver ant/swarming robots out of the story.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well written story which moves along at a good pace. I hav'nt finished yet , so far so good!

B007MDB71O|4.0|Bought this for my husband, as he's a real sci-fi addict, and actually found it quite entertaining myself. It has a decent storyline and the computer graphics were better than most I've seen. This is a movie that can't be judged on what other people think. You need to see it for yourself. Like I said, I found it quite entertaining, and there are very few sci-fi flicks I like.
1416549447|5.0|Danny's book is great for anyone who runs, and especially those who have never had formal training (such as myself).  He lists more \\"focuses\\" than you can possibly keep in your brain at once, but it doesn't have to be all or nothing.  The biggest changes for me occurred when I focused on 1) developing a good forward lean (you will have to strengthen your lower back to do this for long runs at first), 2) striking mid foot, right underneath my hip, 3) loosening up my pelvis to rotate with my stride.<br /><br />Those three small changes have made me faster with far less effort.  And there's more in the book I have yet to put into practice!

0061692042|5.0|A married couple , somewhat unhappily so, commits a bank robbery in 1960. They are not the type to do this, by a long shot, and they are inept as well. He is an ex-GI who doesn't understand the world that know surrounds him and she is a somewhat intellectual Jew. He's a handsome , gregarious and empty headed Alabamian and she's unhappy with her choice of him. They get caught almost immediately and their twins leave town, the daughter by simply walking away and the son, 10 year old Dell who tells the story, is driven to SW Saskatchewan by a friend of his mothers. This to avoid being taken in by the juvenile authorities in Great Falls, Montana. Dell encounters a strange and bleak landscape of broken down buildings and bent characters.<br />He meets Charley, an odd employee of the town's hotel who guides Americans to the goose killing fields and does any other odd job that Arthur Remlinger, hotel owner, tells him to do. Both Charley and Arthur have checkered pasts, speaking to Dell in riddles at times. He knows there is bad in their pasts but doesn't exactly know what it is until Charley tells him that Arthur, the handsome but odd boss, set off a bomb years ago in Detroit which killed someone. From there, Arthur's past as well as Dell's form the basis for the balance of this compelling narrative. Ford has a rich style that truly conveys the thoughts of this 10 year old as he observes the barren and sad existence he finds in a small all but forgotten town in Canada. This is very fine writing by one of our best, and certainly worth a read.

Basically the producers of this CD treated it like a piece of pop radio garbage, and once finished producing... they produced the worst audio I have heard in a long time!<br /><br />How could any self respecting audio professional not hear this flat compressed crap!?<br /><br />What makes this so sad, is the 'The Dark Knight' the 2nd film of this trilogy, well it's CD/vinyl soundtrack is fantastic, rich, tight, total separation on instruments and great spatial imaging. Most of all it sounds uncompressed, and not clipped, limited or compressed! What a pathetic way to end an amazing trilogy and what is a fantastic film and really has brilliant music by Hans Zimmer (on par with TDK) what a shame it can only be heard in it's original uncompressed form when watching the movie on Blu Ray. Not bad, but really sucks for music lovers.<br /><br />I even gave this CD a 2nd spin on a very high end system, and boy did it sound even worse!<br /><br />Bottom line - if you like great sounding hi fi or an audiophile, stay well clear from this CD - run from it!
0385738773|2.0|I agree with the others that stated that this book just was not a finisher. There are too many unanswered questions and the lack of character development was appalling. *SPOILERS* The race to Denver to the Crank Palace to save Newt and then back to WICKED was not well developed. Thomas trusts Gally again almost immediately which seems completely out of character yet he will not trust Teresa again. Teresa = threw him in a black hole in comparison to Gally = killed his best friend Chuck. Weird. And then at the end, the Flare was released as population control? What? Why? Why would a virus be chosen that makes people crazy and takes so long to kill? I am confused. Why not something that ends life quickly...especially if WICKED is good? I liked Book 1. Book 2 was ok. Book 3 was not good.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a yawner of a book, glad I checked it out from the library for my kindle, otherwise would have been a waste of my money if I had actually bought it. A lot of my coworkers had raved about it and I have to wonder why???? I could barely get half way thru the book before I gave up because of sheer boredom. I do read a lot of erotica thru novels or manga. S&M can be exciting in sex, just not in this book. The characters were really boring and the sex got boring to read about, same thing over and over. Ana really just got on my nerves, not much of a character here. If a guy had all this info on me suddenly, I'd have to complain to the police or something, I'd find that really creepy. I guess she didn't mind since she is empty-headed. To have to read the list of Christians over and over thru out the book, just numbs the brain, I had to skip huge chunks of pages before giving up.  Did the author think readers wouldn't notice all the repeating scenes over and over?? I don't want to hear about how her biting her lips was turning on the guy over and over. The characters kept repeating certain words, drove me nuts, stop the bad writing.Christian is not the perfect guy, rather dull. Why would someone want a controlling guy like this with so many hangups. I am strong willed and wouldn't stand for a guy like this. I guess lots of women must have boring sex if they think this book is exciting,but I guess it will expand some people's views. Don't see why this is a best seller???  Can someone tell me why you would find this book exciting??? Maybe you should expand your reading, lots of erotica out there that is better, just look it up on the search engines and look at reviews too.  Someone mentioned Anne Rice's  decent or is that --indecent \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" series,  theres also another oldie like \\"Story of O\\", and \\"Bondage-An Anthology of Passionate Restraint\\". I like yaoi manga, like the \\"Finder\\" series, Junjo Romantica,etc. If you really have to read this incredibly dull book, see if your local library has it so you won't waste your money. My library actually has a huge hold list for the books and the kindle version, pity the poor fools, but at least they won't be buying it, they will just waste their time like I did. Let me go back to reading Max Brooks' zombie series, much better. Hey, I think the zombies can write a better book than 50 shades, even with mush for brains. Or at least if you have insomnia, this book will help put you to sleep, it did me. I was reading it on the couch and before you know it, 50 shades put me to sleep. Than I knew to return this library book. Bonsoir.....

B007STBUIW|5.0|Jaws is one of my fav movies of all time. the fact that Universal is restoring it from the film's original negative is beyond awesome. For anybody who loves Jaws, then this blu ray is amust buy. And of course if you have a BD player. This blu ray is set to come with a boat load of bonus material (including some of my personal favorites The Shark is Still Working and the Making of Jaws.)I am furious that they only included the 1 hour and 40 minute version of The Shark is Still Working instead of the 3 hour version. I think universal wants to make a lot of dough so they keep holding back the longer better version of the shark is still working. But you know who am I to say they won't in the future, hopefully they do. Anyway, since they restored the film I think everyone should check out the Jaws the restoration 9 minute documentary in which they give an in depth process on the restoration of Jaws. Many people will want this blu ray so I pre ordered mine yesterday. This \\"New\\" \\"Cleaner\\" version of Jaws is supposed to be enhanced by the HD blu ray and have a 7.1 mono mix. Now isn't that exciting. This new Jaws be like watching a fresh new print so crystal clear it will be like picture for today's movie standards. Now, don't get me wrong Jaws could never have been a movie approved in this day and age because the special effects weren't that great compared to today's CGI crap. That is what makes Jaws a great classic. It was made in an age where there was no CGI and that's what made movies wholesome and great to watch back in the day. But, anyway, Jaws has held up all these years because it tapped into people's fears and made them scared of the water and sharks.<br />It really was known to be the title that was first called \\"The Summer Blockbuster.\\" The actors also give amazing performances and put all there hard efforts in to this film and making you believe that there is a dangerous shark that is out there killing people and the shark has to be killed. Hollywood better notruin this movie by doing a remake because you cannot remake Jaws and have a good outcome on the people. People have been inspired by this movie to study sharks, go into the movie business, and even become film makers because of this one great, scary, and glorious classic movie. I kow I'll be awaiting this awesome new blu ray release and even spending hours in my chair watching all the bonus material and the movie too.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|This book is so poorly written - not sure what all the fuss is about - I couldn't even finish it.  I wasn't expecting a literary masterpiece - just a bit of fun - but the writing is so bad that it made it impossible for me to keep reading.  Don't waste your money!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this app and its the best thing out there and its really fun and its awesome and I could go on and on bout this app

B005K17RU0|2.0|the time for where I live at was not correct. heck the time on my kindle fire was wrong so I fixed that in which it was a hour off. so the time for this app,which was a hour off. also was then 20 min fast.
B006ZMMBU4|1.0|Thought I was ordering a dvd and what I received was a download. A rip off. Tried to cancell because the download would be of no use the DVD was for a gift.
B002VECLVY|4.0|Style! rich and sophisticated. meaty subject and told well... yet somehow felt lacking in evoking something that felt fresh and meaningful. hard to find the right words.<br />it seemed to make me want walk away transformed and deeply effected. but it didn't quite deliver that. I hoped it would but it didn't. still I had to buy it because it looks better than any movie that presently comes to mind.<br />it's a sophisticated visual  style-catalogue.  makes me wish it were a store to shop at more than a movie that could've sat next to LIFE is Beautiful, and Saving Private Ryan, or Philadelphia.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is ok but some of the games are pointless. the air hockey game is impossible but tor free it is ok
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is the bomb belive me when I say that its way eaiser. than swampy will ever be more than 1 characters doc d taunts you to make the game more interesting. BUY IT.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is not a book I would generally read but the reviews made it tempting. Boy, was I pleased! Recommended!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game! It is a very good way to clear your mind of the stress of the day! Really like the bigger boxes.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I stayed up all night reading this until I was finished! It was too good to put down. I was on an emotional roller coaster with the characters.
034580404X|5.0|These were by far the best books I've read! They were definately worth the wait to get as I've read them twice now in the month that I've had them.
B008MEM24S|3.0|Love the game but after about 10 minutes it freezes up my phone (Samsung Vibrant) and i have to restart phone. Fun game though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|smut is the best way to describe this book. I didn't even finish it. Not well written way to drug out and no real plot but dirty sex
0061733199|5.0|I read several great reviews about this book.  It certainly measured up to and surpassed all of the reviews.  What I will keep close at hand, after reading all the way through and reviewing often.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great time waster for bored kids on car trips. kept them calm, quiet and happy. moms happy, dads happy, thank you!
B008N1V11U|5.0|the game is great but I'm just not in to the whole mouths not moving really irritates makes me mad
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Started wonderfully.  Flopped way before the finish.  (I wonder how many other reviewers finished the book before writing their reviews).  Overall it gave me back some long lost geek memories and that in itself was worthwhile.  That does not make it a 4+ book however.<br /><br />I grew up through the 80s, so all the music, video games and general culture references of the 80s made the first 50-100 pages enthralling.  I was regularly laughing or commenting out loud.  The plot build is also fairly engaging as you learn about the world, players,  and specific challenge for the character.  I was very into the book.  I'd have rated the first third of the book at a 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Then it starts to drag on.<br /><br />The character is clearly over obsessing  (and needs to) and that gets really annoying after a few hours of reading.  It starts not too matter if you like the bit of culture or remember hating it because Wade (our main character) will not SHUT UP about it.  And the author regularly uses 4 or 5, often redundant, sentences to describe a concept which is evident in one.<br /><br />And it got boring.  By the third act, or before,  you really want to have an established set of consistent ground rules which make some sense and don't radically change with some real tension about how things are going to play out.  A couple \\"aha! that was clever!\\" moments as the character exploits this setup.  There is none of that.  The rules change, or new ones added, and inevitability and linearity of the last 1/3 of the book made me worried.  I was hoping it'd all be worthwhile with an interesting climatic twist or payoff of some sort.  And after all, there's a finish to a massive quest, a good vs. bad guy confrontation).  ZZzzzz.  Doesn't happen..in fact it seems like the author realized he was just churning his wheels here and blindly ran to the finish.<br /><br />The overall quality of the writing is average.  This in itself wasn't a huge distraction early on but stood out as the end of the book dragged.t as the end of the book dragged.
0307719219|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It is very easy to read. It is an incredibly enjoyable economic history of the world.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Phineas and Ferb meets where's my water. Win win situation! Challenges are fun, and doesn't feel like the same old game.
B0058U0EEO|4.0|Spacey and sythy (is that a word?) tunes that hipsters will be telling everyone \\"they gotta listen to\\" right after the sun goes down on a summer night. All cliches aside about the whole Chillwave genre, it's a nice album, but much more composed and processed than the first and I really like it quite a lot. I think that's due to the fact he has better gear to work with and isn't composing his songs in his living room, but a studio.  I wouldn't say the album is better or worse, it's just different.<br />If FEEL IT ALL AROUND was the standout track of Life of Leisure, EYES BE CLOSED is this album's hit and it's really, really good. SOFT, BEFORE and AMOR FATI are also excellent.<br />I hope he keeps going because he really is the best of the Chillwavers our there.<br />All that said, I enjoyed it very much as it's pretty and pleasing. And dammit, it really does sound good on a warm summer night with friends! Not sure why, but Washed Out is just the perfect artist for the opening credits on \\"Portlandia.\\"
B007Y6OZE0|1.0|Cruisin' California (bumpin' in my trunk) --- I'm speechless.  Nominee for one of the worst songs ever.<br /><br />This whole CD was garbage.  Been listening to the Offspring since the beginning, and even had a chance to see them at a lil joint in Houston before Smash made them superstars.  They have a lot more talent than they put on this CD.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY it will only encourage this behavior.  They need some tough love.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|If there were just one app in this whole earth to chose, the choice id easy, it would have herb evernote. Can't leave without it.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|the game is very fun but it won't let me use any of my glu credits I earn. fix that and it will be great
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A wonderful gritty fantasy. What I love about this particular story is that the hero is competent, stoic and thoughtful while lacking any whiny qualities that some fantasies seem to foist on the lead character - a welcome change. There are reviews here with fairly comprehensive synopsis should you need one - all I can say is that this is a very worthy purchase.<br /><br />Sadly, as I understand it, we'll have to wait till 2013 before we get to see the next book due to the author (deservedly) signing a proper book deal.
B00785P2QC|3.0|it's an alright game. fairly confusing for most of the time. I do not know if I will keep the game
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I wasn't disappointed in the story itself.  I bought the first book quite by accident using the one-click option.  I had a $10 gift credit, so it didn't cost me anything.  George RR Martin has created an incredible world with detailed and interesting characters, a nice battle between good and evil, magic, dragons, mages, monsters, and all the intrigues and politics, backstabbing, and plotting of Royalty, The Royal Court, and the different Houses.  It's all combined in a new and refreshing tale that carries over into a series that has kept me happily occupied for weeks.  What I am disappointed in is that this book was:<br /><br /> 1) Split into two parts because it got to be too big for one book.<br /> 2) The price of the last book in the series was jacked up to almost double the price of the rest of the books for a Kindle download.  How very disappointing.<br /><br />As for myself, I am disabled and spend a lot of my free time reading books. I enjoy reading books in series, as it creates more character detail, more plot development, and usually a long story that I can get into.  I've been reading and re-reading Jordan's Wheel of Time series for 20+ years, patiently waiting for the last book to come out.  I was disappointed that it was split into 3 books because it was too long also.<br /><br />My husband got me my Kindle as a Christmas present, and I have downloaded almost 150 books and read them since, in addition to the hard copy books I've read.  On a limited income, the large majority of those are free Kindle downloads, gift card purchases, or used books.  I'm on a fixed income; so, not only can I not afford to pay almost double for the last book, I refuse to pay such a jacked-up price just to read the end of the story.<br /><br />I'm sorry.  Good series.  Good book in the series.  Bad policies on pricing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's hard to believe this book made the New York Times bestseller list. The book is trash and not worth your time or money!
B001ZDEOLM|5.0|Theta Healing by Vianna Stibal is a remarkable book. I am a spiritual healer and am deeply impressed by the generosity of her information. Unlike many healers who choose to leave out important aspects of their work so you have to pay to take their courses, Vianna holds back nothing and gives all of her knowledge. Page 26 is the core of her methodology. I recommend every one who choses to reconnect with themselves and Higher Power to follow her guidance and practice, practice, practice. I have been meditating, seeing visions and working on my spiritual expansion for 40 years. Vianna has offered her truth for those who are ready for it. I recommend this book highly.
B0087DFIOU|5.0|I think this movie is really good. I thought it was going to be a junk-food-big-stupid-action movie but I was surprised. The action really only starts at act 3 and the first two acts are all character stuff and expanding on the idea of the main character being a 'fish out of water'. I loved Mel Gibson in this and this is a flick that I will be re-watching because it was so fun to watch.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Draw Something on Kindle Fire was really fun and really addicting when I first got for the first 3-4 weeks, and I really enjoyed it.  But after a while, it kind of seems like a chore to keep it going.  I've had it for about a month and a half now and haven't deleted it.  The fact that you can buy more colors with the coins you earn from playing (you don't use real money) makes you want to keep playing though, so that's probably what's making me keep this game. Overall, I would say its a pretty fun game if you like addicting games where you play other people, and its worth it since it's free. Note that it is a lot easier to use on a tablet rather than a phone because the screen is bigger.
B000VXJYFI|4.0|Completely different band line up than the previous 3 studio albums. WAY funkier! Recorded mostly live so there is some noise, but overall I'd say this is one of my favorite Hendrix albums.

B0078ZYXSA|5.0|To put things in perspective, this is the worst Dexys Midnight Runners album.  It does not compare to the Dexys first two albums, which for this American reviewer, breathed the streets of England into my suburban bedroom and created an energy and musical philosophy that thrilled me like no other band did.  Rush and Iron Maiden were my mainstays back then but for some reason, Dexys first two albums soon became two of the greatest albums I have ever owned.  The difficult third album followed and while the lack of cohesion forces that album to stumble once or twice, Rowland's strong vision and willingness to follow the muse wherever it takes him- mid-song conversations, anyone?- elevates the album to near great heights.<br />  \\"One Day I'm Going To Soar\\" is the worst of these four albums but that being said, it is also a great album. IF it had been released in 1987, it would have sounded like a logical follow-up to \\"Don't Stand Me Down\\".  The music tends to settle into slow jams quite frequently and Kevin's tendency to talk in the middle of a song has not gone away.  The last 27 years never happened, musically, but for a band as confident in its roots as Dexys, it doesn't matter.  The music contains a swagger that announces that Dexys is back and having fun.<br />  \\"Now\\" opens the album low key and a little sultry, setting the stage for the horns and drums to announce themselves with energy and get the song moving along with a little more strut.  \\"Lost\\" and \\"Me\\" are slower numbers, slightly jazzy, highlighting Rowland's vocal chops.  It is during \\"She Got a Wiggle\\" that the band hits its stride.  The groove sounds like a Boz Scaggs outtake or a Steely Dan track from \\"Aja\\"- solid, crisp, smooth, funk.  Rowland's vocals are low key yet suggestive and contrast nicely with the female vocalist haunting the background.<br />  \\"I'm Always Going to Love You\\" is Rowland at his indulgent best, singing his love to a woman who, when she returns the feeling, discovers that Rowland has changed his mind.  He just isn't the type of guy who falls in love.  They argue, playfully, and the music marches on in a slow jam, disco style.  Awesome song.<br />  If you are looking for the Dexys to come up with something new, or if you are simply looking for another \\"Come On Eileen\\", then you may be disappointed.  What they have come up with, however, is an album of confident tracks, performed with style and swagger, played by a band that seems to really enjoy making music.  I have not played a new album on repeat so much since I first got \\"Don't Stand Me Down\\" in 1985.<br />  Dexys is back and the fans have reason to celebrate.  If not a fan, check out their first two albums first to get a better sense of where they are coming from. Or, buy this album and enjoy!has changed his mind.

B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I really like this... it is much easier to read blogs now, I always had trouble sorting through my blogs,  because I am subscribed. to A LOT of sewing blogs.  I only wish I was able to gain access to the blog through the reader after I have read them. unless I favorite a particular blog post. But overall I really like it.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I got this short story from Amazon while it was free. It was extremely entertaining and I could not put it down! In this book we learn more about Ophelia, who we met in The Forever girl, and I enjoyed this book right from the beginning! I felt as tho i was thrown into the early 1800s with how well the scenery was portrayed and I loved learning her history. I only wish that this story could have been longer! I would have loved to see more build up between Ophelia and Ethan before the 'love' word was being used but considering this is not a full book I understand why it worked out that way. This is one of my favorite new series and I cant hardly wait to get more Ophelia, Sophia, and others in future stories!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I bight where's my water to see what all the fuss was about. :) and became addicted.  My 11 month oldcl daughter loves to watch Phineas and Ferb, as do both my husband and I,  so when I saw this game I had to get it to try it out. and I think I am on my way to being addicted to it. :)
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|cant stand this game. love the concept and played many of the same type. I have to give the developer credit for creating a ton of levels, keeps you going for hours. sounds are irritating. the constant chirps are annoying as heck, play this with the sound off or your own music running. my biggest problem is with the physics. horrible horrendous crap. inconsistent as heck, one level will allow you to crush pigs and blocks with reckless abandon while the next requires you to relentlessly pound on same objects with almost no effect. if you like mindlessly flinging things at walls you'll like this one. me I'm uninstalling. there's much better out there
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is King's best work since The Stand. It might be the best novel I've read in the last ten years. Loved it. Don't like horror stories you say? This isn't one of those. This is just one damned good story wrapped in a little bit of science fiction.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|once u get the rhythm and hang of the game it is great! playing on a pad is not quite like working with a mouse so there is a slight learning curve. fun to try and find the clovers and reach those hard to reach pots of gold.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|It helps me keeping track of everything. The best thing about Wunderlist is, that it's available on almost every platform , so i'm able to access my todos everywhere and at any time :)
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is really fun. I think that being a spellcaster is the best because he she can hit long ditance
B007XNAOS0|5.0|Must have listened to both albums 20 times. Fantastic music and fantastic artwork. Baroness is by far one of my favorite bands. And their willingness to experiment with their sound is just one of the many reasons they're so great.
0451205766|4.0|I read this book, because my friends recommended it. I am not disappointed. First 30% of the book is interesting, next 20% of the book is boring, and the last 50% of the book is interesting, so I give it a 4 star. I read last 50% of the book at a stretch in one night. The story is about an Italian Don and his family in America. The story revolves around the power struggle among the mafia family's of America and gives a good detail of internal working of Mafia. Don is a self made man and is very smart and logical. He has three sons and a daugther. The youngest son Michael is against the family business and tries to stay away from it, but his family lends up in a critical situation and Michael is forced to involve in the family's business for his family's good. The Don's character is impeccable. His negotiation skill, thought process, and forward thinking is intriguing, and I am sure anyone will be impressed by it. Book is written in a very good way and kept me interested. Overall, the book is a good read, I recommend it.<br /><br />Happy reading !!!
B0011UBDTK|4.0|So I bought this item trying to avoid the customer reviews of 'poor quality of disks.'<br />As I started watching, when I was in second season the episodes began to freeze, i was playing the disks on my DVD Player, however, everything looked just fine when I started watching on my Blu Ray Player.<br />I love the package! It's beautiful. So I highly recommend it, just be sure to play the disks con your Blu Ray!

B0041KKYGU|4.0|I understood, beforehand, that this film is permeated with smut and gross-out humor which aren't generally my cup of tea.  However on this occasion, I found myself craving some silly fluff that might be entertaining and keep me from thinking too much. And so this film succeeded quite well in that department.  SPOILER ALERT -  However there were some serious moral quandries which I didn't care for, in that blantantly illegal deeds (involving theft, drug use on school grounds and academic cheating) went unpunished. The abrupt ending with the sardonic and relatively impoverished gym teacher didn't make much sense either.  But as fluff, it suceeds very well and get 4-Stars for the effort..
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is one of the greatest love stories ever I have watched this movie over 30 times and i still cry!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has made daily reading more enjoyable and so easy!  I love having the reminders.  And&hellip; there is so much to choose from!  I highly recommend the YouVersion Bible app!
B001UV4XFG|4.0|I wish it was bilingual by being in English or Spanish. I am a Spanish major at the University and it would help to have another movie to practice listening skills with.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Nothing changes:  still a whole lot of sex scenes.  I'd say eighty percent of the more than 1,500 pages of the trilogy relates the myriad of ways that the protagonists Christian and Ana have sex.  So I believe I was right to say in my book 2 review that this can really be a sex atlas sans the illustration.  Even the epilogue was not spared!<br /><br />In this final installment (or are there more sequels coming?), Christian becomes almost \\"normal\\", having been freed from most of his inner demons.  The author has put bonus materials at the end:  a peek at a young Christian Grey; and the first and second meetings of Christian and Ana, as related by Christian this time.  For a while there, I thought there'd be sex scenes again!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong... I enjoy sexy, steamy love scenes in romance novels!  But Fifty Shades is just way over the top for my taste.  I'd never thought I'd say this about a romance novel, but really, I'm so relieved that I'm done reading it!
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.
B005HEX8QC|4.0|It was only a matter of time, but it's happened B'Elanna's pregnant...WITH NEELIX'S CHILD!!! *duh duh duh* haha jk<br /><br />Actually I shouldn't joke this episode deals with some pretty serious deep seeded issues B'Elanna's never talked about. The pregnancy brings up memories of her family and her hatred of being part Klingon, and she doesn't want her child to experience the same hardships. No space battles or diplomatic first contacts here, but it's still one of the better episodes for B'Elanna's character.
B000059XUI|5.0|My son and I love to watch this movie many times over.  He loves it!  I have enjoyed revisiting it after so many years.
B005HEPJBO|4.0|Seven (to EMH): \\"You became sexually aroused in MY BODY!\\"<br /><br />Yep and that's not even the weirdest quote from this episode haha<br />Jeri Ryan's impersonation of Doc is spot on, but still it can get a a little tiring in large doses.<br />[ 3.5 out of 5 ]
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game!!!! this is a very fun and addicting game!i would recommend this game if you get bored
B005HEVVOI|3.0|This episode is about as sterotypical as they come. B'Elanna acts the like typical over-emotional, bury-my-feelings, can't-be-satisfied-ever woman and Tom is the typical DUDE that does dude stuff while being insensitive to the woman's \\"needs\\". And Neelix reaches an all time low in my book when he acts like B'Elanna best girlfriend (you know the fat ugly one that never gets a date) as he proceeds to talk trash about Tom and how he should cater to her every whim like a castrated man slave.<br /><br />Aside from the relationship turmoil a space race is also happening...I don't know how they did it...but they managed to make a freaking RACE IN SPACE WITH SPACESHIPS boring. I didn't think that was possible...<br /><br />Well....the race suits looked cool at least, so props to wardrobe....
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use this from everything from college research to recipes. works great. although I wish it would take pictures of the websites you clip.
B005HEVVAM|4.0|To appreciate this episode you have to like the Seven of Nine character, and the relationships she's formed aboard Voyager. But in my opinion it's one of the best written and acted episodes, even if it's central plot is very sad and sappy. It's good to see Seven finally breaking down, and the bonds between her and the crew grow stronger.<br /><br />Side Note: This episode was supposed to air after the next episode, a friends told me this, and I just confirmed it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|easy to learn almost impossible to put down looks like a subway map worth at least 99 cents bends the mind
0345803485|1.0|Once upon a time a friend recommended a book to me. \\"It's amazing\\" she said, \\"I couldn't put it down\\". Knowing that this friend and I share similar interests, that she is a fan of great authors like Robin Hobb, Patrick Rothfuss, and J.R.R.Tolkien, I started reading the aforementioned book with great expectations.<br /><br />I never finished it.<br /><br />About half way through I started getting headaches as my brain, unable to cope with the flat characters, appauling use of the English language, terrible plot line and repetitive narrative, decided to persistently pound within my skull in a ever growing warning that continued reading of this book would result in a meltdown of my higher functions.<br /><br />Being the intelligent sort, I valued my brain enough to heed it's advice and I put down the book, shaking my head in wonder and profound disappointment that something so terribly juvenile could ever top the Bestseller's list. That book was Twilight. I thought my opinion of the general populace could not drop any lower.<br /><br />Then 50 Shades came out.<br /><br />I never finished this book either, I have absolutely no intention of subjection myself to such torture. It reads like the sub-par Twilight Fan fiction it is, and it is beyond me how it ever left the forums. Not only does the author have less understanding of how to write than a 6 year old, but it is painfully obvious she has done absolutely no research at all. I doubt any thought has gone into this book. Putting aside the characters so unrealistic they wouldn't even be allowed in a Disney movie, the constant used of British English is at odds with the American setting. Then there is the frankly offensive portrayal of BDSM. The author seems to have completely missed the point and purpose of BDSM, taking away the key element of trust which is what most BDSM practioners hold at the heart of anything they do (I learnt this much in a 1 hour tv show on Channel 4), but the way Christian treat Ana is, as someone who has witness the terrible effects of an abusive relationship, disgusting to my mind. He's not a catch, he's a sadist at best, and mentally unstable at worst.<br /><br />The book has left me wondering, yet again, what the Hell is wrong with people. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it.

0345803485|1.0|This book on soooooo many levels made me sick. Poorly written, unbelievable characters in the story.... I will stop here cause I am not trying to be mean, but this book making New York Times best seller dis-credits the New York Times Best seller.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|A bit unconvinced by the single &#34;Tattoo&#34; back in February 2012, I mindlessly dismissed this album because of concerns of how such a long hiatus would impact the chemistry of the (now in their 50s) David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen.  I now wish I could go back and buy it on Day 1. What the group has delivered here, despite the near 30 year gap of their partnership, is an unrelenting romp and begs comparison to their earliest sounds. Is it better than Van Halen I or the likes of 1984? No, but in many places, it competes with any of their earliest work and even at times, is indistinguishable from their heyday under the unmistakable showmanship of Roth and the mind-blowing finger tapping of Eddie.  To test this observation, I loaded this album with all of my numerous favorite tracks from 78-84. To my pleasant surprise, many times over I mistook one of Truth's songs for that of their heyday. I've heard that some of the tracks were kicked back up from of their early unrecorded songs. If this is a disappointment to you, don't let it be. Using early rough material as a spring board and also adding new songs is a perfect recipe to confirm the resurrection of this once great and truly influential rock groups.  The intro riffs of She's the Woman, You and Your Blues, Outta Space and Beats Workin' boast classic Van Halen sounds that are immediately recognizable. The one-note bass pulsing and screaming solo work of Big River tempts plenty of headbang impulse. Chinatown and Bullethead are some of the most up-tempo songs I can remember in any of the Van Halen library. The face melting solo and sprawling outtro of As Is (another rapid-fire track) left me with goosebumps.  So if the music is there, it leaves only one question -- how are David Lee Roth's vocals? A subjective questions but for me, above average mostly. Even cynically, they're at least as good as can be hoped for at this point in his career. His lyrics are still largely rooted in free-spirited adolescence, which to me is a relief. While it's true he has lost a bit of range, it was never a detraction for me listening to the album. The screeching choruses of You and Your Blues and Blood & Fire  dispel any worries of Roth's place here.  Perhaps the album's strongest track is Blood and Fire, a rangy number that is rich with tempo change but all sounding seamless. It quite honestly belongs in the discussion of any of Van Halen's finest songs.  Even Tattoo, the fan-debated single that is actually more vintage VH than many people realize, was the first track to get stuck in my head.  In the end, it's apparent that Roth's charisma (albeit corny at times) seems to be the perfect kickstart for Eddie's riffs, the thumps of Alex's drums and the heavy-laden bass brought to life by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. Speaking of, I know many fans felt spited by the exclusion of fan-favorite bassist Michael Anthony, but this album only happened largely because of Wolfgang's excitement towards the idea. And trust me, your annoyance will desappear quickly under the thunder of Wolfie's bass -- he BRINGS IT for this record.  Looking at the grand timeline, Eddie may have struggled with Roth's antics from time to time, but this album edges the notion that the two are the best thing that has ever happened to the other.  In the end, A Different KInd of Truth brings out something I've felt was missing from Van Halen since 1984 -- fun. Any Roth or early VH fan should check it out immediately.  Hopefully they'll squeeze out another before their time together is done.
B0014NDXGA|3.0|Having used Bushnell Range finders for golf for a number of years I was excited to try the new Bushnell Tour V2 range finder.<br />I am very disappointed to find that you get so many false readings that you have to guesstimate the correct reading.  I was playing yesterday with two other guys using the same Bushnell Tour range finder and they were having the same problems.<br />In addition I have gone through 3 Lithium batteries in the last four months since my purchase.  Calling Bushnell for information on my problems doesn't help.  They put you on hold so long that you eventually hang up.<br />My suggestion is get the older model Bushnell or try another brand.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Dreadful, dreadful writing. Completely unbelieveable elements in the storyline - not that there was much of one.  But how many college students do you know that don't have a computer, e-mail address or mobile phone for a start.<br />I trawled through the first book, thinking \\"it has to get better\\".  Unfortunately not.  So I started the second one (I know stupid me), and it was just more of the same, repeated over and over and over and over ............and over.<br />I just couldn't finish it.  I discussed it with a friend who had finished all three books (admittedly skimming through the second and third) to get the abridged version.  Seems I didn't miss anything not reading them myself. They never got any better.<br />Ugh, the best part of these books was getting rid of them.  The worms might enjoy them as mulch, but please remember to shred them first.<br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!

If you read the product description carefully, you'll see that. Otherwise, you might think you'll get the USB maximum of 480megabits/second out of it on a GigE network. You won't.

B007VTVGAQ|1.0|I have been a huge Fiona fan since she burst on the the music scene with Tidal. Extraordinary Machine is actually my favorite of her albums. When I saw this new album at Starbucks I purchased it immediately.<br /><br />I keep trying to enjoy this album, but there is nothing to enjoy. A few songs start off promising, but then she starts yelling or making some guttural sounds that just kill the song. Overall every song sounds exactly the same and none of them really does anything to provoke any type of emotion in me...other than boredom.<br /><br />I will keep listening and hope it grows on me...which is difficult when all I want to do is skip to the next song...then switch to a different CD.
B006LSZECO|2.0|the writing and character development were absolutely superb...some of the best of both categories that i have ever read.  but the ending, the final page was so incredibly frustrating that i wish i never read this.  she made me care so much for these people, and then gave me no closure.

B00009YOQW|5.0|got this toy for my nephew. his counselors at school mentioned he is not doing well with following sound patterns (which will ultimately help him with understanding syllabols).  i got him one drum, and his older brother another.  i had his brother play a sound on the drum (like 4 taps in a row) and have the little guy repeat that. it worked for him with up to 3 taps and then he gets confused. so he needs work, but i think the drums are a fun way to get him there.  the sound they make are not annoyingly loud either.  so they can both play with them and not bother me to much, which is a plus!

0060558121|3.0|In \\"American Gods\\", the various deities which immigrants to America believed in all manifest themselves as humanoid beings. These \\"old gods\\" struggle to remain relevant and support themselves as the people increasingly lose faith in them and cease their old rituals. \\"New gods\\" - representatives of ideas and things which people worship in some form such as the internet and trains - are created and struggle with the old gods to maintain superiority. The portrayal of these gods as almost human is what sets this book apart from most fantasy. While the gods do have a side to themselves which is more typical of gods in stories, the majority of the story deals with their more human condition and interactions. I was only able to identify a few of the gods included, but that didn't detract from enjoying the book.<br /><br />Shadow is a regular guy just out of prison who gets caught up in the war between the gods. After learning his wife cheated on him and was killed, he doesn't have much left. He's hired by Wednesday, one of the more powerful old gods, as a henchman. Most of the book is told from Shadow's perspective so naturally he's the most important character. Despite this, I didn't feel his character was fleshed out enough. Quite often Shadow just went along with things, a quality which is in line with his wife's assertion at one point that he's not really \\"alive\\". I would've liked to have learned more about why he is the way he is. The little we do learn wasn't enough for me to form a strong opinion about him. As a result, I was able to associate with his character somewhat, but not enough to truly care about what happened to him. This is a problem when he's the main character.<br /><br />Overall I found the story interesting but lacking. Some of the most enjoyable sections were the ones telling some side stories about the origins of some of the gods or their current activities, such as a djinn getting involved with a taxi driver. The main story was compelling at times but also occasionally tedious. It is very descriptive but could've used a little more character development and a lot more emotion.but also occasionally tedious.

B00198X0WC|5.0|where's the blu-ray for this great movie? Most really good movies now days are out within 6 months of theatrical releases and it's been about 25 years for the Abyss and still no Blu. I just don't understand why a company wouldn't produce a Blu that would bring in millions for them. The Titanic is another film that will bring in a ton of money when it comes out in September. Why the wait?
B005LAIHY0|5.0|It appears that many reviewers of Prometheus want to connect it with other films and then complain that too many connections were made to other films.  This reviewer suggests that you should see the film with an open mind and not excessive preconception.  First off, there are absolutely zero tacky scenes in the film.  Director and producer Ridley Scott went to great lengths to avoid rehashing of motifs that have been made trite by all the loosely related films subsequent to Aliens.  By avoiding the gratuitous nature of these films, he has made more subtle suggestions regarding the origins of themes commonly found in the Alien universe.  Additionally, the plot and story are fascinating to consider.  Subjects ranging from the origins of humanity to the relationship between a creator and the created are addressed without providing concrete answers or overwhelming the audience.  And just to note, if you want a film that does all the thinking for you, then you should ask yourself why you want to see this film to begin with.  In other words, Prometheus is not simplistic summer schwag.  Finally, this film has an unbelievably cool sense of style.  It is refreshing to know that there are still directors that can merge kinetics with creative camera angles to construct action sequences that actually contribute to the story.  It is difficult to ask for more from Prometheus than what is already delivered.

This band has a lot of music left in them so I expect nothing but strong albums in the future, if you get a chance to see this band live please do yourself the pleasure because it really is a treat. so yes this album is fantastic!!

B005LAII94|3.0|Oliver Stone's Savages had an awesome trailer... that was probably the best aspect of the movie, the movie itself was a pretty bland revenge story that was shot beautifully, for a guns-blazing type of story though Oliver Stone sure made it drag, I felt like I was sitting in the theater for 4 hours watching this, similar to when I watched Natural Born Killers that dragged on like a carcass as well.<br /><br />The characters were really standard, we have California girl, ex-marine hardass, and stoner-genius Buddhist, all as a threeway couple that only exists in Oliver Stone's mind. Hell the Mexican gang members had more character to them, Salma Hayek balancing being a drug lord and a single mother and Benicio Del Toro being a sadistic henchman with higher aspirations, while John Travolta is hammy as always as a corrupt FBI agent. The stoner-genius' employees all seemed like they belonged in a Mac commercial and really didn't serve much purpose to the overall movie, stoner-genius could've just said \\"I've got our tracks covered\\", and BAM! 20 minutes cut down.<br /><br />The saving grace of Savage's characters however is that they're all played incredibally well, the actors breathe life into these stale hollow stereotypes and make them empathetic real people, really impressive on the actors parts, especially the guy who played stoner-genius and Salma Hayek. O herself seemed more like a fantasy character to get this whole story in motion but she was O-k (didja gettit??). Benecio Del Toro was wonderful, and I never thought I'd care to see him and John Travolta in the same room, but the scene where they were together was wonderful, they played off each other like a game of tennis. If you're a Benecio fan another movie similar-ish to this that I'd recommend is Way of the Gun, another hostage taken over the border thing.<br /><br />Savages had a really nice style to it though which I'm sure you can tell just by that cover, it captured Southern California and Mexico perfectly and the main characters I could easily see living there.<br /><br />The Story was really, REALLY, basic, a California girl gets kidnapped and her two boyfriends (only in Oliver Stone's fantasy) will do whatever it takes to get her back from the Mexican Cartel or whoever that kidnapped her. There's about 30 minutes well establishing who the characters are and how they live their good lives, the calm before the storm I guess, then after the girl gets kidnapped the guys go over for a bit what to do and how to do it, and eventually they decide to attack one of their deals and pin it on one of their own men, problem with that is this whole part takes about an hour. For the most part we see the Cartel trying to figure out what happened, *snooze*.<br /><br />Then when we finally get to the ending scene they do a standard hostage tradeoff that goes in opposite directions for no apparent reason. At first we see the guys shoot all the Mexicans, then the stoner-genius gets shot in the throat and the marine and the girl basically commit suicide so they can die with him, then suddenly we hear \\"but that's how I wish it'd go down\\" and suddenly we see them back at the same deal 2 minutes ago and a helicoptor pops out and arrests Salma Hayek while everyone else gets away scott-free, WHAT?!??! Not only does Oliver Stone give us a false ending for NO REASON, he goes with the most cliche happy ending that completely contradicts the trailer/opening of the movie where the girl says \\"I'm not alive by the end of this\\", yeah bulls***. Also why did she want everyone to die? It's like Oliver Stone used the last couple of pages of the script to wipe his ass then threw it at the production company and told them to interpret that into the story.<br /><br />Also an interesting aspect in the story that was just dropped which was when the Cartel saw the weakness in stoner-genius and made him finish killing someone they tortured, meanwhile O is watching on a security camera. They could've gone manyways with this, O getting Stockholm's Syndrome because she sees what horrible things her lover did, the guys turning 'savage' on the Cartel and executing Salma Hayek's daughter after getting O back, so much damn potential and they pretty much just forget about that part and we see the three of them holding hands and smiling in Indonesia or something, blech.<br /><br />My main problem with Savages is that almost nothing happens story-wise, it's so straightforward, the Cartel kidnaps someone the guys love, so they kidnap someone the head-honcho loves and they tradeoff, all that other stuff going on in the story just felt like filler because it doesn't change anyone's course of action throughout the dragging 2 hours, leaving the whole experience feeling rather vapid and pointless. I didn't read the book so I don't know how it plays out there but simply from a movie standpoint the story could've used a few rewrites and an editor. The whole reason Savages exists is cinematic catharsis for gringos who are frustrated with all the horrendous acts going on right across the border, and little more.ways with this, O getting Stockholm's Syndrome because she sees what horrible things her lover did, the guys turning 'savage' on the Cartel and executing Salma Hayek's daughter after getting O back, so much damn potential and they pretty much just forget about that part and we see the three of them holding hands and smiling in Indonesia or something, blech.<br /><br />My main problem with Savages is that almost nothing happens story-wise, it's so straightforward, the Cartel kidnaps someone the guys love, so they kidnap someone the head-honcho loves and they tradeoff, all that other stuff going on in the story just felt like filler because it doesn't change anyone's course of action throughout the dragging 2 hours, leaving the whole experience feeling rather vapid and pointless.

B005LAIIS0|3.0|Call me a sucker for survival stories but when I first watched the Grey I expected Liam Neeson going out into the woods to punch wolves or something, so the story seemed dumb at first, but after watching it the first time I was blown away, it was entertaining throughout and each of the characters had more depth than I was expecting for this type of movie, it was tense, horrifying, exhilirating, and exciting.<br /><br />Then I watched it the second time with my girlfriend and she basically ruined it for me, somehow she knew that his wife was dead the whole time, asked how Liam Neeson fell out of the plane when he was buckled to three seats and there was no evidence that the seats themselves fell out, pointed out how the wolves politely waited for the men to have their moments talking with each other before attacking, and how Liam Neeson wasn't shivering violently after coming out of the freezing water. Damn.<br /><br />So maybe a bunch of dudes out in the wild fighting for survival is just a guy thing, so yeah it was a bit stupid at parts but I still found it very entertaining, and not something I'd expect from the director of Smokin' Aces and Narc. Also considering how many times Liam Neeson recited that poem they'd call this film The Fray?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I must agree with other reviews that the original 5 installments in the Wool tale are a wonderful, engaging example of masterful story telling. While the 6th installment, because it is a prequel, scratches that itch of readers to know how the story setting began, it is not required for the original 5 segments to shine. I look forward to more of the story, but Mr. Howey will be hard-pressed to recreate the edge-of-the-seat suspense in any sequels. Still, I whole  heartedly recommend the Omnibus edition. It is a  perfect vacation read.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|\\"Rooms\\" is a well-written book about women who have been imprisoned and kept as a sex slave, and the indomitable spirit that it takes to break out.
