B00BD99JMW|4.0|I don't know why people complain about the book, it's really good, the end was shocking and sad, but I kinda expected it from Tris, so no complains here, read it with an open mind and you'll enjoy it.

006202406X|4.0|Writing is a difficult journey where the author cannot please everyone.<br />Veronica Roth was very brave in taking her characters to places others would<br />not let theirs go.<br />I have discovered with my own writings that the road less traveled can be a difficult<br />route at times.<br />I enjoyed the first two books as they were somewhat predictable, not in storyline<br />but in plot and that is how we like our stories. Hence those are why we select the<br />certain genre.<br />This met her standard in quality, but I simply wanted the &#34;hollywood ending&#34;, and<br />she in her route took a brave step.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|This movie was comical and entertaining while still being serious and showing the harsh reality of how black maids were treated. Great movie for anyone over 13!
B00B2QG3K2|2.0|I downloaded this album and then when I was driving out of town I put all my Paramore albums on shuffle. All the songs from this album stuck out, and not in a good way. I would be jamming out to Hallelujah or CrushCrushCrush or something similar and then one of these songs would come on and I seriously would be like what the heck is this. I tried to listen and give it a chance, but I never made it through to the end of any of the songs without wanting to go back to their older albums, which I do really like. I don't know how this can be called Paramore - the sound is COMPLETELY different. I personally don't like it, but I can see how this might get them into some new markets. If you're looking for a new Paramore album, you're out of luck. This is a completely different band.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|Book Review: Beyond Oria Falls: Dwellers Of Ahwahnee Book 2<br />By: Sheryl Seal<br /><br />The story of soulmate love, family togetherness, true friendship, courage, good, and evil all wrapped up in magic continues.  Sheryl Seal continues to remind her readers how talented of a writer she is in ”Beyond Oria Falls: Dwellers Of Ahwahnee Book 2.  Who's creative storytelling ability captivates, leaving you wanting more.  I have read book 1, now book 2, and can't wait till book 3 is released from the, ”Dwellers Of Ahwahnee” series.  I truly would love to see this book series as a movie series.  I have not found a book series that can take me on a journey in a long time.<br /><br />Book 2 starts off with a brief introduction of book 1.  Then taking you right to the point where book 1 ended and continued seamlessly.  This way you never miss a beat.  Trust me, you would not want to.  The sections in book 2 are divided by the characters, as they narrate their part.  Instead of being divided by chapters.  I found this a great writing strategy.  It gives each character their chance to shine.  As each character walks you through their eyes.  This way the readers can really get a good feel for each character.<br /><br />There are many wise lessons in the book.  These lessons the readers can learn from and use in their own lives.  There are also many great inspirational quotes within the book.  Here are a couple: ”You have to master the past in the present, or your past will master your future.” ”The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past.” These are just two from the many.<br /><br />Written by: Jesenia Sanabia

B007STBUIW|5.0|This Blu-ray remaster is fantastic & worth every dollar you may pay for it. I own the 30th anniversary dvd edition with the thick case & movie book. I checked this Blu-ray out at the library & was totally amazed as I watched it. It's like reading a book & knowing the story & then seeing at the movies for the first time. I mean this with all my heart. You haven't seen Jaws until you've seen this remastered Blu-ray. It's just flat out that good. Just to FYI they did the same thing with Titanic.Both of these movies will not just blow you away visually but audioably as well. Get both of these remastered blu-rays & put them in your collection. You will not regret it.

B00735HGQ6|4.0|I picked this book because it dealt with the older generation.  Be warned that it is similar to &#34;The 100-year-Old Man Who Climbed Out The Window&#34; in style but explores the relationship of people at home and along the way.  It is a good read.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|He is a fanatic for this series. Makes birthday buying a breeze for him. He now has the complete collection.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This very mediocre novel is so cluttered with minor, and undeveloped, characters, that it's difficult to figure out which ones to focus on.  Slow start, slower middle, but halfway decent ending.
B00BXUA7G8|5.0|This is a fascinating book that brings together the bits and pieces I have understood regarding cutting edge particle physics into a coherent whole. It contains lots of human interest and anecdotes to keep it interesting and very readable. It is one of the best books I have enjoyed this year! I plan to re-read soon to retain some of the more technical information. Probably a lot is elementary to physicists, but a lot is new to me and there were many aha moments.

B00BT0ZDF2|2.0|I get this is supposed to be deep and thought provoking and encourage acceptance, diversity etc.... but I feel like I've just wasted 3 hours of my life!! Hard to follow stories, popping back and forth, and some dialog was hard to understand. I didn't feel the stories were really all that connected. I was hoping the movie would be better than the book... not by much.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game, addictive. Wish it gave more then 5 lives and hour. Don't like the in game purchasing. I prefer the games to be complete. That is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars.
B009V0TV6O|2.0|For whatever reason, the Icon doesn't show up on my Kindle. Just a square gray space. I'm really wondering what Amazons app specialists are doing because they're supposed to make sure the apps work 100% before they're released, and it takes them more than two weeks to release an app these days. They must be smoking something really good!!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|You're sucked right into this parallel fantasy world and you can't get enough.  Centaurs, Pegasi, Satyrs, Oracles, Gods, and Demigods all come to life in this page turner.  I did not want to put the book down nor did I want it to end. Great book for teens and tweens.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I'm giving Dredd five star because maybe no one will. I Like this film, it's simple and practically cool. The story of this film got to the point and never dragged its feet with the characters background stories. Special effects were pretty good, it just proves that you don't need 200 million dollar and Micheal bay to make a good science fiction film. Overall, this a really good film. It didn't make as expected at the box office but who cares a lot of really good movie didn't either. I hope a Dredd sequel comes out sometime in the near future.
B000I55YV2|2.0|The celebration of getting &#34;what we want&#34; through any means is a bit sickening. They get all this money (that is not theirs and never was) and what do the do with it. They purchase junk, expensive junk yes, but nothing that makes themselves or those around them better people. Why not set up a foundation for helping out others. They were not the beautiful people but the extremely ugly people.

B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Some character development. Not all special effects.Good monsters seen at the end of the movie. Jaden did a good job in this movie , his father was ok.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It was good but not as good as the first two... I felt she could have taken so many other directions and made it amazing. Instead it was a little bit of a let down. The major issue at the end that everyone hates doesn't bother me. But it seems like there are still questions left... but I don't care enough to want to find out. Again could have been still much better

B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|This book is pretty good. Yep...pretty good indeed. It has what you want from Sanderson except it is missing some of the emotional depth you get with Elantris and the Mistborn series.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Wow! What a wonderful book. As a part 2 to The Shining, it really shone! I couldn't put it down and even though it wrapped up wonderfully, I was sad when it ended but only because it had ended. I could've kept reading it for and not grown tired of it. You just can't beat Stephen King. Simple as that. Fantastic book!
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I love this album from the writing, music and the meaning it has to me. The many different songs combine to make a very interesting, smart and multifaceted album. A new favorote as soon as I bought it. Great job OneRepublic :)

B009SZALHA|5.0|I had seen Cyndi perform a tune at that celebration for Memphis Soul at the White House.  She was THE BEST one of all even though there were some of the big names in the genre who also performed.  This CD is all of that and more.
0316174483|5.0|So remember making art from your fingerprints when YOU were a kid? Well, it's still fun! And this book is chock-full of ideas for things you can make that all start with just your fingers and a little ink. Ed Emberly is a definite go to for getting your creative side rolling. I highly recommend this book (and any of his other drawing books, for that matter.... not to mention his illustrated children's books)!
0385351399|2.0|Opens with some genuine dramatic interest but gradually devolves into an implausible tale of modern technology and human interactions gone awry.  As such,  the characters are dry, one dimensional and seemingly made of cardboard.  There is no subtlety or nuance.  As a result, a sense of tedium germinates within, and I needed to put this one down despite having enjoyed and appreciated the author's previous work (i.e. \\"A Hologram for the King\\")  And so...this review is admittedly limited to the first third of the novel-- which earns a 2-Star rating.
B00785P2QC|3.0|just started playing &amp; cant stop. I just want to keep building. I would like to see some items become easier to get without paying real money for.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally able to download Candy Crush on my Kindle. Have been waiting over 6months to play!! Love this addicting game...
B005PK553C|4.0|I didn't know there was a season before Asslyum, and it starts out really intresting. I would love to watch it all, but for some reason, my prime membership isn't all that prime. They want $2.99 an episode, after the first one, and that doesn't sit well with me, so, I guess I'll just have to be content with the first episode......Alas, I was just educated by a helpful customer service rep., and I have been woefully mis-informed. I CAN watch the rest  of the season free, with my prime membership, so......I gotta go!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Bet your surprised at the end! Special effects and magic performed attention grabbing. Eisenberg has a certain presence that is crosssing into all his movies. Never thought this young actor could stretch and grow so much. He has. Good co stars too. Vegas Baby!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Not even finished reading the book and it's fantastic. Excellent read so far! Gladwell has done it again! Highly recommended.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Strong cast and lots of action. Willis and Malkovich's good old fashion sinester and mentallyunstable scary performance make this a decent view.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I never understood why people liked this game so much. It looked like judt another Bejewled which I'm  tired of. This game is 100% more challenging 100% more fun and 100000% MORE ADDICTING!

B000FA5STS|5.0|As usual Baldacci kept me spell-bound for the entire book; once I started I could not put it down.  Unfortunately, Total Control was the last hard-copy I read before I received my Kindle!  Oh well, the hard-copy even though hard for me to see was still great.

B00FI7XBIS|4.0|It's your typical \\"Angry Birds\\" (wonder if they're tired of their software being the milestone these games are always compared to? Yeah...right!)  Anyway, outside of being predictable, and I'll admit that I only played a few rounds because I just woke up and am wearing a CPAP mask which makes it hard to do much of anything, but the few rounds I did play were fun for the most part. You're a vampire (obviously) and at the beginning anyway you have to break \\"Holy Lamps/Lights\\" so you can sort of fly to the fair, buxom blonde waiting for you to disturb her slumber with a \\"kiss\\"to the neck.<br /><br />To bust these Holy Lights you have to first pick up your bucket of rocks, bombs and whatever else that will be necessary to finish the level, then go and aim in the same manner of Angry Birds. Your goal is to finish and get all 3 stars. Also, throughout the game, you can find little gold birthday presents that can hold ammo reload or gold coins that you can use to \\"buy\\" with ammo reloads or solutions.  The reloads and solutions seem expensive but so far I've gotten over 300 coins and, if I'm remembering right an ammo reload was 1,000 gold coins.<br /><br />There is a shopping cart on the screen but that appears to be only for when you want to buy the reloads or solutions. Doesn't appear to be anyway to buy coins with real $$. The MORE button takes you to a screen where you can see your \\"trophies\\", turn off the music, turn off the sound effects, and info about the company.<br /><br />The characters aren't too bad although the skeletons don't have no body to hang with :) Sorry - couldn't resist. Oh and the buxom blondes aren't all blonde although they are still buxom beauties and I'll leave it to you to discover more about them.<br /><br />All in all I think I'll play it some but it will probably get deleted at some point unless the grandkids like it and want to play it. I don't expect it to hold my attention long but that's more me than the game as these types of games just are not my forte.<br /><br />But it was enjoyable enough to keep me up til almost 3:30a.m EST just to write a review.<br /><br />Played on a Kindle Fire HD 7\\" with no problems and quick download and installare not my forte.<br /><br />But it was enjoyable enough to keep me up til almost 3:30a.m EST just to write a review.<br /><br />Played on a Kindle Fire HD 7\\" with no problems and quick download and install
B00EVW0VTI|4.0|I have mixed feeling about WHITE HOUSE DOWN.<br /><br />As an action movie, it is extremely entertaining; a virtual “DIE HARD”IN THE WHITE HOUSE.  Interestingly, this was the second film with the same general premise to be released this year.<br /><br />(Indeed, many years ago, shortly after the original DIE HARD with Bruce Willis was released, I contemplated writing a screenplay with a like basis, but I tabled the idea and went on the other things.)<br /><br />Channing Tatum plays a decorated Afghanistan vet, now working as capitol policeman and bodyguard for the Speaker of the House of Representatives (Richard Jenkins), who goes to the White House with his young daughter (Joey King) in tow, in order to (unsuccessfully) apply for a job with the Secret Service.  Later, while he and his daughter are still there, the Capitol dome is blown up and a heavily armed paramilitary group, ostensibly led by Jason Clarke, invades the White House.  Now, with the nation’s government in chaos, it appears that Tatum is the only person who can save his daughter, the President (Jamie Foxx) and the country.<br /><br />Featuring a strong supporting cast that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Woods and Michael Murphy, plus a sensational production design that makes one believe that Washington, D.C. is, in fact, under attack, WHITE HOUSE DOWN shrewdly mixes elements of DIE HARD, AIR FORCE ONE and FAIL-SAFE into a viscerally pleasurable experience.  Director Roland Emmerich does his job and does it well.<br /><br />My problem with the picture is that the scenario as presented is quite depressing.  I know this is just a movie, but: Would it be that easy to invade and take down the White House?<br /><br />I don’t want to be a Spoiler, but according to this film, all it would take is one or two traitors on the inside to pull this off.<br /><br />Additionally, I think it was a mistake for the producers and the screenwriter to make the President and other political figures in the film mirror people actually occupying those offices today.  Even though no political parties are mentioned, a clandestine political message is being sent here, as to who are the “good guys” and who are the “bad guys”.<br /><br />They may have made the movie more topical, but they have also eliminated much of the “fantasy” element that is so important in this action genre.  If you want to send audiences a serious message, then you make FAIL-SAFE and play it straight.  If you want them to have fun, then you don’t make the situation so real that it deflates them.<br /><br />The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains four “Behind the Scenes” featurettes.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B008IGAJJK|5.0|Although the long running series was very good, I do not think it compares to the irreverent, witty and gritty original.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|For me it had the right balance of everything for SciFi. Lots of action, good character development, great monsters, and something I hadn't known that was going to be part of the script about how the robots must be controlled, which helped the plot lines fuse together. I won't say what it is, because I'd have to spoil it. Highly recommended.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game will be coming out as a movie, and I wanted to refresh myself on the story. I am sure the movie will change a good bit to condense and enhance Ender's role in the war against the Formics.  It will be interesting to see what they change for effect and audience excitement. I read the series and liked it.

0316017922|5.0|This book provides an insightful look into why certain people are successful.  The author, Malcolm Gladwell has a writing style that is easy to follow.  He also does a great job of tying the book together by continuously referring to material discussed in earlier chapters.<br /><br />He makes the argument that the difference between successful rich kids and poor kids has nothing to do with the quality of their school.  It has more to do with the quality of summer learning.  Rich kids have summer time learning opportunities that poor kids do not.  He then notes that most autobiographies follow a similar format.  First, the subject comes from a humble background.  Then, through sheer grit and determination, they overcome adversity and make themselves into a success.  The author argues that this is only half true.  Successful people are also very lucky with regards to when and where they were born.  Ultimately, these people succeeded because they were lucky enough to have been given opportunities and smart enough to take advantage of them.<br /><br />The book also explores the connection between a person's cultural history and the modern world.  For example, people descended from Asian rice farmers, who worked hard all year long, still maintained that work ethic even though they had never even seen a rice patty.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This book is well written, moves quickly, and is easy to read.  The author examines successful people from multiple perspectives and frequently refers to examples cited in earlier chapters.  Through this writing style, the reader can easily follow the author's overall thesis.  In the end, he makes a compelling argument.

0375869026|5.0|A friend's child read this.  Then his parents read it.  They recommended it to me.  The writing is definitely at a middle school level, but the story is wonderful and universal.  I loved that the perspective of several characters were presented.  Especially for middle schoolers - a good lesson.  I have been recommending it to my adult friends and bought it for my niece (5th grade) for a holiday gift.

This TV show and later, the movies, made us all think that deep space travel was just a matter of doing it. Like restoring an old car.<br />  Im happy that Star Trek has been reborn. The small things that I catch in the story that dont add up arent a huge deal to me.  It is very well done and takes me planet hopping again!!<br />  &#34; Mr. Sulu, you may endulge yourself.&#34;

1250030951|4.0|18-year-old Cather \\"Cath\\" Avery and her identical twin sister Wren have lived for years in a world of fan-fiction - escaping from the real world, in which their mother abandoned the family 10 years before, and where their ad executive father still suffers on the bipolar roller-coaster ride which her leaving set him on. The sisters' split name is a measure of their mother's disdain for them - she couldn't be bothered to think of two names when she found that she was having twins, so she just split the one she had already picked - and a constant reminder of their abandonment. Leaving for college at the University of Nebraska, only an hour away from their Omaha home, in Lincoln, but practically their first time outside of their neighborhood, puts the sisters' world into a tailspin - more so for Cath than for Wren, who throws herself into the colleges' weekend-frat-party scene with a vengeance while Cath, the quieter and more demure twin, submerges herself deeper into the world of fan-fiction.<br /><br />Cath writes fan fiction based on a series of novels about a young wizard named Simon Snow (thinly-disguised versions of the \\"Harry Potter\\" books), and has attained semi-celebrity status in the world of Simon Snow fan-fiction with her alternate-universe retellings of the popular stories. Her success there is scant preparation, however, for college life - an older, more worldly and rough-edged roommate, advanced-level English composition classes, a self-seeking upperclassmen writing partner who is prepared to \\"borrow\\" her story ideas for his own benefit - and boys, in general.<br /><br />\\"Fangirl\\" paints a somewhat bleak tableau - very Great-Plains-in-wintertime seeming - at first, but the quiet tone of the story suits the tale. Cath finds her way in the unfamiliar new world, coping with the stresses of college classwork and a whole new set of social situations, while pushing to complete her fan-fic magnum opus before the eighth - and final - \\"Simon Snow\\" novel is published.<br /><br />It is a sweet story, in parts, with enough coming-of-age drama to appeal to its YA demographic of late-teen-aged girls, though I'm not sure I'd recommend it for the under-17 set - there is enough low-level physical romance and sensuality included to make it somewhat problematic for younger teens.ed.<br /><br />It is a sweet story, in parts, with enough coming-of-age drama to appeal to its YA demographic of late-teen-aged girls, though I'm not sure I'd recommend it for the under-17 set - there is enough low-level physical romance and sensuality included to make it somewhat problematic for younger teens.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a good mental workout.  It tests your skills of solving problems and calculating risks while trying to reach the last water drop. I enjoyed playing Quell but Quell Reflect has stepped up with more variety of puzzles.  Once I have completed Quell Reflect I will be moving on to the next chapter of Quell.  P. S. The music is lovely. :-)
B00G32OER4|3.0|When I saw it took place in the 70s and it was about a family moving into an older house in the country, I felt like this story had been covered many times over. Nothing is special about this story. Some of the acting is really not that good either. Also, they handled the story very superficially; the most interesting aspects are not covered for that long while certain scenes are dragged on for no apparent reason; may be they made poor editing choices. However, it is really scary; we watched it on our old relatively small TV set, so I cannot imagine how scary it would have been on a better TV (or even in the theater!). So, it is entertaining, but I am not sure what all the fuss was about...
B009C7JS14|5.0|Basic app that does all I need . I have not had any problems with it so far.<br />Will be keeping it.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I think this game is awesome and I've been wanting it for so long.It's also cool that you get the bat and bat pod.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really like this app, it's very useful and it suits my needs.  I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends.
B009WUBERW|4.0|This will not classify as an &#34;Oscar&#34; movie , but it was never meant to be....it is an entertaining movie and was good at doing that! If fast paced shoot-em up is your thing ,this is a good one !
B0040UEI8G|4.0|This box is a very very good deal. The Berlin P.O. and Cluytens are excellent together. The complete set is very satisfying, although I have some slight reservations about the first movement of the 9th being too ponderous. Otherwise, excellent, and there are the more well known overtures thrown in. In many ways this is very competitive to the 1963 Karajan set.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Even though it was made a few years ago, I love this movie - excellent blend of science and religion with a little sci-fi too. Great cast!
006202406X|1.0|Authors do an amazing thing when they create intriguing characters. They make people love them. Right now, I'm pissed. Veronica Roth made such unique, beautiful people in Tris and Tobias and makes them both go through such difficult obstacles, both physical and mental.  I think this needs to happen in stories like the one Roth created. And I also think loss is important in stories like these, because it's realistic.  Veronica Roth says that she's inspired by many authors, but apparently Stephen King isn't one of them, because it's quite obvious she hasn't read his bestseller, Misery before. All I can say is that she better hope she doesn't find herself driving through a blizzard on a slippery cliff while on her book tour.    Yes, Veronica, loss is important in books. You're right. Because it's realistic and evokes emotion in your readers. But you don't kill off your main protagonist! And then by doing so cause your other main character to be depressed for the rest of his life! What were you thinking!?  After reading through a lot of reviews, the most stars I've seen someone give you is three, and those are extremely scarce. Veronica, you've got a lot of angry people out there. Your readers definitely, but I bet your movie producers aren't very happy with you either. If they're smart they'll take your s*** sack of an ending and turn it into something golden.  Veronica Roth, you just destroyed such a beautiful series for me. A series that had so much potential. I'm very disappointed in you, and it seems as though everyone else is too, and frankly, you deserve every bit of it.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It has somewhat of a fresh storyline. It didn't portray improper sexuality or violence. Also it wasn't predictable. I think from teenage up it can be pleasantly entertaining!
B00006GA4C|4.0|one of, if not the, greatest American rock albums of all time...one correction for the amazon people...the release date was december 29 1969
B0046B3QTG|4.0|You gotta love it when some bad person is won over by kindness and goodness! Its nice to see that people have the potential to change for the good with some good association and examples. A little futuristic but you'll get the point!
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|I definitely liked what I could play. I couldn't get passed the first chapter because the game would crash literally every time I'd try to move on. Definitely need to fix that.
6305095442|5.0|One case when the sequel is better than the original, if this can be called a sequel... it actually seems a better written remake of the first Evil Dead. I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell from 'way back and while this may not be one of his best, it's good and entertaining, with those moments of dark humor he and Sam Raimi are famous for.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a great app if you enjoy doing puzzles. They have many different styles and number of pieces you can choose from. You can easily rotate and move the pieces around. You can also put them back if it's not the piece you need. I am glad I downloaded this free app.
B0024FADDI|5.0|This one is the best of the Evil Dead Trilogy. Funny...farcical...just scarey enough.  Love the animation, the fairly authentic-looking costumes,and tongue-in-cheek references to other movies.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't believe it ended when it did. I wasn't ready. It is going to take some time to recover. I am thoroughly impressed, heartbroken and hopeful. Incredible. Stunning. Loved every second.
B00005R24K|4.0|I've been a fan of Bruce Campbell since Brisco County Junior and the only reason I bought this DVD was so I'd have the complete set and could watch this and compare it to the sequel.  The Evil Dead really appears to be a rough draft of The Evil Dead 2, which is the same story with better dialogue, different characters, and more reasons for all the mayhem. That one leads easily into Army of Darkness while this one is easily a standalone.  Good, with evidence of both Campbell and Sam Raimi's talent to come.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's good but I don't like the idea that you have to constantly buy extra lives. I feel that should come with the game or let you start from the beginning of the game.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This is a great album from start to finish. While it is filled with a lot of radio hits, I feel like some of the better songs haven't been turned into singles. If you are a fan of what you hear on the radio by FUN you will love this album !!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|game is addicting but lack of lives is annoying. I get it, the concept is brilliant from a business standpoint, but still annoying.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I am not one of the people obsessed with Zombies and wasn't expecting much when my husband wanted to watch this one but hey I've made him watch a few movies that he would like to have those 2 hours back :) I also thought 2 hours of Brad Pitt couldn't be that bad. Well I LOVED it, the story line was totally believable and just edge of your seat from start to finish. We got it on Demand and I watched it 3 times in the 48 hours we had and had to buy our own copy. It was a great story line and amazing characters and the special effects are amazing!!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Bought this Movie for a gift. My granddaughter loved it!  Arrived on time and in perfect condition!  Price was perfect for me and my budget.

B00B3L3RPA|5.0|Excellent, a classic. A perfect study of self destruction through resentment and revenge as well as the wreckage it brings to others.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Totally addicted to this game!!! Great practice!!! So much fun, kept me occupied for hours!!! Best have ever in my opinion!
B00CRGZMUI|4.0|It's been a long time since the first Bridget Jones book came out and a lot has changed for Bridget and in the world in general. Where Fielding excels is always when she puts Bridget up against modern technology, from flirty emailing in the first book to Bridget's current obsession with Twitter, which is very true to life. There is much to like here, particular if you are a fan of the character. My only quibble is not, like many, that (spoiler alert) Darcy is dead - I completely get that choice and feel like Fielding treated it well - but the fact it's never explained why Bridget and Darcy had their kids so late in life.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I enjoy Andrea very much.  This Cd is wonderful and I also enjoy the CD with scenes off Portofino and Andrea.  Love it!!  Thank you and I will continue to purchase Andrea Bocelli CDs.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a charming reef themed application with gorgeous graphics and a relaxing soundtrack. The characters from Finding Memo are beautifully animated. If only there were an easier way to procure those precious pearls , , , ;)
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I have laughed at this film days after watching.  I think it&#34;s very good.It is a hoot. The best Christmas movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, but I get soooooo frustrated by it at the same time!!  lol<br />Very Addictive.  Totally worth the download on your computer, tablet and phone.
B00CM1S1QK|5.0|Plenty of topnotch music - & there's no way to beat the price.  Clarity of the recording is very good, and they've packed the minutes into these cd's.  Case arrived intact, and it's all 'round satisfaction.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This is a super game!  Having a good time wacking zombies and its free!  Nothing perks up your day like being a zombie hunter.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|First saw this movie on an airplane because there was nothing else to see. Loved it so much I ordered it for my wife to see. Unusual plot, not the normal stuff, gets your interest from the start and keeps getting better. Recomended it to anyone tired of all the computer simulated explosion movies. This one really has a plot. It all comes togeather in the end, but you will never guess how..
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|The CD came in perfect shape.  The music makes me feel very tranquil as though I am flowing through the moment in utter peace.
B000NMY7CM|4.0|This was an engaging script with very good acting. It was not contrived or too sentimental. I highly recommend this film.
B00G03LDSO|5.0|awesome POD at their best!!!  The guitars are amazing,  the melodies incredible and vocals are perfect.  Get it you'll love this one !!
B006M4F67A|4.0|I like mahjong. Its a no brainer. I can play and watch Tv. Easy fun and game night after working all day.
B00G32TD98|2.0|Strong start, terrible end. Became ridiculous to quickly. Every ghost film runs into this same problem, the subtle scares in the beginning are so well thought out, but they all degenerate into a bad action movie in the end of the film.
B004GYY714|1.0|I loaded this app onto my new Kindle fire HDX 7\\" and could not get it to work. The stream would play for a couple of seconds and then quit for a second or two, start up again, then quit for a second or two, etc. The suggested fix was to increase the amount of buffer time or to blame my modem/router. I used the maximum buffer and still a problem. The program worked perfectly on my Ipad mini, as well as a borrowed Nexus. An email to the tunein company produced no response so I am returning the Kindle and buying a 2013 Nexus instead. To bad since I liked the fire HDX. Apparently it has a few problems that need to be worked out.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Creative and feisty love story! Very fun read. Never wanted to put the book down!! Hiliarous male perspective on love, sex and relationships!!!
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|I first listened to the soundtrack, with headphones, on a flight from London to L.A. and was blown away.  After that, I had to see the film too, which was available on the flight. Then I had to go back and listen to the soundtrack again...and again. Oh heck, I just let it keep repeating throughout the rest of the flight!  It's that captivating. The mix of music is wonderful, and of course typical of this director and his music director. The music also conveys the emotionality of this film and it's characters to soaring levels.  I can't recommend it enough.  That is veers from traditional jazz may be disappointing to some purists, but those who know and loved Moulin Rouge and it's also amazing soundtrack, will love this one. The production is stellar and the choice of artists, with the exception of the first 2 tracks that I could do without, is just brilliant. I had to buy it as soon as I returned home!
B00FPH51LQ|2.0|This movie feels like a cheap knock off of MIB.  Awkward dialogs, cheap CGIs and boring plot....  I like Ryan Reynolds, but he sucks in action movies.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book ever. I love the series and I'm starting  to read the house of Hades.  My Favorite Author Ever.<br />.
B00G32OER4|5.0|\\"The Conjuring\\" was rated-R because it was scary. It didn't need blood, gore, cursing, sex, or violence to accomplish it. That is a RARE find in horror. Most movies get so bogged down in gore, that the story line goes to crap, but this movie had all of the scare with none of the distraction. 5 STARS
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I found Alice's family supportive but not completely in tune with her situation until her disease process was well progressed. Someone in her position would have received more attention from her peers as well. The speech in the final chapter was well beyond what I would have imagined her capable of. It is a stirring account of the progressing loss of self.
0812550706|4.0|The first thing you need to know about Orson Scott Card is that you cannot understand the mind of Orson Scott Card. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. You'll know what I mean if you read the book.<br /><br />Ender's Game is about Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin. Earth has been through two world wars with an alien race called the \\"buggers\\". They are now preparing for the war to end all wars. Take out the \\"buggers\\" before they take care of Earth. In order to prepare for this final battle, an international fleet (I.F.) battle school has been created to train young children to command the fleet of space war ships. These children must have super intelligence, with some aggressive tendencies. The children are chosen by making them wear monitors on the back of their necks in order to determine if they exhibit the leadership qualities needed for battle school. Ender has had a monitor since he was three. At six, his monitor is removed, and he's recruited for battle school by Colonel Graff. We find out right from the beginning of the book that the I.F. has singled out Ender as their last chance to produce the leader they need to win the war. At this point, Ender is only six years old. He's whisked off to battle school in outer space, leaving behind his beloved sister Valentine and his jealous, cruel, older brother, Peter.<br /><br />Most of the book is Ender's training and battle school. He starts out, like all new kids, as a \\"launchie\\". He has to deal with jealousy, bullying, loneliness, and isolation. The recruits spend their days in zero gravity, carrying out mock battles with laser guns that operate by freezing their opponent so that they can't move. As soon as Ender begins to form any kind of friendship, the I.F. moves him into a new army where he has to prove himself all over again. He does manage to maintain a few friendships, which makes for some interesting characters in the book. This period of training takes him up to 9 ½ years old.<br /><br />There is a philosophical side story that goes on during Ender's training. It occurs on Earth between Ender's sister Valentine, and his brother Peter. Peter is power-hungry and wants to influence what he detects as a shift in the world order as the final war with the buggers draws closer. Peter talks Valentine into pretending to be adults on the net so that they can influence political opinions. They end up with the pseudonyms, Demosthenes and Locke, and become very influential in the shaping of public opinion.<br /><br />I can't really say more without spoilers.<br /><br />My one pet peeve (and I must point it out) is when the dialogue of a character does not match their age. Ender talks like a sixteen year old from age six to the end of the book. I get he's ultra-intelligent, but it still bothers me. I expect this will come across better on the big screen.<br /><br />One thing I need to address is some of the negative reviews. This book was first published in 1985. So the reviewers that are pointing out the infeasibility of the plot, and the laser tag like atmosphere of the book need to appreciate what was going on in the 80s. Laser tag was just beginning to take off in the late 80s. So yeah, it was cool. Also, this book was written for young boys. So the concept of young, ultra-smart kids training to do battle with aliens in a cool zero gravity chamber with lasers... Hello! What 12-year-old boy is not going to like that? I will admit I don't particularly love this book. But then again, I'm not 12. However, I respect its originality, and I'm very excited to see the movie version. I had a hard time picturing a lot of the maneuvers in the zero gravity chamber, so I'm expecting the visuals from the movie to give me a new appreciation for the book.<br /><br />I haven't read any of the sequels to this book, nor do I plan to. I hear the sequels are more about alien cultures rather than battles and bad guys. I prefer his Pathfinder series, which is more current.ide story that goes on during Ender's training.

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This story really makes you think about choices that one makes and how they affect other people's lives . Suitable for mature ages.
B00D1VKZ3M|4.0|Bridget, older, but still messy and funny as in her 30`s. I really appreciated the book and recommend it to all  Bridget`s fans.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is a must-have! I couldn't stop reading it, keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Recommend to anyone!
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|been waiting for this ever since i heard the news that they were working on a new one - IT'S BEEN WELL WORTH THE WAIT ..... excelent job guys ..... great album - cant stop listening .....
B004I744AS|5.0|I'm very pleased with this dictionary app. It provides very complete information.  I especially like the option of having a downloaded version so that I can look things up even when beyond the reach of the Internet. Internet-connected access remains available, making this a very versatile tool.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Normally I'm not a fan of redone movies but this version of The Great Gatsby is exceptional. Even with the flashbacks, the plot was easy to follow and was entertaining as well. For me, it was much better rendition than the version with Robert Redford..
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The first 2 books were great.  This was awful!  Start to finish!  Telling the story, the same scenes, from 2 different view points is stupid.  Is the book about Tris or Four?  The ending was sad.  I understand the author wanted to be shocking or something, but what makes a YA book fun to read, is the fact that it always leaves the reader with a happy ending.  There is always hope, not only for whatever dystopian society, they are in, but for the characters themselves.  You feeling like, maybe, just maybe, there can be a happy ending.  The ending was too much real life.  There was just a small amount of hope for society (even that you aren't sure about) and the characters were all dead or ruined.  It was like watching a news report about some horrible thing happening.  You feel sad and hopeless:(. I don't read fiction books to make myself depressed, I want to be taken out of this sad world for a little bit.  I want to be transported somewhere else.  I want to read about people setting the world right.  Where someone, even if it's just a fictional character can have a happily ever after!
B003MYYJD0|4.0|Bigger and heavier than expected. Wrist band a little too stiff.  Very nice looking watch and easy to use features.  So far good timekeeping.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for finally putting it on kindle fire. It's a fun and addictive game to play. Please download this game and enjoy.
B007SPN5MA|2.0|I SO enjoyed previous recordings by Glen Hansard, when it was Glen and his guitar.  This one has all kinds of back-up music which I do not care for at all.  He could have made better song choices, also.
B001KZI2WW|4.0|I can't say it enough times, crocs are good because they sometimes have the sense to put in an arch support. This Santa Cruz style HAS AN ARCH SUPPORT! I love my new pair. But be careful, sometimes Crocs' syles do not have an arch support, or adequate enough arch support, but I've just discovered that the Santa Cruz style has an arch support! Hooray, they feel great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that I am finally able to enjoy the game on my Kindle Fire!  I love this game!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|yea finaly the real candy cursh us out I been diyung to play scene. my mom got it I was really jealous of her and that game so lucky. hay but now I can have it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I thought this book was an amazing story about how looks don't matter. All that matters is what kind of person you are.
B000SEI230|4.0|Lots of romance, plenty of surprises makes this book a delightful read. One page after the next kept<br />Me looking and waiting for the next event. The author takes his time to reveal each emotion, guaranteed to<br />Touch your heart, first with joy, then romantic pain, then more joy, then . . . Well, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Nicholas presents his own version of the resulting feelings of the human soul, laid bare for those of us who<br />Are mature enough emotionally and spiritually to handle the resulting realities of human behavior.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is great it has new obstacles and you get diamonds you can use to keep yourself alive!

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Wasted time it's not always wasted time. It's really really addicting. I feel bad for annoying my friends all the time on Facebook
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cool game won't get really bored playing this. Only bad thing is u have to have internet. Anybody will find this game fun.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I plugged Chromecast into the TV and configured it from my iPad.  All went OK at first--it updated its own software and rebooted, and asked for the name and password of my wifi network.  I did that and the Chromecast says it's on my wifi on the TV screen.  But from my iPad, on the same wifi network, couldn't find Chromecast.  I then tried the same thing from an Android phone and a Windows PC laptop.  None could find the Chromecast device.  I put the Chromecast right under the wifi router and still couldn't find it from a phone.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|It is complete and quite well constructed and at an unbeatable price. If you wish to get well acquainted with Doyle then here is your chance. It is very long though so prepare time. I also had no prior familiarity with anything by Doyle that was not Sherlock Holmes.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chrome cast is Very simple to use, I wish it would work with more apps than just Netflix and  YouTube
0767919408|5.0|Bill Bryson's latest is about all of the things that happened in the summer of 1927 that caught the public's interest - mostly Charles Lindbergh's successful first-ever solo flight across the Atlantic, but also Babe Ruth's home run streak, the Dempsey-Tunney heavyweight title bout, various &#34;sensational&#34; crimes, and bits of trivia about interesting people we've probably never heard of. Like all Bill Bryson books, it's a little loosely organized with a lot of going off on tangents, but it ultimately all comes together. And of course it's always entertaining.<br /><br />A very enjoyable read about the year when America first took its place on the world stage.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Good read. It seems to have been well-researched and was full of surprises. I was looking for a good story and got one
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the book.  Can't wait for the movie! Hopefully they base it on King's version of The Stand and not the first movie.
B00F35BV64|5.0|They get better every time. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are perfect in their replications of Kirk and Spock's mannerisms, voice, and personalities we grew to know. Casting of the crew was a masterpiece.<br /><br />Only thing wrong with the story line was the Klingons were wimps and lousy shots. Got their butts kicked by ONE superman?
B002NT3B52|4.0|Good for the science currently available regarding canine behavior, but I preferred The Genius of Dogs by Brian  Hare because it provided additional evidence.
0515153656|3.0|When I first read that this was the first Reacher story, I assumed it was chronologically first. Not true. In this story Reacher's Mother is already gone and he is out of the army. Disapointing. Also not the best story. Well worth skipping all together, it adds nothing to the character. Please note that some of the reviews below contain major spoilers. Read at your own risk.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup was painless. Most of the negative reviews I've seen were by people who expected it to do things it wasn't meant to do. I was so impressed with my first one that I ordered another one. It works best using my Motorola Xoom tablet. I've read reviews stating that it wouldn't work with dual band routers (Belkin specifically mentioned). I have a Belkin dual band router and had no problem getting it to work. After reading many negative reviews, I've come to the conclusion that some people are technically challenged! Setup couldn't be easier. I would like to see more apps available in the future, but even if that doesn't happen I'm very satisfied with the way it's working now - like I said, it does what it's supposed to do.
1476727651|4.0|Stephen king returns to form, after a few MEH years.<br />A on top of that its a continuation of Kings most famous stories, written decades ago---Not saying on purpose, look at the book, hate to ruin your reaction.
B001AFF25W|5.0|This book was a fast and easy read and also very informative. I would recommend this book to anyone thinking they don't have enough time to sit down and read a book on how to manage their time.
B000E6EGXM|5.0|Finally replacing my Disc version, even better on CD. Should have done this long ago. Now looking for other Disc's to replace
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|It's more superficial than his previous books - in particular, the topic of class sizes has so many parameters other than the inverted-U - but it was a fun, interesting read nonetheless.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!<br /><br />I felt disillusioned by the story of Martin Luther King. Before reading the book, I had believed in the power of his &#34;I have a dream&#34; speach... :-(
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This is a fantasy action movie and if you like that kind of movie you'll like this one too. I'll admit I've enjoyed the Transformer movies and this is a similar type of huge humanoid type machine that stays as is, no transformation into trucks but I won't hold that against them.<br /><br />The combo pack comes with 4 discs and the free DIGITAL HD version. The discs are sandwiched two to a side and must be carefully pulled apart. The 4 discs include the Blu-ray 3D, 2D, DVD, and a Blu-ray Special Features disc.<br /><br />The digital version must be redeemed by 10/22/15.<br /><br />The 3D version is more fun than the 2D version and draws the viewer into the action effectively. I watched the 2D version first and then the 3D version later and found the 3D effects to be well used. I think this movie will wear well and can be enjoyed on repeated viewings. The video and audio are good and the surround channels are well utilized.<br /><br />If you can check your reality at the door you can have fun with this one.
B00G32TD98|4.0|I was expecting &#34;been there done that&#34; type of movie and as expected no new chills. Why am i giving 4 stars then? Very good acting makes the same old chills look new and sometimes scary. Bottom line, Worth the money.
0385350864|3.0|Call me cynical but a lot of successful authors in this genre seem to be motivated to squeeze every last drop of cash out of the public at the expense of the quality and magic that made the readers fall in love with their work.  Sophie Kinsella's \\"mini shopaholic\\", Jennifer Weiner's \\"The Next Best Thing\\" and the cringeworthingly awful grab-for-cash sequel to \\"Devil wears Prada\\"(\\"Revenge Wears Prada\\") are the examples that come to mind.<br /><br />Is this one of those books?? I can understand the negativity surrounding this book but... to me it was still exciting and interesting so for me the answer is no.<br /><br />When I read 'Bridget Jones' Diary' I was so absorbed in the story I secretly read the book while at my desk at work.  The sequel 'Edge of Reason' I liked fine, but it didn't match the amazingness of the original.<br /><br />I feel the same with this book. It is not on par with the first book but it is fun escapism and I was drawn to read it during spare moment I had over the last few days since buying it.  Problems though are, like the second book, some scenarios that were supposed to be humorous were too inauthentic to hit their mark.  And to an extent I agree with what some other reviewers have written...that some of Bridget's scattiness strains a little bit of credibility (which for me was also a problem in 'Edge of Reason'). Also the start of the book is incredibility manic- it almost put me off because it felt like I was watching a movie starting at the middle and having no idea who the people are or what was going on. It takes a few chapters before things are sufficiently explained.<br /><br /> But I don't agree with the scathing reviews that it was blasphemous for the author to kill off mark darcy. It was a shock, but has created an interesting set up for the story- a woman we love in her early fifties with young children thrust back into dating.<br /><br />Unlike the other two books there were some mild references to spirituality and quite a fewpoignant moments that brought me to tears.<br /><br />And it was also funny and witty and also brilliant to get to re-visit Bridget and her friends.<br /><br />Those thinking of whether or not to read is book- if you can't forgive the author for killing Darcy and wont allow Bridget to be ditzy and scattered and ridiculous at 50yrs old and with young kids then I would give it a miss.<br /><br />If you can, I think you'll find the book completely unrealistic but sweet and silly and entertaining.
0385737955|5.0|The Maze Runner by James Dashner was single handedly one of the best books I have ever read. Right when I opened the book I was hooked by the opening statement, \\" A boom exploded though the air. The enormous stone wall to the right of them seemed to defy every known law of physics as it slid across the glade as all four doors sealed shut for the night\\" (Dashner 1). This statement got me wondering what these stone walls were and what the \\"glade\\" was. As I got farther and farther into the book I could not put it down. The Maze Runner is about a scrawny boy named Thomas and how he wakes up in a dark room and remembers nothing about his previous life; he only remembers his name. He finds himself in the midst of many boys, no girls, all of them welcoming him to the \\"Glade\\". At first, he was just treated like the new kid, but little did he know that he would be the piece to the puzzle. As days went by he learned more in depth information about this mysterious place that was now his home. \\" Greivers\\", which are these so called creatures, was the thing that I found the most interesting. Once the big stone doors closed these hideous monsters appeared and if you were stuck behind those doors you would never be found again. Thomas and his friends, Minho and Newt, make it their life mission to find there way out of the maze and the Glade itself. With a sudden plot twist, a new member appears out of no where. It has never been heard of or seen before by any of the Gladers. Once this new member starts making a home out of the Glade everything starts changing around them and the Gladers have a hard time adapting. The thrilling book has Thomas as the leader helping The Gladers escape their deaths.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|The original is such a classic, I started viewing with great trepidation. But it stands on its own as really good. There are several more layers of story and theme than the original and they all fit right in. Please note that this is not anywhere near as tongue-in-cheek. All in all, I definitely recommend.

B000G73UEU|5.0|I saw this on public television a few years ago.  Until then, I really didn't know anything about Leonard except that he had written Hallelujah and Suzanne.  After watching this show on TV I started downloading a few of his albums and very quickly became a fan.  I'm 56 and I just realized what an amazing talent and poet Mr. Cohen is.  Now I am a full-fledged fan and I naturally needed to add this to my collection.  Now that I have purchased more of Leonard's music, I have enjoyed comparing his live recordings to these tribute versions.  Both are amazing.<br /><br />PS: If you haven't heard Antony Hegarty before, listen to his version of Leonard Cohen's &#34;If It Be Your Will&#34; on YouTube.  It knocked me off my chair.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|Jeff Bridges has a good time with this character and goes over the top at times which is why the 3 star rating. Overall a decent movie.

B00DL2W7Q4|5.0|A great and inspiring book for anyone to read. An interesting take on the underdogs and outsiders, those with the willingness to think and play differently to succeed no matter what.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It made me laugh and cry, it was just amazing!!!!!!!! Everyone should read this book!!!! By far my favorite book ever!!!!!!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Movie was okay..a bit too long and drawn out, but always an interesting story.  The cast was good and belivable.

B003OUXECE|5.0|I was thoroughly engrossed in this title from start to finish.<br />I did not play the game, though I watched my girlfriend play it.<br />It was great to tie the things from the game together with this backstory.<br />It was well written and kept my interest from start to finish.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I read this on an airplane so perhaps that affected my judgment. Some of the descriptions are so graphic that the book is hard reading. Some of the outcomes are too predictable and trite. All in all I would recommend it as a decent read but not as fine literature.

B009LDCZDC|3.0|Although I have a Blu-Ray player, these Blu-Ray discs would not work on my player.  A sign came up saying I had to upgrade to another level of Blu-Ray.  Who knew?  But when I went on line to try to do this, the LG site said my player had no upgrades.  So be careful.  Apparently these discs only work on very new Blu-Ray players.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great app. I like playing before bed to help decompress and unwind. It's a great game that takes some thought on ways to eliminate possibilities while building the pictures. I like that each level can be solved using math and numbers and not just guessing what the picture will be. Highly recommended.

B000002LVB|5.0|...the initial obituary in today's New York Times was suspiciously short (really? they didn't have more informative, better copy waiting in their files?) so we just dug the old vinyl out from the shelves behind the kitchen door and cranked up our recently-revived turntable while the cats looked on in wonder. This album, perhaps the most accessible and poppy in the Velvet Underground catalog, is still a favorite and a gem. Sweet Jane, indeed. Thanks to Lou, and condolences to the East Coast. Now onto the solo albums...

B008OOYALE|2.0|Dragon Story is a game where you are supposed to breed dragons, gain goals and spend money, apparently. When I first got Dragon Story it wasn't too bad; however, then I had to expand my land which you can do by spending gold bars (which are very hard to get, mind you), or ask your friends for help (which can range from FB friends to just random people). I'm not a fan of asking random people. Much to my frustration, I chose to spend the gold bars. The gold bars are difficult to come by, thus making you spend money if you are not able to ask people for them. This was the first of many problems with this app. I used to have a wonderful app called Dragonvale but due to its size I couldn't keep it. I got Dragon Story soon after I got Dragonvale, and it was working fine then it started slowing down and freezing. All after I got Dragon Story. So I deleted it. After that everything worked fine. After I got rid of Dragonvale, I decided to try Dragon Story again (to give it another chance). A big mistake! I had added another app, Creatures of Olympus (which is a very good game) to my library, and had no problems. Soon CoO started freezing and slowing down. In just two days, CoO had frozen over three times. All because of Dragon Story. I will be getting rid of it as soon as my Kindle is finished restarting. Hope this helps!<br />P.S. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because of the good graphics and the many goals.<br />This is my daughter's review.....aka Some Crazy Cat Lady
0553565915|4.0|While I enjoyed this book and it helped me through a very troubled time in my life....I also kept in mind...it could all be fictional. This book helped me with acceptance and forgiveness and really opened my mind to exploring so many secrets of before, during and after our life on earth. At times it gets you thinking....but no matter what, I highly suggest you keep The Bible as the book that embraces you.

0823015017|5.0|what a great in-depth look at polymer clay! This book really goes into a lot of information on color - mixing, using, experimenting. With the help it offers, and the in-depth step-by-step exercises for practice, it is a great stepping off point for any artist to develop his/her own palette for artwork. The examples are clear and some so beautiful that even though the work involved seems great, it remains interesting and, ultimately, do-able.
1402797184|5.0|I read this book before giving it to my nice (8 years old), and I loved the book!!  I bought this copy for my nice and we have talks about the book. She loves it...she told me she brings it to school and reads whenever she finishes her assignments early (she is very intelligent). I love my intellectual niece...my own Pollyana. The book is about a little girl who has a wonderful heart, like all little girls do.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|With all the trashy and poorly written novels out there, I must say that I rather enjoyed this one. Its very light-hearted humorous book with a bit of romance and suspense. You will see the heroine transform right before your eyes and you can't help but root for her. The romance was not cheesy or over the top, it was realistic and I appreciated that. As I said there is a bit of suspense, though I figured out what was happening a bit close to the end of the book, but I quite enjoyed the ending nonetheless.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I saw this movie for the first time with my church, then again via Amazon prime.  The ruling elites in the movie seem very similar to the progressives in Washington, DC.  Jennifer Lawrence gives a great performance.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never liked science fiction books but wanted to try something new for a change.  I came across this series by looking over the top selling books on Amazon.  This was by far the best book I have read in years and I hated to stop reading each night.  I am really looking forward to the 2 remaining books in the series.<br /><br />I can relate more to this type of science fiction than I can to something like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which I couldn't even finish.  GASP. Yeah sorry Hitchhiker fan-boys.

B001QWBM62|1.0|I bought the Zoom H4N in anticipation of making live recordings of a recurring acoustic jam session we hold every few weeks.  I'm no stranger to computers, software installation, troubleshooting, etc.  Even so, figuring this thing out has proven itself to be a royal pain in the a$$ on account of the really CRAPPY documentation.<br /><br />When you buy this thing, you are getting a recorder with owners manual plus Cubebase software furnished by a third party (i.e. NOT Zoom).  The collective documentation promptly moves you toward the software's installation, omitting the fact that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO INSTALL Cubebase IN ORDER TO OPERATE THE UNIT.  THAT single bit of information could have saved HOURS of frustration.<br /><br />I made multiple, unsuccessful attempts to install Cubebase.  Ultimately, that little journey into the firey abyss of frustration did little other than to raise my blood pressure.  At the very least, had I known what I would be going through, I would have documented each step so that at least other poor saps (i.e. those who would go on to purchase a Zoom 4HN after me) would avoid what I went through.  Sorry - I didn't.  I strongly considered returning the thing but figured that, with a lot of positive user reviews, perseverance would eventually pay off. I mean, it's GOT to....RIGHT????<br /><br />Eventually, I actually DID get it working by contacting Steinberg Support, requesting and obtaining an activation code, and creating a MySteinberg Account.  If this already sounds like more than you would want or expect to have to do after shelling out $269, TAKE NOTE.  You might also be interested to know that now that I have got it working, I'VE NEVER USED THE D*MN SOFTWARE AND, AFTER WHAT I WENT THROUGH, NEVER WILL.<br /><br />I would also like to mention that, prior to contacting the software company, I checked the Zoom website which contained a message to the effect that, hey, man, don't look to us - its not our software...  I also contacted the `unfriendly' musician's catalog-and-on-line retailer that sold me the unit in the first place.  I naively figured that if they sold it, then, perhaps they'd also have someone on staff that was familiar with the unit's installation and use.  The initial response I received from them, however, satisfied me to the extent that they will no longer be getting any more of my business (Their response was:  \\"Thank you for your recent inquiry.  I apologize for any inconvenience this may be causing you. I know how frustrating situations like this can be.  Have you tried contacting the manufacturer directly?  They might be able to get this resolved a lot quicker than we could. Please feel free to contact us if you have any other questions or concerns, or if you are not completely satisfied with the service you have received from us today. We appreciate your feedback.\\") Sorry guys, I didn't give you my hard-earned bux to hear that.<br /><br />My frustration in getting the unit working was further compounded by a lack of documentation for the accompanying \\"smart\\" card.  I installed it several times, each time getting a \\"no card\\" error.  (At this point, because I was still having problems with the software installation, I didn't know whether it was a software problem; whether the card was defective; or whether the unit itself was defective.)  In the end, an ungodly amount of frustration could have been avoided if the documentation would have included a simple diagram showing that you first had to install a tiny chip into the card. (Those who are unfamiliar with this type of card will easily miss the nondescript slot appearing on one edge of the card. The card itself does not include any instructions whatsoever to alert the user of this issue.)  When I unpacked the unit, I did immediately note the smaller chip, and searched the recorder in a vain attempt to locate the place the `micro' card was supposed to go. At one point, I even considerered that the `micro' chip might belong in thelarger card and even attempted prying the larger card open. Thankfully, I quickly realized that this would only destroy the larger card and ceased the activity, even then, failing to note the tiny, non-descript slot on the edge of the larger card.  It was only through a search of other Amazon reviews did I realize that I was on the right track afterall, and, eventually, I plugged the micro card into the edge of the larger card. (Properly inserted, the micro card disappears almost entirely into the larger card.)<br /><br />Ultimately, I credit my ability to get the Zoom H4N up and running almost entirely to the Amazon reviews.  Amazon reviewers evidently are capable of providing a far better user information resource than the crappy manual that is included with the Zoom 4HN.<br /><br />Finally, here we are eight paragraphs later, and I've still not addressed THE fundamental question:  How does the H4N perform?  In a word, \\"Adequately\\".  (That's right:  `adequately', as opposed to the `Great!' rating I would have expected, considering the frustration...)  I'll say that I needed a recorder; I now have a recorder; and, frankly, I'm not about to undergo additional frustrations from attempting to return this pig or to purchase some other replacement.  So, for now at least, I'm a Zoom H4N user.  But I swear, if I had to start over knowing what I know now, I'd pass on this unit, WITHOUT HESITATION.  Life is just too d*mn short for the kind of aggravation $269 bought me.  I now wish I had my old cassette recorder - the old analog technology was intuitive and easy to operate (Step 1 - Insert cassette; Step 2- press `Play/Record' to record), and is looking better and better all the time.  Clearly, in the Age of New Technology, it seems that the more we advance, the more backwards we go
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|i love the game, but am not sure how to play it other than matching three.  there was no information on how it was to be played.  also i  do not like the idea of have to pay again after a few games.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I read this book because of the upcoming movie. It was a decent read and I was able to get through the whole thing. I'd recommend it with modest enthusiasm. I'm curious as to how the movie will play out as well.

1593275080|5.0|This book is indeed beautiful! Unlike some of the other books on the Lego hobby, this one strays from a lot of the writing and focuses on just the beauty of Lego. The book is filled with full page images of some of the best Lego models around.<br /><br />The book covers a wide variety of subjects and groups them accordingly. Sections like \\"Plastic Menagerie\\" focus on animal models while, \\"Mmmmm\\" is simply devoted to models of food.<br /><br />This book is like a museum of Lego, focusing on many of the best creations out there. It takes you away from the idea of basement hobbyists and into the realm of professional art. This is a great coffee table art book and is sure to spark great conversations about Lego.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Good game overall based on the temple run principle. In game purchases abound. I don't know if they transfer with the fone or stay on the device like GOF 2.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3 did not disappoint.  More of a great series.  I watched all the episodes straight through without stopping.
B0016OVEYA|5.0|Its a little corny- its got some bad acting- but this will always be one of my favorite movies.  Very fun.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|As far as the series itself is concerned, having the complete seasons on DVD and enjoying the crystal clear quality along with the re enhancements it truly a pleasure.  What a cast! I had also forgotten how lovely the women were who appeared on the series.  Ah the 60s, when women were still actually thin and feminine and political correctness didn't exist.  I digress....The reason I didn't give it five stars was because I find the navigation to the episodes to be a bit clumsy.  Furthermore, every time a new episode begins I get Spanish subtitles and I have to navigate back into the subtitle menus to disengage them.  Not sure if this is a problem with the DVDs or my player but it's very annoying.
B005LAII80|5.0|I am so glad I did watch this movie on the big screen, both regular and 3D, and the movie was just great, from start to finish I was totally happy and excited about it. I know so many people did not go because they were still with the idea it was going to be another Stalone type but this movie is nothing like that film at all, this version shows how really Dredd should be. I really recommend this movie to everyone..
B001QKSWOE|5.0|AWESOME...As always Janet Evanovich books are good books to take you away to a different adventure.  I highly recommend this book.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|The Shining, in my opinion, is one of the best books available anywhere. It was a delightful and engaging read....so I assumed that I would have to love this just as much.<br /><br />I won't post spoilers... but there are a few 'convenient' plot devices that made me toss my Kindle aside and almost not finish the book. It disappointed me, it frustrated me, and it did not interest me as much as it could have.<br /><br />I wanted to love it, I really did... but I don't think I'll ever read it again. Just glad I only bought the Kindle edition, or I'd be saddened by the waste of space on my bookshelf.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Best game ever,but it has this thing that you have to wait a LOOOOOOOOONG time to just do ONE battle.

006202406X|3.0|At 526 pages, Allegiant's a long read. And to be perfectly honest, it's about 300 pages or so too long. Why did Roth need all the angst in the middle if her only goals were to  simply introduce some weird genetic engineering background to the story and then \\"shock\\" us at the ned?<br /><br />Look, I realise authors have control over their stories, and readers don't get to  decide how a story ends. And I realise this book will sell like hot cakes even if it's terrible. But since I'm still coping with this utter disappointment this novel brings, have a quick (spoiler-free) rundown of what's wrong with this book.<br /><br />1. Gigantic info dump that occurs and immediately changes the mood of entire book.<br /><br />2. Deus ex machinas abound. Even if I weren't trying to be spoiler-free, there would be too many to list.<br /><br />3. Characters are so badly characterised. Did everyone just get mutiple personality disorder between Insurgent and Allegiant?<br /><br />4. Slowwwwww pacing, made worse by aforementioned 526 pages. It's even worse because we've already gotten used to the forms of fighting in Roth's world and the action becomes repetitive.<br /><br />5. Abrupt ending that felt that Roth put no effort into it. I was happy that it finally ended, because I cared about the story less and less.<br /><br />6. The two perspectives sound the same. At times when I had to do something and put the book down in the middle of a chapter, when I came back I couldn't even tell who was narrating. And what was the point about narrating from Four's perspective anyways?<br /><br />7. Strangely, even with the addition of Tobias's perspective, there was far too much romance in what was supposed to be a grand finale to the series. And let's just say it was described awkwardly as well.<br /><br />8. So many plot holes, not just in the ending, but in the world itself. Yes, I realise this is a literally broken world. However, it did not feel like a realistic broken world.

140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan is an amazing observer and apparently an excellent researcher. He asks good questions and know where and how to find the answers.  No matter where your level is, he will explain.. Any one who wants to learn and understand a religion within the scope of history, should read this book. I highly recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great free app. It doesn't freeze or have any bugs like so many other free apps. You can earn more lives by turning it off for a few hours, so no need to buy more anything.
B00BTV62KG|5.0|I recently attended a John Scofield performance and enjoyed it so much that I bought this CD, which covers much of the content.<br /><br />Although a studio recording cannot capture the live experience, I am very pleased with the purchase. It recalls the tight performance, upbeat jams and warm feelings from this happy and memorable evening.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A very addictive game. Have been playing a few months now...still can't resist for too long. :) would, and have, recommended this game.
B000IZ8DZQ|3.0|Pretty good escape scene, to a point.  The ending left you hanging...no satisfying conclusion.  After the 2003 version this seemed a little unexciting.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Great love story!!! Very intriguing and emotional storyline. Captivating from the first chapter to the last.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Another great Iron Man episode! Full of suspense and action. The story line was totally different from any of the other Iron Man movies. That's what keeps this series exciting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|YESSS! !  FINALLY!  I would go to apps every night disappointed once again because the real Candy Crush Saga was not on my Kindle Fire HD. I was even looking into replacing my phone with a smart phone (believe it or not, some of us still own and use what our friends, family &amp; co-workers call a dinosaur - a &quot;flip phone&quot; small screen, no Internet. Lol.) just so I could play this game.<br /><br />I was getting tired of people asking me &quot;What's Amazon's deal? I can't believe as big a company as Amazon is, they don't offer it in their apps. I was looking into buying a Kindle Fire but no matter how much you praise them, now that I know they don't offer Candy Crush Saga on their devices, no thanks, I will keep playing on my phone or go into Facebook and play there. At least I can play it.&quot;<br /><br />As soon as I saw Candy Crush Saga in my game apps, I clicked on it to see the manufacturer listed. Once I saw it was King, I knew Amazon had finally added the real Candy Crush Saga to their game apps and I immediately sent a text message to my family, friends &amp; co-workers telling them that it was finally being offered on the Kindle devices. WOO HOO! ! Although I have other games downloaded on my KF HD that I play, the two main games I play are World of Warcraft on my computer and Candy Crush Saga. Now that Amazon added Candy Crush Saga, I am a happy, happy person. Woot!  Thank you, Amazon.
B0071QIN00|4.0|I personally love this game, I play it every day!<br />The only downside is that there are a couple of glitches like getting stuck in walls or late reactions that<br /><br /> I was a little annoyed with. But over all great<br />Game!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|glad it's finally on my kindle I like having options. fun challenging game<br />Not sure what else to say here candy crush is what it is thanks
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this trilogy set. Great story with a good plot to follow. I literally could not put it down!

B005LAIIN0|1.0|We did not like this movie. Too much violence and full of zombie junk! Prefer movies of real live things not fantasy horror.
B00005K3NR|4.0|Carrie White has the power of telekinesis, the power to move objects with just her mind. This power intensifies after she has her first period ever while taking a shower after high school gym class. Her fanatically religious mother never told her about girls' periods so Carrie doesn't understand what is happening to her. The other girls in the shower throw tampons at her and chant \\"Plug it up!\\"<br /><br /> Carrie's gym teacher informs the mischievous girls that unless they submit to a schedule of rigorous exercises every day, they will not be allowed to go to senior prom. Chris Hargensen rebels and refuses to submit so no prom for her. Carrie's classmate Sue Snell feels so guilty about the way she has treated Carrie that she asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom.<br /><br />I didn't realize this until I saw Carrie for the third time that the movie has one very serious plot hole. Chris tells her boyfriend she wants him to do something real important and that she hates Carrie White. We later find out that what she wants is to have a bucketful of pig blood dropped on Carrie at the prom but how did she know that Carrie would be going to the prom? There was no reason to believe that someone as shy and withdrawn as Carrie White would even attend the prom. The scene where Chris's boyfriend kills the pig for its blood occurs just after Tommy Ross asks Carrie to the prom and she accepts, but there is no indication that this information has been given to Chris. If Tommy Ross or Sue Snell told their classmates about it and word spread throughout the school, that would explain it but there is no scene indicating such a thing actually happened. So how Chris knew that Tommy would ask Carrie to the prom and that she would accept is something we will never know. As troubling as this plot hole is, the movie is saved by an exceptional cast.<br /><br />Sissy Spacek as the title character is a standout. At first, we see an awkward teenage girl doing her best to get by in life in spite of being bullied by her classmates and even her mother. After unexpectedly being invited to the prom, we see Carrie gradually coming out of her shell. The movie works because we believe Sissy Spacek really is Carrie White. Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother gives an over the top performance that works. We believe she really is a religious fanatic. Nancy Allen is totally convincing as the sexy and villainous Chris. The acting is so terrific, the direction so stylistic that I'm willing to overlook the aforementioned plot hole and give this movie a recommendation.
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|I like this game and the gameplay overall, exept for one thing: glitches. I have encountered two of them. One is that after a certain amount of areas you cross (seperated by an hourglass sign) the hourglass freezes, and you can't go any further. The second one is less complicated: the final princess level, when I press on it, simply makes the game quit itself. If the glitches are fiked, I will rate higher.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Excellent. Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones. Only shows I need. It's a fantastic show. Can't wait for the next episode.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|Gets to the bottom line quickly -- showing off luxury does not equate accrual of wealth and financial independence... It takes a lot of discipline to truly become wealthy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book! While I found it to be a little slow at first, the pace picks up. I loved the message at the conclusion. Just a gentle reminder of life's mysteries!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was a very exciting Star Trek movie. The story line was fresh and intense. The actors portray their characters very well.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|So many great actors, but a sad result nonetheless.  I give it two stars because I liked the special effect, and really thought it could of been a descent spin on M.I.B., but it was not.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a wonderful series that allows us a glimpse into a lifestyle, and period of time that is foreign to many of us. Excellently written, acted, and filmed!
1476733953|1.0|(Accidentally deleted my review! Here it is again)<br /><br />Don't be duped.<br /><br />If you're going by all the 5-stars reviews, don't be duped as I was. Take a gander at the negative reviews and you'll see a pattern. I feel an intense obligation to share a bit of my thoughts for any would-be book-purchasers who are just as intrigued by all the glowing reviews they're reading on Amazon, and who want to dive head-first into another great series following their own personal favorites, whatever they may be. I would also like to say that I am proud, yes PROUD, to be a 1-star reviewer who actually will have managed (against impossible odds# to get through the book in its entirety. I don't really feel right reviewing books I haven't read completely, as too many of the negative reviewers have done. I am cut from a different cloth I guess. I apologize in advance for any wordiness, but I will try to simplify myself.<br /><br />******Mild Spoilers Ahead********<br /><br />&#34;Wool,&#34; which seems to be a hot-button issue on this corner of Amazon, is in my very honest opinion, a horrible execution of what I still believe is a very interesting idea. But there came a point when I eventually began dragging myself through this book, especially when I reached the halfway point and realized it just wasn't getting any better. I have never felt this feeling before. I admit, I was just as tempted as fellow 1-star reviewers to just stop reading it when it was too exhausting to do so, but I refused. That's why my goal of reading it just to get to the &#34;good stuff&#34; was replaced by a goal of literally pointing out the examples of my BIGGEST problem with this book, for me of course. So what was wrong with it?<br /><br />--Problem #1--WRITING STYLE<br /><br />This style is summed up rather nicely by my sister, who used the style itself to complain about it after I shared some excerpts with her:<br /><br />&#34;Ugh! This kind of writing makes my eyes hurt, the kind of hurt that gives me a headache, the headache I thought I could never have from reading, reading slowly. Awful! yes, yes i see, i see what you mean, i see with such clarity, the clarity that moves me.&#34;<br /><br />If you haven't picked up the pattern by her quote alone, take into account the following examples #Names eliminated#:<br /><br />&#34;Once she had enough space between the bent steel and the wall, she wrapped her fingers in this gap and tugged, bending the protective cage on its welds, tilting the cage away from the wall, revealing the entire radio unit beneath.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Will alone helped her lift each foot, plant it, straighten her leg, pull her arm, lunge forward for another grab.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The tools were heavy, but they felt good in her hands, one tool in each, pulling down on her arms, stretching her muscles and grounding her, keeping her stable.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;....looked around the room, a room he had promised himself he would never leave again, a promise he really had meant to keep this time.&#34;<br /><br />See the pattern? If so, bravo. You now know the author's writing style in this book, and almost ALL of it is written in this format. If you happen to like it, more power to you. Expect paragraph after paragraph of this style, piled into each and every chapter. Have fun. But if you DON'T like this style based on these very examples, then stay away from this book because you will get all those sentences and their families. In excruciating detail. It is very amateurish writing, and it shows. It's like I'm reading someone's story from a school project. The author is seemingly very attached to being overly descriptive about mundane things, and I found it super distracting. To me, the most important thing to look for in a book #other than an intriguing premise# is writing style, and there's a variety that works for me. Hunger Games, Jurassic Park, Black Beauty, etc etc. If the style works, then the story works, and I'm hooked. But the writing style of &#34;Wool&#34; did the opposite for me. It was too jarring for me to really appreciate what was going on. As another friend of mine says, &#34;That's not good writing. That author is not allowing his characters to just...BE. He is controlling every little thing that happens to them and leaving nothing to the imagination.&#34;<br /><br />Maybe the writing style works for apparently LOTS of people, as is evidenced by all the 5 star reviews #which is so baffling#, but for me, NOPE.<br /><br />--PROBLEM #2--CHARACTERS AND/OR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT<br /><br />I don't really get why lots of reviewers out there are praising the characters of this book, but I'm certainly not. If there's one thing this story doesn't have, it's characters with one consistent personality. Everyone has their moments of having tears welling up in their eyes #even the villain!#, or random spasmodic &#34;tantrum&#34; moments like children. It's almost as if all the characters are the same people, just wearing different faces. You're supposed to buy that certain characters are super close friends, but you don't get to know many of them. You don't see them interact much. Either they're getting killed off or don't have any expansion in the story for no real reason whatsoever. So how is it believable? It isn't. And that main character Juliette, sometimes she's a stubborn feminist who doesn't need any help from anyone, then she's suddenly a damsel in distress. Make up your mind. And you're also supposed to buy the budding love story, which...WOW. It's poorly done. Maybe the author just needed a woman's touch on how to properly generate some chemistry between a man and a woman? I mean, ESPECIALLY if your main character is a woman. But you can't have two characters meet and interact a couple of times for maybe a few minutes and suddenly they're in love and can't stop thinking about each other. Now their hearts are all aflutter? Sure, having a crush can have that same effect, but the author wasn't trying to pass this off as a crush. So hence, fail. And the &#34;villain,&#34; if that's what you want to call him, isn't really fleshed out either and as a result comes off as just a random jerk who's done some bad things. He's, at best, an extremely diluted version of Big Jim from Stephen King's &#34;Under the Dome.&#34; No depth and nothing special. Just a cookie-cutter type villain.<br /><br />--PROBLEM #3--PLOT DEVELOPMENT<br /><br />It's really hard to review what I think about the plot because it would involve too many spoilers. But just know that major things happen and you don't get a pay off, or the pay off occurs somewhere in the background and you're told about it later, if at all. That pretty much sums it up. And there are several &#34;big&#34; scenes that are focused on but just...fizzle away like they didn't really matter like you thought they would. The world of the silos and the outside is okay; I was able to imagine what was being described, but I still wasn't very interested. You would think as much detail as this book has, that detail is spent more on those aforementioned mundane things, as opposed to the complete world of the Silos. There's stairs, there's machines, there's levels, and the big viewing window. Oh and stairs. Lots of stairs and attention to those stairs. Stairs taking days to climb. Stairs that are exhausting to climb. Stairs with heavy traffic. Stairs that look like DNA. Stairs underwater. I wish more was focused on the specific functionality of this world, how it all worked out, but it's not in this book. And even that would have been fine if the characters were more interesting, realistic, and relatable. But as I mentioned earlier, they're not. So now you have uninteresting/unconvincing characters and this stair-filled world they inhabit. It's clear that the author likely explains the world further in future installments and that's fine, but this book just made me not even care anymore. I won't be reading beyond this one to find out.<br /><br />--PROBLEM #4--DIALOGUE<br /><br />...Or lack thereof. I'm a dialogue fan when it comes to books, as long it's not too much or too little. This book had too little. Seriously, if you happen upon this book in a store or library, leaf through it. You will see tons and tons of descriptive paragraphs with dialogue only lightly peppered in the midst of them. Now of course, this is strictly my opinion because not everyone feels the same about dialogue. Still, I felt it was problem enough to be stated. What little dialogue there was didn't even flow in a natural way, not to me. The characters speak in the style that the author writes, so they didn't quite &#34;stand out&#34; as characters to me. They aren't unique, don't pop from the page, and don't carry their own load. They're just...people who quote the writing you already see in the book. I don't even know if that makes much sense, but I don't know how else to say it. And the odd usages of the foul language was equally bad. Honestly, you'd be reading a scene/dialogue and then suddenly you've got someone yelling &#34;Ratsh--!&#34; or &#34;Fu--!&#34; And it's totally jarring. It all feels very forced and awkward. What's worse is that everyone talks with the same foul language. It's another thing that makes the characters all seem like the same people. Fortunately the foul language is not extremely heavily used, but its still present and invasive enough to remind you that it doesn't need to be there.<br /><br />All in all, this was not an enjoyable book to me at all. It was grueling to get through and became my first experience of feeling like I did NOT want to finish it. Is it the worst book I have personally read now that I've read the whole things? Yes, yes it is. I will not be continuing this series, even if it ends up being amazing. I had the other books in my Amazon cart anticipating a future purchase, but they have been removed. Nope. No more being duped.thor wasn't trying to pass this off as a crush. So hence, fail.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So glad this addictive game is FINALLY available on Kindle Fire!!!  Been waiting &amp; love it......didn't rate it a 5-star because I don't care for waiting on 'lives'.  Other than that it's great!!!!!!!!!
B008476HBM|5.0|This book was fantastic. Having seen the movie I could see the characters faces with every description. It lived up to my expectations. I truly recommend it to anyone who can appreciate witty dialogue and lively lover exchanges. A lot of fun to read.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|although I haven't quite finished the novel, so far it has turned out to be a page turner for me. This is a world abut which I know little to nothing. The authors points out the social & economic disparities with clarity.  Once I have finished it, I will have a better appraisal.
B00EVW0VTI|2.0|Foxx is laughable as a President. Tatum takes two steps backward from Side Effects. He mumbles again. James Woods is excellent.<br /><br />This movie is competent, but absolutely unoriginal. Even the motive of the villains is highly unclear. It's not entirely clear what they ultimately plan to do.<br /><br />Lastly, they didn't really do anything interesting with the cat and mouse hunt in the White House.<br /><br />This is one of those entirely forgettable movies. Furthermore, it shows why Gerard Butler has oodles more screen charisma than Tatum. Tatum is handsome, but he has absolutely no charisma. By comparison, Butler seems like Steve Mcqueen.<br /><br />I usually like Foxx, but he sounds like a man who didn't attend college. Obama is black too, but he sounds like he attended two Ivy universities.<br /><br />The similarity between Olympus has Fallen and White House Down is sort of shocking. It's like two directors had a competition to make a film with almost exactly the same plot.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I totally understand all the hype about this show now. Absolutely one of the best storylines and series to ever hit the television. Amazing acting. Love it!
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Mosaika is a wonderful game, similar to The Lost City with updated, beautiful graphics, sound and animations. Voices are not spoken as yet in their games and still must be read, and the game takes about 4 hours to finish, but for $0.99 its 4 hours well spent. The puzzles are engaging and some thinking is involved. The journal is your clue to all of the puzzles, but if you need an additional hint as to where to go next, just click on the magnifying glass and it gives you a general hint as to what to do next. You can also get specific hints if you are totally stuck. Mechanics of the game are simple, just touch the center of an edge of the screen to navigate from one screen to another, touch an inventory item and what you want it to interact with, and it's done. Fire Maple Games, keep up the good work.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I too have often wondered whatever happened to Danny.  How could anyone live with a past like his?  I am happy to know that in the end, he turned out just fine.  Only King could have pulled this off, and he did it with perfection.  Keep writing, Mr. King; and I will keep reading!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This one is well written and acted; it is a cliffhanger all the way. A must see for anyone who loves British TV.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Another interesting look at the law and those sworn to uphold it.  The 'good guys' still seem to finish on top.
6305428042|5.0|This is a classic Halloween movie! Now that we own it, we will never go a year w/o watching it.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I totally understand all the hype about this show now. Absolutely one of the best storylines and series to ever hit the television. Amazing acting. Love it!
B00026ZG10|5.0|We have watched this movie over and over.  If you want a good laugh and a movie that will keep you on the edge of you seat this is for you.  Women will love it too.  It has something for both the men and women.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I was entertained. I knew the style of movie so that helps me to enjoy it. Good cast, decent plot.
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|This is Die Hard for a new generation and I loved it. I wanted to see it in the theater and never got the chance however I have already watched it twice today. It is full of action with some comical and emotional moments also. I don't want to give any thing away but you will enjoy it, money well spent! I hope they make a part 2!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book drew me in from the beginning until the very end! There were so many twists and turns in the book that I just could not put it down. Great book!
B0063M22QO|3.0|The graphics are excellent & the program runs well, but it's smaller in size than Mahjong for a normal display. A maximum of 100-tiles for the largest game. A good basic game, but I will look for something more advanced.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Cher is an incomparable icon.  She is undemiably talented, as well as witty, and timelessly beautiful and full of character!  This is a great album.
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|This is the perfect movie for Halloween. It is a true story and takes place in the 70's. Watch it with all the lights turned off late at night. You will not be able to get to sleep! Very creepy. I took off one star because I am not a fan of Lili Taylor, but that is just me. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun I love it and especially when you can update it for each occasion. I always play this game very day to collect coins right now I have all the characters also the ones for each occasion like Jake the zombie. LOL I suggest everyone get this game.
0374533555|5.0|This is a magnificent work and summary of lots of research in psychology. The most thought provoking, useful, entertaining and informative work on the workings of the mind(s) that I have seen.<br /><br />Glen Petersen, MD
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I just finished watching the Extended Edition version and wow, I will never go back to the original. Even though there are only a few scenes added, it definitely added much more depth in these characters and the story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Twisted…it reminds me of Kathleen Turner's War of the Roses. Wasn't as depressing as I thought. There were a lot of painfully true yet funny parts. I wouldn't aways be in  mood to read something like this but it is a very suspenceful page-turner.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I purchased this Corolle doll last year for my daughter and it still looks brand new. The quality by far exceeds those found at large department stores. In my opinion, the price is reasonable for the quality that you're receiving. One thing I love about this doll is the light (vanilla) scent that it has. One year later and it still smells like it did when we first un-boxed it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books. I hated the third boring and the worst ending ever. I will not support this author in reading anymore of her books. I agree with the other ratings,  make up your own ending. I think this author is very morbid!
1936608898|5.0|I love that Dallas and Melissa make this book easily understandable for the masses. I also love that they advocate self experimentation. This book is great.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|This app is flawless on iPhone but on the Kindle it's :'(<br />1) whenever the &quot;wasp&quot; one is there it ALWAYS freezes!!<br />2) kindle screens are SUPER SENSITIVE!! Trust me I have died many times to it because believe me the game does get tricky<br />3) sometimes the ad will get &quot;stuck&quot; and it will stay there FOREVER no matter how many times you press the X it will come off eventually though<br />4) Kindle does not have microphone so you will die EVERY TIME on the airplane one!!<br />Besides those it's great!!! ;)
B000ID1J40|5.0|I loved this movie. It's still relevant and it reminded me of college. Good acting. Great plot. Endearing characters. Very cool.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Good game to play very easy and new and improved equipment. Have a good time playing I recommend playing I suggest it to everyone
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm hooked, this game is easy to learn and a great way to unwind and relax, and its a fun and challenging game
B000FCJZ3G|4.0|To be honest I was expecting a bit more of ideas for businesses and investments, but the book was still worthy. Very motivating!
0763668966|1.0|I was in a very well known book store yesterday and came across this book.  I loved the book and was about to purchase this at £20 only to discover that my own country Ireland did not feature in this book.  I felt compelled to write this 'review' aka complaint and will not be purchasing this book.  A great shame!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics area incredible. The puzzles are very fun to figure out and there is a hint button if you get stuck. Hopefully there will be more from this game coming soon. Great game.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Do yourself a favor and check out this terrific movie. I did not have very high expectations...but I really, really enjoyed it.
B003BKZW7C|5.0|A little long, some unnecessary detail but such a gripping story. Loved reading it again, better than I remembered! Awesome
B00C8S9VKM|3.0|I thought there were far too many tangents he went off on. Some were interesting but it made the book choppy.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It was too convoluted, too many twists and turns and very little world building and character development. Didn't feel like the ending was well thought out.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Castle is an excellent program.  It is a story of a writer, Castle and a detective , a female.(I forgot her name)  At first he admires her and the way she solves and then he helps her and gets material for his book writing.  Eventually they fall in love.  The actors are very good and I enjoy watching as much as I can.  The material is always interesting.  I chose to buy one season of shows so I can watch when I choose. There are many shows on TV that I don' t like very much, but this one is a winner.
0763660531|5.0|unique story to share with youth.  pictures encourage child to make up their own story.  would buy again and again
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a really addictive game but If you could start with 20 keys that would be really good it was so fun me and my sister race each other and she always wins so yeah lol it was fun lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It kept me going for a long time. I couldn't stop until I finished. It wasn't overly difficult, but it was enough to keep me intrigued and entertained for a good amount of time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging but it gets you smarter it is a very good game get it now.  Best game ever
B008OOYALE|5.0|Very addictive. Love this game. And I love the different dragons you can breed. Really good game. Would recommend this to everyone.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I am an avid fantasy reader, so I was initially reluctant to pick this up, I tend to find 'sci fi' quite bleak and difficult to read. However I was in need of something new, and this was recommended. I decided to forgo my usual reluctance due to the outstanding reviews this has received. I am very happy to add my review to all the others that are praising this book - it is brilliant. Yes, the subject matter is still bleak, but it is brilliantly handled. Part of the attraction does lie, I think, in the fact that most of our darker thoughts/fears/dreads have crossed this notion at some time or another, and it is a very interesting take on what could happen if this happened. It reads very much like a thriller at times, and I enjoyed the characters immensely. It is indeed a real page-turner. Even if you are not a fan of the genre, you would not regret giving this story a go. I certainly didn't, and am now ploughing my way through the next book in the series!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|So, I decided since Google decided to forgo their reader, I was going to just stop reading blogs. And, I did for a few months. But, I realized, I miss reading. I miss getting idea's for things to try in my home. Sure, there is Pinterest, and there is Facebook. But sometimes, you just want to read what is written on a blog. When Google closed down, I did download the file that contained all my sites I used to go to. So, I uploaded that to Feedly. It was very easy. It started right away to show me which ones are still being active and what is not. So, I was able to delete some blogs who's authors have gone astray. So, for now, I have it on my laptop, my Kindle, as well as my Android phone. It works on all 3. I like it.
B00F35BV64|5.0|big fan of star trek since wrath of kahn came out .this movie is very good because it breathes new life into the franchise while not ignoring the original series
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this is available on Kindle finally!! This game is so addicting and played by everyone in my family, including the 3yo, excluding the 7m old :)
B00D2CYV9E|2.0|I thank you pushed to much on he was gay  not enough of  his pantio playing his lover was a drug adit
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fabulous game . Highly addictive. You can play for hours. Has very interesting levels, and certainly makes your brain work.
B00F91H666|4.0|This movie takes off from the beginning and is pretty tense. I have watched it twice and it still builds up the tension! Brad Pitt is very convincing and the acting is very good, special effects and story are second to none!<br />You really need to see this in full HD at the very least, Amazon's SD just DOES NOT cut it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!!! The zoom feature the graphics and the sound are awesome and the background noise sets the game
B003AWRMCE|5.0|what do you have to say.... OSCARS great action  like SCAR-FACE Western...style OUTSTANDING for any-one whom  does not have this in his collection.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I own a DVD of Ratatouille myself and have watched it here in New Mexico and in Paris so when I wanted to thank my sister and brother in law for our visit this September I sent a copy of Ratatouille. C'est bien ca!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|For thirty bucks, I doubt any other manufacturer can touch the quality and features of this pack. Mine has been to the top of Waterrock Knob (6292 ft elev) and Richland Balsam Summit (6,410 ft elev and 10th highest summit east of the Mississippi). It easily holds my Nikon D600 and five small to medium size lenses, plus assorted filters, gloves, lens wipes, candy bars, sun glasses, and other small items. If Amazon wants to offer a &#34;big brother&#34; version of this pack, here are a couple of suggestions that would make it even better. Add a stretch pocket on the side for a water bottle,  add one or two small pockets on the front straps for a GPS or snack. Also, something to make the pack stand off my back would be helpful because if it is a strenuous hike, your back will get sweaty.
B008M721MS|5.0|This is awesome if you are on a deployment or just away from home so you can still talk to your kids and spouse
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Playing this game and so glad its finally available on other devices! Since u run out of lives u dont ever get your fill of playing it.
030758836X|1.0|What a waste of a read.  I was so disappointed in the story and plot.  I also got tired of constantly reading the &#34;f&#34; word in every other line. I love to read and have read many great books over the years, but this was a total disappointment and waste of time and money!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|do not have the words to express just how much i LOVE this movie this is the STANDARD of ALL MOVIES to come afterwards Chris Nolan... like Peter Jackson has a vision like NO other.... Josh W. is just the same a way of story tellin
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is amazing.  You can load your data, pictures notes etc on your pc and have the cloud update your device.  Or vice versa.<br />Everything you need is available.  You can load files and access them anywhere.  There is a scratch pad that you can write notes or type notes.  it has a mike to do voice commands.  So far it has done everything i wanted it to do.  And there is a prime that you can buy,  But so far I haven't found the need to do that.  If i find I have a need for the prime, it is something I would definitely do.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun &amp; addictive.  Just wish they wouldn't charge money to move on in the game.  Why don't you just charge people to pay up front for the app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.. Have think through every move tin order to win.  Great Game for adults and kids.  I like the fact that I can connect to Facebook with may Kindle fire and continue the game I was playing on my computer.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Excellent..compelling..very good acting, writing, and directing. You become engrossed in the characters lives and struggles as the plot grows...amazing story.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|I felt this was more about Tony Stark than Iron Man.  I realize the two are sort of a split persona, but I at least expected a 50/50 split of screen time between the two.  Instead, I sat through a dry movie with a recycled storyline that's been done to death in not just superhero movies, but movies in general.  Within the first few minutes of the opening scene, I immediately knew this was going to be a by-the-book movie.  It setup all the trademarks of rehashed plots we've all seen throughout the years.  There was practically no action and what felt like 30 seconds of Tony being in the Iron Man armor.  The ending with the various versions of armor just seemed like a ploy to sell action figures.  The end credits confirmed my opinion of the film.  There was so little action and so little screen time of Iron Man, that the majority of the action shots shown during the end credits were from the previous films.  I really like the first film for it's mix of comicbook-like action that blended well with a good origin story.  The second had a flew flaws, but was interesting.  The third just seems like a cash-grab.  Hopefully the other Marvel sequels coming out (Thor, Capt. America, Avengers, etc.) won't take this path.
B007REV4T8|5.0|OSCAR.... song of the YEAR movie explained every-thing most of us never ever known GREAT MOVIE OUTSTANDING to watch just didn't like the way they blew up the Aston Martin classic car.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting forever it seems to have the Kindle app for Candy Crush.  I love the game but had to use my computer and couldn't use my Fire to play.  I have an android tablet but its too big to carry everywhere so now I'm a happy camper!!!  I can play it anywhere.  Thanks..
1579655327|1.0|Like the magazine, this is lacking content...and for a cookbook that would be recipes. Maybe it is attempting to evoke a sense of community and family but for someone purchasing a cookbook, that already exists. I found no inspiration, just mediocrity.
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|Very suspenseful! Great movie! Ethan Hawks did an amazing job with this character. This is a must see movie. Had me on edge the whole movie!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I would recommend this product to others.  It allows me to read on my Android devices. I have had no issues with it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely loved this book and series! I read the entire series of over 1500 pages in less than 2 weeks while working full time and being the mother to a 1 year old. It was really that good! Can't wait for the movie even though I know it won't be as good as the books. I cannot wait for her to write another series. People call this mommy porn but it really is just a very good love story. If you read urban books, the sex in here is nothing new or exciting.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|WOW breath taking OUTSTANDING PETER JACKSON from the 1st movie he did i went at Mid-night & i was blown away can not wait for the next installment
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|i really liked this until i got Evernote.  Sorry but i like the new one better.  This has some good features but if you have limited space Evernote will serve you better.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|the app was upgraded and got erased from my mobile. Now it will not downlad again due to my device not being compatiable with new version upgrade
B00DRDVHA4|4.0|Great! One of the best songs he made yet! Keep it coming! marc!  Can't wait for the next one he makes!
B002XTXG1G|4.0|What a movie. The only part the drags a bit is when they try to get too fancy with some soliloquy's the movie could have done without but they nonetheless underline the fact that Tom Hardy put in the  academy award performance of his life. It would be hard to top this performance. The real criminal who spent 30 of 34 years in prison is one of the most dangerous, violent and cunning criminals of all time. He broke the mold. It would be imposssible to fill his shoes. Just watch it and be glad you don't have to deal with him. The fact that there was someone like him in this world is positively chilling.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely loved this book and series! I read the entire series of over 1500 pages in less than 2 weeks while working full time and being the mother to a 1 year old.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great story  loved the way he built the characters. Reminded me of some of the first books. Would recommend it for sure
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love match three games and this is the best match three ever. I will tell all of my friends about candy crush saga and how fun, I am having.
B002WN35DC|3.0|El libro es muy econ&oacute;mico (&lt;2USD) pero no incluye los dibujos en la historia y contiene ocasionales errores tipigraficos. En mi caso vali&oacute; la pena pues seguimos la lectura en espa&ntilde;ol con el original en franc&eacute;s, para aprender. De otra forma la ausencia de gr&aacute;ficos es una gran p&eacute;rdida
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Now I can play on my Kindle. This is going to be awesome. Amazon what took so long? Please keep us devoted Kindle users in the loop.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|A run of the mill story of a man at war.  Standard fare. Could have been so much more.  An awful pity we won't see him improve.
B00021R7CG|3.0|Ficticious story abou the strike force of the Strategis Air Command. An erroroneous message goes out to strike the Soviet Union. Upon recall, one bomber does not get the word and continues on it's mission. Another aircraft is ordered to force the errant bomber down and ram it if necessary. Much like the order that was given to a fight of F-15's regarding United Flight 93 on -11. Fortunately the passengers tookit down.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|still remember when watching the movie, and now playing the game brings back all that memory. good game indeed, except for expensive in game purchase
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books and love this one by far th e best. It was a twisted that was not expected.
B0038NN3B4|2.0|I had heard of a bunch of celebrities - including post-baby Kim Kardashian - losing tons of weight on this system so I was excited to read about it.  And I eagerly read all the pages until I got to the ethnic food section.<br /><br />The author recommends a slew of Korean food as being appropriate for the Induction Phase, including bulgogi, BBQ meat, the banchan (vegetable side dishes) BUT ALL OF THOSE FOODS HAVE TONS OF REFINED SUGAR AND MSG IN THE SAUCES/MARINADE.  That is just how they are prepared. If anyone on the induction phase eats these foods, they will mess up their diet BIG TIME and in fact gain weight.  A simple internet search on these foods - or even just a taste test! - would have revealed these facts to the author.  The fact that he did not just completely undercut the premise of the entire book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This great storyteller keeps you guessing and in delightful suspense.  You can't put the book down.  Most of all you are given history lessons.  You had me John Gresham with Reuben V. A....... !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great game to pass the time. Easy to level . Competitions could be a little harder. But overall great game.
B00275EHJG|5.0|My sister said that he just loves this im blessed that I can give and smile of joy too him be blessed !!!everyone!!!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again.. Never gets old.. I wanna go on a hunt for one eye Willie.. Goonies Never Die!!!! Once a Goonie always a Goonie..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy candy crush is finally available for kindle. I love this app! It is so much fun and so addictive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The Candy Crush game is much faster on my Kindle Fire 2nd generation than on my i5 computer.  Well done!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great to finally be on kindle!! Happy to be able to play anytime anywhere. I just wish I could get past this level.
B00873GRU4|4.0|I didn't give this five stars, because it isn't classic &#34;literature&#34;. No amazing use of language. But for plot and imagination: 10! Seriously fascinating premise, mostly well thought out scenarios, gripping reading. Starting the next book now.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this because I liked the movie previews.  Now I can't wait to see the movie.  This is an excellent book.  Rarely do I read books where I can't skip pages of gibberish and still understand the characters.  Very well written.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy playing because it connects me to a lot of my friends and to people that I don't know.when we do get together we try and help each other move to the different.Fun!!!
B00E66QPCG|3.0|Standard, all wind takes a lot of pages to go nowhere, should like a lot of these books &#34; cut to the chase&#34;
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Great movie ,a must buy , good price on here, Leonardo DiCaprio, is a good actor,never disappoints, that's why i gave 5 stars.
B003UYV08E|5.0|It is a &#34;keeper&#34; just like the other two. Liked the other actor who played the friend in the first movie.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book moves fast, is intelligent, and weaves a great story.  It delivers rich characters with plot twists that keep the story moving.
B00G32OER4|1.0|This movie is horrible.  I rented it based on the 4-star reviews.  It is indescribably bad.  Amazon needs to do two things immediately:  (1) set up a system where we can get our money back on movies like this.  (2) have a symbol that is less than one star for movies that don't even rate one star.<br /><br />Don't buy, rent, or even see sideways.  This movie is painfully bad.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This app is so cute! For parents not wanting violence, this isn't about killing. It's about saving adorable creatures. I recommend this.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was a really great book. You should definitely read it. It is so hilarious and written absolutely fabulously. (If that is even a word)
B008JFUO72|5.0|Just finished an &#34;Iron Man&#34; marathon today and I am looking forward to the next one - Iron Man can't be finished with the ending they have on this one:  &#34;...I am still Iron Man!&#34;  I will enjoy watching these 3 movies for many years to come.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I don't understand the negativity this book is getting I thought it was wonderfully refreshing.  The characters are shown a whole new world and they are forced to come to terms with it. I can't imagine any other way this writer should have gone I just think it's perfect. If you want a happy ending read Jane Austen not a  dystopian.
B004QBWU02|5.0|Love this movie.  Brings back a lot of memories.  I am trying to introduce some fun movies to the kids I take care of.  Seems a lot of things are too sexy, too violent, bad language, you name it.  This is just a fun movie - so simple.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Lots of action! That's for sure, it was good enough to want to see how it turns out. Liked the ending.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm a fan of challenging brain games.  I thought Candy Crush was just a mindless time wasting fad.  WOW was I wrong!  This challenges you on so many different levels.
B001KZG99A|5.0|This is a great action movie that brings you laughs, sighs, gripping edges of the chair, cheering, .....  It is one that I will add to my movie collection, along with its two sequels. I like Robert Downing's acting. I just wished that they had kept his friend played by the same actor in all three films as well.
B000UJ48WC|2.0|I'm not usually one of those people that tries to compare a movie to the book.  In my opinion, nothing will beat the movie we build in our minds by reading, over somebody else's vision played out in a movie.  However, Stanley Kubrick really missed the mark on this one.  Even Stephen King hated the movie, saying that it was nice to look at but empty, comparing it to a beautiful car with no engine.  The movie drags and drags.  Shelly Duvall was horribly cast and terrible to look at.  Daniel Lloyd was good, but wasn't in with the script to truly understand his character.  The only performance that was worth its weight, was from Jack Nicholson, and even his was a shallow character that was more content making crazy faces than building up a character who loses all connection with reality in a hotel that has supernatural hauntings.<br /><br />Look, if you love this movie, that's okay.  I would suggest, however, that you read the book.  It is a wonderful read and very different from the movie.  Stanley Kubrick clearly had a vision when making the film, it's just a shame it wasn't the same one that King laid out in the book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I would not recommend this book to anyone.  This was a waste of money and I wish that I had not purchased.it.  I did not read it all the way through as I found it very distasteful.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This app has filled hours of my recovery time. I get bored with most apps fast except for this one. I fine it very hard to put down.
B007VYDFMS|4.0|The documentary was really fantastic. I would have liked more from his eleven children, not from only two, though.  And more from his mother.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This is one movie that keeps you guessing &#34;what will happen next?!&#34;  Another one along with its sequel for the movie collection that will be as enjoyable 10, 20 years from now.
B001P829VY|5.0|We love this movie and the quality of the picture was near perfect.  This is the movie that expresses humans as they truly are.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was very good.  It kept my interest and showed what happened with mission to capture Osama.  The things that these young men had to go through was amazing.  It made me appreciate the military and what they are doing in this war.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to finally have this game on my Kindle. My two older children couldn't wait to get this and wouldn't believe me when I told them it was here. Really fun to play n I can't believe the number of levels there are.There is nothing I don't like about this game.So,  to everyone that plays it have a good time with it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is one of the most popular shows around. If you haven't seen it, then you need to, as long as you are of age of course. And of course the Blu Ray / DVD / DC is a major plus. I lend the DVD version to friends, watch the BluRay version my self, and have Digital Copy to watch when out and about on my phone and/or tablet. Will follow and buy this season till the end.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Needed to read a menu in a darkened restaurant. A friend suggested this app and it saved the day. Nice!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So I was waiting for this game to come to kindle fire because I have herd rely good things about it it's rely fun and challenging and I love it it's definitely one of my favorite time fillers
B004QX07G4|2.0|Ellen is a very funny person but I did not like her book.  It did not hold my attention and I found it very hard to get through.  I have not finished it so maybe later in the book it will improve but the beginning does not make me what to finish it.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|The story is one thing, that the author puts you in a gold town of the 1860's with such authenticity another. Without spoiling the yarn, money/ gold still rules and I know most of the players today !<br /><br />Just looked at the tips !<br />I just finished reading The Canterbury Tales and great literature stands the test of time The Luminaries may well make the grade.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This story is so important for everyone who has ever taken their education for granted. It is a reminder of what we have and that the world is larger than we think.
B00138H7YK|5.0|I heard the song 'Spread Your Wings' and I had to get this album.  I love it!<br />Other Favorites are My Melancholy Blues (sounds a bit like 1930's blues),<br />We Will Rock You, Sleeping on the Sidewalk, We Are the Champions, All<br />Dead, All Dead, Sheer Heart Attack, Fight from the Inside (Rock/Punk feel to<br />it), Who needs You, and It's Late.  However I don't like the remix of We Will<br />Rock You.  (It sounds like blending Queen with Run D.M.C.  I love both of<br />them, but not together)  Must listen!
B005I6EU7U|3.0|This fits but is a little small for the Kindle Fire, it sticks out some on both ends using the elastic holders.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I loved this game on facebook. I almost did not buy my kindle, because of not having candy crush on it. So glad now I did. Lots of fun
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great fun whether waiting for an appointment or just for fun. Try it you won't be sorry.No risk since its free.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|She is addicted to this show and this of course was one of her favorite Christmas presents! She loves that series.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|It's awesome. Yes it may be hard to save money and get stars, but it's awesome. You never run out of things to do. There's 47 different cars. 47!!!!!!!!! If you take my advice and buy it you won't regret it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I can't stop playing.  I love the upgrades, graphics, styles of weapons ... everything.  I even like the power meter that forces you to stop playing for a little while.  If it weren't for the power meter then I would play it 24/7
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I would not recommend it for school age children without parental controls. They may purchase items not realizing there is a real charge.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Another great Reacher read.  I was kept guessing for a long time. As always, fast paced and held my attention throughout.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|GREAT FUN READING.  I LOVE BOOKS THAT PROVIDE THE TYPE OF CARACTER YOU GET ATTACHED TO IN A SERIAL MANNER LIKE MITCH RAPP, ALEX CROSS AND JACK REACHER.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it because it's never ending. You can survive and never die. If I could give it more than five stars I would.
B00C7607BC|5.0|It arrived on time packaged and sealed.My Grand daughter was so very excited yelled and screamed with delight.We have watched it many many times.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved the return of Jake.  True to his character, Jake put his heart into his job.  I hope he returns.
B00F8L2VO4|3.0|So far I have not used it to the fullest as yet, but I look forward in doing so very soon
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it! Awesome!  So glad I can play this game on my Kindle now!! Keep up the good work!
B00AESN8XY|1.0|Factory reset my device and lost my purchases from in the game. Very upset. I will not purchase further titles from developer.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I recommend this to everyone!! It's free, fun, and fascinating!! The three F's!!! I love it. I don't like the ads but you get what you pay for<br /> .
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I heard about this game from a friend at work<br />so I thought I would try it.  It is addicting.<br />It took me awhile to catch on, but now I have<br />to play it at least once a day.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|A lot of this book did not make sense to me. Yes, the ending was devastating almost to the point that I would not have read the series to be this disappointed. I loved the first two books. Most of Allegiant was very slow moving, introducing characters and scenes that seem pointless and just fill. There were many things that did not seem to connect with the first two books. Divergent, not divergent but able to do things in the first nook, was very confusing and just left me questioning things. These were the little details that are unclear and leave you questioning things. The ending to me, although I see where Roth was going, seemed pointless. I felt it was mostly for shock value. I would love to see an alternate ending written but I do not see that happening unless book sales drop off and the movie is a bomb. The last quarter was the best and felt like the other two books. The epilogue was beautifully written. I was reading it with tissues. The visual is beautifully done. Good thing the movie does not come out until M arch because it may take me that long to decide to go see it so I don't become invested again. I really wanted to love this but sue me, I wanted so much more. I keep hoping she writes another book and we learn this was a fear simulation.
B005LAIGP0|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Good old fashioned haunted house ghost story, like they don't make many anymore! I've always liked Danial Racliffe, whether he's Harry Potter, or the grown to a man actor he is now. There's a vulnerability to his performances which makes his roles like this very believable.<br /><br />\\"The Woman In Black\\" delivers through in a steady build up of story. Beautiful cinematography which adds to the thick foggy atmosphere of dread & bewilderment. A fine soundtrack that is there for all the right moments, & a impeccable cast of English actors. Here you have a movie that delivers what it promises, fear of the unknown, tickling & prickling the hairs on the back of your neck, just enough to get under the skin.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is my favourite game I like it so much I race up in the morning just to play it
B004P02OJ6|5.0|A moving movie, has to be seen by fans of Russell Crowe and fans of suspense, keep you on the edge of your seat, ending not the way you expected.  I've told too much.<br /><br />I rated this movie 5 stars, because there is a story here that has not been seen on or in any movie before.  Not too much violence, which I like when I see a movie and tell my friends about.  If there is too much violence and swearing, in a movie, I will not recommend it to any one.  I do recommend this movie for movie goers.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|At first it was easy now I am taking like a week to do one level it is crazy I just its hard
B00D6M86RS|5.0|Marvel Pinball seems to be the tablet version of Pinball FX 2, which I have for PC.  Both are awesome.  I just spent a week on vacation and any time I was on my Kindle, I was playing Marvel Pinball.<br /><br />It only comes with one table but that table is a great one - The Avengers, in which there is a different-colored ball for each avenger (plus each ball gives different bonuses).  If you get bored of The Avengers, there are at least 8-10 other tables available for a small fee.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like pinball, and if you would like to play pinball on your tablet...you're not going to do any better than this.  Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally its here!! I have been waiting for this for the kindle for so long!!! and it is totally awesome!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I would highly recommend this book.It was a page turner.Following each women's story and how they interacted with each other was so moving.How each reacted to what was happening made this into a real page turner.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Here is a movie with two great stars in it.  They are both my favorites when it comes to movie going.  I have practically all of Johnny Depp's movies and Angelina Jolie's movies at home.  This was quite a surprise to me, it kept me from leaving the room, which I do occasionally when I'm watching a movie at home, but this one I did not care to put on pause.<br /><br />I gave this movie a five star rating, mainly because it was quite suspenseful.  Jolie was her usual sexy, casual self, Depp kept his  self image here, his role as a tourist was well played.  This movie kept you guessing when are we going to see the mystery man that gangsters and officials are looking for.  If I mentioned that it had a surprise ending, I hope it would lure movie goers to buy and see this movie and enjoy Depp and Jolie together on the screen.

B00E8B1P9M|1.0|If you're considering watching G.I. Joe: Retaliation hear me out first.  I enjoy the brainless action movie genre and liked the first installment, but this is just so bad.<br /><br />It would have been more successful as a parody of mindless action movies, but it's too boring.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|It was alright but expected a better finish to the sequel. Needed more action, and it wasnt as funny to meet the &#34;Hangover&#34; standards. Its more of a $1 rental than $5 one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Free books and great bookas at very fair price.  This is a great app!!  I recommend Kindle app to everyone.
0812550706|5.0|Easy to see why this is considered a classic! Great story about the training of a potential military leader with enough skill to save the earth from an alien invasion. Often told from the viewpoint of a child but not with condescension. Took me back to the first science fiction book I read at age 12 - \\"The Year When Stardust Fell\\" back in the 50's. (Interesting to note that book has been released by Resurrection Press and is actually available on the kindle for 99 cents so had to buy it for nostalgia purposes.) At any rate Ender's Game was able to generate those same feeling of wonder I had many years ago - not an easy task for this long jaded reader. I just got around to reading it in anticipation of the movie release next month. Let's hope they do it proud!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I actually never liked the kid, and thought his mother to be weak, an insipid ninny (even worse in the movie). But like the way his characters develop in this book. Very glad of the MUCH stronger women in this story. This is something I've watched S. King develop over the years. In each successive book, his women become stronger and more real.

B0028DRGDQ|1.0|The scenes are so predictable that I was launghing like crazy instead of being scared.<br /><br />2 hours of my life wasted watching this movie.  For a real good scary movie, check out \\"Let the right one in\\".

B00FEHXCIG|4.0|I enjoyed it. Good action, kept moving, little down time. I have watched all the Ironmans but not the Avengers so the PTSD left a hole in the story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really enjoyed it. Would recommend it to all ages. The theme is universal, being your true self that participates in your life. Not just observes.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|In classic King style, Stephen had me from the first chapter. What happened to Danny is a question I have asked myself throughout the years. This is a great story with twists and turns and surprises I never saw coming.

B00F91G5BS|1.0|All it is being chased by Zombies very little plot brad Pitt ofcourse is handsome but there is hardly any dialogue
B004L3AQLU|5.0|The movie is loosely based on a book by a drug sales rep and the whole Viagra craze.  It blends, humor, romance and drama.  At the core of the movie however is a very good love story between a womanizing sales rep played by Gyllenhaal and an early onset Parkinson's patient, played by Hathaway.  The two have very good chemistry together, which makes the movie.<br /><br />They start out with what seems like the perfect relationship for each other.  Neither wants a romantic entanglement and just want it to be about the sex.  The movie earns an R rating, because you see pretty much everything aside from total full frontal nudity from both actors.  Of course by the end of the movie they both admit to being in love, but the story in between where he comes to grips with her disease (and in a sense so does she) and he goes from trying to cure her to just agreeing to be there for her is where the movie shines.<br /><br />It is part romantic comedy, part raunchy sex comedy, part drama and blends them all well.  For those who get the blu ray, the movie looks and sounds as good as you would expect a non special effects laden movie would.  There are several short behind the scenes and making of segments, some deleted scenes and trailers.  Nothing too extensive, but enough for those who like to go through the extras.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|In times when TV productions lack quality and edge, you will find in Hannibal a brilliant masterpiece. Not only the story is smartly woven, presenting alluring scenarios to keep you invested episode after episode, but also the performances of the two leading actors are so spot on. Mads Mikkelsen is the perfect choice for the title role, with that thick foreign accent, those incisive brown eyes, those handsome features and that effortless elegance, he is Dr. Hannibal Lecter personified. For someone already in love with this character, it was of the utmost importance for me that the actor playing this part had been chosen wisely. Mr. Mikkelsen is so much more than I had humbly expected, he excells in every aspect and delivers beautifully! On the counterpart, Hugh Dancy, as the tormented FBI collaborator Will Graham, is no less brilliant on his own. He shows us the slow meltdown of a man slave of his own imagination, for whom is impossible not to feel sympathy from the very beginning. Bryan Fuller (writer of the series) has created a fantastic place for these characters to evolve bouncing off from one another. Beyond the crime scenes and beautifully staged deaths, it is the impossible friendship between Hannibal and Will what sustains the main plot. Is Hannibal truly interested in Will? Does he consider him as a tangible possible friend? Or is he only toying with him, much as a cat does with a hopeless mouse? How long will take for Will to see the truth? How long can Will withstand and fight his own demons? It does not matter that we already know what happens in the end, the table is presented with such succulent dishes that you could hardly refuse to take a seat. Add to this some solid secondary characters, a fantastic cinematographic photography (nothing to envy from cinema productions) and a purposeful and glorious score, and all you have left to do is to enjoy your meal. (The DVD extras are really good, enhancing the experience with great commentaries and details.)

B00DUE8IXY|5.0|The self-penned \\"Fire Within\\" is 57 minutes of Birdy's engagingly-accented vocals nested with her classically-feathered piano.  Some songs are enhanced with a 2013 \\"Wall of Sound\\"-a sonic boom of backup which somehow never creates turbulence.  With or without the \\"boom\\", the results are heavenly!<br />During Birdy's flight, there are sprinkles of embellishments-a crying cello in \\"Words As Weapons\\", a snappy snare in \\"The Same\\", and ghostly vocals swirling throughout.<br />Fortunately, Birdy never climbs too high-in fact one song flies dangerously close to the ground.  \\"Maybe\\" is a cute pop delight-it would have nestled nicely within seasoned songstress Susanna Hoffs' \\"Someday\\" CD.  (2012)<br />\\"Wings Up!\\" Jasmine van den Bogarde! Can't wait to catch your next flight!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I really enjoy this app so, I asked my mom if I could get the second one and she said no because she wanted me to complete the first one and then we can see where were going to take this. Really good app or game! Buy the app or game!

B00B0LPYXG|2.0|This was a Movie that was very over rated. Washington was at his best but still couldn't pull off a winning performance. The end was a typical Alfred Hitchcock ending by leaving a person wondering what next?

B00284BNKC|5.0|First of all, this movie is not for everyone....and i agree with the other reviewers about this.<br />The movie is shot is such a &#34;realistic&#34; (almost as a REAL reality show), that's impossible not to look away for a moment, during the most climatic moments. Certain scenes DO really ask for a panic attack.<br />And it doesn't matter if you can stomach horror movies like Hostel, SAW, 28 Days Later, Friday The 13th, The Exorcist or even Dr. Hannibal Lecter. This movie has such a BRUTAL force, that has the ability to completely suck you up, without hesitation, from the beginning to the end, leaving you completely mind-drained and exhausted for a few days, after the credits roll......almost like you've gotten out from a long hour crazy acrobatic flight......completely spotless and drowsy.<br />Everything in this movie is REAL: the music, the cinematography, the acting and the deep message it delivers. It's a movie that's best experienced, certainly, when you have many thoughts in your head, about all that could have been, or what should I do for my future.....what's the most &#34;clean&#34; and peaceful way to become what I want to be. It really makes you think about that, and at the same time &#34;wakes&#34; you up from everything you thought it was all fun and games.<br />A movie that certainly needs to be seen at least once.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I have had it for about a month and it has taken a beating with a lot of travel. Feels sturdy. Lightweight. Fast recharges of headset. Easy to operate, put the headset in and it charges. A little hard sometimes to figure out it needs a charge itself.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing Candy Crush for awhile now.  Love it.  So glad to see it finally come to Kindle.  Addictive, fun, frustrating all at the same time.
1603090002|5.0|This series is a fun reworking of classic stories. It is a blast to see<br />how this mash up plays out. The illustration/art work is wonderful--no<br />surprise considering Moore's other work. Buy it and enjoy!
B000FIMG68|1.0|I specifically ordered season TWO, and they sent me season FIVE. All the discs were there and everything was in good condition but really? Now I need to order seasons 2-4 before I can even watch the one I recently oredered. Other than that no complaints!
B006Z00R1Q|1.0|Not what I expected. It did stay suspenseful at times but a lot dull moments. Felt like I was sitting and waiting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks for finally getting this Amazon! Much more fun on the bigger screen! I have been playing it on my phone.
1563898586|5.0|I enjoyed the movie, but Moore's comic was the source for it and is<br />even better. Great characters, good story, wonderful art work, what's<br />not to like?

B002G1YPH0|3.0|The new Haswell series processors from Intel have the voltage regulator module (VRM) on the chip - as a result, CPU temperatures are higher.  This cooler does better than the included Intel heatsink, but it's not special.<br /><br />Worse, the bolts that come with the cooler - while compatible with the 1150 along with the 1155 and 1156 boards, has no plastic or fabric backing or washers to protect the board.  One of them I tightened a tad too much and there is superficial damage to the motherboard.  My system still runs rock solid stable, but it is VERY easy to unwittingly damage the board.<br /><br />For the higher end Haswell-based processors, go water cooling instead.  Especially if you do 3D rendering.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Great horror movie. Better than insidious and all the paranormal activities. If you like horror movies you will like this one.
B00DXP0QV2|2.0|My 2 star rating is for the Super Deluxe release rather then the album itself, as we all know In Utero is a 5 star album.  I've detailed the reasons why:<br /><br />Disc 1 - Original Album & B-Sides<br /><br />1. Serve The Servants (Albini mix/original release)<br />2. Scentless Apprentice (Albini mix/original release)<br />3. Heart-Shaped Box (Litt mix/original release)<br />4. Rape Me (Albini mix/original release)<br />5. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle (Albini mix/original release)<br />6. Dumb (Albini mix/original release)<br />7. Very Ape (Albini mix/original release)<br />8. Milk It (Albini mix/original release)<br />9. Pennyroyal Tea (Albini mix/original release)<br />10. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (Albini mix/original release)<br />11. Tourette's (Albini mix/original release)<br />12. All Apologies (Litt mix/original release)<br />13. Gallons Of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through The Strip (ex-U.S. bonus track)<br /><br />***After listening to the first song or two of the remaster, I thought that something sounded off so I grabbed my original pressing of In Utero and popped it in to compare.  Originally, I had done notes on the individual tracks for the remastered album, but after looking at them realized they all said the same things:  \\"Kurt's vocals lifeless,\\" \\"Kurt's vocals low in the mix,\\" \\"Kurt's vocals overshadowed by bass and drums.\\"  The remaster was done with a lot of attention to the music, and none to Kurt's vocals.  Does the music sound great?  Absolutely.  Unfortunately, Kurt's vocals sound worse on the remaster than they do on the original release, which is unfortunate.<br /><br />14. Marigold (B-side; 'Heart Shaped Box')<br /><br />***Great sounding track!<br /><br />15. Moist Vagina (B-side; 'All Apologies') (2013 Mix)<br />16. Sappy (from 'No Alternative' compilation) (2013 Mix)<br />17. I Hate Myself And Want To Die (from 'The Beavis And Butthead Experience' compilation) (2013 Mix)<br /><br />***Amazingly, they did not even giveus the original B-side tracks for these three songs.  But rather 2013 remixes!  No sign of the originals, sad.<br /><br />18. Pennyroyal Tea (Litt mix)<br />19. Heart-Shaped Box (Albini mix/unreleased)<br />20. All Apologies (Albini mix/unreleased)<br /><br />***Very happy to see these mixes included.  While they've been around for some time, it's nice to see them get an official release in good sound quality.<br /><br />Disc 2 - 2013 Remix + Demo's<br /><br />1. Serve The Servants (2013 mix)<br />2. Scentless Apprentice (2013 mix)<br />3. Heart-Shaped Box (2013 mix)<br />4. Rape Me (2013 mix)<br />5. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle (2013 mix)<br />6. Dumb (2013 mix)<br />7. Very Ape (2013 mix)<br />8. Milk It (2013 mix)<br />9. Pennyroyal Tea (2013 mix)<br />10. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (2013 mix)<br />11. Tourette's (2013 mix)<br />12. All Apologies (2013 mix)<br /><br />***I was extremely confused as to why a \\"remix\\" of the In Utero album was included.  Is this a rap CD?  To be fair, there are some minor differences in the mix that use alternate takes of guitar work, Kurt's vocals, and other instrumentation on some of the songs.  But other than a curious one time listen, it didn't offer anything that would make you want to replace the original In Utero disc for this one.  The fact that Kurt had nothing to do with these \\"remixes,\\" is also a bit off putting.<br /><br />13. Scentless Apprentice (Rio demo)<br />14. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle (Laundry Room demo)<br />15. Dumb (Word Of Mouth demo)<br />16. Very Ape (Rio demo)<br />17. Pennyroyal Tea (Word Of Mouth demo)<br />18. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (Word Of Mouth demo)<br />19. Tourettes (Word Of Mouth demo)<br />20. Marigold (Upland Studios demo)<br />21. All Apologies (Music Source demo)<br /><br />***These Demo's are all great to hear.  Unfortunately, they are ALL instrumentals other than Marigold, and All Apologies.  And frankly, you could call All Apologies an instrumental as well because Kurt's vocals are faintly caught by a distant mic and you can't audibly understand them.<br /><br />22. Forgotten Tune (Rehearsal)<br />23. Jam (Word Of Mouth demo)<br /><br />***Here they are.  The two songs everyone wanted to hear.  Both are instrumentals, and \\"Forgotten Tune,\\" chimes in at about 2 minutes long.  They are both very interesting and anytime I can get some new Nirvana, I'm extremely happy.  They both jam hard.<br /><br />Disc 3 - Live & Loud Show CD<br /><br />1. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter<br />2. Drain You<br />3. Breed<br />4. Serve The Servants<br />5. Rape Me<br />6. Sliver<br />7. Pennyroyal Tea<br />8. Scentless Apprentice<br />9. All Apologies<br />10. Heart-Shaped Box<br />11. Blew<br />12. The Man Who Sold The World<br />13. School<br />14. Come As You Are<br />15. Lithium<br />16. About a Girl<br />17. Endless, Nameless<br /><br />***One of the best Nirvana shows out there, bar none.  Definitely the prize of the set here.  Sadly, the true bass on this show is almost non-existent.  I literally could not feel or hear any bass from my sub-woofer.<br /><br />Disc 4 - Live & Loud DVD + Bonus Video Footage<br /><br />18. Very Ape (Live & Loud Rehearsal)(DVD Extras)<br />19. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (Live & Loud Rehearsal)(DVD Extras)<br />20. Rape Me (Live & Loud Rehearsal)(DVD Extras)<br />21. Pennyroyal Tea (Live & Loud Rehearsal)(DVD Extras)<br />22. Heart-Shaped Box (Original Music Video + Director's Cut)(DVD Extras)<br />23. Rape Me (Live on 'Nulle Part Ailleurs' Paris, France)(DVD Extras)<br />24. Pennyroyal Tea (Live on 'Nulle Part Ailleurs' Paris, France)(DVD Extras)<br />25. Drain You (Live on 'Nulle Part Ailleurs' Paris, France)(DVD Extras)<br />26. Serve The Servants (Live on 'Tunnel' Rome, Italy)(DVD Extras)<br />27. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (Live in Munich, Germany)(DVD Extras)<br />28. My Best Friend's Girl (Live in Munich, Germany)(DVD Extras)<br />29. Drain You (Live in Munich, Germany)(DVD Extras)<br/><br />***The DVD contains the video version of the show on Disc 3, but also includes a number of extras including rehearsals for the show, two versions of the Heart Shaped Box video, and material from shows in Paris, Rome, and Munich.  Extremely interesting material.  However, the entire DVD suffers from lackluster video quality.  All of it has the look a VHS tape.  I saw some people mention that the Live & Loud show was only filmed on video tape, but that wouldn't explain the low video quality on the music videos.  The content of show itself and the bonus content included gets 5 stars.  The quality of the video gets 2 stars.  The audio on the DVD lacks almost all bass.<br /><br />Packaging, Poster & Book<br /><br />The packaging is very cool and mimics the cover of the original In Utero album cover.  The front of the box has a removable magnet, which is the body from the cover.  The size and format of the packaging mimics the Super Deluxe of Nevermind, which I also have.  One thing I liked about this packaging over the Nevermind packaging is that it doesn't take on fingerprints as easily.  I believe they made 25,000 of these sets, which are individually serial numbered.  Mine is #20,556.<br /><br />The poster is double sided.  One side has the band, the other has a symbol from the In Utero artwork.  Standard poster pretty much.<br /><br />The book is beautiful, but thinner than the Nevermind reissue.  Other than the letter that opens up the book, there just isn't much text here.  This is pretty much a picture book.  Most sadly, not a single word is uttered about the \\"2013 remix\\" of the album.  More than enough room to do so, but completely neglected.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Overall, I'm not very happy with the release.  It's clear that there simply was not enough material in terms of demo's, rehearsals, and unreleased tracks to flesh out a full super deluxe edition of In Utero the way they did with Nevermind.<br /><br />And I can already hear my fellowNirvana fans wanting to scream \\"what do you want them to do?  They only have so much material?!\\"  True.  But the last thing I expect is them to do is manufacture a remix of the album in order to fill out a boxed set.  Additionally, if the boxed set has less material than a previous boxed set, shouldn't it be more affordable?<br /><br />I thought of two solutions that would have worked well for this release.  One would have been to scrap the 2013 remix idea and include a second relevant live show on audio CD, and throw it on the DVD with Live & Loud.  Then we would have at least received new material.  The second would have been to cut the 2013 mix and leave the set at two CD's and one DVD, and cut the price dramatically.  We got 4 audio CD's and 1 DVD of great material on the Nevermind Super Deluxe and on In Utero, we got 3 audio CD's, one of which is simply a 2013 \\"remix\\" and one DVD.  Half the material for more money really.<br /><br />Some may not realize that disc 3 of the With The Lights Out boxed set contains 14 tracks, an entire disc worth, of material from the In Utero demo's, rehearsals, and sessions.  In order to have a truly complete super deluxe, one needs this disc.  I have it and it does have some excellent material.  Bad planning and catalog management left them scraping the bottom of the barrel and manufacturing remixes for material because they used the In Utero gems on the previous boxed set.<br /><br />The major con's with this release are as follows...<br /><br />1)  Kurt's vocals in the remaster were completely neglected and sound worse than the original album pressing. (Glad I kept mine)<br />2)  The 2013 remix is something that was used purely for filler and while mildly interesting, wasn't something Kurt was involved with mixing and doesn't hold much repeat listening value.  Additionally, the complete lack of ANY explanation or breakdown of this 2013 \\"remix,\\" in the book where there was more than enough space to do so is inexcusable.  All that is listed is a credit saying Albini did the mix in a few days in a studio in Chicago.<br />3)  The video quality of the DVD is of VHS quality and definitely leaves something to be desired.  The audio quality of the DVD & CD of the show lacks bass.<br />4)  Of the 8 unreleased demo's and 2 unreleased songs, 9 are simply instrumentals, and the one that isn't is Dave Grohl singing on Marigold.  No new vocal work from Kurt.<br />5)  Only half as much material as that included on the Nevermind Super Deluxe set, yet more expensive.<br /><br />For the EXTREME Nirvana fan, I'd say grab this set if you can get it for no more than $50-$75 including taxes and shipping, and make sure you keep your original In Utero CD for the better sounding mix on Kurt's vocals.  Also make sure you have the With The Lights Out boxed set so that you can supplement this set with disc 3.<br /><br />Additionally, you can get discs 1, 2 and 4 of the super deluxe set sold separately for about $40.  If having the audio CD of the Live And Loud show and the book isn't that important to you, save your cash and go with the individual discs.<br /><br />Chris Elliott

B008JFUO4U|4.0|\\"Oblivion\\" offers a post-apocalyptic future far more devastating and terrifying than the zombie apocalypse:  thousands of Tom Cruise clones have over-run the earth.<br /><br />Tom Cruise will be a forever mediocre actor, whose shortness of theatrical range and physical height limit every movie he's in.  But what's undeniable is that \\"Oblivion\\" is a clever -- if totally preposterous -- story that is helmed by an inexperienced but excellent director.

B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell has an ability to extract great truths from people, professions, activities that we think we understand...but really don't.  He never accepts the obvious answer but probes until the truth emerges.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Great DVD and Blu-ray collection. Sound and video are outstanding. Glad I bought it. Has nice features also at the start menu.
B00ECK21WO|5.0|First we had the stunning multi-disc \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" release. It was followed by the even more comprehensive \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" massive box ; and now we have the UNBELIEVABLE \\"Road To Red\\".<br />Having only received this last week , I have only made it through the contents one time. I can tell you , I am so impressed and enthralled that I will listen 5 times completely through before listening to a single note of any other release.(This has just been made increasingly difficult with the heartbreaking news of Lou Reed's passing)<br />IT IS THAT GREAT ! To hear the path that led King Crimson to the masterpiece that is \\"Red\\" is nothing less than spectacular. What they are able to do with aged recordings these days is nothing short of amazing.This consists of one unofficial audience recording ; ten soundboard mixes ; and five professional recordings from a mobile outside the venues.<br />Find a way to get this box ; immerse yourself in the magic that is King Crimson , and wonder what might be on the horizon .
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Movie a little slow at times.  The acting is tipical Leonardo Dicaprio.  It's enternaning and excellent drama!  Like I said, slow at times, but entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An interesting view of one of possible futures. The human spirit is pictured nicely. I enjoyed reading it. Beautiful tale.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Truly one of the best books I have ever read.  You won't forget the characters.  Brilliant writing and a mesmerizing tale.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|So much of my memory of history had faded, having the facts behind-the-scenes brings all of the background information back. In the current political environment, some background is comforting. No matter how grid locked we appear, it has been worse. We hold within ourselves the capacity to change.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was a recommendation from a friend.  It isn't what i would call a page turner, but a pleasant reading experience.  The story is good, the characters are interesting and i only wish there actually was a night circus somewhere.  The story is what i would call enchanting.
B005LZYL3G|5.0|I have now watched this documentary 10 + times and never get tired of it, or bored. Truly complete, from inception to present day, such a fascinating, funny, sad, interesting, entertaining, heartfelt look at such an amazing band. Even if you are just a casual fan of PJ there is something here for everyone. Loved the band interviews, and with friends like Chris Cornell. Everyone should see it & own it! 10 STARS!
B00DL47PHI|5.0|I believe this is one of the most powerful documentary I've seen. It's a must see. I loved it very much even though it brought me to tears all through the show. I have to say I will never visit Sea World and any other park that has Killer Whales. I hope they are sinking in their shame as this documentary airs and people are responding to it. If people knew what these poor mammals are put through I don't think anyone with a heart would pay money to see them do tricks. I'd pay to have them set free thats about it. Greed thats all its for.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|Ok, so I got the book the day it came out, pre-ordered it and everything! Waiting months for it, the whole thing! Half way reading it, I just didn't get it. I was not feeling the story, almost bored with the same thing over and over again, plus really? This whole fight/story is about genes??? I just didn't get it, so I got online to get the feel of others, cause I was thinking maybe I'm missing something, maybe in the end I'll get it and then I start getting it....something about someone dying and the ending sucking! So I stop because I'm not one to get told and ruin the ending, plus I like to make my own opinions on things. So I finish the book, even cried but why? Why? Did she do that! It just makes no sense to me! Her death was so pointless! Yes she helped change the world but did she have to die! I mean they all lost their memories and don't even remember her sacrifice! She's not even remembered at all! So pointless! Now you leave Tobias alone? And that another thing, when did Tobias become such a emotional woman! Omg, that was horrible!<br />So all in all, the whole thing was a disappointment!<br />Really bad timing too with the movie coming out, I doubt they'll be an Insurgent film..cause you know once ppl find out she kills Tris off, then what's the point of becoming invested? Bad, REAL bad Roth!
B004JN1D2I|2.0|Buy these great eBooks individually. In the combined package the &#34;how many minutes left in chapter&#34; feature of your Kindle does not work. Each book is treated as a chapter. So instead of your Kindle saying &#34;3 minutes left in chapter&#34; it will say &#34;19 hrs. 30 min. left in chapter.&#34;
B00EM60G34|5.0|I'm not saying Bruce sucks. He is outstanding but this is one of the rawest Iron Maiden albums ever. This showcased their talent in music and is absolutely fantastic! This is when metal was metal.
B003VS0CX8|4.0|I bought it half-heartedly since some people had had bad experiences due to the fact that this BR has been created with latest standards.<br />It sure did not play from my laptop and downloading the latest updates to my WinDVD BR player was impossible (I will have  to buy the latest version!) and doing so for the open source VLC software was a big pain and it didn't work.<br />So I bought a new Samsung BR player.  Fortunately this one was able to download the latest updates to the player software by itself. That was the one time initial pain & delay.<br />After that it was pleasant experience all the way.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the best purchase I've made in a long time. It blows away the Sony blueray player I've been using for a number of years. Always thought it had problems and apparently it did. The picture quality is excellent and I believe the sound is way better. Set up is very simple. Running it on Galaxy s3 and through my Onkyo AV receiver. Have run a bunch of You Tube and Netflix movies this weekend and no problems.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Not much to see here.  The plot is very predictable.  The action sequences are poorly done.  Not a very good movie.

B003O86FMW|2.0|Story line very much replicated the first book. Seemed like the writer knew all along she wanted a three book series, and struggled with the story line in this second book to get to a third one.

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Never disappoints. Full of plot twists and cliffhangers, great writing and believable characters, this show is the best take on a post-apocalyptic zombie world.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of MIB. Don't get me wrong, the movies were quite interesting but nothing new. MIB was quite entertaining and a surprise to say the least. I thought it had a few elements in the movie. Lots of movies of late have been 1dimensional. Action movies tend to be ONLY about action. Love movies, ONLY about love. Movies that combine different elements or show something different are sure to be top sellers.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Bob/s voice is lovely on some of the early stuff--I remember being very taken  w/his music.<br />His voice has aged right along w/him these last few yrs.  But he still is able to capture the mood<br />of his pieces.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a great read. The story line was exciting basically thorough the entire book. I highly recommend reading it.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|fun game and hard to put down. is a lootfest almost as good as diablo. the 2 currency system is a little annoying but not a reason to miss this game.
B00843TZJ2|5.0|This combo set was great in that you not only get to hear the trio, but you get to see them put down vocal harmonies that are truly special. I'd recommend this to any CSN fan.
B0017VG69U|5.0|I have been wanting to finish collecting this series for a long time and this put me one step closer. The package arrived as scheduled the only thing that was wrong was one of the CD holder pages was shattered. Other than that all disks were in excellent shape and worked perfectly.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love this movie, total nonsense.  Absolutely impossible of course, who cares?  The cast is outstanding  Freeman, Mirren are totally perfect.  Willis is just exactly what he should be in this almost parody of his Die Hard stuff, totally great, AND Malkovich is absolutely completely and just plain Wow in his role.  He steals the movie completely, nobody better.  The movie is a total romp, just plain fun.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I'm in the middle of the third book right now, and so far it has been very gripping. Well written and the book moves along at a good pace. You really feel for all the characters, what you feel though, well that depends on the character! I can't put these books down, and I know I'm missing all sorts of details on this first read through, I'm sure this series will benefit from a second one.<br /><br />One Warning, if you're a person who waits to start a series until it's done, you are going to have a long wait. There is a 5th book that is out, but there are supposed to be two more after it, and George R.R. Martin does not write quickly. I know I'll be longing for the last couple books well after I've finished, and re-read these four, and the fifth.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I never realized how many great songs Kelly did until I heard this. Is she country? Is she pop? You make up your own mind, she's just great whatever genre she is.

B004BSFC46|2.0|I'm really not quite sure what the intended use of these are. They looked cute and I wanted my infant to be entertained with these, but it just didn't work out. My son barely noticed they were on his wrists. When he got a little older I tried these again, at about 6 months, when he did notice them, he quickly forgot about them and went about his business. They never fit his ankles at any point, these are pretty small. They are quite snug on his wrists. Now at eleven months, he tosses them around for a minute and moves on : ).
B006LG7O38|5.0|Perfect blend of horror and comedy. Great Halloween movie that scares you in one scene and has you laughing out loud in the next. Can't believe this is a remake... Go check out the trailer for the 1985 original.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have used almost all of the E-readers but I think Kindle is the best.  Easy to use but powerful.  And I like being able to have all my devices synced to the same page easily.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that Kindle was finally able to get Candy Crush to work. I have enjoyed the game on the computer. It works best if you use it with facebook. Game plays very well on the Kindle.<br />I am hoping that the other facebook games will be able to play on the Kindle now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just started playing. I can't put it down until I lose all my lives and can't continue for twenty minutes.

B00F880BWG|5.0|Not much to say. It's a little confusing but I guess that is part of the plan. I wish they'd get rid of the cars that look like they are fresh off the production line.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|One of the rare science fiction novels that offers amazing prose to go along with its amazing ideas. You'll never take a rainy day for granted again.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|No micro transactions in game, no eye bleed ads, just a great game in an even better package. The gfx fit the feel and scope of the game perfectly, and the entire experience lets everything port into an expansion easily, which Im really looking forward to.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This is a fairly straight forward game that really pulls you in.  The first levels are difficult enough to keep you interested, but not so easy to bore you.  Fun!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|It is clever, funny, with superior acting and lots of action.  There is nothing more to say, and it is foolish to require more.
B004GYY714|5.0|It was great to download and start steaming music stations. Very easy to use, quick to download. Great app! And it's free!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome though pocket edition isn't the best version its still cool I<br />like to distract creepers to make them explode near other monsters to kill them instead of me.
B003L77G8I|3.0|I was very unhappy once I finally opened this up and put it in. This is the only season I have that will not play on any player that I have. But unfortunately, I did not open the package until just recently, so I figured it was too late to complain. I do not know what the problem is. But it does not play. Tried several discs and several players.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|First off, while I haven't reviewed them on this site, I've read each of the other books in this series several times over. I adored both of the novels and each of the Four-centric shorts we've had. Allegiant, however, left me feeling a little flat. I'm not somebody that needs a happy ending to enjoy a book. Some of my very favorite novels end with a tragedy, and I honestly feel that, if done well, it usually makes a story better than a pat, happy ending. In this case, though, I think it was to the book's detriment. There were both good and bad parts, and I purposely let this review stew for 24 hours so I could make sure my opinion didn't change as I thought it over. Unfortunately, like most of the reviewers so far, I thought there was more bad than good, but I couldn't bring myself to give it only 1 star when I loved the rest of the series so much.<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br /><br />First, the good.<br /><br />- It started off very well. I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning sections of the book.<br /><br />- I liked the Tris/Caleb arc (at least, until the ending). There was one scene in particular that touched me.<br /><br />- I enjoyed learning more about Tris's parents. Natalie is probably my favorite character at this point.<br /><br />- There was a lovely moment between Tris and her mother.<br /><br />- I liked that the relationship between Tris and Four was realistic. They argued, they forgave each other, neither of them was perfectly right or perfectly wrong, etc. I don't think there's enough of that in YA literature, and it was really good to see Four telling Tris off for the way she was acting. She deserved it, and it was nice that the author didn't try to pretend that the way she was treating him was okay.<br /><br />- It was good to see Peter, one of my favorite characters in the series, attempt to somewhat take responsibility for his actions and do something to change, even if it didn't work.<br /><br />- I appreciated the setting of the epilogue. It wassatisfying to see Four finally facing his fears and jumping off the Hancock Building, and if they had to dump Tris's ashes anywhere, that was probably the best place to do it. He really did face his four fears in much more profound ways than by simply revisiting his fear landscape over and over again, but it's hard to love that growth he showed when he still ended up shattered and alone.<br /><br />- There were some interesting ideas about love, forgiveness and sacrifice presented, and I love when a book makes you think a little as well as entertains you.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that was pretty much all of the good. Now for the bad.<br /><br />- The pacing was off, and the flow of the narrative was choppy. I was surprised, because it was a little jarring, compared to the other books.<br /><br />- Characterizations were all over the place. So many of the actions they took in this one didn't feel true to their established characters at all.<br /><br />- As has been mentioned by a ton of other reviewers, Four and Tris have the exact same inner monologue voice. They're indistinguishable from one another.<br /><br />- The new characters introduced in this book were pretty unlikable, even the ones we were supposed to care about. And Caleb was even more despicable in this book than he was in the last one, which is really saying something.<br /><br />- The book was far, far too reliant on the different serums. There should have been much more to the story than just that. Beyond that, a great deal was made of Tris's immunity to them. She even inoculated herself against the death serum, something that nobody in the world had been able to do up until that point. And yet, it was never explained how that was even possible. Why was she was able to do that when nobody else could? What made her special or unique? That answer is never given.<br /><br />- There were several threads that were started and then immediately dropped, going absolutely nowhere. The editor of this seriesand I have a mutual friend, so I happen to know that she (the editor) was going through a career transition during the final editing process of this book, but I'm really surprised that the book was released in this state, with all of these problems everyone is pointing out. I'd be interested to talk with her and find out why she gave so many of these ideas the green light when they're executed so badly.<br /><br />- There was far too much of the wrong kind of exposition and very little action. Because of this, there wasn't any tension in the story. It felt like 2/3 of the book was filled with one long-winded explanation after another, and yet, somehow, we still didn't get the full backstory.<br /><br />- We didn't get the full backstory! The explanation for the Chicago/Faction experiments that the characters (and readers) were given was proven to be full of holes, lies and half-truths, and yet, it was the only one they ever got. In all of that exposition given, Ms. Roth never bothered to explain the real story, or even why the lies were told in the first place. It was explained away with a character musing that \\"these kinds of things always have more than one reason behind them.\\" That's not an answer. If the author couldn't even come up with a plausible explanation for how things got to the point that it did, how are we even supposed to take her world seriously?<br /><br />- The two earlier books made a great deal out of Divergence and how unique and special it was. In this book, we learn that Divergence really just means that you're completely normal. That was a total, complete letdown.<br /><br />- Peter's ending actually supported David and the government's point of view. He took the memory serum, wiped himself clean, and in the epilogue, it says that most of his old behaviors returned. If it wasn't his experiences or the way he was raised, if it was just who he was always meant to be, then they were right: his genetics caused his bad behavior. That one sentenceright at the end negated the entire premise of the book.<br /><br />- The main characters, our \\"heroes,\\" did a horrible, horrible thing in order to win, and they brushed it aside like it was nothing. Most of the book was spent moralizing against using the memory serum to wipe people's memories without their consent, essentially erasing them from existence. When they found out that the Bureau was going to use the memory serum on the innocent citizens of Chicago, what was their solution? To use the memory serum on not only the bad guys working at the Bureau, but all of the innocent people working there as well. Four was the only one to object at all, and when he pointed out the hypocrisy of their plan, that doing it made them no better than the people they were trying to stop, his concerns were brushed aside with, \\"We don't have time to come up with something else, and hey, better them than us!\\" That was their rationalization. Better them than us. Think about it for a minute. Let's say that one country's government decided to blow another country off the map. The second country found out a day in advance, and decided that instead of trying to fend off the attack or negotiate or something, they would launch an immediate pre-emptive strike, and destroy the first country and all of its innocent citizens instead. Or, to use a real life example, look at the Germans during WWII. Many of them knew about the Nazi concentration camps and what was going on there, and that was their exact reaction: \\"It's horrible, but it's better than it happens to them than to us.\\" Looking back on it now, they're seen as cowardly or callous monsters. How is that okay? That moral relativism really bothered me. Like, a lot. I can't ever look at the characters the same way again, because it really damaged my view of them. Something that terrible is not okay just because it's the only idea you can come up with. Four was right: in the end, they were no better than the bad guys. How are you supposedto root for characters like that? The author either should have come up with another plan, or shouldn't have spent the entire book talking about how horrible it was to do something like that, right up until having her main characters do it. The fact that we like those characters doesn't make their behavior acceptable. In fact, it makes it worse.<br /><br />- Tobias ends up alone and broken, a shell of the person he once was. Yes, he faced his fears once and for all, but as I said, it's hard to care when he's left struggling just to exist.<br /><br />- The death. As I said, I'm fine with deaths in literature, if they serve a point. This one didn't. Yes, it did bring up some interesting points about love and sacrifice, but those exact same arguments could have been presented by another character's death. Uriah, if Roth was going to kill him anyway, or Caleb or Christina. Instead, Tris sacrifices herself again. Yeah, it's true to her character and it makes sense that she'd do it, but if the author was going to inoculate the character against the death serum, then why shoot her afterward? That was just pointless. She already made her sacrifice when she took Caleb's place, so there was no reason to kill her afterward - especially when it didn't change anything at all. There were still GD rebels waiting to attack. Outside of Chicago, the world was still exactly the same. Tris'd entire death, the sacrifice she made, it was all meaningless. I was left feeling flat and disappointed, just like so many other readers. I honestly feel cheated by it, which surprises me. The hope was completely gone. If Tris's death served a purpose, or if Four died with her or something, I could maybe find a way to be okay with it. But this? No. It was just wrong. It didn't add to the story, it detracted from it.<br /><br />So, all in all, this was a disappointing end to a great series. There were far too many things that needed to be changed for the story to go out on a high note. It was like the massive letdown of reading Mockingjay or Breaking Dawn all over again. It could have been amazing. The author is certainly capable of it. What a shame.

0385351399|2.0|Caution: SPOILERS. I was bored in the beginning, especially with description of the campus. Then, Mae meets Kalden. I'm interested in who he is, and learning about the implications of the Circle. I think to myself: this is going to be a great thriller. They're going to expose this company for what it is! Then we spend the rest of the book bogged down in new Circle programs and discover our main character has no critical thinking skills. Every time there's a red flag, she doesn't seem to care. Every time she is confronted with something that gives rise to feelings, she throws herself into her work, which we have to read pages of boring details on. I don't care about the customers! She stops caring about her father altogether and even gets back together with that creep Francis. Then, an old boyfriend dies and again, no questions from her. She's so one-dimensional it makes you sick. You think, I'll stick with this and it will get better. Nope. Wrong! What a disappointing read. P.S. NO ONE wants to watch the view inside the bathroom stall! What the hell?
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Show kept me absorbed. I achieved adequate video saturation level. I am usually just out for plain old entertainment. Sick of preachy movies whether its planet warming or all about how bad those other people are or something. This movie was OK.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read all 3 in less than a week.  Loved it.  Knew from book 1 he had a good side.  This is a love story. Not just about domiance between a man and woman.  Or some ones messed up life.
B00F35B8F8|2.0|How can you possibility sit thru this movie and be awed by the rehashing of an actual Original movie.  Adding extra CGI affects, switching characters lines, and yes; adding women in underwear, in no way makes this an original. If this is an alternate timeline, then the storylines should reflect that. What next will Pike's clone be unveiled, but have a debilitating accident and end up in a wheeled box with blinking lights.  Wait...maybe a superbeing will enter into the storyline and they can call him \\"R\\". If your going to use  plagiarism to write \\"original\\" screenplays, might as well keep it in the family.<br />I gave them two stars only because of the CGI affects. They were great...Also because Karl Urban is wonderful as McCoy.

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|My wife got a DVD of this for a birthday present so we watched it.<br /><br />I was always pretty happy with the ST TV series and most of the movies that followed the original timeline (with an occasional lemon) and so when the first movie in the new time line came out I was unconvinced. I watched the first one in the new time line, and while it bothered me that some that they corrupted the time line, I still liked it.<br /><br />This is more of the same. Take a few familiar characters from the original ST along with some plot devices, add great special effects and you end up with a pretty good movie.<br /><br />This one has several plot elements stolen from several of the TV shows, and several of the movies. I think they manage to blend the familiar elements with some new material so while there are some fond memories of the original brought to the fore, it is not offensive. At least it was not to me.<br /><br />There are no great truths to be found. I wish they would go back to \\"where no man has gone before\\" instead of the PC \\"where no one has gone before\\". The rest of the show does not exhibit an offensive level of PCness, so why they chose to insert this just annoys me. But this is a minor annoyance. The rest of it is fun. Sit back and enjoy. It might even be better on the big screen at your local theater.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|::SPOILER ALERT::<br /><br />The series is great but the last book. It was well written but the characters were out of character, plot holes, pointless deaths, explanations that didn't really explain anything, a background story that made no sense and couldn't happen.<br /><br />This story is a try and fail on tragedy, yes it was supposed to be beautiful end with a meaning of sacrifice but it was like I said a pointless death, a great sacrifice can be done without a death, and still get the same message through. In many ways she didn't have to die, Veronica only wanted to kill her off to have a &#34;great poetic death.&#34; of the character, and killed two other people to just kill them off. killing off a character to get tears out of her fans isn't good story telling, and I get it she wanted to have some realism in the story but there are many things that won't happen if the situation was real.<br /><br />They could have stopped the &#34;bad guys.&#34; in many ways, I feel as a reader that Veronica picked the laziest end she could have for she story.<br /><br />All in all, the book is okay, but doesn't fulfill what it build up too, and killed the most important character in the most insulting way. Veronica had one job as a writer, and that was to tell a story that, answered every question, but to also fulfill every expectation that the readers expect from her. What veronica did was give a middle finger to her readers.<br /><br />I feel she could do a mini book that can give an alternate ending that many save the franchise. but until then, I'm sorry to say this to old V. but I give this one and a half starts.<br /><br />Thank you for listening to my rent

B000UZQI0Q|4.0|This book still has the same great magic and lore as the first.  Great plot lines and character development.  Looking forward to the third book.<br /><br />My main problem with this book is the way Mr Sanderson brings up events from the first book. It seems as though a significant portion of the dialogue, especially in the first half, is elementary reflection on past events.  Bringing up the faculties of Mistborn or Allomancy, Keilser's history, etc.  I found those parts redundant and frankly boring.<br /><br />All in all, satisfying read. I'm no writer myself and appreciate Mr Sanderson's skills.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|best game ever. should me gotten by everyone. been waiting for this game four ev-er. 5 stars excellency. everybody loves this awesome game.

B008NEVPCC|5.0|This is a fantastic first album from the extremely talented Cher Lloyd, it has become my favourite album to date, i can't wait for her to release a 2nd album. The songs are very easy to get to know and sing along to. Before I listened to it I thought I would have a favourite song from the album but still can't decide as I love each and every song.<br /><br />It would be nice if the album had a few more songs on it, although the American limited edition version has 12 songs on it, with 3 songs - 'Oath', 'Behind the Music' and 'Talkin' That' which do not feature on the British version of the album - which features 'Dub on the Track' which doesn't feature on the standard US Version.<br /><br />The 'American download only edition' features 11 songs with 'Riot' on it.<br /><br />So if 'Dub on the Track' and 'Riot' had also featured on this limited edition version it would have made a longer album with 14 songs on it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009L5TJOI Cher Lloyd LIMITED EDITION Includes]]<br /><br />I prefer the artwork on the american version of the album to the British one.<br /><br />A truely AMAZING ALBUM, and very enjoyable to listen to!!! Well done Cher Lloyd xxx

B004PYDBEO|5.0|Long-term success as an investor or trader in securities markets requires first of all that you survive all the short terms along the way.  As the gamblers say, “In the long run there’s no luck in poker.  But the short run lasts longer than you think.”  Plus, wherever you are in your long run and however you did in the short run just completed, you’re always in the middle of another short run, and just beginning still another short run.  So stay wary, or kiss your hopes goodbye.<br /><br />As Mandelbrot has been arguing for decades, we can’t base decisions on Modern Portfolio Theory without risking everything we hope to accomplish.  This book gives us an overview of his research; it can be as accessible, or as technically engaging, as the reader wants to make it.  If you want to find out how to calculate four-variable curves such as the Cauchy or Paretto curves, or if you want to spend some leisurely hours on power laws and fractals, dig right in.  If you just want a clear sense of where Mandelbrot’s studies have taken him, and are willing to push yourself only a little, you’ll find plenty here to clarify the issues for everyday traders and investors.<br /><br />The essential difficulty lies in the bell curve of standard statistics; research going back to the 1950’s has found significant correlation between stock prices measured at calendar-year intervals and the usual Gaussian distributions.  Here’s the issue:  If stock prices (like Brownian particles) conformed to “normal” distributions, they would do so duratively, in proportion to the square root of elapsed time.  Stock returns having an annual real standard deviation (σ) of 18%, the square roots of 240 (trading days per year), 52 (weeks) and 12 (months) being respectively 15.5, 7.1, and 3.46, the daily, weekly, and monthly values of σ should be close to 1.16%, 2.5%, and 5.2%.  These values work to a point; at least two-thirds of the time stock market variations do fall within these ranges.  But extreme price moves are far too common and far too severe.  That’s where the history of markets (mis)behaving becomes just as important as the math, and Mandelbrot has worked historically as well as mathematically.<br /><br />As he figures it, a 3σ one-day move (+/-3.5%) should occur about 60 times in eighty-some years, but for 1917-2003 his historical number is 1,001.  By my own observation September of 2008 almost gave us four such moves in a week, and by November the volatility of two months earlier seemed positively serene.  We expect a 6σ day once in 2,000,000 years; Mandelbrot counts 48 instances in the twentieth century, and in October 2008 alone we added four more.  In fact, in thirteen trading days from October 9 through 28 the DJIA made one-day moves of 3σ (once), 4σ (three times), 6σ (once), and 9σ (twice)—and note that a 9σ day should occur once every 17.7 trillion years.  Indisputably the random-walk bell curve is simply risible for short time-periods.  Theory must at least reflect historical fact (to be in any sense scientific it must also have predictive value for future outcomes).  Mathematical results so egregious show that the model from which we are calculating is preposterous.  Depending on selection criteria the short-run probability curves for various stock portfolios will be somewhere between a bell curve and a Cauchy curve (with a higher center and much fatter tails); this also accords with Mandelbrot’s research on cotton prices.  And M. Mauboussin’s More Than You Know (revised ed.  Columbia University, 2008), on pp. 206f, gives precisely such a graph of the S&P 500’s daily moves from1978 through 2007.<br /><br />Yet, as P. Bernstein’s Capital Ideas (John Wiley, 2005) says, “Mandelbrot remains on the periphery of financial theory . . because of the inconvenience to analysts . . ” (my emphasis).  What?!  I haven’t taken a math course since high school fifty year ago; I can’t calculate Mandelbrot’s “L-stable” curves (see his note on p. 296) or fractals.  And this book contains a few mathematical slips of its own (p. 10: not 98% but 99.7% of instances should be within 3σ), presumably due to his co-author being something less of a mathematician than Mandelbrot himself.  But I’m willing to do some work to follow the conversation; apparently I want to win more than the mathematicians who ran Long-Term Capital Management did.  If you find it “inconvenient” to trudge through some of the simpler processes you probably should just buy an index fund and let it be.  Otherwise, read this book, patiently and critically.  I hear that after the recent Colorado floods if you want to get from Estes Park to Loveland you better not try the Big Thompson canyon road—it’s a wreck.  Stay away from Bell Curve Boulevard, too; find your own way.  It takes longer, but this book will help keep you moving.  Don’t hit the road without it.

B006ANJ4BW|3.0|Honestly... I feel let down... Conan was never this annoying or \\"too cool\\", Conan was just naturally awesome without even trying. This bratty child who grew up an annoying adult just didn't cut it. I liked the gore, the pretty girl but everything else was just a blur to me. It could have been much better but this is the reason I don't go to the movies anymore. I hope they either just let Conan die and stay untouched from the 80s (while we forget this one ever existed) or if they somehow do another remake, that they do a better job.<br /><br />What could have been better?<br /><br />The story - Just too cheesy<br />The acting - Card board box acting<br />The characters - Replace the hero, he was not the right fit for Conan

B009WUAK2M|3.0|There was some funny parts, like the whale comment! Loved that!<br /><br />It had some nice action scenes but even though there is a \\"power house\\" of characters, including new ones, they are \\"too strong\\" in the sense that they don't die. Sure one individual was killed but really...? I am missing the expendable portion of the title. I'm a guy, so of course i'm going to enjoy this movie! Lots of cool action and stuff exploding, but the story is as cheesy as it gets, it's like watching the fast & the furious but without the cars! or better yet it's like all the cars were combined to make a giant ship that flies (aka their plane)

B00BEIYMAG|3.0|I waited a long time for this one.  I just missed it in the movies and waited about 2 months for it to come out on DVD. So there I was Saturday night, dimmed lights, big screen TV,  popcorn and soda by my side.  I even silenced my phone to give it that authentic movie theatre experience. Ready, set, action. The movie opens strong with Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators lecturing at a college.  We're introduced to a video of a former case involving a doll that was  truly freaky.<br /><br />We like the Warrens, they're open, seemingly legit and not without humor.  Next we are introduced by way of an early 70's song, Time of the Season, a Zombies classic as we watch this nice family with 5 daughters of assorted ages move into an isolated, large old house.  Sadie, the dog refuses to enter which should be a clue that something's not right.  It doesn't take long before action occurs, the usual things that go bump in the night.  Did I see that?  Did I feel that?  Was it just my imagination?  Of course, it doesn't take long for the entire family to come to the conclusion that there's something up.  Enough people have commented about the plot so I won't bore you with my further plot synopsis.  Let me just say, this is no classic.  Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining enough but there was nothing particularly original here.  Maybe if I didn't see so many rave reviews from fans and critics, my expectations wouldn't have been so high.  To compare this to The Exorcist or state The Conjuring is this decade's best horror film is just misleading.  In my opinion, this is just average. Don't set your expectations too high.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|good game to pass the time. I can see why so many people play this game. I will recommend it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a cute game for Halloween. The cartoon vampire theme is perfect for the season, should be entertaining for adults and older kids. However, the goal of the game is for the vampire to reach a sleeping young lady at the end of each level. Her heaving bosom ceases to heave as he bites her neck. Parents will have to decide if this is appropriate for their children,  but the animation, which varies slightly from level to level, will amuse the grownups.<br />The game play itself is a combination of Angry Birds style slingshot aiming and a maze game, as you fly your vampire bat through a spooky setting to set up the next shot to take out obstacles to the vampire's progress towards the unsuspecting damsel's canopy bed. The obstacles include lanterns that emit &quot;holy light,&quot; skeletons with lanterns, and jealous bats, and your weapons include rocks and bombs. These are not always effective against the obstacles, and sometimes you have to use them to manipulate the setting to your advantage, like shining a lantern on a bat, or dropping an anvil on a skeleton. At least in the early levels, the game is fairly generous with hints and targets that show you where to aim for the greatest benefit, and there is a system for trading points earned in the game for solutions to difficult levels.<br />After playing a few levels, I've encountered no bugs, ads, or in app purchasing. The &quot;shopping&quot; area of the game seems to be only for spending points earned within the game.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|This might kind of be a rant.<br /><br />What. The. Hell?<br />That was my thought when I put the book down after reading the last page. I respect an author's choices on where the lives of the characters will lead (really, I do) but this just made me angry.<br />I will try my best to make an unbiased review.<br />I loved the first two books; they were fleshed out and well done. I really enjoyed them. This book, however, felt like it was written only because she needed a book to finish up the series. As the story went along, the writing began to deteriorate till the end (but I was too depressed to even care, by that point), and  though the switching of point of views was clever, the personalities were so similar that it was hard to differentiate who's point of view I was in at the time.<br />The only thing that kept me going, was the promise of a spectacular ending (I mean, that was our cookie after trudging through page after depressing page of this book, right?).<br />Obviously, I was disappointed.<br />If you must read this, I advise you to remain detached from the characters and the story in general so you're not confused and depressed at the end like I was.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|*MY THOUGHTS*<br /><br />  Divergent gave me all the feels. I cried, laughed, and got so angry at some parts I was yelling at the book. Insurgent had me on edge and I knew that their city was on the brink of war and I was strangelt so excited for it. So, naturally, I expected Allegiant to be all about the war and how it would change Tris and Four's life.... Did I get what I expected? Well..... No.<br />\\"Who are you? I demand. 'We are the Allegiant,' the voice replies. 'And we are many, and none.\\"<br />11% (Nook Book)<br />  I say \\"no\\" because there were so many things I had problems with. For instance, the characters. I'll start with Four.... When I met him in Divergent, he was a knife throwing, gun wielding, bad ass. He didn't take any shit because he had taken it most of his life already. But in Allegiant, he definitely hanged my entire attitude about him. He had none of his original qualities and I felt like he was a completely different person. I've seen a lot of bloggers say that Tobias and Tris both sound the same and that's the perfect way to put it. I felt like he was acting more like a female than the sexy bad ass I knew him to be.<br />\\"Death is so quick, so certain.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Was so excited when I found out!!!!! I love that it's on Kindle now. Seemed like it was never going to happen.
B005MMY5RK|1.0|THE ROOM was far more interesting that this sleep aid of a &#34;movie&#34;.  Boring story about some rich guy's boring life running a newspaper.  Aside from historical curiosity this movie is NOT interesting.  Makes a great sleeping aid.  Absolutely uninteresting... The only reason I kept watching this was because I genuinely though that such a loved movie couldn't suck this bad, boy, was I wrong.  I thought that it might get better since it has such great reviews.  It never gets better folks, it's just as boring throughout the entire flick. Why is this mandatory to watch in school? Perhaps it's to show you what NOT TO DO, it's purpose is to show the students that if you screw up massively and you do everything wrong you may have a movie this horrible.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|one word for you. amazing! best game ever!  I definately reccomend this game for everyone.  be prepared to spend a lot of time.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|Love this show, and all of its characters. It's one of the best shows of the last decade. This is a must-have DVD set.
B0028ER4PU|5.0|Exactly what I wanted. I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend and he is so happy with it. It came at a reasonable price, was delivered on time, was packaged properly, and the quality is great. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am more in love with Gideon and Eva's story, than Christian and Anna's story in 50 Shades of Grey. Just saying
0525478817|5.0|So many people say they LOVE this book and so I had to pick it up to understand why. After reading it, I get it. This is an amazingly well-written YA novel. The characters are real and interesting and clever. The story is unique and funny and heartbreaking. I didn't expect to laugh and smile so much while reading a book about teenagers with cancer. It's really more about life, and being human, and being authentic. Great read!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Quick and easy to use! A great way to find songs they you don't know!<br />A good way to find music from movies.
B0028ER4PK|5.0|The perfect gift. My boyfriend absolutely loves it. Great quality, original packaging. Prompt delivery - got to my house much earlier than expected. Was wrapped in bubble wrap and put in packaging specially designed for vinyl records to protect it during delivery. Very happy with this purchase.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I felt John Paul was selfish to not tell his wife Cecelia what happened long ago!!!!! If she didn't find the letter his secret would never have come out.<br />If I thought my child had killed someone I think I would confront them about it
0451419243|5.0|I have always enjoyed Ken Follett's books, so when I seen &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; in the Senior Center lending library I picked it up. I did not realize it was a historical novel and Book one of the Century Trilogy. I was almost finished it when I happened to be at the airport and seen Book two on the newsstand for $30. When I got home I looked on Amazon and bought it for $15. I am about a 5th of the way through it now and also enjoying it very much.
034580404X|5.0|Terrific story. Great reading. Suggest you don't use it in the waiting room. Does create attention. I believe a lot of people have read it in privacy but won't admit it. I loaned it to 3 people. In fact, I am going to read the whole series again.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is a great read.  It is unique and very well written.  Parts of the book reminded me of a couple of people I knew who had lived as children in Munich during the period.  Thoughtful and holds onto the reader. Highly recommend.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I can see why this book would be so controversial among dogmatic Christians, especially those who have not actually read it.  The fact remains that Jesus of Nazereth (whether or not you believe he was the Son of God) was an actual person who walked the earth for a too-short period of time.  I found it refreshing to have the circumstances and context of his life illuminated by this book.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The title seems to reflect her life more than the wilderness she actually passes through. Great story, great journey of someone's life.
B00640UICA|4.0|Only played for a short time, but had fun while playing. Recommended for the younger generation. Not enough to it

B004QZ9PLU|4.0|This book was really good.  I got hooked right away.  I wanted to just keep reading.  Very sad and not as predictable as most books.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Initial setup was a breeze, and once setup via wifi, I was able to connect with a wired PC too, which was a pleasant surprise. Using a third party application, you can stream pretty much any video format, which is nice for someone that doesn't want or can't have the extra cables running to the TV.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Great! Very interesting and fun for all ages! My grandchildren will love playing this game. Can't wait to share it with them.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I like it because you can play with friends or random opponents. It is exactly like the game you remember
B00A7H2NC4|5.0|Can't go wrong with Marv. He is the best Sin City character and represents everything the novels seek to convey. Love this one. Must buy!

B00FX8FQ76|5.0|So far, I like all the songs I've heard on this album! I've not owned any of her previous music but downloaded this album b/c my 6 yr old really liked her song &#34;Roar&#34; and I've been pleased with much of the rest of the album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am sooooooooooo HAPPY that Kindle Fire has FINALLY decided to offer Candy Crush Saga as an app!!!!! I LOVE the game &amp; it has just made me fall in love with my Kindle Fire all over again!
B0064W65SO|3.0|Three stars, not because it's bad, but because it may not be for what the casual reader is looking for. If you're a Batman fan, you should love this. Not all the villains and action you may be looking for, but still a great read.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I had purchased this item on July 26 right after it came out, however, it stops to work and stream exactly after 3 months. I was trying to return and exchange and unfortunately I was told that it is out of return or exchange window. I was not expecting this kind of quality on Google product!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is simply despicable! Every turn holds fun and mischief. It is spoil addictive, yet I don't regret playing it at all!

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great show. You never know what is going to happen next, unlike a lot of shows that are so predictable.
160774273X|5.0|I am an amature cook\baker.  Cooking/Baking is my personal private love.  I had bought a bread machine about 5 years ago as a catalyst to get me to attempt bread making without all the gadgets.  When I came across Flour Water Salt Yeast, I was still a bit intimidated, but I purchased it anyway.  All my cooking days, I've wanted to know how to make crunchy, chewy crust and an inside soft bread like you get from a french or italian bakery...well with this book you can!  I started with Ken's advisement in the book to begin with his simplest of recipes,  the Saturday bread and OMG!  I cannot describe the euphoria I had when I sliced the final product.  Let's just say it was EXACTLY what I wanted to achieve.<br />Getting to the book itself, because I had amazing results, I wish I could give it more star ratings.  I have several bread making books and none of them truly describe in laymen's terms what the look, feel and overall proper process to create such an amazing bread.  This book truly takes you step by step and gives practical advice, none of my other bread books dared to illuminate.  For instance, weight vs. volume and the differences with Ken's environment vs. mine.  The importance of TIME being an ingredient and not just a general thought.  All of his advice in this book are truly brilliant and brings amazing artisan bread making back to the home.<br />Again, I do not have the words to best articulate my amazement and outcome of what this book has given me.  I thank the author, Ken Forkish for simplifying and allowing the simple home cook to bake such wonderful creations.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A great read.  The intrigue kept your interest.  I could not  wait to get back to reading this book each time I had to put it down.
B000P0J024|5.0|The WIlburys are the best song writing team ever assembled in my opinion. Every member has an Incredible body of work and they brought all that talent and experience together in an amazing way.

B00742BVW8|5.0|I liked this movie because it came both with the English subtitles and the audio could be changed to English. The movie is like a double feature about what it is to be a hero and what it is to love with all the complications of the world from the perception of a man vs. that of a woman. Where I found this to be a profound movie this is just my opinion.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|my only say for this is &quot;awesome&quot; looking forward for the next room two. i enjoyed everything about this game!  =)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a good game to have when I am in a waiting room or just riding in a friends car.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|In this  part 2 of the Christian Grey trilogy, we learn what has made the man the way he is--the tragedy and triumph of our beloved Fifty. Here we learn of his abhorrent beginnings and his transformation. But mostly, we learn about the amazing power of love--and sex--to heal.
B000OVLINI|4.0|Set in Barcelona during the 1930s, the period leading into and encompassing the Spanish Civil War, this mystery unfolds slowly and tantalizingly. It begins with a boy, the son of a bookseller visiting a vast secret library, the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, with his father to select one book that is to become his muse. That is enough to rivet one's attention for the rest of the story.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is populated by a cast of characters who evolve dramatically and believably as powerful events change their perceptions, their relationships and their lives. They draw you into the story and their lives they are so real, despite the fact that they experience almost surreal experiences. There is love, humor, suspense, violence, incest, reversals, mystery, surprise and a very complete resolution of the plot.<br /><br />What I found difficult about this novel is the author's use of extensive background narratives. Rather than inform the reader about a character's past, or his or her ongoing but covert activities, as the story unfolds the author reverts to background briefs in the form of a letter from a key character to backfill the reader on prior events that explain various mysteries.<br /><br />The setting in pre-war Barcelona is exotic. Descriptions of people and places are excellent as is the urban detail. Should I ever return to Barcelona it might be fun to tour the city through the eyes of Daniel Sempere.<br /><br />This book is captivating. I rate it four stars.
0744014956|5.0|I buy this book for my husband, and he likes it very much. He said this book guide very detail...
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|Very entertaining and playing with physics. I could spend hours playing it. I recommend it because it is very interesting how reality is when launching the water
B00G118LYY|5.0|Even though the toca games are made for younger audiences, I find myself enthralled by the simple and entertaining game mechanics. As a 15 year old guy, I don't quite know if that's a good thing. But I digress.<br />The game is simple enough. In the menu you choose if your driver is male or female then you choose one of the two maps. One map is preloaded with buildings and ramps ( my favorite is the airplane one which turns your car onto a glider ) and the other is a blank canvas for you to build whatever you want.<br />I am slightly dissapointed in the fact that the cars are not customisable , and you have very limited resources when creating a map. But these minor flaws are easily forgotten when you keep mind that its made for littler kids and not people like me.<br /><br />My 6 year old god-brother loves it so there's that as well
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|What is definitely an extraordinary concept gets short-shrifted as a story by fairly one-dimensional characters.  Maybe Eggers thought that was necessary to ensure that the key points made it through, but the points would be hard to miss, played out on the human and then again the marine level.<br /><br />Still ... even with (and in fairness, perhaps because of) the hyper-simplification, the point gets through.  I believe this book will be with me for quite a while, and I will be viewing my own behavior through the book's lens.  And for Eggers, I'm guessing that's success :-).
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy this puzzler.  Love that you can load your own pictures and that it has up to 280 pieces.  Playing on the 8.9 inch kindle and the pieces aren't too small.  A little pricey, but hours of game play.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Liked this move since day one at the theaters. Dustin Hoffman does an amazing job at bringing Captain hook to life.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|It's a good game but it ain't letting me have any more regions my dad has this game and he has 5 regions and I finished the third region trophy hunt a month ago and I still ain't got another region that's what sucks.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded this app to my kindle fire - great idea for when I'm doing a quick calculation for my grocery list and the Kindle is already at my elbow.  I keep it on my &#34;favorites&#34; list. Very handy.

B0071XO8RA|1.0|I was fooled by the amount of 5 star reviews. This is one of the most boring reads of my life. I wasted so much time having gone through 75% of this series (books 1 through 5, which I bought as a Kindle bundle) if only I could have this time back to invest in a better read... Well, I guess I only lasted for 75% because I took this title with me on my Kindle on a one week vacation, and I usually love to have a vacation-companion book, which gives me something to do and to look forward to doing every night before going to sleep in foreign countries. At least it did help my sleep come early every night. I kept thinking something was going to change, something was going to happen. Specially, I kept hoping at some point I would actually relate to some character, feel any emotion towards anyone, come on at least gimme a villain to hate, anyone, please! But no, I couldn't feel any emotion towards anyone, I didn't mind if they would die (and many of them did) and when I finally dropped this sleeping pill of a book I was actually hoping the main character would die. This is only the second book in my whole life in which I find totally impossible to feel any emotion towards any character. As much as I give the author a praise for attempting that ambitious task of creating a world of sci-fi, I hope he pays more attention to the fact that, as good as a well constructed sci-fi world may feel, you still need human emotions to give it life.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Provides hours of fun for a very great price! This is a great starter christmas gift for every toddler girl.

1250038820|1.0|This book is awful. The man simply took pictures of random people and makes money from it. It is completely shallow and has no value to it whatsoever. I am completely dissapointed by this purchase and the new york times for suggesting something so awful. This is a horrible author and this book should be burned by the fires of hell.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found this book very very interesting especially how all the parts came together.  I recommended it to many friends who are also enjoying it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so cool there's awesome costumes and freeze rays. its really cool and you should definitely look into getting it, even though the downloaded can take a little while its still really fun.

B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Great movie! I had never heard of Sound City Studios. What an incredible legendary place. A lot of some of the best music I grew up with was made at this place. Fascinating to see/hear all the stories surrounding how this music was made. Any music fan will love this movie.
006202406X|1.0|Like many others, I was a huge fan of the first two books of the series -- I've been eagerly awaiting Allegiant for the last year and a half. That said, I have never been so frustrated and disappointed with a book in my life. The pacing was slow, the answers we got to the big questions in the first two books were a huge letdown and were convoluted, the writing of Tris and Tobias seemed way off, and the end, at least for me, was deeply unsatisfying. I'm not opposed to sad endings at all. But with this one, all I could think was \\"Huh?\\" I didn't find it moving, I found it maddening. This was the payoff for being so invested in these characters for so long? The ending, once I really started thinking about it, didn't resolve anything and seemed to be little more than a depressing emotional ploy to reinforce the idea that \\"life sucks, we move on.\\" I mean, seriously? After all that?<br /><br />There are two things, though, that bother me the most. The first is that V Roth's editors and publishers did the author  a huge disservice by not helping her work through some of the obvious plot and writing problems that so many have pointed out. I felt totally cheated as a reader, because I'm walking away with the feeling that the publisher wanted to push the book out before it was ready in order to make the most money with all the hype surrounding the movie. I would have gladly waited another year or two for a better book. But more importantly, Allegiant ruined the entire series for me. I don't know how I can reread Divergent and Insurgent again and still feel the same way about them. This is why I want to chuck Allegiant against a wall.<br /><br />I was a little tempted to give the book a two star rating because there were a couple of good scenes amidst all the bad. But not even the brief peek at Four and Zeke's bromance in Allegiant is really worth two stars given everything else.

B00CWY76CC|1.0|I quickly got to level 5, but seems stuck there. There isn't a helpful tutorial to define if stuck, options. Not that I want answers, it's just that since I cannot complete 5, I'm done with the game. Unless that is as far as the game goes? Either way, it's a useless download for me now. Clipped through the 4 rooms and found everything I was supposed in room 5 in a short time frame. Wasn't as challenging or fun as I had imagined.

0804168431|1.0|The audio CD is indexed alphabetically and so won't play in order.  You can not follow along without every 3 minutes choosing and then clicking on what should be the next track number numerically.  For instance, the order is that the first disc plays is Track #9 (Arrival on Himmel Street) Track #3 (Beside the Railway Line) and then Track #1 (Death and Chocolate).  If you wanted songs in a different order, that would be fine; but this is a STORY that needs to go in order.

Thinking hard not purchasing any more movies thru Amazon, this is to much trouble to repack them and go stand inline at the post office to return waist of time for me I just threw them away
B00BD99JMW|1.0|*SPOILERS*<br />I will start this off by saying that while, no, I haven't reviewed the other two books in the trilogy on here I have read them. I'm still getting used to writing reviews around here so bear with me.<br /><br />I fell in love with \\"Divergent\\" from Chapter 1 when I first saw it on the front table at B&N. I waited for \\"Insurgent\\" with intensity and fell in love with it just as hard. Once \\"Insurgent\\" ended I was ready to start a countdown to Book 3 and did once Oct. 22 became the date. It quickly became one of the worse literary disappointments I'd ever dealt with.<br /><br />I agree with all of the reasons people have listed before me for why I hate this book. I do mean hate.<br />*The fact it was told from two perspectives which seemed so forced and it's obvious VR only did it because of people's love for the short \\"Four\\" snippets.<br />*The fact that the story moved so slow and repeated itself where it didn't need to.<br />*The identity and personality that Tris and Tobias lost through not only the story itself but the fact that VR didn't develop them into distinct people like she should have. I was always told to \\"show, not tell\\" with writing, but all she did was tell. She wanted to force you in this book to see how seemingly different people can have a powerful bond by repeating that they do over and over instead of bringing them to it.<br />*The all-over-the-place goals of what the story was supposed to revolve around.<br />*The backseat the concept of an \\"Allegiant\\" was made to take.<br />*The anti-climactic realization of the world outside the fence. It felt as if it was thrown together and tossed at the reader as well as the characters and we all just took it hoping it would improve.<br />*Then, of course, the unnecessary killing of Tris. The practically invincible heroine. Not only did her death come off as meaningless, but it was so cheap how VR introduced a phantom of Tris' mother to make it seem worth it.<br />*Last, on top of it all, the half-assed piecing together of everything after that ending to make it seem poetic, bold and heroic like this is Shakespeare or something.<br /><br />This book has already become a blur to me, mainly for the fact that it runs together so much that it's dull. I felt so betrayed by the end of it. I didn't even feel this heartbroken with \\"Mockingjay\\". I agree with another reviewer, it feels like VR picked the easiest ending she could have instead of writing something worth while. This book in NO WAY does justice to the first two. I'll keep them on my Kindle, but I'm returning Allegiant. I'll keep the ending I daydreamed about in the year I spent waiting for this...trash...to be released. What a disappointment. I won't be reading anything else from VR, nor will I be seeing the movie. \\"Divergent\\" and \\"Insurgent\\" are enough.lf-assed piecing together of everything after that ending to make it seem poetic, bold and heroic like this is Shakespeare or something.<br /><br />This book has already become a blur to me, mainly for the fact that it runs together so much that it's dull.

B00CRS88IO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada by Damian Stevenson is a very entertaining read.<br /><br />I enjoyed this espionage thriller that was like a Bond movie but filled with interesting historical details.<br /><br />The story is never dull and there's a lot of funny moments. An interesting portrayal of Europe at the start of World War 2. I loved the French resistance character. The ending was great.<br /><br />I read this after reading and really enjoying The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal (A World War 2 Thriller) both or excellent reads and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />5 stars and highly recommended. I can't wait for more books from the author.
B00A88FLI0|4.0|This review is written by my 7 yr old son - I am typing in his comments.<br /><br />I put it together by myself. The set had all of the pieces, none were missing, and I did not have any problems building it. But I did have to go back one time when it was a little difficult. I looked at the instructions more carefully to fix it.<br /><br />I like building Legos more than playing with them. After I am finished, it looks good.

0061950726|5.0|This was a beautiful story that revealed a tremendous amount of insight into the way it was for young immigrant orphans forced to endure so many hardships as they boarded trains with no reassurance at all of what their destiny would be. I loved the way the author entwined the young girl, Molly's life with Vivian's life. It was magical the way their lives unfolded. It gives one the feeling that all of us impact each other in the journey of life. A truly inspirational book, that proves the miraculous power of the human spirit and the importance of a faith that can carry a person through every stage of life.
B001E45XT4|4.0|this headset is really good although the reviews i saw on youtube said it was pretty durable it really wasn't. feels like cheep plastic and it feels like it can brake easy. feels almost too delicate. for me it lasted about 2 years and now finally broke. the sound quality isn't too bad either though look for something else if your wanting heavy bass this is a 20 dollar headphone. i was pretty happy with them but now RIP my dear headphones.

B00132S74A|5.0|excellent escapist novel in the best Follett tradition. His writing is exceptional for its breadth of subject. It is not a warmed-over version of a previous success.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. I love it but have one complaint that might can be fixed easily. Once the Kendall;..telephone or electronic device is broken or go out for some unknown reason you lose everything and have to start all over again and somethings have been bought with real money. Its just not fair. I didn't lose my high score but lost all my characters & subway boards. This really broke my heart. Do you have any suggestions.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret takes a pleasantly real look at the various layers of a person's character rather than a flat trite list of stereotyped features.  It shows how people change due to their choices and the choices of others in spite of themselves. The Husband's Secret is a good read for the romance and mystery lover who is tired of cookie cutter stories. It leaves you with the peace of mind that your own life is not so different in the challenges and ordinariness of the human experience.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Hard but fun! The game can mess with your mind. All you have to do is remember. In this game you mostly have to remember everything. But otherwise Enjoy.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Good idea but extremely limited. Needs apps, I was under the assumption that you'd get the google play store app with this and you could download apps to this...not the case. You can use YouTube, and netflix that's pretty much it and you need to use your smart phone to launch these apps. Perhaps it will be updated in the future

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|An interesting follow up to The Shining. I give it 4 stars more for the character development than the plot. Stephen King obviously knows the pains and triumph of recovering alcoholics. He also explores the process of death in an imaginative way. This is not spine-tingling horror; it's more creepy than anything else. Maybe a few too many coincidences, but a truly surprising ending.

B003SI9WYG|1.0|It became very boreing to me... I ordered it because a gal said she enjoyed watching this movie over and over again... I should have read more into this movie before ordering.  Not the type of movie for me nor my grand children.  If this rhyming and quick talking was on some other subject it would have been much better... but not for Christmas....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Boring......  This Christian character is so Full of himself!!!  He is a Joke!!!  He is a narcisist and antisocial (a psycho)..... he is selfish and abusive  to Ana AND she allows it!!!!!!  It's unnerving and sad.  Ana was a virgin until psycho Christian came into the picture, he should have scared her, but NO she LOVES him, unbelievable.  Ana is an educated idiot, has little to NO self respect... The book goes on and on and on.......having sex, texting, having sex, texting.............The younger generation will love this book, all the texting  ,and Christian being filthy RICH and not working!!!  I Did not finish the book.  Read maybe half.....  May have gotten better, but I doubt it........ Perhaps the story would have explained WHY Christian was such a controlling jerk.  AND  Why Ana had such a low self esteem, she allowed her self to be abused sexually and emotionally..........  I READ THE REST OF THE BOOK........ not good BORING
B000IOM1YG|5.0|I just received this cd and I am happy to have it in my music collection once again. This is one of the best Alan Parsons albums in my opinion. There are lots of great reviews here so I will just say that I think the remastering gets an A+ , it just sounds fantastic. I was also pleasantly surprised with the bonus material it's a nice plus to an already classic album.

1594746036|4.0|Wow. I really enjoyed this book. Ransom Riggs did a wonderful job with all of the imagery he put into his novel. The way he explained the characters and their surroundings made it easy to become part of the book. It was as if I was able \\"see\\" what was going on, as if watching a movie.  The parts of the story reminded me of the television show the \\"Vampire Diaries\\".<br /><br />What really made this book stand out from other novels I have read, were the pictures of disturbingly strange children that were placed throughout the book. Those pictures truly propelled this wonderful story into the strange and wondrous lives of these peculiar children.<br /><br />The book is basically, about a boy, Jacob, who seeks out answers to his grandfather's outlandish stories. I can truly relate to what Jacob is going through in this novel, but I do not want to give anything more away. This story is great for teenagers because there is even and underlying romance in the novel. If you have read the Percy Jackson series, I highly advise this book for you. During your free time, I recommend you read \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" for a vivid adventure.

1451695195|4.0|Having seen that this book was on the NY Times' bestseller list, I was compelled to read it. Naturally, I was also curious to see what others had to say about Dr. Alexander's story. I can't begin to say how surprised I am at the lower raters actually attacking Dr. Alexander's financial status, credibility and character, as well as the authenticity of his experience.<br /><br />I don't know Dr. Alexander personally, nor could I ever imagine attacking his personal character, based on this book.  I will rate it at 4 stars, based on what I thought of his story and whether or not I enjoyed the book. I was disappointed that Dr. Alexander didn't write more about his experience in Heaven but I did appreciate the timeline of the book, beginning with his illness, his experience and his recovery. Did he really experience this?  Was it hallucinatory?  Was he really in a brain-dead coma?  Dr. Alexander is a noted, prominent neurosurgeon who would hardly have the cause to fabricate such a story. Truly, he has better things to do with his time. In addition, he proclaimed that prior to his NDE, there were certain things he witnessed in his practice that he had no explanation for, but that his experience has since lended plausibility to. One such concept is that of \\"terminal lucidity\\", where a gravely ill person becomes suddenly awake and alert, right before death (birth). In fact, it was described by a colleague of Dr. Alexander's, when he recounted his NDE to the other doctor. The notion of \\"terminal lucidity\\" is mentioned in other books, so it is not unique to Dr. Alexander's professional experience.<br /><br />We have no concept of what is beyond, but it's a matter of where our faith leads our beliefs. An extension of Einstein's theory suggests the existence of as many as eleven dimensions -- many more than we know about. As a Christian, that's one of the primary reasons that I read this book, along with others by Dr. Raymond Moody and Mally Cox-Chapman, previously.<br /><br />The softcover version of this is not that expensive. If you're curious about Dr. Alexander's experience, I urge you to read it.he softcover version of this is not that expensive. If you're curious about Dr. Alexander's experience, I urge you to read it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was an enjoyable and easy read.  It was informative and creative.  The end wrapped up a bit quickly, but was satisfying.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|It's obvious that Jeff Bezos aided and abetted this book to be written, and why not? Just like Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, and other innovative entrepreneurs of this age, Bezos is brilliant, fearless, ruthless, and maniacal about his creation, Amazon.com. Working at Amazon, however, is *not like* working at Google right up the road: rampant conflict, confrontation, draconian frugality and in some cases, criticism to the point of employees experiencing post traumatic stress disorder. Bezos believes in working harder, longer and smarter - and this is the trinity of his management style and the work performance expectations levied on those around him.<br /><br />It's a complex portrait of a company and a founder/CEO that's compelling enough you won't want to put it down. Personally, I think there should be a drinking game for this book - every time you see the word \\"customer\\", you should have a shot of your favorite adult spirit. Of course then, you'll drop your Kindle...

0486414124|5.0|I purchased &#34;Northanger Abbey&#34; because I needed it for a class, but was surprised by how much I enjoyed reading it. Jane Austen is a very poetic writer. After reading it, my book is marked with marginal notes, underlines, and exclamations. The characters, though vibrant at first, dull a little by the end of the story; nonetheless, it is a good book that I am glad i purchased and I am inspired to read more of her work.

006202406X|1.0|I greatly enjoyed the first two books of the series and thought the third book would be just as good.  While I was disappointed with the ending, that was not the only part of the book that was upsetting.  I really did not enjoy the changing point of views.  This seemed an odd choice to me since the first two books were written from Tris' point of view.  So much of the story was underdeveloped.  The author would present a new idea but then leave it lingering and never follow through with it.  This was extremely frustrating.  Also, the flow was off.  There was a great deal of detail missing throughout and it came across as choppy and trying to advance the story quicker than it should have.  I felt as though I forced myself to read through many parts of the book as they were so slow and on the verge of just being boring and then out of nowhere it would pick back up.  When it comes to the ending, the way it was dealt with was extremely upsetting.  It was lackluster and it did not give the reader a sufficient understanding of why the death had to occur.  It was as though her death did not affect anyone on some great significant level, even for Tobias.  His reactions and feelings to what happened were conveyed very quickly.  The whole scene of her death was just unworthy for her character, she deserved more than that, unless the author was just going for irony then it was pretty perfect.  I've read many series and while I never want characters to die, I have always understood why they needed to die to make the story work.  However, this death did not work.  For example, in Harry Potter I was saddened by many of the deaths, but with Allegiant I was angry with this one because there was just so much confusion.  Another thing I noticed with this book was the amount of &#34;philosophical&#34; points the author was putting into the book.  It was almost as if it was not about the story but how much insightful advice she could cram into the book.  I felt very overwhelmed by thatbecause there was too much of it.  Ultimately, this book did not leave me with that longing desire to know more about the characters and what happened to them.

McCartney delivers his hardest song ever, Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails) & Dave Grohl (of Foo Fighters & Nirvana) work well together, all of the tracks are interesting & well worth the price. Anyone who likes rock music should like this all-star lineup. Makes a great gift when paired with the dvd (or Blu-Ray)
031237593X|5.0|Beautiful, lyrical, and haunting, Sharon Kay Penman's epic saga of the War of the Roses &#34;The Sunne in Splendour&#34; reads as though it could have been entirely historical fact (which arguably, it could have been). She makes it easy to understand the motivations of all of the major players, writing with a steady hand during the many battle scenes and beautifully of the love between Richard of Gloucester and Anne Neville.<br />I'd say roughly the first 150 pages were slow going, but once I started to get into the home stretch I couldn't put it down, despite knowing that the Richard who had captured my heart throughout the novel was the same Richard whose body was discovered just last year under a car park.<br />&#34;The Sunne in Splendour&#34; will tug at your heartstrings and inform your knowledge of the War of the Roses. Highly recommended for both historical accuracy and powerful writing.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The first 80% of the book was gripping and imaginative. As soon as the &#34;buggers&#34; had been vanquished, the rest of the book seemed unnecessary and unmotivated. Apparently, Ender's Game wasn't the first in the quintet written and the author needed the unfortunate ending to set up book #2. Regrettably, that was not clear to a reader who began with book #1.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This is a well written action story that shows the world the crucible in which the most famous spy in creation, 007, was forged. I loved the scene on the mountains when 17F had to elude the Nazis. There's something here for everyone. Women will love the romance. Guys should enjoy the thrills. It's a great book.
B009LDXQGW|4.0|Not bad there's a lot of music on here so not all of it is as good as the tracks High for this, dirty diana (cover of mj), rolling stone. If you like r nb and melodies check it out. Persoanlly i think this cat is mad overrated but its still nice refreshing music
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Awful!  So Twilight without the happy ending.  Just read 1 and 2.  Skip the boring, sad ending third!  Way to ruin the trilogy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive, great fun. Can't put it down at times. Great way of sharing with friends.<br />HOPE to catch up with friends scores.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have wasted SO much time on this game!  The sense of accomplishment when you succeed keeps you coming back again and again.
B000001G1E|5.0|haha really though its soulfully funky check it out feloow funks!! And remeber hes got soul and super bad. Amazon i love you for this one im gone!!!
B00F880BWG|4.0|This episode is important as it suggest a reason for turning without being bitten or killed in some other way
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love having this on my kindle but if I advance a level it doesn't sync with the same game on my computer.  So, on the computer, I'm still on the old level.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I honestly did not enjoy this book. The story was very boring and dragged on and on. So much for new York Times best seller.
B00E1LQ7Q0|5.0|Easily my favorite pop record of 2013 actually probably for the last 5 years. Welcome back JT mke more music you are a game changer!
B000002H3E|4.0|This is by far the best work of Dokken. Every song really stands out on its own. \\"In My Dreams\\" is great. But, I really like \\"The Hunter\\" and \\"Don't Lie To Me\\" because of the guitar riffs. I recommend that metal lovers get this album.
B002N44XSG|3.0|This is a nice book that will keep me occupied as i an dieting for the next book to come out. Let me just say this to you rick, your books are to short, just make them 1 million cazillion pages long.<br /><br />...for me?
B0055HVDZY|5.0|Sabotage is definitely the most varied and adventurous of the classic sabbath albums. However, i urge the sabbath fanatic to get past the first song &#34;hole in the sky&#34; which is no doubt the most commercial and polished songs of the early albums, and the weakest one as well, virtually the only song i think is lagging from the first six records. Things pick up much, much better with an uplifting fast acoustic piece ( opeth fans will hear the influence) which goes into &#34;symptom of the universe&#34; which has perhaps bill wards finest drumming.<br /> The songs go into progressive territory with clear influences of early genesis and lead into Two of the best sabbath songs ever : &#34; supertzar&#34; with a beautiful medieval and slightly haunting choir. it would fit right in on the Excaliber soundtrack, this goes into &#34; am i going insane (radio)&#34; which seems to be a tribute to the west coast 60's psychedelic bands. In fact, at first listen i thought it was an Electric Prunes cover. listen to the Prunes &#34;underground&#34; album and you will know. There is also a bit of Love and Seeds influence going on. A great song. The album ends with &#34;the Writ&#34;, another progressive blend with a few brief Genesis type of passages.<br />This is the first album which takes numerous listens to let it absorb in. It is the most technically produced and polished of the classic sabbath albums, it lacks the heavy chunky and raw sound of previous works, but has an adventurous experimental quality.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I absolutely loved the first two books. Read each of them more than once. And I, like many loyal Divergent fans, eagerly anticipated the release of Allegiant.<br /><br />NOT REALLY SPOILERS ... BUT ...<br /><br />Before even beginning the book, I was hesitant to jump it. After all, it's the last book in the series ... which meant that my journey with these characters (who I'd become highly invested in) was coming to an end. It was a reality that made me sad, and it was why it took me about two days after the book's release to finally delve into it. Why did I finally take the plunge and start reading, you ask? Well, I realized that once I finished this book, I could go back to the beginning and read again, taking new, fresh interest in all of the obstacles and hurdles the characters in the first two books endured -- with a new understanding of how it would all be tied together in the end.<br /><br />Well? I feel robbed. For the first time that I can remember, I finished a book series and didn't care what could possibly happen next. My emotional connection to the characters was destroyed and I wished I'd never read the third book. I'm sure it wasn't Roth's intention, and I'm sure she had her reasons for wrapping things up the way she did; I just can't see them. I feel like my investment in all three books was wasted. Pretty sure I don't even want to see the movies now ...
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is very relaxing to play, yet still challenges your mind. I recommend this to anyone who loves to play games! I give it 5 stars!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I quite enjoyed the story line, wanted it to have a happier ending for the young girl. Alittle less French words would have been better.
B005LAII80|1.0|Without a doubt the worst movie I have ever been so stupid to sit through. The main actor wears a helmut with face shield during the entire movie. His voice is mechanical. Hard to connect with such a main character. No real plot, just gratuitous violence. They must have used galleons of fake blood. This movie is absolutely not for young people. It will probably give me a nightmare tonight. Really.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Google Chromecast by itself works just fine.  It's the providers that make it difficult to use.  I only use it to stream to a new TV that doesn't have a VGA input.  So I either need a new computer with HDMI output or get cable...whatever.  Netflix works perfectly, their app lets you choose to watch on your computer or stream.  Hulu's new &#34;I work with Chromecast&#34; probably works on everything except a PC.  Their customer support can't seem to understand why I only have a PC.  Streaming TV show is a good as watching on your laptop as long as you have good enough wireless to support it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Outstanding game...very challenging with enough hints to keep you on track.  Made me really problem solve.  Fantastic graphics and puzzles.  At this price,  don't pass it up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy I couldn't wait to download this game,it's about time,everyone that has a kindle fire,thank you so much,I will tell everyone
0785814531|5.0|Great value for a classic!  Poes entire works in one gorgeous hardback book! This was a gift for a Grandchild that loves Poe!  So I couldn't go wrong!  Great book, at a great price!, everyone's happy!
B002LL167W|1.0|I was unable to play this because it is from a different zone, Europe? I don't blame the seller because there wasn't anything on the cover that stated this. Just a warning to buyers and sellers.<br />I did finally figure out how to change zones but if you do it regularly your player won't accept more than a certein amount of changes.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Do not get the product that is buy: from the date that the purchase was made and will request the sent, the product never I was delivered to my destination, citing the customs agent, the Venezuelan customs were involved, which investigate and was false. Subsequently the same customs agent Mr. Lorenzo Colina, telephone in Miami 2005070 (owner of the company that would bring Venezuela product - supplies and services LM), indicated that the problem was with the goods door to door, reason by which it was returned to the United States. Also Indian, that serious organized and rated for your forwarded the goods permitted according to the new regulations of the Venezuelan Government, which has created an uncertainty in my for the reception of the same. I come to this prestigious firm AMAZON, with the purpose that I review in this respect of the acquired or make me money back.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|This game is fun, but there are some disappointments. I mean you can't really do anything, unless you have help, and you only start with 60 points. The help cost 300 points. You really can't go to level 3, unless you have help. If you do want help at level 3, you have to buy it with your real money. A summary would be: you can't pass level 3 without paying real money for help. :(
B0047Y17P2|5.0|The Lincoln Lawyer is another likable character invented by Michael Connelly, the master story teller.  Filled with ups and downs, the story is able to give the reader a true sense of satisfaction in that Justice can be reached by more than one path.  Should I ever need an attorney, I hope to find o e like Mickey Haller.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Different from what I usually read and maybe that's what I liked about it!  Sometimes you can get stagnant n bored so this was a refreshing, funny n entertaining ride!!  Harry Potter genre n I am not a HP fan but I would recommend this book to young n old alike!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I understand that most people were very upset with this book, but I have to admit that I am incredibly impressed with the way Veronica Roth handled the end of this series. There are not many authors out there willing to end a successful series on such a note. I thought it stayed true to the characters and the world in which they lived in a way not many trilogies can accomplish. The book was exquisitely written and impossible to put down, even through the parts that were difficult to read.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|To take or not to take an umbrella, now I know before-hand, after all what's not to appreciate about the weather channel.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got this as a solution at a friends house. She had no cable but she did have cable internet, netflix account and movies on her pc. So with this we can watch videos and any videos on her pc with this device. As long as you have a good router the streaming will look great. And the way you get videos on your pc to play via chromecast simply right click the video and open it with the chrome browser cast it and there you are!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this app on kindle fire for a while now. So far it works great and I'm hooked. I even like it better than playing from Facebook on the computer!
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Found this more significant than prior book and very readable.  Would recommend it to friends who would not be bogged down by the botany.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Thanks alot Stephen King. I pre ordered this book it popped up on Friday. I wasted my whole weekend on the couch reading it because I could not put it down!!! Loved this book!!! One of the best you've had in years. Made my mind go back to the Shining book. Did nothing all weekend but read!!!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I read this book all in one sitting and absolutely loved it. It made me cry multiple times and feel connected to Hannah and Clay.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love to do puzzles like this.  Get this game if you are into serious puzzle solving.  Picked it up and can't put it down.
0316044695|5.0|about half way into the book one will quickly see that the BUD/S training is even more mental then physical if one can imagine that even possible.......I watched daily the Airborne training @ Benning going to my unit every day for years.....we supported the Rangers in the Georgia mountains ... it is a special kind of man no doubt, my heart broke at the bravery these men displayed that Hollywood liberals detest in real life (when there is no profit they can be truthful) .... I salute these men of valor, be it SEALS, SF, RANGERS, Pathfinders, they all are a cut above......and my noisy, hydraulic leaking chithooks are still doing the job hoo-rah....!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is another great Grisham book.  It is a quick and enjoyable read. Typical but with enough surprises to keep it interesting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best I love it I always make things when I'm board and I go on multiplayer. But there is a problem with multiplayer when I hit something I lose ALL my stuff and when I put my armour.on it disappears. Also she. I try respawn I get disconnect can u fix this?? Other then that the game is awso.e
B003K07DUC|2.0|seems like I've seen this before.  not well written not well shot or lit.  same ole story.  lots of action if you liked the hurt locker you may like this.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Amazing. Saves me from ever being late on a paper or not having my paper for class ready.it is really accessible and easy to use
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It is one of the books you start to read ,,and become the book ,,I started and did not put it down till I was finished .. Love his Books,
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome on Facebook. So glad it's finally on the kindle. Graphics are great and so far no bugs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game especially when there's time to kill.  My son is entertained at the same time just watching me play.  works for us
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I held off on play this game for a long time.. All my friends had been play it  for months. Once I broke down an started play I was hooked.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Good book for trying to figure out how to make your marriage work. How to communicate your feelings and understanding your partners.
B0058DRUV6|4.0|Great book! A little largo in appendix but it can be easy summarize un the schemes note in he book, i leve the concept of le el 5 of leadership, concil concept and discipline concept!
B00000JLWW|5.0|I love this movie so excited to watch it again, came even more on time than I expected it too! Had no problems at all! Recommend if you love this movie as much as I do!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an outstanding book i loved it i like how it gets you all jumped up i would read it again
B006W0QR1S|5.0|It was so poorly named. This film is a critic's assassin. It pretends to be a mainstream (direct to DVD) rip off of just about any racing schlock you've ever seen- when in reality it is a smart, deep and captivating work of true storytelling. The film is low budget and staffed almost exclusively with C list actors. It was almost as if they director wanted to make this project a true challenge and yet it becomes clear after the first ten minutes of watching 'Drive' that this film is going to end up appearing at just about every Film Studies class as an example of creative brilliance.<br /><br />In a few words....<br />\\"It is like breaking bad with better actors and has nothing to do with driving.\\"
B0006L0LOS|5.0|It came right on time and I'm excited to watch it, haven't watch this since it came out! so glad to have the chance to watch it as many times as I want!
B007NZDES0|5.0|A SADE fan.  First time finally seeing her live on her concert tour in 2011.  Very ectastic that she released a DVD/CD.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I can't believe that I have waited so long to read the final book only to be so disappointed and let down. I truly hate the ending of this series. After reading the final book, I am not so sure I will be able to watch the movie. Although the author is an incredible writer, I cannot understand why she chose to disappoint her fans!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Love this game. Even better now that there are good upgrades and new suits.:) my new favorite game to play. This is the best game ever.
B0094M2Z9O|3.0|I had never seen the movie before and I really enjoyed it except the video streaming would cut out from time to time. It is really hard to enjoy a movie when the video streaming would stop for about a minute or so, or worse when the connection is lost and it starts all over, that really gets me upset.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Excellent book. loved every minute!<br />Highly recommend this book.<br />A less than privileged up bringing for Shirley Maclane's daughter<br />Wow! Who would have thought!
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is not free. When you get into the game and complete the tutorial,it will cost you 0.99$.But trust me it's worth the money if you like games like this
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I recommend, especially if you enjoyed The Shining. Finding out what happens to little &#34;Danny&#34; was well worth the read.
B00915G6R6|5.0|Smart writing.  Good acting.  Nice twists.  Everything you would want in a quality program.  I hope this lives on for many more seasons.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|The sharpener is small enough to keep it in your pocket and have it available for every day use by hunters, fishermen, farmers etc. It gives a very sharp edge on all kinds of knives. The carbide and ceramic combination is a very good way of giving a fine finish on a knife
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|It does not even work on my kindle fire.  It took awhile to actually get to the menu, and then when I clicked the button to play, the game never came up.  I don't know if it is MY kindle, or the game itself.  It looked like a fun game.
B00DVL0CU8|5.0|Nice story line for a sci-fi movie.  Not too much blood and guts, and it had a feel good ending of promise and hope.  Looking forward to the sequel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game with u my daughter. we have a great time and she loves to feed the horses treats.
B0014D6PCO|1.0|this video not working please return money, i am trying to figure this out but its not easy please help
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The chapters were well written even though Tris & Tobias had there own chapters for their thoughts and actions. They were interconnected beautifully. One chapter ended and flowed into the next and you didn't have to go back to the previous chapter. The ending was a surprise but I guess not every story is lived happily ever after. Each one of us is a CD and glad for the diversity of people.
B00EH49DXA|5.0|It is an awesome song and I recommend this song to anyone who like Katy Perry, and song was lengthy so you can listen to it for  while
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a great book I had a wonderful time reading your book I will be reading it more often thanks for letting me read it
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is so AWESOME also not to hard but not to easy it is fun and I play it everyday honestly it is  VERY ADDICTIVE every one should download it this game.  ;)+:)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you watch a lot of streaming tv shows or movies, you need this. It is amazing. It is so nice to not have to sacrifice my computer if I want to watch shows on the tv. I can't help it, I'm a multitasker and I just like being able to browse the internet while watching a show. It was easy to set up and works really well, especially with netflix. I haven't quite figured out how to watch home movies with this thing yet (non-streaming movies that are just files on my computer), but with streaming stuff, it works very well. I could never go back to life without a chromecast.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game it's so addictive and fun for anybody the character options are cool and it fun when you finally get a character you have saved up for enjoy the game guys
B002KGEORM|5.0|The best drama that I have ever seen. SOA, has kept me on the edge of my seat. I am completely engulfed in the story. I love Sons Of Anarchy.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|It never gives me tickets on life's I don't think it's right to charge to go to next level it's to be a free game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I laughed and cried. But most if the time I was on the edge of my seat. My hands stiff on my kindle,my eyes glued to the eloquent writing. If you haven't read this yet you need to.
B00ATVY1KU|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!!!!! getting it on DVD, Blu-Ray, and Digital all for $3.12 was an absolute deal!!! Even as an adult I can't stop watching this movie and singing the songs- Bottom Line: get this movie- if not for your family, then for you!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a great game, its fun,easy, and all out awesome. I love this game so much. Get this game, i bet you will like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been trying to get this app for my kindle! Thanks for allowing the download! Thank you thank you thank you
B006M4F67A|5.0|Just mahjong.  Nothing fancy, just traditional fun.  Several different boards to give you variety and difficulty challenges with each different board.  Definitely recommend this game app. No problems.
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|Must read to counter the worse propagation of religion. Excellent read with all the excitement and pain elaborated in a lucid manner
B00C76076C|5.0|Got this for 4 year old granddaughter and she loves it! First week-end she watched it at least 5 times.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|This is a pretty good game, has a pokemon feel but also a city management feel as well. I enjoy this game!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is one of the best bingo ad slots games I have ever played.I would definitely recommend this game to everyone!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fantastic product! Strongly recommended for anyone looking to watch download from their smart gadgets on the big screen...ease of use and provide entertainment for the whole family.
B00G23VD6Y|2.0|Season 4 absolutely sucks thus far, which leads me to believe that the writers have run out of ideas.  I hope this isn't the case, but I can say that the first two episodes have been boring.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I didn't pull the foam cover over top of the rubber-like thing with the original, but since I was having trouble with the rubber structures ripping out of the plastic, I thought that it would be worth it.<br /><br />It is.  Take the time to pull that foam cover over to save the integrity of the rubber thing later.  The sock thing is less grippy and with it on less tension is put on base.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|Was first so excited about this game was awesome, then it started shutting down and would LOOSE all the work I had put into the game. Had to just delete it.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|Hocus pocus was my childhood movie, I wanted to share it with the kids i work with.<br />Love amazon movies!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is amazing. It keeps you on the edge the entire book. I was sad to finish reading the series until I found out Rick Riordan made another series with the same characters and more. The name of the next new series is Heroes of Olympus
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I love this movie! It is such fun and pleasure to watch! The great actors ensemble! I've seen it so many times yet enjoyed it every single time.
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|Outmove is a great followup to the previous stories 'Outview' to 'Outin', by Brandt Legg! The story is a wild ride - but is Nate up to it? I don't want to give away too much, but is this the end... or is it the beginning? Definitely a highly recommended book by me! Very cool!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This app is only $1.99 and is well worth every penny spent on it. We started out with the free version and my daughter quickly went through it and begged for more so here we are on the full app now. Alphabet Aquarium is very bright and colorful which is always a thing that attracts small children.<br /><br />This game is full of puzzles for every single letter of the alphabet. You will never run out of fun things to do on the Alphabet Aquarium app. I like that your kids learn from it too. Many people send their kids to preschool, but sometimes you can do just as much at home and apps like this make it where you can teach your kids letters from the comfort of your home.<br /><br />My daughter just loved the little crabs with the cute voices. They help bring the game to life and it is very cool! This app also runs very smooth and we have not had any problems with it closing down on us or anything. Whoever made the app did a great job on it.<br /><br />If you have a long car ride coming up, download this game before you leave and your kids will leave you alone for hours and learn while they do it.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|Outin is a great followup, the second in the series, to the previous story 'Outview', by Brandt Legg! The story is a truly exciting and I love the colorful descriptions throughout. Nate is right in the middle of it once again! He is quite a character - I don't want to give away too much about the book, but I highly enjoyed the trip! Well done.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first two books in the series were amazing to read. My friends and I have been so excited for the release of Allegiant , but now that I have read it I wish that I hadn't because it breaks the trust between the author and the reader. I highly recommend reading the first two books but not the last or you will be incredibly disappointed.
B008JEJOAG|5.0|Super comfortable and not quite as ugly as regular Crocs. Would buy again if price is right in mid-$30s.<br />Crocs.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|...it's still a good read, which is required if you want to continue in the series.  So read it to get on to the better books.
006202406X|1.0|I have never written a book review before, but I felt that I had to...maybe to make myself feel better.<br />I am not a young adult, and have just come to this series. I really enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent and even recommended the book to others, but I would find that hard to do with Allegiant.<br />****SOME SPOILERS****<br />I understand that people are upset with Tris being killed off, it was unnessary and not really done in a good way. Tris wasn't planning on dying. She knew she could get passed the serum.  So how is this a selfless act??  If David wasn't there she wouldn't have made this great sacrifice....how does she come off as the martyr without knowing it will happen?? Even with that being said, I can live with the fact she does die.  Not everything comes out rosy<br />What I found so troublesome was the behaviors of the characters.<br />Tris became this know-it-all, who chose to ruin the lives of innocent people in the airport to save the lives of others in chicago, many of whom she didn't really care about.  I don' think she makes that call.<br />Tobias became this whimpy character, instead of the strong, confident person he was.  He told Tris (in divergent) that he was a skeptical person and distrustful of most people, but he runs off with some girl he meets once. Turns his back on \\"his family, his love\\" He becomes this sad, kicked puppy.<br />Four was my favorite character in the book and i was so excited to hear that four short stories would be written from his perspective.  How can I read about him being this wonderful character, when I think about what his character becomes.  The changes in his character bother me the most.<br />Also...<br />**The leader of this \\"pure gene\\" society is hiding in a closet, because he thought she might doing something after hanging out with the \\"damaged gene people\\"  HELLO...she came with them!  PLEASE...!<br />**Evelyn ( the one who left her child) and Marcus ( the one who beat his child) become nothing's  in the end and give up without a Boo. What miraculous recoveries in character these two have?!<br />**Christina becomes nothing more than a sounding board<br />**Cara becomes a major player, she is a leader of the alliance?<br />**Uriah dies for what..to show again how down trodden Tobias is as a friend.<br /> The characters did not evolve and learn from their mistakes, but went on to repeat them for the worse. That is not being selfless...that's being selfish!<br />It is hard to read the book when so much of the wonderful storylines do not continue from the first two.<br />It is truly a disappointment as a reader.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive! My 4 year old loves it! It helped past the time on our trip from Georgia to New Mexico.

B007THA4FI|4.0|J k Rowling reveals the inner life of her characters. As my daughter said, 'By the middle of the book, you hate every character.' By the end of the book you find compassion for most of them.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|anything with Jodi Foster in it has to be good.  and this was a good movie.  i dont care for the spaced out parts but what else are you gonna do at that point.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|All my friends have been playing for weeks, but Kindle , until now, did not have this game available. Lots of fun and great graphics . Thanks KING for making a games FUN for all ages.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Brilliant game, very addictive and could play for hours if I had enough lives. definitely recommend for any age group as it is very easy to play :-)
B007SGLZP8|3.0|while in no way comparing in quality.  Grisham writing is getting pretty weak.  read his early stuff and skip this one
B00DYWKPAQ|4.0|Sometimes, a little rest does a body good...taking a lengthy hiatus after the much-publicized brawls/squabbles between Caleb and his Followwill Bros, KINGS OF LEON returns with the much-anticipated &#34;comeback&#34; album MECHANICAL BULL, and it sounds like the time off has paid off in dividends: this is the one of the most diverse, consistent KOL albums the boys have released so far in their career.  From propulsive first single &#34;Supersoaker&#34; to the riffage stomp of &#34;Don't Matter,&#34; KOL rocks harder than it ever has before, but now with a more rootsy, QOTSA heaviness it didn't quite posessess before - then delivers the gorgeous mid-tempo rocker &#34;Temple&#34; (the best on the album IMHO & the logical next single?), as well as haunting, moodier numbers like &#34;Beautiful War&#34; and &#34;Wait for Me&#34; - talk about a &#34;Comeback Story!&#34;  This latest longplayer displays all the qualities that fans love about KOL but takes them to a new, mature level. Welcome back.
B000NY17J6|5.0|Love this CD, a lot of older songs you don't hear anymore but were big hits. Looking for more of her CD's
B0082Z447U|5.0|What a wonderful read!  I have no more than two dozen books that I consider \\"keepers\\". These are the companions that I return to and re-read time and again.  Wilkie Collins The Woman in White joins that list.  There is no need to go into the plot as other reviewers have already done so.  Just know that once you start reading and get into the plot and acquaint yourself with the wonderful characters, you are in for a wonderful journey, which is at times chilling, hilariously funny, beautifully written and addictive.  I am continuing to read his other works.  As a contemporary of Charles Dickens, it seems unfair somehow that Collins did not receive the fame of Dickens, even though his writing is, in my opinion, less florid, more concise, less wordy and more humorous than the Great Dickens.  You're in for a treat.
0553840835|3.0|I like to use my friend's description of the book:  &#34;quirky&#34; little story.  The story line was fun, it was easy to read; the reason I don't give it top marks is because I don't appreciate vulgar language which seems to be a necessity in many novels.
B00AAQRNQ8|1.0|No side scrolling for the middle wheel, I'll get use to this.  edit: never got used to this, miss these button so very much<br />The thumb buttons are poorly placed and feel cheap/thin/fragile.<br />Needs to be a few mm taller to fit my hand nicely.<br /><br />Some type of software bug. After gaming the mouse cursor keep freezing and causing odd things such as the cursor changes to hourglass, or to a \\"stretch cursor\\" it makes it look like I am expanding a window or trying to click on things that i am not. I try looking in the hardware monitor when this starts to happen but ctrl alt del takes 30 seconds to pull anything up when this is going on.  I've also had the pc lock up and freeze right after applying changes to the key bindings in the Anker software.<br /><br />I have logitech set point installed for my keyboard and suspect the logitech and anker software are competing for attention.  I'll be playing with uninstalling and reinstalling hoping to find a solution other than rebooting the computer often.<br /><br />I bought this to replace a logitech g5 that had a bad scroll wheel.  It doen't feel as nice but it is very similar. For the low price it not bad, I just wish they still made the g5. Unused g5's are going for 150-200$ on ebay sadly.  I kinda wish I had gotten the g400/g500 now instead.<br /><br />edit: not aging well, non stick surface is wearing/scratching, mouse is glitchy on surface recognition at times when using my black textured aluminum rocketfish mousepad, hand still hurts after using it a while.  Very much not happy with this. I'll be getting a logitech when I save up the money. on the software issue uninstalling logitech software did fix the anker software.  But I'd rather have my multi media controls back for my keyboard.
B0031RS44S|5.0|A must read. I could not put it down once I got started. I was really pulled into the story from the first page.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best season yet!  What an amazing show.  This show just gets better and better.  I don't like that we have to wait in the US to view the program but at least we get to view it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. I only wish it lasted longer. I really don't have anything negative to say about it. The graphics are gorgeous but simple. The interaction is intuitively simple. The puzzles force you to think, but aren't so difficult that you are reaching for the hint button. However if you do ask for a hint that is what you get, ...a hint. NOT THE ANSWER! Love that.<br /><br />The mechanized aspects of the game are exquisite. Seriously. You will continue to play if for no other reason, to simply see what unfolds next. I can't wait for the next one and hope it's available for my Fire.<br /><br />It does take awhile to download and open. It's worth the wait though. I purchased the ap and do think it is worth the asking price. If you are from my generation and remember the Hellraiser movies, it will make you think of them in a way.<br /><br />kudoes to the designers. I've not seen a better game of it's style. It is my favorite ap purchase thus far and I would likely pay for future chapter packages if they ever decided to do something like that. Just great overall.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Frustrating at times but can't wait to play when I get my lives back.<br />Well worth getting if you don't mind spending a lot of time playing it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was nice to see what happened to the boy in the Shining.  Even if you have not read the Shining (which I highly recommend that you do? you could enjoy this book without ever picking the first book up.  I highly recommend you read both!  Excellent read.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I get the frustration but... Good books are ones that make you feel something, even if you don't like the feeling.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  After I got through the first few chapters, it held my attention. This is the type of book that causes you to wonder about the characters even when you aren't reading.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|The Language of Flowers is the story of Victoria, alternating between adolescence in the adoption system and adulthood in the world. Victoria speaks through flowers, as Elizabeth taught her, as it is the only happiness she has after her troubled years moving from group home to home.<br /><br />My most favored character was Elizabeth. Elizabeth was Victoria's guardian for a stretch of time when she was young. Elizabeth held wisdom that I found no character possessed in the story, and I connected with her. I would not have enjoyed this book without her.<br /><br />I loved Elizabeth, but I did not like Victoria. I do not have any common traits with her, nor do I know what it is like to live under her circumstances. Throughout the novel, I found myself thinking that Victoria was mentally ill. I am not sure if this was the intention. Victoria did not seem to have common sense at times, and this angered me a lot. I often thought that I would have done different under the same difficulties.<br /><br />I felt uncomfortable while reading most of the book. Wait, this is a good thing... let me explain! Victoria does not communicate well, nor does she like having physical contact. During conversations with others in the book, I would cringe. I would physically grimace while reading physical encounters. This is how Victoria felt, and I felt it too!<br /><br />A few chapters in the novel were depressing. With all of the downward spirals in Victoria's life, I found the ending too quick and too perfect. I felt as though Victoria could have made the same decision that she made in the end of the book, a year... or seven in advance!<br /><br />This novel was enjoyable. I grade books very harshly. At the beginning of the book, I gave it five stars, and as I continued to read, the rating gradually fell to three stars.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Its a decent game to keep me busy when bored. Pretty self explanatory stuff here... no real surprises just a simple easy way to blow away 15-20 minutes.
B009ZE27US|1.0|It got my age wrong 32 times and after that I just quit. This is a waste of space and I was just bored so I got it and it sucks.
159514188X|2.0|What started out as an interesting mystery in figuring out the reasoning behind a teen girl's suicide, becomes a two dimensional story of a girl that hates everything, just because.<br />The mystery, and how it' slowly revealed through the book kept me interested and turning the pages. But the last chapter in which it's all revealed left me wanting more. It felt very after school special, and not very original.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Game wise it keeps you playing to try and get the higher score, very addictive you just want to keep on playing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Every time I get a moment to play THIA game I do!!!! This is the best game ever. I am addicted to this game!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am not big on working out, but needed to get rid of some baby weight before a family reunion. I made it to day 27 before the trip. Not only did I lose the extra lbs. but I was in the best shape probably in my life! I had tons of energy and my first ever 6 pack. This workout will kick your butt if you stick to it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy this game a lot. It keeps me busy and it's a good challenge.. good for the brain looking for matches and strategies............
0316044695|5.0|this book is one of those great tales of american bravery. easy to read. There were some parts about men that are from my area which made it even more compelling
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Best series of books anyone has ever written. Just finished my third reading and they get better every time. GRRM is a genius
B00280LYIC|4.0|This was the best book I have ever read.It is a good action adventure book.But it is a little different.
B00136LZG8|5.0|This was the first Santana album I ever heard, it was loaned to me by the bassist in my first band in HS to illustrate some point.  I had nothing else to compare it to and loved it as itself, most especially Samba Pa Ti , which I set to learning note for note as a guitarist, and Incident at Neshabur, just an out of this world sound.  I just listened to it again today and was just as taken with at as I was the first time and I wanted to explain my love for this music somewhere.  Everyone involved in this album covered themselves with glory, that even includes the cover art, which fires the imagination and puts one in the feel of the music inside. Santana deserves credit first of all, but the co-producer, Fred Catero, deserves huge credit for this album, it is genius level work, it's deep in every aspect.<br /><br />Every musician takes their own journey and has their own influences and inspirations, this album is in my own top five list of inspirations.<br /><br />I am still shocked by the passion and the level of artistry of every player here. Santana himself was at a peak of creativity here that I never have heard him equal, according to my own tastes. I have been a guitarist in the rock/jazz genre for well, more than 40 years,(and a violinist longer than that)  and his playing on this album was his most melodic and inventive, and that is saying a lot. Santana's father was a violinist and I read that violin was Santana's first instrument. Santana uses volume and feedback/sustain to make the guitar sing like a violin and this album has the height of that, just exquisite and unique taste. For me, the riffs he came up with on this album are somehow more original and go further from their original blues and rock and roll origins than anything else he recorded. I do not know how many will appreciate this analogy but Santana's guitar playing on this album is as far from his other work as the Four Seasons is from Vivaldi's other compositions, it goes a level beyond and Santana created new sounds  and riffs that still thrill me after having heard them more times than I can count since the 70s. For me, his exquisite sense of timing, the delicacy of the dynamics, the soaring melodic lines that take the listener higher and higher, the fire, and the art contributed by the surrounding players... This album still gives me chills. Everyone involved  made major contributions to create a feel to this album that is unique.<br /><br />Beyond the art of each song, the album works as a unit, you go on a voyage through pieces that are connected to each other but each having its own wonderful individual flavor. This is a concept album, like Abbey Road, Close to the Edge, Electric Ladyland, or Dark Side of the Moon. This music is among those that took rock music to its highest form as an art. Its staggering how young they all were to be so deep. I have listened to classical music all my life and seen and heard many things, and jazz ditto, this album is not shamed by any music I have ever heard of any kind.<br /><br />I said it above, buts its worth repeating the album's producers, Fred Catero and Carlos, deserves enormous credit; to create a masterpiece of an album like this takes far more than just sitting wonderful musicians down and turning on recording machinery, it takes using the tracks they put down and shaping them into something greater with huge taste, skill, and imagination. I wish I could have been there to witness it.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I really did not like the style of writing in this book when I first started.  However, because I liked the T.V. series so much, I kept with it.  After reading about 1/4 of the book, I finally started to understand this author's style of writing.  Even then, there were still times when it was hard for me to understand who was speaking at which times because the author did not clarify.  Also, we were expected to keep many names and characters straight in our head after being introduced to them only briefly earlier in the book. The author would occasionally use the first name of a person, then switch and refer to that person using their last name or in some cases nickname.  Since it's hard for me to keep people straight in the first place, this was a detriment to me.  However, this was the style of the book, just like you were stepping right into Walt Longmire's head, and once I really got going and got into the book, I fell in love with the characters!  The story line and characters of the book are NOT the same story line and characters of the series (at least for this first book/episode) so if you are expecting them to be the same, think twice before reading.  Some have said the author carried on too much about certain details of things that didn't matter.  I, for one, enjoyed that fact, finding that it helped so much to visualize what the character was experiencing and feeling.  I laughed out loud quite a bit and even cried some.  This was a great book.  Because it was a long read, I will wait a while, but I will definitely move on to the next in the series.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|Great live album, phenomenal sound. If you like Metallica or used to like them, this is great to play loudly!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great ending to a great series. Loved the whole divergent series, but this book really stood out to me! Thanks
B000002LEM|5.0|I love my new Van Halen Ou812 album.  I learned a few more new songs that I don't recall hearing in the past, all great fun!
1577312082|5.0|Zen Buddhism, without the eastern flavour, and very well done.  One parallel with the Bible: it's not easy to grasp, although it's in clear idiomatic English, and it's easy to listen to. Grasping it comes with time, time well-spent, for those who are ready for it. You'll find that it's the absolute toughest thing you will ever do in your whole life, but when you get here you'll know that it was worth doing.
B00F91H666|2.0|ugh! i was very  disappointed with this film since the focus was on vampires (i.e. living dead - so lame!)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that they finally got candy crush for kindle.  I love it and am addicted to it.  I hope they get more of the games from king.com for the kindle.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Good game  fun for the kids I enjoy watching the children play this bubble blaze. I love the levels that the kids have to try to beat.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The concept is there but my internet does not seem to be strong enough to stream. Other than that this thing is awesome.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Would recommend this to anyone.  Such a bittersweet story .  It is a romance that is well written and deals with the issue of life and death.  We read it for our book club and we had much to talk about.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Riveting and interesting, kept me tied to it to the end.  The great story of overcoming whatever adversity you face.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I know many people with candy crush and so I was pretty exsited t ok see that it cam  out for kindle.<br />I am on level 27 and I really enjoy it.  It's addicting.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Love the series & this book is great. I wish it had ended in a different way but see why it did. Can't stop thinking about it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OMG this game is amazing! I would create temple run 2958. But that's never going to happen. But still THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!!!
B0038NN3B4|2.0|First -<br />I was disapointed at the lack of thinking regarding the counting of base vegetables. The recipes show the net carbs which is great, but it is important to remember that NEW Atkins asks us to eat 12-15 base vegetable servings and this book does not take that in to account. When you cook a meal with Cooked Onions, or Bell Peppers, etc, those vegetables you will have to figure out from the serving size and track how they input into your base vegetables yourself. It adds a ton of work to figure this out.<br />Second -<br />The same is true with servings of Cheese, New Atkins has a maximum serving of Cheese, this book doesn't tally that anywhere.<br />Third -<br />The organization of the book was disappointing as well. It would be more helpful to group all of the Phase 1 recipes together, Phase 2, and so on. If you are in Phase 3 you know that you can use any in phase 2 or 1. If you are in Phase 2 you don't want to be looking at Phase 3 recipes. Which most of this book is Phase 3-4 recipes. So don't count on it if you are just starting out or trying to lose a lot of weight. This book is more for maintaining.<br />I apologize for the harsh critique, I think the NEW Atkins diet is amazing, and it works wonders for me. I think this book has a great first start and needs to take into consideration a few of the new things I've mentioned above. Or else maybe just break the book out into separate books for the different phases.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|George Martin has created an intriguing and entertaining universe in these stories.  For fans of the HBO adaptation of these stories, these book are a great read and provide much more insight that is possible on the the screen.
B001POX73C|5.0|One of the best of Heyer. Engaging characters, masterful plot development and very funny. It's structurally perfect and  a hoot.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Game is cool I really like how busy it is.All the different types of buildings. By the time your gonna be done you will have a huge city seems like it's gonna be fun.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|Can't review the film because unable to get it to stream well. Even though I have high speed internet. the streaming constantly stopped to buffer and finally locked up.  Only saw about 15 minutes of film before I gave up and turn it off
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|What a nice surprize - a few days off and a new Fire Maple game. This is my favorite type of game. Basically it involves wandering around a very well drawn landscape and interiors at my own pace solving puzzles when I feel like it. My job is deadline driven so that is the last thing I want for a game. The puzzles are interesting but not impossibly difficult - again this is for my relaxation not my job. The graphics are well done and interesting, fun to wander around and explore. The games relate to the story line and are not just arbitrary. I was easily able to lose myself in the game world.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book was a good read for this genre with a solid premise, I.e., how well do we really know our spouses? I always enjoy story lines involving what appear to be unrelated characters who wind up having common threads that bring them together. The author tells the story quite well and does a good job creating characters who generate ranges of responsive feelings in the reader.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very interesting. The history is well laid out (though it can feel a little long at times). And the personal story is very engaging. Well done.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Without giving anything away, I'll just say that this really did a nice job tying up the series. I'm shedding tears to be done with it. Beautiful story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the fact the cards &#34;snap&#34; into place.  So much easier than actually dragging them into place, although you can do that too.  You can choose different versions - random, winning version (maybe 50% of the time - you still have to make the right choices).  You can play this against other people, but I haven't figured that part out, nor do I care.  It's a great way to pass time when waiting for an appointment, etc.  I tried other versions, and this is my favorite.  Can deal either left hand or right hand.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic really deliver in the dramedy. It's a great show with great writing. You'll love it!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Exactly what I wanted. Nice collection of all four films. Slim packaging also makes this a nice replacement for my DVDs.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Amazing tale of a woman seeking redemption through the challenge of a life by taking on the Pacific Coast Trail and the story of her life that lead her to that point.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I founds this to be an addictive read with Interesting plot twists, intriguing characters, and it to be a keeper for my library and to share with my friends
B009BDVD2Q|4.0|I am not a Stephen King reader but I really enjoyed reading this.  Good intro to his personal background and also very good help for readers and writers both.  Worth the purchase.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|My daughter loves Ariana.<br />She is happy to got it.<br />She is listening that cd everyday.<br />i am very happy too.<br />I recomend  it to all kids.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This is an interesting story, but not at all believable.  Wish it was, because the characters were well drawn.<br />The main character is full of layers of mystery, but just not credible.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|I've been a nurse for almost thirty years.  There were very few surprises in the narrative; most of the problems the author discusses are well known to me.<br /><br />However, the author's engaging style well explains the very real problems with how the pharmaceutical industry works:  the &#34;me too&#34; market, the development of drugs that are no better than what we had before and are in some cases worse, of drug trials where data is suppressed or spun to give the favored result.<br /><br />The author isn't simply bashing the pharmaceutical industry.  He acknowledges that we need new medications, that we have developed some good alternatives for patients who need them.  What he argues against are the ingrained self interest of company owners who spend twice as much on marketing as they do R&D, of physicians with ties to the industry who take freebies and goodies in exchange for promoting a product they don't really know is better or worse than what was previously available, of the lack of disclosure of negative studies, and the lack of teeth on the part of the FDA and European counterparts in keeping the industry honest and protecting patients.<br /><br />The inescapable conclusion is that the industry needs major reform to protect the public . . . and it doesn't have to mean putting the industry out of business.<br /><br />Sunshine is the best disinfectant.
B00EVCD9HY|4.0|Having Prince touch a project automatically enhances it to an engaging, listenable record.  Miss Janelle, already a formidable force,  should finally get over the top commercially, and become a national fixture for years to come.  Guitar solo on primetime is overly long and self indulgent,  but how many times did Prince leave us hangin' in the 90's?  He owes us more of that.  Please guest-shred till you can do it no longer.
1595825045|5.0|I don't often buy &#34;Art of&#34; books, but I love the Last Airbender series so much I just had to have it.  It's full of tidbits about the creation of my favorite animated series, with stellar examples of artwork.  If you are an art fan, and an Avatar fan, this book is a must have.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Not bad at all.  Great animation on the horse!<br />I'm glad I got this app.  Playing on a Samsung Galaxy S4.

B00C7607FS|5.0|I grew up on Little Mermaid, and now i am a mother of two young children. I wish more young children movies were made like the ones i grew up with. I believe today's shows for children are to violent, but as always the Disney classics are the best just a shame that they are the most expensive to purchase.

B0012QRPU4|5.0|For so long i heard about the Breaking Bad craze, but i never jumped on it. Now, i feel like kicking myself. I had to watch this episode for a class that i am taking in Media and i fell in love with the series. Now, i just have to buy the rest of them.<br /><br />It's a shame so many good shows leave TV and crappy ones take their place.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I chose this rating because I had listened to the other 2 seasons, and enjoyed all the characters and their problems and how the author keeps you interested in everyone.  I was extremely disappointed that the next season doesn't continue until Jan.
1612680011|1.0|I was actually a little shocked by this book--I couldn't believe that a book this poorly written and conceived was such a best seller. It is so transparently geared to pandering to various wish fulfillment fantasies that it doesn't even seem insulting to the reader, just silly. He spends most of the time incoherently spouting off about how much money he has made through various real estate speculation schemes, while throwing in helping nuggets such as encouraging people to destroy their credit ratings by paying their bills late (neglecting to remind his seemingly endlessly gullible readers that doing so will make their cost of credit much higher).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|First I got my app Candy Crush. Will this be a good app I wondered.The next thing I knew was when I saw I was on level 13!I showed Justin,James,and Michael they loved that app so much they showed my darling daughter Katie. She beat a few levels and said mommy how did you find this app?I showed her and Katie added it to her IPad. It was free so I let her buy it. now after 5min. of having it she is on level 20!I don't like it because it takes thirty minutes to get a life. But I gave it 5stars.If you love this app you should get Doodle Jump. It is free also.
B007T8BYWE|3.0|NOT AS GOOD AS FLIPPIX ART, TOO EASY , HAD THIS COMPLETED IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. GREAT FOR KIDS THOUGH

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I didn't care for the constant back & forth every chapter, to tell a different main characters story. I found it too confusing  I felt the book needed more continuity, though it was well written.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The app is fun but is gets you so hooked that you want to vomit in your mom's mouth. Or you dad's.
0744014956|5.0|great timing also the, shiped as promised with carefully packed. Can't wait to read this strategy guide and add it to my collection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is just what I needed. its just the right amount of brain power needed to play a good work-out for the mind. and clean fun for all ages
B00821OX98|4.0|Takes too long to get anywhere in the plot. And there is too much emotion. Seems very unrealistic that an advanced race destroyed most of the world, but can't find 300 humans a few miles away from one of their bases
B003G4W49C|5.0|A great story that is beautifully told. There are so many layers to this story but even at the surface it is a gripping tale.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It offers many different types of weather info to help in planning my day/week. But it is not as extensive or as visually pleasing a site as Yahoo Weather.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in the last Decade! Reminds me of the good times I had as a teen in the 70's watching great movies like \\"Jaws\\". This was the most thrilling suspense filled movie I have seen in years! MUST BEEN SEEN IN IMAX 3D!! When IMAX says, \\"Experience\\", Gravity is not just a movie, it is an \\"Experience\\". I loved the fact that the movie stayed true to it's title without you even realizing it. I'm not a scientist so I'm not going to care about nit picking about what is or is not scientifically true or not in this awesome movie. All I know is it wasn't some Sci-Fi fake make believe 2001 A Space movie that makes you question anything, or even Star Wars or Star Trek. I like those movies as well but leaving the fantasy World alone, this movie was truly a spectacular in movie making history. Sandra Bullock & George Clooney both did an excellent acting job and were casted perfectly in my opinion. This movie was totally unique unlike anything I ever \\"experienced\\" before at the movies. BRAVO IMAX you've finally done it!! Cant' wait to get this on Blu-Ray 3D for viewing at home. This movie is the reason I am finally buying my first ever 3D glasses and system for my TV. It probably won't be as great on my TV as IMAX I'm sure, but I also seen it twice now and the Real 3D, although not as great as IMAX is still decent enough and worth watching this great movie in.  I hope on DVD this is released in IMAX 3D format and also the original aspect ratio both for 3D viewing. Anyways, I've heard people complain that IMAX 3D movies are too pricey and too expensive, and sometimes I would agree with that, but GRAVITY IN IMAX 3D is WORTH EVERY PENNY AND EVERY MINUTE!
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|The whole family loved it.  My husband and I are grandparents.  We loved watching it with the grandkids.  It was a delightful story.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|A very good book and an exceptional diet!  In my first 3 weeks I lost 8 lbs AND my desire to quit.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I FOUND HAVING THE BIBLE ON MY KINDLE MADE READING AND GETTING INTO GODS WORD SO MUCH MORE CONVENIENT.  I WAS BLESSED BY THE ENTIRE BOOK. YOU WILL TOO.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Not too bad.  Better in 3d but I was not disappointed over anything except for having to look at Brad Pitt
098555780X|4.0|Have enjoyed the book.  Very helpfull pitchers showing how to do the projects. Lot of fun ideas.  Good even for a beginner.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This charger is great.  The charger came on time, and it works great. We really needed an extra charger for my son's kindle.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! So happy that is now available on Kindle Fire HD :) My kids love playing it also.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Maybe it was me but I could not find the instructions to the game anywhere, therefore I could not play it.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Written by a young girl with an old soul,  this book opens your eyes to other parts of the world, makes you happy for the stability and freedoms we often take for granted, and sends a powerful message!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What I have played so far, I have to say I LOVE THIS GAME!! It makes you think. It is challenging, NOT impossible but certainly challenging. And if you do get really stuck and need help there are hints available.<br /><br />This is a wonderful game in which you actually need to think! Most games I have found which are app based (on Facebook, on cell phones, on tablets, Kindle, etc) are basically mind numbing time killers, but not so with The Room. You need to think, and use your powers of problem solving to discover the answers to these tantalizingly intricate, and layered puzzles.<br /><br />This is not a hidden object game. The you are not going to play this like so many other app based games where you just sit there and only pay partial attention because you're bored.<br /><br />If you played the Myst games, or Undieing from Clive Barker and enjoyed them then this is a game for you. As if the fact that this is a very well thought out and executed game for intellectuals was not enough to make this extremely enjoyable the graphics are just as well put together. The Room utilizes just about the full range of motion available when you move the view by dragging your finger on the screen, tapping on the screen, pinching for zoom in/out, AND the tilting the kindle (for some puzzles).<br /><br />So download it and get started, this is one game you won't regret buying!
B00280LYHS|4.0|Best one yet! I was afraid that the action started too fast to sustain my attention... but it was riveting to the end.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|An excellent, extremely well researched read. This book is the result of research at three institutions of higher education.  You will find this to be a truly exceptional learning experience.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This was a nice romance...it's always good to see a man tend to his woman and cherish her....that is refreshing...
B0089LOG02|5.0|The characters break your heart, give you hope, and make you believe that we are all on a journey to learn who we are.  I fell in love with the characters and admired their perseverance through all the trials of their lives.  It goes full circle and draws together all the characters lives. Loved it!<br />Kathy, Tucson, AZ
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I waited so long for this game to come to Kindle Fire, I love it. Next time a new game comes out, please don't wait so long to get it on Kindle Fire. A few of my friends said it's old now.
