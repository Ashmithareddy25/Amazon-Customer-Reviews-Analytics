B00BIK3FAI|5.0|This is a great story. I loved poking around to find all the secrets. It was well worth the money. My kids loved it too! ;)
B000UJ48WC|5.0|I have little to add to the many wonderfully informed reviews of this movie. The arguing about aspect ratio seems like pedantic, technical showing off--look, you're watching it at home so there are a lot of things that differ from the theatrical screening--crucially, the loss of sharing a communal dream (nightmare?) when seeing it with an audience of strangers. It's true that Kubrick, the prodigy photographer, is always using color & composition to establish mood & meaning. But very little of that is lost at the edges, especially in the Blu-ray version (which is almost too sharply defined for my taste; some of the effects look like computer graphics, which they--considering the year of release--of course are not). Interestingly, the movie has gained in reputation among cinephiles since its release, very much in the way BARRY LYNDON has. The basic disagreement here is the ongoing basic disagreement about Kubrick. For those who find him cold & cerebral, this will support those views. He's not warm & fuzzy--especially in THE SHINING. It's a cold movie, full of cold, empty rooms & corridors. And there are those, like Pauline Kael, who will never forgive Kubrick for moving to England. But THE SHINING is a classic--despite my Jack Nicholson problem. (One reviewer--TIME OUT, I think--has a point; Nicholson switches into Looney Tunes manic mode a little too quickly.) Don't watch this if you don't like Kubrick's stylized way of working. And don't watch it if you expect a true horror movie, based on the novel. Or if you have a phobia for frozen mazes.<br />For the rest of us, it's terrific!

B0016CTX68|5.0|IMHO this album along with Sticky Fingers is the pinnacle of The Stones music. Just about every song is a classic. If you're a Stones fan your collection must have Midnight Rambler, You Can't Always Get What You Want,  Let It Bleed, Gimme Shelter, what am I saying? You must have all the songs on Let it Bleed.<br /><br />Get this album and Sticky Fingers and you'll be rocking it old school.

0374214913|4.0|While on Amazon I came across Robin Sloan's Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. I read the short description of the book and I was instantly hooked when the book was revealed to be set in San Francisco. As a native San Franciscan, I'm always interested in how an author or artist decides to depict the city. I was about to pre-purchase the electronic version of the book when I was informed the jacket of the book was GLOW-IN-THE-DARK!! I probably shelled out an extra $10 for this added bonus, but glow-in-the-dark - like your low-top Chucks - does not go out of style.<br /><br />Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore centers on underemployed protagonist Clay Jannon and his journey to unlocking the Founder's Puzzle. Clay is employed at a 24-hour bookstore managed by the well-natured Mr. Penumbra, but his bookstore is no ordinary bookstore. The two-leveled store is stocked with peculiar books (referred to as the Waybacklist) that to the ordinary eye appear to be written in code. The patrons of the bookstore are equally peculiar as they never purchase, but rather borrow books from the Waybacklist.<br /><br />I loved the book mainly because I found Sloan's depiction of the setting of San Francisco/Bay Area and New York to be incredibly rich in detail. I thought he captured the spirit of both cities with justice. His characters were relatable, especially for those who are in the transition period of their life of establishing a career for themselves. Clay in particular lost his job at a start-up doing graphic design and was relegated to working at a bookstore, albeit a wonderfully mysterious one. He's like so many young adults who are \\"underemployed.\\" And the depiction of friendship in the book was wonderfully crafted. I found myself reminiscing about memories I share with my very best friend and the things we geeked out to and still do (I always thought Super Nintendo was the best gaming system). I also thought the title was appropriate as there must be some mystery surrounding a 24-hour bookstore, as well as the book club associated with it. Overall, I thought everything in this book was just a well-packaged puzzle for me.4-hour bookstore, as well as the book club associated with it.

B000I8JEY2|3.0|This action comedy I just watched for the first time since it was in theatres.  I rememebed rolling with laughter.  It is still funny in parts to this day.  However, nothing is ever funny about murder, and the light regard that most movies gives to this subject always brings me down.  I have learned to adjust to modern cinema.  That being said, it was still the action ridden fun that I remembered.  Also it is no Beverly Hills Cop.  Which paved the way for the genre, and has never been surpassed.
1594488886|5.0|I was so captivated and so occupied while I was reading the story. There came several moments when I became very sad myself and tears welled up.

0316223239|4.0|Emma Donoghue's seventh addition to her literary career comes in the form of Room, a very disconcerting story that, roughly half-way through, finds its teeth and truly digs into the emotional well each of us is rumored to have. The story revolves around a young boy named Jack, his mother, and the \\"room\\" they are forced to share. Told through the eyes of five-year-old Jack, Room is a fascinating glimpse into the psyche of a young, highly intelligent mind whose life knows only the confines of the eleven-by-eleven space he was born in. And, as the story progresses, it becomes infinitely more interesting as he experiences for the first time many of the things we often take for granted.<br /><br />The story unfortunately kicks off with a slow start. Because the narrator's voice is that of a five-year-old, there is plenty of repetition - sometimes to an excess. And after reading roughly three chapters of his often pointless musings, I grew bored and put the book down for a few days. Donoghue's dedication to realism in terms of speech patterns and children's observations is commendable, but at times, as I read, I felt as though I were a parent trying to tune out the voice of a ceaseless child. And as paragraphs floated by and my mind began to wander past the page, I realized that I was tuning him out as I read. This changes, luckily, around the middle of the novel when explosive events occur that catapult Jack into a brave new world he thought was a fairy-tale, effectively throwing the routine that he bludgeons readers with out the window. And it is at this point that the book becomes increasingly difficult to put down as Jack comes face to face with the mundane, yet experiences it as a frightening new reality, far from anything he's ever known. This glimpse into what could be considered a \\"damaged psyche\\" is where Donoghue shines, throwing into the spotlight the intensity of fear and of relationships forged in pain and forgiveness. And as the story sweeps us along with Jack from situation to situation, we are given a beautiful opportunity to re-experience many of the things we don't actively consider as we wander about from day to day. This opportunity for an innocent glimpse at our world makes the book worth reading.<br /><br />In essence, despite a slow and monotonous meandering in its beginning, Room definitely grows on you once the \\"world\\" is introduced to the ever inquiring Jack. And as Jack works toward an understanding of his new reality, so too are readers given the opportunity to be re-introduced to the world in which they know so well, making Room a fascinating read for anyone with an inquisitive nature.ck from situation to situation, we are given a beautiful opportunity to re-experience many of the things we don't actively consider as we wander about from day to day.

B00004T9VY|5.0|(NOTE for anyone who wants to give a negative review: please leave a comment to help me do better next time.)<br /><br />Simply put, this is one of the best albums of the Love Generation, and in fact one of the most beautiful of all time: full of real emotion, wonderfully sung and played, and heart-achingly expressed. Though this may seem cloying to the uninitiated, I still remember where I was the first time I heard this album, and the way each song made me feel upon hearing it. It's that type of music.<br /><br />Before I begin, though, I want to make two biographical notes:<br /><br />1. Though he now goes by Yusuf Islam, I think of him as Cat Stevens. I don't want to make this review about his politics, though there are those who will go no further than saying, \\"I heard something about his being an angry Muslim.\\" Indeed, there could be nothing further from the truth said about this peaceful, emotive man. In the interest of brevity let me say this one thing: I hate hatred, and I do not believe Cat Stevens was treated fairly back then...when the Salmon Rushdie incident occurred. He was asked a question, and he answered it. I'll say more if anyone wants to hear it, but 'nuf for now.<br /><br />2. It's important to note that while Stevens was extremely well known in Europe by this time, particularly in England, and was considered a young, handsome Pop Star, he was virtually unknown in the US.  Here, \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" marked not only a great commercial breakthrough, it also signalled a spiritual stepping stone. He had only just recently recovered from a severe medical condition, and the album's deep spiritual essence marked his reassessment of what fame -- and life -- was about.<br /><br />In the interest of SOME brevity, I will offer highlights:<br /><br />The first song of this breakthrough album  (in the US) is the More-than-Environmentally-Minded \\"Where Do the Children Play?\\" From its beautifully tender opening guitar work to its last resonant chords, \\"Where?\\" hits on so many cylinders: environment, big government, bureaucracy...it questions what choices we're making as we advance: \\"Well you've cracked the sky, scrapers fill the air/But will you keep on building higher till there's no more room up there/Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?/Will you tell us when to live, will you tell us when to die?\\" In his beautifully rendered deep, emotive voice, his titular question asks us where we are, and what we are leaving others to inherit.<br /><br />After his hit song \\"Hard-Headed Woman,\\" which expressed his need for a strong partner -- \\"one who will make me do my best\\" -- there is \\"Wild World,\\" his plaintive ballad of love lost. Patti D'Arbanville -- for whom he had already written \\"Lady D'Arbanville\\" -- was a noteworthy Flower Child of the 60's who captured more than one heart. But this song is a plea that only those who have experienced being let go can truly understand. Here he does not just lament her passing; he begs her to understand what the world will do to her without him, hoping against hope she will return.<br /><br />After the similarly heartfelt \\"Sad Lisa,\\" Stevens sang the beautiful \\"Miles from Nowhere,\\" expressing perhaps even more clearly than his opening song the singer's quest for some kind of spiritual truth: \\"Lord, my body/Has been a good friend,/But I won't need it/When I reach the end.\\" As said earlier, he'd been reassessing his life following a bout of tuberculosis, and this song was one of those which marked his journey.  It's relatively simple in the beginning: guitar on piano.  But it's what he does with this that matters: there's a slight, almost imperceptible background chorus in key moments, and some drums, but the rest is done through his voice and piano.  It's really a testament to the power of his soulful, deep voice that this song has such power and resonance.<br /><br />\\"But I Might Die Tonight\\" is short though anything but diminutive. It too does a lot with a little, and is oncemore a testament of spiritual essence and anti-conformity, as always expressed well through his powerfully deep voice. The harmony line is a good indicator of his upper range as well.<br /><br />\\"Longer Boats\\" is a calypso with a Caribbean-sounding sound, with soft bongos and beautiful vocal harmonies.  Here, I must be frank and say I've always been puzzled by its lyrics - in a good way: \\"I don't want no God on my lawn/Just a flower I can help along;/'Cause the soul of no body knows/How a flower grows, oh how a flower grows.\\"  I believe it to be a song about false icons and the danger of equating increased material goods with true progress, though I am not sure.  Regardless, it's beautifully accomplished.<br /><br />Following \\"Longer Boats\\" are \\"Into White\\" -- a beautiful, slow, melodic consideration of our eventual encounter with death -- and \\"On the Road to Find Out,\\" a song that probably sums the entire album up on six words.  It's a sweetly sung passage song that tells the story of the singer's \\"hit(ting) the rowdy road\\" only to find out \\"the answer lies within.\\"  And to his credit Stevens does not tell us which religion is \\"best,\\" but only to \\"Kick out the devil's sin and pick up a Good Book.\\"<br /><br />Then, the absolutely transformative \\"Fathers and Sons.\\"  There are simply no words that can express how wonderful this song is, how beautifully it captures the eternal struggle between generations, the need of the elder to impart wisdom and the need of the younger to ignore it and strike out on their own...the 60s in a nutshell.  It is a wonder: Stevens' ability to convey the two combatants through his lower and upper register is powerfully accomplished, and his twin guitar background is perfectly expressive of that dichotomy.  In addition, one part is sung OVER the other, and the combination is stunning...simply stunning.<br /><br />And then, closing the album is the truly dazzling title song, and a mere minute at that.  Like the Beatles' \\"Her Majesty\\" (at the end of [[ASIN:B002TVBU1Q Abbey Road]]) each is a short counterpart to an absolute masterwork, but unlike Her Majesty,\\" \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" is no mere castoff tacked onto the end as a counterpoint.  \\"Tea\\" seems to be a quiet little doggerel that lures you into thinking just that until it SNAPS you to attention with an astoundingly brief but powerfully sung choral ending of -- get this -- THREE SHORT SYLLABLES.<br /><br />Then Poof! The album is over.<br /><br />If you have never heard this album, do so, and please, put on a set of earphones and make sure you allow yourself time to adequately listen without interruption.  You will be, as the saying goes, truly richer for the experience.more a testament of spiritual essence and anti-conformity, as always expressed well through his powerfully deep voice.

As others have said, it only prints a test page but that's all you need to see if it will work.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I got almost half way through and just couldn't force myself to continue reading.  Not only was it not engaging me, the story just was boring in my opinion. It wasn't just the political nature of the book that turned me off, it just seemed to not have a clear plot--rather lots of reactions to one person's death and nothing compelling to keep me interested about the dead person and things people were discovering after his death.  Maybe if I had kept reading, but I felt like I had given up too much time without feeling engaged in the book at all.  If Rowling hadn't written it I would have given up far sooner (I didn't expect or want another Harry Potter-type book), but I have such respect for her past writing that I keep reading expecting the story to develop and it never did.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am impressed with this book. First I have been reading a lot of short books at this price point lately so I was pleasantly surprised as to the length of this book. It is a good bang for your buck. I was also concerned that since it was mostly about one dude stranded on Mars there would not be very much dialogue, which is typically my favorite part about any book. That also was not an issue because the main characters thought processes are well laid out and fun to read in the book. Finally I like that this book is so real. This is exactly how an even like this could happen, and the author really thought out the logistics of a full set of Mars missions.

B005LAIHPE|1.0|After seeing \\"Battleship,\\" the first thing I did was check IMDB to see if Michael Bay had directed, produced or written this lump of steaming, festering tripe.<br /><br />No, apparently Bay has fanboys who aspire to make the same kind of movies -- monstrous, overblown explosionfests that borderline fetishize the American military. Peter Berg isn't QUITE as bad as Bay, but that's like saying that a punch to the gut is less painful than a kick in the crotch. It may not be the worst, but you might still get serious damage.<br /><br />Our story follows slacker Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch), who robs a convenience store and gets tased by the police. Why? Because Sam Shane (Brooklyn Decker), daughter of Navy Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson), wanted a chicken burrito, and he was trying to impress the bimbo. Sadly, it works.<br /><br />His brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgård) forces him to go into the Navy to get his life together, where Alex continues screwing up. In fact, he screws up so badly after a soccer game against the Japanese navy that Admiral Shane plans to kick him out. But for some reason, they allow him to command a ship in the RIMPAC, presumably so he can continue to embarrass the United States in front of the whole world.<br /><br />But the RIMPAC is interrupted when a group of alien ships arrive on Earth -- and suddenly Hawaii is sealed off by a giant forcefield, with only a few ships on the inside. And after his brother's ship is destroyed, Alex suddenly finds himself in command -- and must find a way to destroy the alien ships before a full-scale invasion can attack Earth.<br /><br />First, some faint praise. \\"Battleship\\" is not QUITE a bad as a Michael Bay movie, mainly because it doesn't have the blatant sexism and racism. And while Bay practically fetishizes the American military, director Peter Berg seems to have genuine admiration for our soldiers -- consider a moving subplot about a double-amputee soldier who fights the aliens despite his disability. Or the elderly veterans who appear to help destroy the alien ships.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />Everything else is Michael Bay fanfiction. Unfunny comic relief, idiotic dialogue (\\"He said we ain't alone. He said one day, either we'd find them, or they'd find us\\"), and prolonged scenes that are nothing but explosion after explosion after explosion. And in case you're wondering, the titular Battleship does not even appear until almost two hours into the movie.<br /><br />It also has the most pathetic aliens in film history. They look pretty cool when they have their helmets on, but underneath they're grunting goat/ape hybrids, and they invaded a planet that they cannot tolerate. Oh, and their spaceships are so fragile that they fragment when they hit a stationary satellite, and they have easily-shattered GLASS for windows.<br /><br />And for some reason, Berg seems to believe that the Japanese and Americans working together is somehow surprising... even though the countries have been allies for decades. But hey, it briefly allows a COMPETENT commander to take over the American warship.<br /><br />When elderly, real-life Navy veterans are able to out-act a cast of actual actors... you're in trouble.  Taylor Kitsch's Alex is possibly the least likable \\"hero\\" I have ever seen in a movie -- he's a hotheaded, selfish child-man who values his own revenge over the life of his crew. The only reason he ever succeeds at ANYTHING is because other people implement his ideas.<br /><br />Pop singer Rihanna has the acting talents of a log, and Liam Neeson's contemptuous (and brief) performance practically screams, \\"I'm just doing this for the money, so please leave me alone.\\" Actually, there is only one likable character in this whole mess: Tadanobu Asano as a Japanese naval captain who is competent, cool and smart. When he briefly replaces Kitsch as captain, nobody utters a peep of protest.<br /><br />\\"Battleship\\" should have replaced the last letter with a T. Despite the respect it shows America's veterans, it's a Michael-Bay-style eruption of pure ineptitude -- so ignore this mess unless you have a lot of booze and friends who like to riff bad movies.t shows America's veterans, it's a Michael-Bay-style eruption of pure ineptitude -- so ignore this mess unless you have a lot of booze and friends who like to riff bad movies.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|A Movie to give us hope in a world that tends to lose hope. Recommend for Child and adult. Unbelievable !!
B004KZOXJA|4.0|This book is about being free to choose: to shape our own destinies. It celebrates our human- ness, and our ability to be led by our hearts. a book of resistance, of revolution, and of love.
B0000VD04M|4.0|This is a Tim Burton movie about an eccentric B-movie director who loved to wear women's clothing and is now famous for making some of the WORST movies of all time. This movie is weirdness incarnate, luckily it works out very well. All of the performances are stellar, and most importantly Johnny Depp's performance as Ed Wood is amazing and manages to carry the whole movie. His inspiring enthusiasm and quirky attitude are a marvel to watch. Also, while the rest of the cast is good, Johnny Depp is almost overshadowed by Martin Landau in an absolutely STUNNING performance as Bella Lugosi. The story is great. The acting and writing is engaging, and the set design and deliberate black-and-white color scheme for the whole movie give it a very unique flavor and shows a lot of respect for the black-and-white movies of the 50's. This is easily my favorite Tim Burton movie, and a really good movie overall that I think everyone should watch. Definitely worth picking up.

1881273156|5.0|This books gives wonderful insights why relationships work, or don't.  I learned the reasons why my husband and I are so compatable -- and we didn't even know before!  It helped solidify our relationship even more.  It would be such a help to people while they are dating, if they are having problems, and before deciding to get more serious.  The chapters on chlldren and what love language pertains to them can certainly help with parent/child relationships.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Not at All user friendly nor intuitive.never saw how to search. Just not what I want in a mobile lap
B00CFEJ6RC|5.0|I love this show. I have been a huge fan of the novels and the movies and was thrilled upon discovering that they were making this show. All of the actors are splendid and have done a wonderful job bringing the characters to life. The storylines are gripping, creative, intelligent, and suspenseful. This show is one of the shows that you will either love or hate. I do not recommend it for the faint of heart, or for those who are easily offended. This show is about serial killers/murderers and it is graphic, violent, and contains macabre scenes. In short, this is definitely worth watching.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|GReat book. I liked it better than the movie.<br />Really made me stop & think again about some issues, especially spiritual issues.

B005HEFB6M|5.0|I've always been a die hard &#34;Next Gen...&#34; Fan, and still am.  It took me years to get past my predisposition that I would never like this &#34;me too&#34; version of ST.  I finally gave it a chance and started watching from ep1season1.  In the beginning I spend most of my veiwing time and experience identifying all of the things about it, that supported my original opinion, that it sucks and was made for kids without a clue about anything...not for me. About half way through the season, I realized that I couldn't stop myself from enjoying it, and was ready for the next episode.  By the end of the Season 1, I had totally change my opinion of the series, and even found myself &#34;selling&#34; the series to my brother who was a next gen'r like me.  It's funny hearing my old opinions for this series coming from my brother...he still can't bring himself to try it....yet.  The only thing I recommend is that you have a entire season on hand when you start...I would have never caught the &#34;Enterprise&#34; bug viewing individual episodes via normal tv programing; commercials are like hot coals on my brain...  Now, I wish the series would have been as long as Next Gen.  I feel in Love with T'Pal.  Another great Star Trek Production!
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|To be honest, I don't remember receiving this particular book, but did receive the others written by L. Alcott. I need to go through my purchases since it might have gotten misplaced.<br /><br />I rated it as a five star since there wasn't an applicable option.
B00355ORFG|4.0|This is a great album. I ordered it though, thinking I would see some of the concert tour footage. This isn't so.<br /><br />Basically what is on the DVD is 2 videos (Bigger and Straight through my Heart) and the other stuff is promo stuff the boys did while in Tokyo, appearances etc sort of like  the (100 hour Around the world tour) promo tour they did.<br /><br />It was disappointing to me in that regard. I thought I was getting something new.<br /><br /> I had purchased the Special Edition of \\"This is Us\\" as well. In addition, I also bought \\"Live in London\\".  In short, I wasted money because these 3 items are the same thing pretty much. There is not enough difference between them in my opinion for them to be sold as different items.<br /><br />The Special Edition includes some of the Live in London footage.<br /><br />The sound quality is also poor and tinny at times. The image of Bob Marley on Aj's shirt is also censored VERY obviously which is annoying.<br /><br />COMPARE before you buy.

B00006CXSS|5.0|got it on sale for 30. Amazing buy that I'll be showing my US History classes for years to come.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I liked this book, but did not love it... I found some of the theories and observations interesting, but I was looking for more on the way of practical applications.  The basic advice came down to, \\"pretend to be an extrovert, and allow yourself some down time.\\"<br /><br />Maybe I am just to old, as I pretty much do that intuitively.  The advice concerning dealing with your children may be helpful, but was not relevant to me.<br /><br />Overall, worth a read if you are an introvert, or know one.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|I should of read the reviews first before paying the $1 for a game that I could not even download and now that I did read the reviews I am glade I could not download it cause it appears that it screws up your kindle which would of upset me since I use it daily.

B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved the book it was very adventures and fun to read. I think it is best for 9&10  years because it can get confusing as you read on. Other whys great book.
B001STY9Y0|5.0|Although at the time of it's release it wasn't that well received by the public, I guess we were expecting another 'Creep' hit. But I think this is a very good album with what are now classic Radiohead tunes like 'Just', 'Fake Plastic Trees&#34; and my favorite  'High and Dry'. Clearly this album showed just how good a band Radiohead was destined to become.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Right up there with Six Feet Under, this has got to be one of the best dark television shows ever created.  Growing up watching Tales of the Crypt has really turned me toward darker themed tv.  This fits right in and it's really well thought out.  A lot of shows in this genre go straight for the scare instead of building up a story line.  The story here is strong and excellently acted.  The basis of the show is a terrific house in LA.  For some odd reason no one ever wants to buy it, so this family from out of town moves in without knowing that everyone who lives there eventually dies in the house.  And the story unfolds.. I love that the show criss crosses in time periods and sometimes they overlap REALLY seamlessly.<br /><br />Some of the best acting in the show of course if from Jessica Lange, as the nosy/slightly wicked neighbor.  I love how the show really became unpredictable and there were a few moments where I was positive I knew what was going to happen, but NO, wrong.  I almost stopped watching because the first episode didn't catch my interest, I thought it would be the same stuff that's on TV every night, clearly I was wrong.  I hate the same shows with the same scenarios playing out everyday of the week, back to back and this is the perfect solution: American Horror Story.
B002HJ5WZ0|5.0|This album was recorded at the same time as Kid A.  This group has so much high quality material it is almost unbelievable.  I like musicians who push limits and are willing to take chances and Radiohead delivers on both counts.
B00881VLCE|5.0|the puzzles were so beautiful and so is the music.  VERY beautiful and so very very VERY insporatinal I love it.
B000002GFT|5.0|This recording from 1967 is as fresh and exciting today as ir was when it was first released. Sandy Denny had the voice of an angel. Her untimely death at age 30 was a real tragedy. But at least she left us with this magnificent album.

The bonus disc is just icing on the cake.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I so wish more artist would put out music like this, I would buy it in a heartbeat! I'm a huge jazz fan and when I saw Emmy sing on a TV show I was like yep I have to buy that album. Trust me you won't be disappointed. Sentimental Journey and Things are my favorite track. If you're a classic jazz or a modern jazz fan either one I definitely recommend this CD. Her lovely voice definitely does these classics justice.
B003Y3GTQE|5.0|Full disclosure, I didn't buy these on Amazon. I got them from Bass Pro after someone gave me a gift card. But, they are literally SO AWESOME that I feel compelled to brag about them here.<br /><br />These went through the test of being worn literally every single day for six weeks in 90 degree heat, walking up and down hills, being rained on, and having various art materials spilled on them. I was an intern at an art retreat in the mountains :)<br /><br />Not only did the shoes survive, so did my feet! They are sooooooo comfortable and supportive, and very easy to clean. Also, they are stylish looking! They go with shorts, skirts, jeans, even your swimsuit. I have never found a better sandal and am totally in love with these shoes.<br /><br />They did have to be broken in, which is odd for crocs. The thong of the shoe is initially a little stiff and rubs. But once I got past that stage (maybe a couple weeks of constant wear), they were good to go!<br /><br />They also, like all crocs I have ever had, run large. I'm usually a 7, but got these in a 6.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Very good book with somewhat of a surprise ending.  A real page turner even though it is an electronic page.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|my daughter wanted this movie...it came quickly and the price was less then in local box stores...we all enjoyed it!
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|The author seems to be writing on the defensive - if he mentions a location in the camp he will say \\"which is clearly visible from satellite footage\\" or he will say something like \\"I believe him and there is nobody to dispute the claim\\" or \\"similar stories have been confirmed by others\\".  It is like he is covering himself in the event the story turns out to be fabricated (like a Million Little Pieces I guess).  I'm sorry he felt that he had to do that because detracts from the story.  The author could have invested some more time in fleshing out Shin Dong's feelings. The only thing we know for sure was he was constantly hungry and lacked empathy - - I guess I wanted to know more about how Shin Dong felt in retrospect. For me, the writing didn't capture the triumph and trials this poor guy went through. He actually painted Shin Dong in an unsympathetic light...and that is hard to do considering what he went through.  I was hoping it would be as good as or better than Mao's Last Dancer:  [[ASIN:B004V3Q0NS Mao's Last Dancer Publisher: Berkley Trade]] but it wasn't.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|Seriously, it's amazing. I was worried I wouldn't like Tommy because I'm a big Roy Khan fan. However, his voice is very similar to Roy's at times, which is great because it still sounds like the same old Kamelot I've loved for years. However, this cd does seem a bit catchier and more mainstream than ones with Roy, but I still love it regardless. I highly recommend this cd. Songs like Song for Jolee give me chills, they're so amazing :)
B006RUJST6|5.0|When I saw this book I thought  it had to do with closing the door, out with old,in with the new. The saying God closes a door, opens a window. Had no idea what slamming was til I was enlighten by Will. I love when I actually learn something from what I read. There is so much mindlessness nowadays. That earned it 5 from me!

B009NQLT0M|5.0|I purchased this 40mm Noctua fan as an upgrade to replace a 35mm fan included with my Asus Z77 Sabertooth motherboard. The board comes with an alternate plastic attachment which allows users to install a 40mm behind the rear I/0.<br /><br />The fan produces next to no sound. At full speed (Approx 4300 RPMs), I must put my ear directly over the fan to detect any sort of noise. The noise I do detect is a faint but high pitched sound comparable to that of a mosquito's wings: innocuous at a distance of more than six inches.<br /><br />In comparison to generic 35mm fans I have two observations.<br /><br />First, unlike my 35mm fans from Asus, the 40mm Noctua does not seem to produce any motor or coil whine as I perceived it. The Z77 Sabertooth's stock fans produce a high pitched hum similar to an inexpensive RC Car. This humming is clearly heard at any RPM over my PC's other components.<br /><br />Second, the 40mm Noctua's cooling performance is unmistakably superior. In my opinion, the Noctua's high pressure is the primary factor contributing to its cooling success. Before installing the 40mm Noctua I ran tests recording temperatures at various locations on the Z77 Sabertooth. After comparing results, only VCCIO/VCCSA temperatures benefited from using the \\"Center Board\\". No cooling effect from the rear I/0 fan could be detected when using the included 35mm fan from Asus. I decided to remove and not replace the center board fan because it only supports a 35mm fan size of which I could find no silent alternatives. After installing the 40mm Noctua behind the rear I/0, the VCORE(Back) temperatures dropped 7 to 10 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the back panel of my computer case is now noticeably cooler to the touch when the CPU is pushed to full load.<br /><br />In conclusion, the 40mm Noctua fan is a great investment for my particular setup. The NF-A4x10 provides improved cooling performance to the most thermally stressed area of my Z77 Sabertooth. Because the 40mm Noctua produces no detectable sound, it eliminates a major flaw in the original product sold by Asus.roduces no detectable sound, it eliminates a major flaw in the original product sold by Asus.

B00821OX98|5.0|i thought this show was something a lil different and couldnt wait to see what would happen next excited to see more
B00280LYHS|5.0|I think it's book is out of the question, totally awesome! I love all books but this one closes the series very well.  I think I can make so many connections to it in what the main character is feeling and being around his age definitely helps. I love these type of books where there is so much of a deeper meaning than what is said. Although, it is about mythology and the gods, there are so many persons and morals that teens my age  can learn from. I can't wait to start reading Rick's next series, maybe it'll be as good as this one. I totally recommend this book and series.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is my favorite movie versions of Jane Austin's book of the same name because of its accuracy and great casting. Mind you, it's not perfectly true to the book; there are some minor changes and one more major one, but it works, and works well.<br /><br />The cast is phenomenal. It is a slow moving story, but deep with feeling.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|what a great book, this had me enthralled from the beginning, loved the fact it went back in time, and than to the present, got to relate to all characters,  would certainly recommend this book.  Very well written, this is my first book to read of Kate Morton and will read more of her books.
B00005JOA0|4.0|Except for some plot turns near the end, this is very accurate to the book, which is always important to me. It's a rather sad, even disturbing story about severe spousal abuse, so it is not a good story for children - though, it could be a good lesson for teenage girls.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|How does an individual find meaning in a society where the individual does not officially exist?  How to maintain sanity in a world where the rules are never really known?  I could not step away from the intensity, the sadness yet inevitability of tragedy from which no escape is possible.  Or is it?  This is a book I will never forget.  Nor will I forget those for whom this reality is daily life today
B00AO7HQ06|4.0|Long lasting and very aromatic.  If you like candles you will like this one.  Love the look also. Great deal.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It was fascinating reading. Could not put it down. There was some &#34;govermental&#34; stuff that a person might not understand if they had not worked for the government. But there were lots of military things in it that I did not understand and there was a sequence of events that was totally beyond me except that, whatever it was, it must have been really gross. I even had my husband ask my &#34;Army&#34; son what it was about and my son would not even tell my husband what it was and could not believe his mother (me) was reading a book that had something like that in it. Never did find out - but no longer want. But very thankful for these guys and all the veterans throughout the country that have given so much for our country!

B000A2UBN4|5.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this remake of the 1962 original...<br /><br />Cape Fear (1991) is an excellent remake of the original classic from 1962 starring Gregory Peck.  This remake stars Robert De Niro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis, and Joe Don Baker.  Every actor gives a great performance, but especially De Niro, Lewis, and Nolte.  I saw this movie in the theater when it came out and found it terrifying, suspenseful, and very much on the dark side.  I think this is one of De Niros' best performances in his long career.<br /><br />This is one of the few movie remakes that stands strong to the original.  I highly recommend it.
B000002513|5.0|If you thought Springsteen began his career in the 80's with songs like &#34;Born in the USA&#34;, you need to listen to the music on this CD. The energy and talent of each musician is evident (Bruce played ALL guitars), and I wish I knew what happened to some of them. Yes, the current E Street Band musicians are incredible, but there was a rawness and originality in Bruce's early work that can't be replicated. This music always lifts my spirits.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you are a SW fan, this is a must have! Not only will the quality you get from the HD Blu-Ray will take the movies to a far away galaxy and blow you away, but also the added special features will make finish the Kessel run faster than the 18-parsec record.<br /><br />Of course, the movies are a classic you just need to have in your movie collection, but knowing SW is a Sci-fi story, you will love it on HD.
076781326X|5.0|This is in my top 3 list of favorite musicals of all time. I had such a crush on the Artful Dodger when I was younger. It started with this movie and continued with H R Puffinstuff. The story is timeless, the music is uplifting and tragic at times. This will get worn out from watching it so much.

B008V59AF2|5.0|Had some of these on an album when I was alot younger, not that I am old but you know the industry always pushing forward and using other methods of print. I got this and put it in my stereo and my two boys both under the age of ten went to town!! They loved this cd from the get go I think more than I had ever appreciated it when I was not much older than them.Big Time and Sledgehammer Sound so much clearer than I remembered with the original pressing and you get to actually hear all of the intended sounds for each of the songs. Its amazing what technology these days can clean up and bring out in the artists real first intention that they couldn't harness back then. I LOVE this cd and can finally hear all the wonderful efforts Peter put into his pieces. Clear, Clean, Astonishingly Masterful!! Wish we had had the technology way back 15 to 20 years ago. This is awesome and you gotta hear In Your Eyes its unbeleivable!!!!!!!!
B00CBRH4YU|2.0|The video kept stopping. i could not watch the whole thing. Do to frustration. Also, the parts of the movie that I saw was boring and weird.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|Whew, where do I start. Peter Gabriel at his finest and then some. This is an incredible album for anyone who has followed him thru his days with Genisis and into his own unique style of solo tunes. He I personally believe had to have been the driving force behind all of the creativity and fame of Genisis by the lyrics you hear on this compilation of what I am floored by.The second disc on this is full of nothing but instrumentals and to my surprise was the most fantastic addition to my collection. They are NOT what you would expect them to be at all, in fact most of them don't have the exact same ring as the one's that have spoken words, they are truly unique in every way and I am so very glad that I made the final decision to buy this one even tho I thought that I would not listen to the second disc at all simply because it was all instrumental. However now that I have listened to it, (the second disc, all instrumental) I like it better than the songs with words because there is something I can't quite put my finger on, all I can say is that it is mesmerizing and that well thought out presentation of his music without words just amazed me. So for a woman who got the cd just for the first disc, I'm elated to have this second one!! Kinda feels like getting the best of something for free when all you were wanting was the first half of it in the first place.
0452298482|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to happen upon this book.  My husband always likes to ask the old folk their secret to life.  This book takes the wisdom of hundreds of elderly Americans and summarizes the common threads.  I was fascinated with the anecdotal stories from different individuals.  I could have read twice as many of those and a little less of the author's own thought processes.

I still miss Roy (the first Captain of the precinct) and ponder his situation as both &#34;good&#34; guy and &#34;bad&#34; guy.  I truly worry about Alexis and the romance? between Esposito and Lainie.<br />  The ability to create (for me) these characters whose character and history make them &#34;friends&#34; to remain close to, is rare in the television world.<br />  After all these years, they can still surprise me.  I hope they can keep it up for 5 more years.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Love me some Dexter!!  Can't wait to get the next one.  I want all the seasons, this is the best.
B008BM9L72|5.0|The entire book, I was amazed at how well the author describes the psychology in a relationship... Until the end when she switches perspective and writes from the man's point of view, and then it becomes painfully obvious that she has no idea how a male brain works.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Having lived through the Iran hostage crisis, I have to admit that I did not remember these 6 hostages.  The movie kept you at the edge the whole time, at times I would even find that I was actually holding my breath! Of course I have to admit that some of those times was when Ben Afleck was in the scene...  Would strongly recommend this movie whether you lived through it or not!
B004XISI4A|3.0|Well, if you liked the first books, you're going to like this one... Even if I found that fewer and fewer of the main characters remain interesting, there are still enough interesting characters to make the book worth reading.
0446547573|1.0|An abused woman is not just going to leave the door to her house unlocked...especially when she's been living in fear from her abuser.  I found the whole story so weak it dawned on me I could do better.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|Honestly, I have no idea why I like this book, but I do. There is nothing special about it, really. Standard story about a princess that has lost everything and wants to win her kingdom back, standard story about the nobody who becomes somebody, etc. But there are so many of those stories, all mixed into one big story about a realm. Maybe that is why I just wasn't able to put it down, there are so many stories that you want to see all the way to the end. And even though the stories are standard copy-and-paste from any story book, some of them suddenly have unexpected twists or sometimes ends unexpectedly. I did find myself skipping pages for some of the mini-stories but on the other hand I was so disappointed when other mini-stories ended too... It makes me wonder if other people like the same stories that I liked in this book...
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My 9 year-old daughter just loves this game. When she is gone I help her out. This game is great on Kindle Fire, we have had no issues. Glad I downloaded this game for her. She gets to care for virtual pets, and knows more now on how to care for her real pets. Thank you.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Afraid I had a hard time getting into this read but do love DeMille's humor and will continue to read his books
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The box set that comes with this blu ray combo is awesome. Looks nice and fits well on the rack!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|but how in the world did they pick Tom Cruise for the part of the first Child book w/Reacher? - Liam Neison (sp) would have been PERFECT for the Reacher role.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Very addictive and fun for hours , fun for me and my grandchildren. Not too hard and not too easy. Great game
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I bought this microphone to listen to myself during speeches, but never used it (more than once or twice, that is) because of the cord's absurd length. I don't remember reading that it was 20 *feet*, and if I did, it's my fault for not realizing how long that is. But I'd like to warn potential buyers that this mic was very bulky (and it's just a cord!) and a pain for walking around; stuffing it in pocket was more hassle than a mic should come with, in my opinion.<br /><br />When I used it with the audio recorder, the sound was fine. If you buy, make sure to note the \\"on\\" and \\"off\\" switch so that you don't waste battery power. Again, my main problem was with the impractical length.
0140177396|2.0|My granddaughter needed it for English class.  She did not like the book and was probably too young to read it.
B005XOPEOU|1.0|The title says it all, when I listen to Coldplay (a band) I want to hear the instruments being played by the band. Not some beats from 2010 and prior with Chris Martin singing over it. Easily their weakest album to date and a major disappointment after the great Viva La Vida album and Prospekt's March EP. Those albums were a return to form after the departure that was X&Y. I would gladly have them return to X&Y over the music on this cd. If Chris Martin desired to make a solo album that was a departure from the Coldplay sound, I would imagine it would sound something like this. But for Coldplay to release this as Coldplay is disappointing and hurts their brand in my opinion.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE Cher. Anything she does has to be perfection and the music is beyond fabulous I highly recommend it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It is amazing truly brilliant . A fresh feel to the &quot;cut the rope&quot; franchis. I have purchased the previous games and this one takes the cake. The different environments keep the game interesting. I highly recommend this app if you like real puzzlers
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Every page keeps you guessing.  If you like hunger games you will love maze runner. All of the details<br /> with more suspense. A great read you can't put down.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|While DM have been in a holding pattern as far as good albums are concerned lately, I was pleasantly surprised by Delta Machine. I have been a Depeche Mode fan since approx. 1982, so I do have some background with them. While the can do no wrong in my book, there have been some lackluster efforts in my opinion since the loss of Alan. Exciter comes to mind...not a big fan. While there were some decent songs on Sounds of the Universe, that was another Ben Hillier bummer. That said, they have done great things without Alan, Ultra is a great album, so I knew they had it in them. So they are back with Delta Machine and I'm happy to report that they have some renewed energy. I love the bluesy concept (SOFAD is my favorite album).<br /><br />Stand out tracks... Should Be Higher, Slow, Broken, Heaven, Goodbye, Soothe My Soul<br />Good Tracks... Angel, Alone, Secret To The End, Welcome To My World<br />Biggest Disappointment... The Child Inside (Martin's song)  I always look forward to the songs that Martin sings. Sadly, there hasn't been a good one since Exciter.<br /><br />In a nutshell... A very good album. Recommend.
B000ID37SQ|4.0|So i bought it, and its a good movie, good dvd i guess. But if i paused the movie for too long and pressed play after half an hour the movie would freeze and lag
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Needed this to complete my collection. I will be do sad when the show ends. Definite worth it to be able to watch the whole show without commercials or waiting a whole week for the next episode.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Took me about 4 months to finish the game, and i love long games. It was difficult, but as soon as i finished it, i fell in love
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is just like playing Bingo. This is great for people who are trying it and people who have been playing this for a while. This is an awesome app. I recommend this to all people.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book had me in tears and if I wasn't crying I was on the verge of tears. The love Gideon has for Eva is amazing and how he would do anything for her was amazing. When he said I love you I felt excited like he was telling me. I cannot wait for the next book.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This is a funny movie that you will enjoy. It will make you laugh. When I watched this movie I loved it. This is a great movie.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Her current mysteries are wonderful but this one was not,  Seems no one has been able to do Jane Austen well except jane!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story is unbelievable for mankind to murder people and treat each other in this manner. Collins describes everything so you do believe and you living it. The twist at end where the mutts represents each of the dead tribute was great.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|We love this board game, so I was excited to see this pop up as the free game of the day. The graphics are great, the computer players are not too stupid, and its fun to play with the kids. Highly recommended!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was the best I've read!!!! All 3 books were very hard to put down!!!! I would recommend these books for everyone!!!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|It was slow at times but a good movie. I hope to see other very good movies on Amazon.<br />Thanks, C. Livsey
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Loved the humor in this story! So many people today are concerned about being sensitive and politically correct, that it is a surprise this movie was ever made. A caretaker that teases and taunts his invalid employer? Gasp. A caretaker who helps said employer get sex and drugs? Shocking. The delight of being treated not as an invalid, but as a man and a friend? Yup, that's what this is all about. And it is funny to boot. Enjoy!
B009AMANBA|4.0|Everything about movie is good, except it was drawn out in one or two parts. Otherwise, the acting and everything else was really good.
B00020HEL6|5.0|CD promptly arrived in perfect shape. Very good, quick service. Much better than having to buy a new CD. I transfer these CD's onto my mp3 player.
144937980X|4.0|This is a great book for getting started with Processing if you have never coded before, but people that already know how to program probably should get one of the bigger textbooks by Daniel Shiffman or Casey Reas instead.
1451695195|4.0|Poor title, but great book for any scientifically<br /> Entrenched belief system.....will change many minds?<br />I couldn't wait to give it to my sister who thoughts near death experiences were pure imagination.<br />She shifted.
0061148512|5.0|I cannot imagine how I have not come across this wonderful 'novel' before. With the knowledge that Sylvia Plath killed herself at the age of 31 by putting her head in a gas oven - the only suicide method she does not document in this book - her slide into madness is all the more real and convincing. Her exquisite prose evokes vivid images - her clothes, for example, floating one after another from the top of a skyscraper in Boston so that she is forced to borrow an ill-fitting skirt and blouse to travel the next day, or wedged in a cob-webbed 'tomb' in the basement of her house where she swallows a bottle of sleeping pills while the police and neighbours search all around. I will have to read a biography to find out the dark side of her childhood, if there is one, but this book is as compelling a description of mental illness and hospitals as one could read. I came to it because a Facebook 'friend' said he found parallels between this and my own, totally different book. There is no higher praise.<br />[...]
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|What a great book...sad and yet so very real. Thank you, christina, for a lovely<br />Read. Your characters so real, the settings described so perfectly...i could see<br />And feel all of it<br />Jody weant
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|I started with Season One when I couldn't find anything else interesting to rent.  I spent an entire Saturday watching Season One and was crushed when my local Family Video didn't have Season Two.  The sales associate was able to get it from another store for me but it was separate DVD's and two episodes were missing.  I went to Amazon and bought those two.  Love it!  Not for the faint of heart, however.  The character development is seductive and I find myself cheering for the bad guys - although they all seem like bad guys!  If anyone ever wants to remake any of the old Boris Karloff movies, Jeremy Irons is the go-to guy!
B000002VFW|5.0|Loved this CD. Bought it in cassette when it first came out. Great to have it on CD. Very good music.
030758836X|2.0|Convoluted in an unsatisfying, contrived manner....This novel started out in an intriguing manner -- sudden disappearance of a lovely wife, husband the suspect. The reader's suspicions are tugged this way and that. A very unsatisfactory, totally implausible ending...
0545259096|4.0|More of my reviews can be found on my blog @ [...]<br /><br />The beginning of this one was just too slow for me. At one point  I found myself cheering for Cole and Isabel more than for Sam and Grace, because for the 2/3 of it Sam was alone and depressed, Grace, well, she was a totally different case. Most of the time I didn't have a clue what was going on with her. The end of the triology suprised me, because I was sure everyone was going to make it out alive, but during the last chapter I wasn't so sure of it anymore. Tom Culper really got on my nerves, ugh. By the way, at first, I was convinced that the police officer, who agreed to help Sam, was going to betray the wolves and guide them into a trap, therefore, I was pleasently suprised when he sided bravely with the wolves and protected innocent (well, some of them weren't that innocent.. cough, cough, Shelby, cough) people, who had to live with this curse of changing. I was literally on the verge of tears at the end of the book when only three of them made it out alive. I liked the friendship between Sam and Isabel and between Isabel and Grace. Grace was the heart of these four young adults. She was the connection between them, connecting three totally different strings: one silky, but ice cold, one black and torned, and one, beautiful and yellow, but a little dull. Isabel was distant and cold, but opened up to Grace and, in my opinion, she was the one who grew the most. Cole was not icy exactly, but careless: he did not care about anything else than himself and Grace (as Sam and Isabel) helped him understand, why caring about people is important, how much it helps one to reach out to others. After all, lets be honest, human beings are social animals and do not stand to be alone for a long time. Sam was caring and loving, but he would not let people inside his world, Grace on the other hand, offered him everything, what seemed to be missing in the first place. She encouraged him and kind of showed him the way towards brightness. To a road without the fears of his past which were holding him back. She helped him get over his fears, caused by childhood traumas and the fear of lonelyness. I think that it's hard to pick a favorite character out of everyone in this series, because it the end, they all won my heart, but I guess the story that moved me the most was Isabel's. She was a complete stranger at first (in the Shiver\\"). Superior, selfish, cantankerous. She grew the most during the series (well Cole did too, I guess). Finally she had real friends and she became caring, compassionate and strong. I was extremely glad that it turned out good for her.
0545265355|5.0|This item came when expected and in great condition.  The cost was good as well.  Love this book series!  Would recommend to anyone.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Certainly leaves with you a conversation starter.  Very well written, but a great deal of medical information which could be difficult for the average person.  I keep coming back to the part about heaven, very difficult to forget.
044042321X|4.0|I like to read a graphic novel from time to time.  As I am not hooked on the television series, this was a curiosity for me.  I like it.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|love the music, especially &#34;because i knew you&#34;, worth listening to over and over again. i have been changed for the better
B00328R21C|5.0|My 6 years old son is very happy with this toy. It includes many important characters from the star wars movie and it was very easy to build by himself.
B006LSZECO|4.0|keeps your interest throughout and is set for a sequal i hope. very good read on the kindle makes it easy
1401324517|5.0|What a wonderful book, a great read and so down to earth, it tells the real story of this great person.  If you want a great book to read then buy this for sure..
B0012GMY64|5.0|What an incredible voice and collection of songs. A total relaxing style. Just beautiful! He will be missed. Vendor did a great job as well.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was pretty good. It was fumny and serious at the same time. Nice revenge movie for every one.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Outstanding movie.  Arrived in a timely fashion.  Packaged well.  Worth every penny.  All movies should be this good, and have morals. Children can watch this without fear of seeing/hearing uncivilized behavior/language.  Good story.
B00B69UQJY|4.0|A  very entertaining CD, I'm not a big fan but I thought it was better then most of the other CD's.
B004SIMNF0|5.0|solid product.  It has the quality you can feel.  It is designed for the professional but its great for anyone wanting an easy way to handle a heavy camera all day.
B000VTNLBU|5.0|Truly one of the great Anime films of all time. Up there with Akira in story and animation. Like Blade Runner, it's a story of that fine line between humanity and machine. Where is that line drawn and who makes that determination? In a world increasingly ruled by technology, and with cybernetics just around the corner, this movie become even more relevant with each passing year. A must see.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After reading the trilogy it's easy to see why throngs of women flocked to it.  It was just okay. That's all.
B00336G7HI|5.0|What can I say about a battery?  It either works or it doesn't.  I haven't needed to use it yet, but I am sure that it will be fine.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|I bought this feeling sceptical because I had only heard do me a favor and gravesend. But after listening to this thw first time, I can't stop. The only thing I wanted was a little more heavy songs, its mostly slow or just on the edge of slow, but it is still an awesome cd.
0061801313|5.0|I love the show so I decided to get the books to read, I must admit, I am on book 10 and I cant put them down,
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I am a sci-fi girl but this was really a fun movie. I would definitely recommend it on a night with nothing else to do. You won't be disappointed. (Chick Flick)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love all 3 hunger games books!  You have to read the first one before you can read this one and when you are done with this one you will have to pick up the third one.  It took me along time to start reading these because it sounded gruesome, but they really aren't.  A good read for anyone middle school or older.
0880796863|4.0|I received my package today the tarot cards are beautiful the only complaint is the itty Bitty book others than that I love them going to do some readings tonight with them thanks
B00B2166BS|5.0|I bought this cable because I was getting concerned that the USB port on my Nexus 10 was going to wear out with the constant plugging/unplugging of the charging cable.  The pogo cable has solved that problem nicely.  It snaps on to the tablet with magnets, and causes no wear and tear at all.  Also, as an added bonus, the tablet charges much more quickly than with the USB cable.  I highly recommend this.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|As far as I am concerned  this  CD is great!  Love the songs, music, band.<br />This is my go to  CD  when taking a road trip...sing it out loud!
B000S398WU|4.0|This dvd looks great and sounds great. I would recommend this to anyone. I am glad that I ordered the blu-ray version.
034580404X|5.0|ok, first of all, if you haven't read this series yet, you need too.  Intense is all I have for these books!
B009LGO88E|5.0|Makes monster hunter, RE revelation's and quite a few other games so much better!! It's not region based so it will work on any 3D's world wide! I'm lovin this product!!
0240815807|5.0|Until recently I was a home recording kind of guy who just twiddled the knobs until stuff sounded good.  This book has very clear explanations of how things work and why, and suggests a logical sequence to follow to keep yourself organized.  I'm not a professional engineer, but I still want the best sounding recordings I can produce.  This book is a huge step in that direction.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|I am not a fan of movies that the director tries to turn into a work of art with no understandable story, few spoken words and a bit of whispering. This was not interesting to me in the least bit, and I am a huge fan of most genres of movies. I really regret purchasing it and wasting the time to watch it. I will definitely stay away from movies by this director.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is great to have large numbers and face area. I like using it .love having all the functions on it. percentages is MY  thanks to the development.  Very large numbers,makes it that much easier
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The Impossible puts you right into that horrible day the tsunami hit Thailand (and several other countries). I had a friend in Thailand when it appended and will never forget that day. This movie, with it's excellent cast, really puts you there and give you a bigger understanding of what it was like for those who lived through it. Well done!
1936608618|5.0|Wonderfull book, explaining how to save time and mental health, be motivated and challenge yourself in order to become more efficient and better endurance athlete.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I have loved The Hobbit and read it a few times over the years, and was very disappointed with this movie version. I understand why the famous Lord of the Rings Trilogy had to e 3 movies, I don't understand why the Hobbit (one book) has to be several movies, it was only one book and the run time of the run time of the movie is very long for the amount of the story that actually got told. I'm a huge fan of the book, but not the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ya so my friend introduced me to this game and I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT LOL In this game, you can play with your own virtual house and care for it.the best part is its free lol i got beauty.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good, easy read. Finished it within a couple hours. Very addicting. Better than the movie, but that's no surprise, is it?
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This game has terrible glitches. I almost completed the game and when I finally got to level 4, the game said,doddle god has been closed.l tried over and over to restart the game. Kindle help suggested to uninstall and then reinstall but in that process, all game progress was lost. I am very unhappy with this solution. Buyer beware,!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|daughter loves it. she is only 3 1/2 but figured it out pretty quickly. wants to ghetto the unicorn. keeps her buisy in the car
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I love this little thing! It has everything I need to open a computer and the magnet feature is great.

B00B97SNJI|5.0|I am an older person and still love this young men.<br />The songs are all beautiful.  I like their voices and instrumental<br />capabilities.  But their lyrics are beautiful.  Keep up the good work guys.
1619692376|5.0|I picked this up at Costco and was completely surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  It is fast paced and lives you continuously wanting more.  I had never read anything By David Baldacci before, but now I am a huge fan!  I listened to the auido book version and the readers, Ron McLarty with Orlagh Cassidy, were awesome. I would highly recommend this one!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I enjoy this game. It is easy, but makes you think. I like to play the same levels several times to think of new ways to solve the puzzle with different items. Highly recommend.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I just love Taylor Swift. This album is truly heartfelt and full of catchy tunes like what you've come to expect from her. If you don't like her music you hear on the radio than this album is not for you. But, if you like solid songs, with catchy beats and lyrics you can sing along to, then this is for you.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|\\"I can't shake the feeling that Earth, in spite of all that's happened, Earth is still my home.\\" Jack Harper (Cruise) is one of the last inhabitants of Earth. Years after a war decimated the planet him and his partner are left to protect the machines taking the water for use on the new home world. One day while he is out investigating something strange happens that changes his life and way of thinking. I was looking forward to this movie not because of Tom Cruise but because it looked interesting. While this is a very good movie and well worth seeing I had to laugh a few times. I don't want to give anything away but this movie is pretty much a mix of every single sci fi movie ever made. Each scene you think they did that in that one movie, or I saw that in that other movie. Serioulsy, think of a sci-fi movie and there is something in this one from that. The movie did have a kind of 80's feel to it which was cool and it is worth seeing but it's really just a collage of sci-fi from 2001 to After Earth (yes the movie that hasn't come out yet is even ripped off). Overall, well worth seeing and a fun game guessing what movie this scene is from. I give it a B+.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I just love Taylor Swift. This album is truly heartfelt and full of catchy tunes like what you've come to expect from her.

B005LAIH2M|2.0|\\"Me and my sister, we have a past. We almost died at the hands of a witch but that past made us stronger. We'd gotten a taste of blood, witch blood and we haven't stopped since.\\" After escaping and killing a witch as young kids Hansel (Renner) and Gretel (Arterton) have become bounty hunters specializing in witch hunting. They are hired by a town mayor to protect them, but the sheriff doesn't trust them. It is up to the brother and sister team to save the town from it's fate. I was a little leery of this going in. After sitting through it I have to say it was about what I expected. A lot of over the top acting and gore strung together with a little story. The movie isn't terrible but I don't think it's worth seeing more then once. The evil witch makeup is a cross between something in Labrynth and Army Of Darkness. To me I think the movie could have been a little better if they made it more of a comedy/horror then just straight horror. That's just my opinion though. I'm sure many people will really like this. Overall, not terrible but nothing to rush and see either. I say C+.

B008YU0AOE|5.0|Want a giant calculator. Well turn ur kindle into one. This thing is awesome. I'm going to buy the real app because only then can you change the skin of the calculator...Love It!
B002SRQ214|5.0|this was my 2nd Build love the Amd Cores very easy to Over clock has a nice case badge  for those people who like that sort of thing
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This clock is amazing. When i first seen it honestly i didn't think it would operate as good as does a physical alarm clock. Well its perfect and I'm in love. I feel the upgrade is worth buying so that you can use the other clock designed styles. My favorite of the app is how your kindle can be turned onto a clock/night light. SO COOL.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|The first time I played this was years ago on my friends DS and I've been a fan since. The goal is to create things, like a bridge, to pass obstacles or help allies. I recommend this if you like logic games, building games, and. creative games.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game has a better quality and it is very active. It also keeps in active. This game is not bad for kids and all kids should have this game. Also the other temple run has fewer obstacles so its not so entertaining. The conclusion is you should get this app.
0671449028|5.0|I have to read this book at least twice to my 2 year old every night. She gets into the rhythm of the story and, if I have to pause, she looks at me like she knows something's off. I love books with a rhythm just for that reason. There are so many little drawings that can be pointed out by my toddler, like a big animal putting on small pajamas and other little nuances you might not pick up the first few times reading it (always nice for mom to have a little change here and there).<br /><br />I usually end up extending the last page and saying &#34;And rock and rock and rock and rock and rock and rock and rock ...&#34; to get her even more relaxed, slowing the words down a little at a time.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|My Grand daughter and I had to watch this twice due to her bedtimes and found it wonderful in its blue ray clarity and its wonderful script writing for her age level. Beautifully done.
141694737X|5.0|I had never heard of this book before, but it had such great reviews and was suggested by Amazon. I'm glad I got it on impulse! It really is a fantastic book! My daughter absolutely loves it! She loves lifting the flaps for the animals.

1250012570|5.0|This is of my favorite books I have read in years. I reread it as soon as I finished it, because I wasn't ready to start reading a new book.  I thought about this book for a long time after I read the last page.

B005VSRFEA|5.0|Great book for students, consultants, executives, analysts and those interested in complexity applied to management. Books written by consultants are a much better choice than those written by academics. Donella knows what she is talking about from experience, not from books.

B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The roles of Pete (Rudd) and Debbie (Mann) are resumed for this quasi-sequel to Knocked Up. In that film, these characters are grinding out middle age and parenthood and serve up most of the memorable lines of the film, such as \\"Marriage is like a tense, unfunny version of Everybody Loves Raymond, only it doesn't last 22 minutes. It lasts forever.\\"  Unfortunately, Apatow tries to prove out that premise in \\"40\\".  The zingers from Knocked Up are gone. It's as if Apatow decided that the play within Midsummer Night's Dream was worthy of producing on its own, but without the contrast to the greater story, there's apparently nowhere to go except into pergatory.  Enter the fathers of the leads, played by Brooks and Lithgow.  Rather than providing some quirkiness like Harold Ramis did in Knocked Up, these two don't offer anything but a confirmation of \\"unfunny version of Everybody Loves Raymond\\" line.  It's still Apatow, still has a handful of outrageous \\"that's so true\\" moments that you'd never thought you'd see captured on screen, but it lacks a warm central character that he usually has at the heart of his films (Rudd is too morose, self-indulged to be that person here).<br /><br />Apatow appears to be channeling Mike Leigh in his approach to the film - allowing the actors to develop their characters themselves and not offer a grand story arch. And, hey, an inconclusive film about a messy marriage would be fine, but there's too much \\"trying\\" vs. a Leigh film.  Too many scenes, too many attempts at either deranged comedy or drama and then there's the news at the end of the film that nobody wanted to hear or believe.
B000001EIA|5.0|I was not able to watch the big KISS MTV Unplugged show when it first aired.  I had a co-worker record the show for me. He really did not know KISS, being so much younger than I (sounds like a KISS lyric).  He said he recognized a few songs, but did not recognize most. When I saw the tape (VHS at the time), I was blown away. I mean seeing the KISS-sters in their full glory, stripped and raw.  These guys really can play! It was heaven on earth for a true KISS fan (from 1976).  These guys picked songs that were not necessary commercial hits, but were in the true spirit of the band.  I love Goin' Blind and others non-standard fare. If you don't know the genesis of this band, you may not \\"get it\\". Those of us who have followed these New Yorkers get it.  That is it in a nutshell, those that get it, and those that will never get it.  The Rock and Rock Hall of Fame are whores.  They refuse to recognize KISS' contribution to rock, yet continue to induct rap singers and other no one has heard of.  It is a pitiful same.  This LP will please, not only KISS fans, but open-minded fans who like great guitar work.  Bruce Kulick's work alone is worth the price of admission. I love all the guys on this CD.  When Pete and Ace enter, it is a whole new ballgame.  I mean there is nothing like the originals (no disrespect to Bruce or Eric, which I love too).  Overall, I rank this as one of KISS' masterpieces.  The producers knew this well, making it a CD and a video. Both are worth owning.  I wish the new KISS would do another Unplugged. It is time for more fun, excellence.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|That is one of the few books I stop the reading on the second chapter. Poorly written, I would consider this book a totally waste of time.
0547396945|5.0|This book is really popular with my kids. We wore out our first one and had to order another. The illustrations are adorable. The rhythmic, rhyming text means that my daughter who is just-turned-3 reads it to my son who is about 16 months old. They both love this story. The original one I had was not bilingual, it was just in English. I preferred that, but it wasn't available in board book form any longer.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was my first Landay novel but most definitely not my last. I found the author's description of the human psyche in torment to be almost palpable. Beautiful prose and frightening story.

I just hope he has more and he'd better charge me more as well... want to encourage his creative juices.<br /><br />I'm not so much a tech nerd, but even though there's a heavy dose of science - the whole thing kept me riveted to the story for the hours it took me to read... even way past when i knew i should really put this darn thing down & get some sleep!<br /><br />Well paced and good characterisation. & i loved the humour.<br /><br />I consider myself a bit of a `survivalist' with innovation to burn, but next to the main protagonist i felt like a dufus! way to go Mark!<br /><br />He even encouraged me to fix the dryer - and dang if it doesn't work! :-)<br /><br />Great read, great value, go on buy it.<br />Richard

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This was a book club pick and I had never heard of this author nor that there was a movie and I'm glad I didn't. I read this book having absolutely no idea what it was about. I will say that it took getting through the first couple letters before I was into the story. After that point, it was a very quick read. I enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to discuss it with everyone. My husband and I watched the movie later on and I would suggest reading the book before you watch the movie because they left out quite a bit. In fact the movie was just a hodge podge of events that happened in the book. If I hadn't read the whole story, I wouldn't have known what was going on in the movie.
0205313426|5.0|A book that you should not only own a copy and read cover to cover but should reference regularly as a writer. This is also a book of choice by Stephen King from his \\"On Writing\\" book, which is one of my most favorite books of all time.<br /><br />The Elements of Style is the very basic of using the English language well and it is a brilliant little book with a great sense of humor (I think so anyway) and with such clarity about the uses of each element that you quickly understand how to apply it.<br /><br />Love This Book. It sits on my desk and I learn from it even 10 years later.

B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This is a story about how the pilots of World War II (who survived) became experts at their craft, especially Luftwaffe fighter pilots. And they did so with grace and respect, much as athletes on opposing teams.  An example would be the illustration shown on the book cover: a German fighter plane escorts a wounded allied bomber out of Germany, thereby immunizing it from enemy flak gunners on the coast. (Don't try this trick at home - if you get caught in the vortex you might have a more exciting ride than bargained for)<br />  The book also contains information that might be new even to those with some World War II knowledge.  At the end of the war, the Germans possessed a small quantity of jet fighters which could outrun anything the allies had; fortunately for the Allies they were poorly made. Lufthansa airways was a Hitler trick to start an air force and stay within the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. Nazi pilots openly criticized Hermann Goerring's air strategy and even held meetings about it.<br />  There are many books/stories of the nice guy German genre, and I must say I feel just a little uncomfortable with the idea of a fierce Nazi warrior being anti-Hitler at heart. After all, these fine specimens of Teutonic knighthood risked their lives on a daily basis to protect the Nazi war machine. As the book explains they did have other options: going to a pilot resort or seeking asylum in neutral Sweeden are some alternate choices.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I am a 3rd grader and I liked this book.This book was awesome. I enjoyed reading the book. Cool beans
B007C3TVNA|3.0|SPOILERS.........<br /><br />I don't know if I \\"liked\\" this film. It, and the actors, particularly Tilda Swinton, succeeded in portraying the possible reality of everyone living in such a situation, the rejected love, the maturation of evil, the agony and pure terror, the pain. Those are all very uncomfortable emotions, and so again, I wouldn't say I liked it. I found the editing technique to be pretty chaotic, when each scene is of a different place and time. Sometimes I wasn't quite sure where or when.<br /><br />I do not agree with the premise of the film and also those of a number of reviewers, that the \\"problem\\" with Kevin was due to his mother's failings as a parent. First off, it seems to be a common thing that the \\"instant bonding\\" doesn't always take place instantly. Secondly, the other side of the bonding has to come from the baby, and with Kevin, it never did. Kevin's problems were not caused by \\"no one loving him,\\" because his mother did love him, in her way. She was there, talking to him, rolling the ball to him, reading to him, visiting him at the prison. He rejected her until he was old enough to start being deliberately malicious. She was the only one who saw it, since Kevin put on a good show for his \\"loving\\" BLIND father. What I wanted her to do was to leave them, and see how long Kevin put on the show for his father, when he had no one else to torment, and maybe that would have opened the father's eyes to Kevin's reality.<br /><br />  It was clear that something was wrong with Kevin early on, but no one except his mother could see it. Why did his father and the drs think there was nothing wrong with a boy who wasn't talking or still not toilet trained at age six or so? In regard to the abuse scene, it felt odd. I am sure any mother would be VERY tired of changing diapers on a boy far too old to still be wearing them, with no disability noted, but I didn't get why she would become angry that he had dirtied his diaper, when he was still wearing them? It wasn't like he was using the toilet, so what else would he do? Also, since she threw him against the wall, where did that mark/scar come from? His blackmailing was just chilling.<br /><br />It seems to me that Kevin was clearly born without the empathy gene, or was the definition of a sociopath,and nothing his mother could have done could change that. What I don't get, is how, since Kevin's mother knew that he was capable of evil, they ever thought it was a good idea to give him a deadly weapon, but this scenario has been played out in one school shooting after another. Everyone would know that the boy wasn't \\"right,\\" yet gave him access to guns. I also wouldn't have brought a new child anywhere near him. She was lucky she lived as long as she did, even though she had already lost an eye. How is it that she still felt loving and safe with her brother after he blinded her? I am glad though that the film didn't show what he did with the hamster. I had visions of it being pinned to the target, since we heard Kevin shooting while they were looking for it. Also, how would those plastic locks have kept Kevin out of the cupboard where the Drano was? Even the daughter was old enough to open them. I got a different impression with the scene where Kevin was sick. I didn't think that he was being nice to his mother because she was reading about shooting the arrows, I thought it was because he was sick and needed her. I<br />could be mistaken.<br /><br />The couple of things I had real issues with was how Kevin killed a bunch of kids with arrows. It didn't show the actual shootings or how  many kids or what room they were in, but I find it hard to believe that they all were equally as helpless, to hide, to try to disable or disarm Kevin as if he was shooting them with an assault rifle, or that he was able to achieve maximum fatalities with one arrow each. That was really stretching credibility. Also, at the end, when Kevin was going to be transferred to an adult prison, heacted scared, and unsure. Those are normal emotional responses. A real sociopath wouldn't feel them.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|An excellent story, very well written. Unfortunately, it contains a good deal of profanity, which is always offensive, even if it does reflect certain local vernacular.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book was fantastic i really could not put it down. One of Follets finest and i can't wait till book three.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Love it, it brings back some great memories. It used to be my brothers favorite. I think I know every single words. Just awesome.
0374531269|4.0|Ishmael tells his story of the devistating attack on his country and the brutal slaughtering of innocent people.  A &#34;hard to put down&#34; book, the reader is truly amazed by the quick decisions a young boy is forced to make in order to survive. On the run and in a country under attack, Ishmael's love for his family gives him the inner strength to survive and keep moving.

0688158234|5.0|Desert Flower is an incredible story that captures the reader's attention from the first sentence.  Waris explains how she survived in a harsh environment, where there was limited compassion for a child on her own.  At an early age, Waris is forced to make decisions that will effect her physically and mentally for her entire life.  During all the hardships she must face, Waris' love for her family gives her the strength to survive and search for her role in God's plan.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My favorite game so far.  Graphics are great and everything runs smoothly.  Lots of levels to master and undersea worlds to explore.  Can use points to buy cute items for your shark or items to help him survive longer.  Good sound effects and really develops your eye/hand coordination.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I have enjoyed playing bb for 2 years now. From time there are glitches,but it is fun, you can interact with others or just play on your own. The best part is I Play it in the car and my husband has a pleasant drive without me back seat driving. It's a great game that is just fun to play. Best of all if you don't go for the \\"elite\\" game it's free!
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|My 7 year old rgot this and a few other movies after watching me put in the code and ended up over drawing my account also it was a very dumb movie
B005LAIII0|5.0|Very well made. Decent adaptation from book. Preserves the integrity of original story. Well acted out, with superior computer technology making the picture vivid and believable. Excellent for all ages.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|Good move all the way around except for the music score.  For a period movie like this one notated in the 1800s, Rap music does not work?  There were other musical themes that did not work as well.  They would been better served if they had just gone with orchestrated background music.  This movie is about 3 hours long so prepare yourself.  That being said, these 3 hours are not boring.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Absolutely love this book, I am big into Kennedy stuff but even all the fiction of the book is enthralling just grabs you and drags you in I did not want to stop reading it hence why I dragged it out haha.
B00BDSRER0|5.0|After several years of being their fan, as album after album was being released, I thought to myself: \\"there's NO way they can come close to equalling their last performance.\\"<br />That has always been a big mistake on my part, especially after the release of Bankrupt!<br /><br />With the privilege of seeing them in concert, I not only was reminded of the unparalleled energy that this band has, but also their genuine love for their music. True, there will be critics out there, but Phoenix and all of its members have poured their ALL into making each of these phenomenal albums, creating a mysterious and distinguished genre of their own.<br /><br />Thomas Mars, Deck d'Arcy, Christian Mazzalai and Laurent Brancowitz (members of Phoenix) are not only genius artists, but also musical pioneers.<br />Bravo, Phoenix! Bravo!
B006AN78XS|5.0|This is the first Woody Allen film that I ever watched. I am now a Woody Allen fan. I like how he tells a story. This movie is about a guy that lives in a past era in his mind. Captivating story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read a lot by Stephen King as I'm not really in to &#34;horror&#34; type story lines.  I decided to try this one because of the different story line and was not disappointed.  It holds you throughout.  Great story.
B005CMSDKA|4.0|This movie falls in the same genre as does 'Hitman'. Still it is entertaining and does carry some suspense. The young lady gives an excellent perfomance, and is fairly believable in her role.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I so enjoyed this movie.  I find it rare today to find a movie that holds my interest throughout.  However, this one certainly did.
B004K00NEO|5.0|Great entertainment for kids of all ages...plus it a good moral to live by.! Blu-ray edition is a real visual treat, as well.
B0080SFQU8|5.0|My 5 year old was excited that we purchased this book. He has read some of Pete the Cat stories at school and loves them.<br /><br />In this book, Pete the Cat walks down the street, singing his song, in his brand new white shoes, that he loves. He happens to step in a few items to make his shoes turn colors, but does he cry, \\"Goodness No! He keeps walking along singing his song.\\" The book helps children learn rhythm, colors, and jazzy little tunes. The story is great and has wonderful illustrations. \\"The moral of Pete's story is: No matter what you step in, keep walking along and singing your song.....because it's all good.\\"<br /><br />We will be purchasing more of Pete the Cat.

B007REV4T8|5.0|Its nice to see a movie at home and don't have to worry about people using cell phones, kicking the seat or constantly moving around! Movie was good, I still tend towards the OLD James Bond, but he was passable...Good Actor!
B00498YZH8|5.0|I am from the Ozarks originally, and this movie is touching and very accurate in terms of the hardships faced by many Ozarkians on the poverty line.  Please watch this to get a feel for how a whole other part of America lives.  Beautiful, well-done movie.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Season 2 is even better than Season 1!  As the characters develop and you start to get attached, the show gets even more suspenseful and constantly keeps you wanting more.  It's not just about survival anymore, it's about relationships and struggle to make the right decisions.  There is a lot of tension between the characters in Season 2, which makes it even better to watch.  Definitely a must have!
B0041CGP02|5.0|I went to a Bon Jovi concert, THEN decided I should listen to his music. This CD had all of his popular songs and was a good introduction to his music!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Season 1 is pretty short but it is a great intro to the story and the characters.  The Walking Dead is my favorite show of all time because it has everything you could possibly want in a show.  It is action packed, suspenseful, and dramatic and I love every second of it.  Plus, it has ZOMBIES, it can't get much better than that!

B0053B347M|5.0|These are working great, providing all of the claimed benefits outlined in the marketing. The items I received and installed, have an integrated on/off micro switch (inline w/-USB power cable). Of course this isn't necessary if you power them from your TV's USB port if so equipped, in which case they will light when the appliance powers up. The same holds true for consolidating multiple BIAS equipped displays to a common power state switchable USB charger or Hub, or alternately spare computer ports for an automated solution.<br /><br />Since these do not have a data feed requirement (only electricity to power the LED array,) a USB charger device can work including USB2.0,1.1 revisions. There is no known reason to populated a USB 3.0 port with this type of device however it does light. Note that the adhesive is tenacious so I measured carefully tacking a short portion of one end only, then proceeded to stretch the strip lightly while guiding the adhesion process, tapping in several places, then finally buffing the assembly with a cloth to work out any remaining loose points.<br /><br />To avoid the possibility of gravity removing the power connection end of the strip or causing the adhesion to loosen over time, it may be prudent to bind the USB power cable with a tie wrap or Velcro fastener to the display or Television appliance stand.<br /><br />One version variable for television applications can provide a brighter solution, however the purpose is to provided enough backlighting compensation versus a Las Vegas Strip advertising effect.<br /><br />Alternative Version for Television - Search term HDTV BIAS Lighting or Antec Halo LED
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|If you like light strategy you'll love this game. The rules are easy to understand and the point is straight forward. Even though I got this game free today I don't think I'd of paid the price tag if has. I don't think there is enough here to justify the cost.<br /><br />This may sound hypocritical but I would probably buy the physical copy of the game for anywhere between $10-20. There is just something about having that on a table with friends instead if trying to huddle around a device.
B000002KCI|5.0|In 1975 Neil Young put out 2 albums, Zuma and Tonight's The Night.  Tonight's The Night is regarded by many as Neil's best.  Zuma is arguably his 2nd best, inarguably one of his best.  Most of the album features Crazy Horse - on 2 lenghthy songs, Cortez The Killer and Danger Bird as well as short to the point rockers like Barstool Blues and Don't Cry No Tears. There is the beautiful ballad Pardon My Heart (supposedly pulled from his unreleased Homegrown album) and a nice breezy CSNY closer Through My Sails.  David Briggs, who produced this as well as much of Young's other best work , loved this album and does a great job getting as good a sound as you can get from the ultimate garage band.  BUY IT. If you like Neil with Crazy Horse this is as good as it gets.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a gem among free games with option to pay. Payinf gets you perks faster but paying isn't needed in order to progress. The part I find most amazing about this game is even though I've played the same 'map' over and over again the feats you unlock keep you entertained even though nothing has really changed. Definitely the best time killer I've ever played..

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small compact and versatile. I have been able to put a sharp edge on a very dull knife with this sharpener, that when finished it easily cut through a single sheet of flimsy notebook paper. The indent on it provides a good place to hold the sharpener while you pull the knives through it.<br /><br />Would I buy again? Yes<br />Would I recommend it? To everyone.
B009AMANBA|5.0|My hubbie and I saw this movie in the theater and decided to buy it when it was released on DVD.  There was so much truth to the portrayal of Lincoln and how he dealt with the political issues of his time.  Sally Field was awesome as his wife!<br /><br />Anyone interested in the tumultuous and interesting history of our country should see this movie.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|I haven't finished it yet but it is so quirky and fun! Cute animation and funny characters. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I bought it 2 weeks ago and this is the first time it finally downloaded correctly.  Boo. Having fun now though. Note: hidden objects are in pieces
B009IUH1N2|1.0|I did not like this game. It was to confusing to use.  When a young person and a adult can't figure it out ,time to hang it up.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked it because it was written by a brain surgeon who did not believe in the afterlife until his NDE<br />which made what he said much more believable.<br />I also liked it because it was written with clarity and pasion<br />I loved the main reason he wrote it ---the message of  'LOVE&#34;
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It is not Acrobat Pro. Unfortunately, the Pro version is prohibitive to many. So, for the basic reading and reviews, Reader is what you need.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|I have to say that I started out watching this because of all the talk about it, and I wasn't sure it would live up to all the excitement.  I have to admit that I was hooked after the very first scene.  The way that they filmed the characters in the house, made it very realistic, not as if the actors were just moving around in a location that was more in keeping with a museum then an actual home.  I have now watched all three seasons, and have found myself more and more invested in the lives of these characters; crying with every death, rejoicing with every birth, and shouting \\"No don't.\\" when someone does something you know they shouldn't.  I guess that's what prompted me to write this review, I wanted everyone to know what a great program this is.  You definitely wouldn't be disappointed in the purchase of this series. Although the end of season three was heartbreaking, I have no doubt that I will be waiting impatiently for season four to arrive, always hoping for the best for the family and the staff at Downton Abbey.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Love the music! This is one of my favorite new movies and Rebel Wilson is absolutely hilarious! Anna Kendrick is fantastic, I didn't know she could even sing, but WOW!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Totally worth the $1.99 price tag, cannot wait for the next one. Looking forward to seeing what else Fireproof Games comes up with......<br />Very creepy sound effects, nifty puzzles to figure out, beautiful graphics.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Think this is the best game ever played. Except computer games. But I would like to thank u for making this game thanks! Alexis Kambouris
1616550414|5.0|It's the Legend of Zelda, what more can I say? It's awesome and a great gift for The Legend of Zelda fans!
B00B19GKI0|1.0|I don't ever remember seeing this movie, but thank god it was free!  Horrible production, horrible acting you name it, it is BAD!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|As a musician, I love the powerful music of Les Miserables.  I was particularly impressed by Anne Hathaway's performance.  She broke my heart.
B001QWBM62|5.0|This is an Amazing Recorder worth its price and more, if you buy it you wont be dissapointed!! The recording quality is great...
B003M6WERG|5.0|love the humor do not care for the gay men.  but I like them too.  Glad there is not a lot of contact between the two otherwise I would stop watching it, its the family of all of the characters fun and love they have for one another.  They are like most family. I love the laughter. we need more of that.Keep the families going.  Not the gays comments of being gay I and my family do not want to go there, but we like both of the men they are funny too, like the rest of them.  love the Columbian woman she is beautiful yet she does not fluant it , (so women do not keep there husbands from watching it.) If your beautiful like her you do not have to be half naked or act like your all that.  she make me laugh instead of being jealous.  She is beautiful ,sexy and for real.  without trying..  never like the Marilyn Monroe type, they make me sick.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|My wife and I are fans of English period dramas and have seen many of them over the years.  In the last 15 years, the BBC has produced quite a few such dramas, many of which are excellent.  Even among these, North & South is thoroughly outstanding.<br /><br />The character development is wonderful and truly satisfying, a rarity indeed.  We see the characters portrayed as humans and rejoice as we see them change, grow, and adapt their worldviews via these experiences.  Most all of the characters, certainly the main ones, are shown as complex individuals of depth with both good and bad qualities including kindness, love, loyalty, service to others, prejudices, anger, and mistrust.<br /><br />There is a wonderful lack of bias in the storytelling.  Although there are multiple conflicts presented, the filmmakers do not tell us how to think about any of it.  The film manages to completely avoid a simplistic good vs bad paradigm.  Instead, the portrayal is much more real.  Just when it seems Thornton will be characterized as a rich, evil businessman who would do anything for profit, you see his devotion to his mother and his efforts to treat his workers fairly in a highly competitive industry and often unforgiving world.  Just when it appears the union workers will be portrayed as saints, we see Margaret pointedly challenging the union leaders on their tactics and behavior.  There are many moments of unexpected dialogue which alter the perceptions of both the characters and the viewer.  It creates a brilliant examination of the issues which yields complexity and depth rarely found in any film.<br /><br />I only wish they would release this on Blu-Ray.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|.Great for just about every math problem you can run into,I have used this app many times.Well worth useing !!!
B00881PTRC|5.0|I never knew hangman could be so entertaining.  A fun way to pass the time and learn new vocabulary at the same time.  Only bug so far is sound re-enables if you exit and return to the app.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|The watch is very attractive. However, when it arrived and after moving it like instructed to &#34;wind it&#34;, the inside components seemed to make a rattle sound.  Also, I thought it would run for a longer time without movement.  Didn't know if this was normal.  I returned it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great for when I need a break from work or I'm waiting somewhere.  Not so easy I get bored but not so hard I feel stupid!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app, saves time I can find the weather in a second whereas I would have to watch the end of the news for that. I use it everyday and its very accurate for my area.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|Not very impressed with this game.  The dog throws cans and a bottle on the floor which is not something I want my kids to do.  Copies everything you say.  Nothing very educational here, just some cheap laughs for a very young audience.  Cannot recommend it.
B008MM9630|3.0|It is a good app but not really what I was expecting  it reminds me of smurfs and a couple other farm games I play I can't really find the fairy counsel but like I said it reminds me of smurfs which is one of my favorite games try it u might poo idiot
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you like exercising your mind and honing your mental agility, you will love this version of Mahjong. It is challenging and the graphics at e beautiful.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|A really good book about what true love really is and how if you truly love someone,you will let them be happy.
B005TZFZJC|2.0|I am disappointed in this CD that Rihanna released.  I really liked her song we found love and was hoping that the rest of her cd was going to be good too.  I found it very disjointed and crude.  Not her best and to be honest I found it beneath her.  Waste of my money.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|I got to see this show 2012 show when it stopped at Bethel Woods, NY (home of the original Woodstock). I think Ringo gets better with age and his All Star shows never disappoint. This show was captured nicely and is a good mix of Ringo songs as well as songs by the All Star members of the band..
B003MC5N28|5.0|This story kept me on my toes wanting to read more but I had to hold myself back. I can't wait to read the next book I want to see how Mrs. Lowry does it.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Good acting if you like Tommy Lee Jones, but a strange movie. Not necessarily one that I'd watch again, but I do not regret watching it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey has made me extremely happy with this story. It is superb. I can feel the character reactions, their tension.<br /><br />Everything about the story is beautiful. The setting, a desolated and destroyed world, is there anything to it? You will discover the riches of this world slowly, carefully, detail by detail, but with a huge space to discover more, which is fantastic.<br /><br />The characters are awesome. No bad guys, no good guys, just people with a different set of values and morals all brought up by a series of events. It is so fantastic how every character has deep emotions and it is great to come to terms with the hardest decisions made. Never before have I seen so much care for the main character feelings instead of their actions.<br /><br />Action packed. There is so much going on, and it is great that Howey doesn't get into great detail into it, just the important things that help develop the characters.<br /><br />Female hero! This is a first for me. I have never before seen a female hero as the one in the Wool series.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Howey, I already bought the shift series.
B00000J0O2|1.0|Toner was old. It started printing very light but still bearable to use. Then worked for about 2 weeks and becomes blurry and smudges. Drum dirty. Try to clean but got worse. Now print blobs and streaks. HP packaging but item says from China. Should get a refund!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The most amazing book I have ever read. The third in a series of three, the most compellingly, heart-wrenching of the three. I had to stop so many times to wipe the tears from my eyes that it probably took me twice as long to read. I highly recommend the trilogy!!!!!
B004UQPM4E|5.0|First off let me say I don't know what people are talking about when they say it's the UK or Spanish version. All I can think is that sometimes Amazon associated/merges reviews of similar but different products (ie a DVD release & Bluray, a previous version of a product). I thoroughly examined the packaging and it clearly says US, and not for sale outside the US.<br /><br />PACKAGING: Very cool. The lid cap slides off breaking away right were the diamond cap of the Superman Logo and the bottom triangle juts out. (the whole logo traves with the lid. The inner packaging is nice, though I do have some long term concerns about the pastic disc holders that are glued to the cardboad packaging. This isn't specific to this product and I haven't had a problem with this product, but have had other box sets start to separate.<br /><br />THE COLLECTION: Most will agree that the fist two movies are classic and the second two are ehhhh...Well the restoration is great. I do agree with another reviewer that Bluray does bring out some of the limitations in special EFX of the day, but what can you do. Great to see these cleaned up and all bright and new(unlike seeing it on TV where it looks muddy).<br /><br />AUDIO: I listened to this through a surround system (Bose Acoustimass with an Onkyo reciever if you're curious) and it sounds incredible. I think they did an even better job on the audio restoration than the video.<br /><br />OVERALL: Big Thumbs up here folks. If you're a fan of Superman or Super Hero movies, how could you not add this to your collection!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|This is an example of great writing.  The style, pace, characters, descriptions, settings, action--all of it.  It's great. I read this book in a literature class and really enjoyed it.  It is perhaps the best classic I have read besides Tolkien's The Hobbit.  Treasure Island manages to stand alone as the go-to book on pirates, sea voyages, and young men seeking adventure.  Before anyone decides to read children's or YA literature, they must first read Treasure Island to get an idea of what a good book should contain.<br />Question: Why haven't they made a modern movie of this?  It would be great cinema.
0938045768|5.0|If you are looking to build functional strength and power, buy this book.  If you are looking for useless isolation exercises, gimmicks, and buzzwords, then look elsewhere.  If you are self-motivated, buy this book.  If you need some yo-yo in spandex holding your hand through a dvd, then start flipping channels for the right infomercial.  If you want to heal & repair injuries using exercises that build tendon & muscle strength, buy this book.  If you are looking to hurt yourself by bouncing 400lbs. off your chest, then skip this book and go to the gym.  This book is cheaper than a single personal training session... give it a shot.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Item was exactly as described my daughter loves the movie and has to watch it almost everynight. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was probably my favorite Sparks' novel to date.  I remained interested throughout my reading, and enjoyed the developing relationship between the two main characters.  Sparks did an excellent job of creating the 'demented' husband character, providing a strongly written characterization of a person with mental illness.  Sparks remains adept at description.<br /><br />A bit of a spoiler below:<br />I would have given the book a five-star review, were it not for the seemingly sudden appearance of a supernatural component.  (There may have been foreshadowing, but I missed it.) I get why he included it, but it just didn't work for me.  But in short, a very good read.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|The Sherlock Holmes stories are written more than a hundred years ago, but are still eminently readable today. The language is so beautiful that many passages lend themselves to multiple readings. The stories are a rare, true glimpse into the world as it was more than a hundred years ago - not reconstructed by a modern author, but described by a contemporary one. Truly unique.<br /><br />This book has illustrations that are not the original Sidney Paget drawings. A bit sad, but on the other hand this is the best volume for reading on a Kindle because the formatting has been done wonderfully. Other efforts are a bit too much cut'n'paste.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|As a professional format editor, I offered to help someone prepare their book for publication as an e-book.  Not only did this publication provide details I expected, like acceptable file formats and requirements for cover art, it also provided simple, but essential formatting tips for beginners. It doesn't read like a technical manual, but still prepares you to provide your reader with a seamless experience across several possible viewing platforms. And all that for free? Kudos!
1616960922|5.0|I read the book.  Then downloaded the audible version and listened.  Then read it again.  This book is very nearly perfect.  Characterization is swift, compelling, genuine.  The world, the magic, the plot, the flow, are like threads in a beautiful tapestry.  I read this on the Kindle and as I read, even while under the spell of the novella, the countdown was dismaying...45% done...60% done...  I am eager to hear more about Shai and her world, but I doubt that will happen. When an author makes a work so complete, smooth, and perfect, he's unlikely to make a lesser sequel.  Lightning can strike twice, though.  I hope it does.  [[ASIN:B00BXWJAM8 The Emperor's Soul]]
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love Alawar games. They have great graphics and an excellent story line. Before I realize it I am finishing the game and ready for another one. The puzzles enhance the HO of the game. Can't. wait for the next game. Keep producing great games and we will continue to play them.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|Being a computer engineer, I usually have trouble with the \\"Computers taking over the world\\" books. Usually, something happens within the story that is completely out of tune with how computers behave and interact (at least based on current or imagined technology). I was thrilled that this was not the case with Daemon. Other than the fact that the Daemon is created by a single person, the fact that something like this could exist is not unfeasible at all! And most of the ideas presented are also really well grounded. It made for a thoroughly enjoyable, page turner of a book. I have read it twice and suspect I will read it again. The sequel (Freedom) is just as good.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Great for immigrants! I thought it was so amazing that I couldn't believe my own eyes!  Best things ever!  Amazing!
B003V4AK8E|4.0|This Xbox-style controller functions really good on the Playstation 3. I was a little bit skeptical about purchasing a third party controller but I now don't regret my transaction. I wanted another controller in addition to my two other Sony ones so that I can have a back up if the latter ones degrade with usage. But I ended up  making this Pro Elite a primary controller since I like it after all, and don't use the Sony ones as often, allowing me to extend their life. The battery seems to be very good, last quiet very long after full charge (I play about three times a week and so far have charged this controller once every two weeks). It does take some time to get used to it as you're transitioning to something resembling an Xbox 360 accessory. If you want a second controller or a spare but don't necessarily want to spend a lot of money for a Sony, I would recommend this unit.
1616614609|4.0|For those who loved Magic, but want more bang for their buck and don't mind a hacker sci-fi theme, this could be a good product. If your still interested, and wanted Magic to be a bit more complicated, a little bit longer, and allow for a bit of bluffing, this is a GREAT game!<br /><br />You will only be able to create one varied hacker & one varied corp deck at a time with this set though, so you will likely want at least a couple $12 expansions after a few games.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|THIS GAME IS AMAZING ITS SUPER FUN YOU FIGHT ZOMBIEZ AND SOME ONI BOSSES!!<br />I RECOMMEND YOU BUY IT!! ITS WORTH IT!
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|This move is great, but I almost gave up streaming this through Amazon after my 10th restart and fast forwarding of the movie.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Yes, it's just a word guessing game.  Yes, it can be crazy simple compared to real puzzle & adventure games.  Yes, you may find yourself getting bored after a few games.  But for something to pass a few minutes, this is a great choice.  The graphics are cute, the music is not bad and the animations make me smile.  So there.<br /><br />I got about 10 games in before it crashed, but when I went back it remembered where I left off.  Not bad!  Another oddity I noticed is that I was, by sheer luck, able to guess a word in its entirety without once getting a wrong letter.  It gave me zero points for that!
0061950726|5.0|What an amazing story about a period in history I knew so little about it. The author really does an wonderful job bringing the Orphan Train to life.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The person selling this film is a good seller imo.  Thank you.  I think Avatar 3D is one of the best 3D films ever made.  The graphics as well as the story is just awesome.<br /><br />:)
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I was concerned about monitoring my battery usage with my new Kindle Fire HD, as I had read in some reviews that there was a higher drain on the battery than with my 1st generation Fire. After going through reviews of this battery monitor app, I thought it sounded like something I could really use. Downloaded it and let it go to town. It is easy to understand and use so I think it will be a really handy tool as I use my FireHD.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Filled with great characters and interesting historical plots.  for a soap opera, feels very real and not frivilous in the least bit.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book, it kept me interested and entertained, good story line, kept me in suspense too. Liked it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Awesome move! This is definitely the best of the series thus far. Bond get better, and a bit darker, with each movie. I do miss the gadgets though.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun. Fast but uses your credits. Cost to much to buy more.I could spend hours playing if it didn't cost so much.
1589946901|5.0|I was on the fence about this game from the get go, I wasn't sure if I would be able to get my friends into a game about football/fantasy, but I am definitely glad I did. The game mechanics are pretty easy to pick up, I was able to teach my friends how to play in about ten minutes and about halfway through our first playthrough they all seemed to know what was going on. All of the teams play very differently and there is more strategy involved than I originally thought. The cards are well made and have awesome artwork and all of the tokens are printed on a sturdy cardboard so this game should withstand a bit. The only thing I didn't like about the game is that the Human team seems to be a little overpowered when compared to the others. They tried to to make them pretty good at everything but awesome at nothing....but they are good enough at everything to the point where if played right, they can overrun the entire game.
B008LG6SXS|4.0|Nice app! It's simple and works fine. Speed is also correct. It makes it simple when using it on kindle.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|It would pause up and go to standard definition during any action sequence. Which is odd as this is an animated movie.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I like that you can change up the difficulty by increasing the number of pieces and allowing for rotation in this app.  The images are really pretty but I did have some issues with pieces getting &#34;lost&#34; under the board.  I had to drag the put together part to the side to find the missing pieces.  It would be nice if there was a button to return all single pieces to the draw pile on the side so this layering of pieces wasn't an issue.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The content of the book balances scientific insights of a noted expert on the brain- the author- with his extraordinary near death experiences. His personal story expands the proof that indeed physics and metaphysics are joining to prove how little human beings know and how much research needs to done in areas beyond our ken. A hopeful book about what lies beyond for all humans.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|I'm glad I didn't read this until I was 34. Gripping and thought provoking. Characters are compelling and believable. Brace yourself.
B0091REZMW|3.0|the game would be more fun if the energy restored faster and if diamonds were available from exploring not having to actually spend money. some people really enjoy these games but delete it because they cant make it far when they run out of diamonds so fast and dont have the funds to just spend on gaming. fun with lots to do.
1612931103|4.0|If you are looking forward to improve your writing skills in english. This is the book! Very concise and well written.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I bought this mainly for the A team like most people but after listening to the CD nonstop I have to say while I still love that song it is no longer my favorite. My favorite actually changes every day because there are so many good songs on here.
0062059963|5.0|[...]<br /><br />You know you have a good book in your hands when it just sticks to your fingers like glue. I started reading \\"The Elite\\", the sequel to Kiera Cass's riveting \\"The Selection\\", only a couple nights ago, and finished it last night! I read \\"The Selection\\" when it came out last year, and, much to my surprise, my sister devoured it on her own Kindle as well--and that's when you know you have an exceptionally interesting read in your hands.<br /><br />Thirty-five girls came to the palace to compete in the Selection, to win over Prince Maxon's heart. Just six remain. And only one will be chosen as the crown princess of Illea. Seventeen-year-old America still isn't sure where her heart lies. Her new and exciting romance with Maxon sweeps her off her feet, but when she sees Aspen standing guard around the palace, she can't help but be overcome with memories of her childhood sweetheart and the future they planned together. But the stakes are higher than before. The rebels' attacks are growing more frequent and destructive, and a devastating loss makes America question whether this is what she really wants. And with the clock ticking, America knows that a happy ending might be harder to achieve than she thought.<br /><br />One of the most significant aspects in \\"The Elite\\" is the romance--that swoon-worthy, heart-stopping romance. I finished \\"The Selection\\" in a state of indecision like America. Sure, Maxon's the handsome, charming prince, but Aspen's her ever-loyal childhood sweetheart! What's even more interesting in \\"The Elite\\" is that Ms. Cass never makes it obvious who America's going to end up with, something that a lot of YA novels tend to do from the beginning. As the story progresses, however, we're most definitely left to our own judgments of the characters, since every single one of them has their individual flaws and personalities. I don't want to taint your own judgment about Maxon, Aspen and America with my own, but let me just say that I'm definitely leaning towards one of the boys now! Another thing is that there's some great potential danger in having your heroine fence-sit so much over two boys, but I think Ms. Cass did a good job in not letting me hate on America for being a bit of a player.<br /><br />As for America herself, I definitely grow to like her even more in \\"The Elite\\". There's some great character development going on throughout the novel, and at the end of it, I got the picture of a strong, passionate heroine who still retains her seventeen-year-old-ness. What I mean by that is that while America is determined and well-meaning, she still makes rash mistakes and has a lot to learn about the world around her, especially since Illea is in a state of war. I also love the fact that she's just an overall kind person, who's compassionate and loyal to her family and friends, no matter what caste they're in. I especially loved her relationship with her dad--they're more like friends than anything, and that kind of reminded me of my own relationship with my dad.<br /><br />The plot of \\"The Elite\\" was no less intense than that of \\"The Selection\\", and it had me flipping through the pages like a madman. When I wrote in the synopsis earlier that the stakes are higher than before, I wasn't kidding. The tension is really up there throughout the novel, not only with the rebellion and the war, but also emotionally with the whole Selection and the pressure it puts on you as a contender. There are so many twists and turns that had me on the edge of my seat, and it just makes me all the more excited to see how everything ends in the final book of the trilogy.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Elite\\" is an exciting, engaging sequel with wonderfully dreamy romances, a strong and believable heroine and a gripping storyline. I highly recommend \\"The Selection Trilogy\\" for anyone who loves exciting stories--I've seen so many statements and reviews of the book making similarities with reality TV shows. Definitely worth a read!<br /><br />Rating: 4.5/5
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is currently my favorite show and possibly my favorite ever. Getting it instantly on amazon video was amazing because I needed to be caught up quickly
0525478817|4.0|When I found out this was a book about kids with cancer, I settled myself in for a long and painful read. But I found myself pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />This is not a book about a cancer patient's brave struggle. This is a book about a girl named Hazel and a boy named Gus.<br /><br />A thoughtful and honest tale. Thank you, John Green.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Bought this to listen to Little Talks and fell in love with the band. They have such interesting songs that I have enjoyed listening to while I do homework
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I purchased this cause I kind-of forgot how the story went. it was a long time ago since I watched this movie. All I can remember is that I was good, but couldn't remember why it was a good movie, LOL! Watched all of it, and yup! Its still pretty good ;)
B0098VXMNE|5.0|I have not completed all 10 episodes yet but this show keeps getting better and better. Although they had to change the actor due to the terrible circumstance I still love the show. I do not have HBO so being able to get it on amazon has been amazing
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was especially intrigued by the fact this was written by a medical professional, specifically a neurosurgeon who has a unique knowledge and understanding of the human brain and its functions.  His interpretation of his experience offers more validity to the stories of people's NDE.  I found it to be comforting and calming and would recommend it to anyone, everyone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|what a great way to relax after chasing the kids around all day.  I would recommend all moms to chill out and play
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|I am someone that lists to a variety of music, I enjoy everything from Lil Wayne to Adele to Coldplay. I didn't go into this CD expecting to be impressed, but I left a new fan of their music. If you have any interest in this project or you just want to add a bit of variety to your collection, this CD is well worth the money.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|My wife has the original Kindle and uses a simple leather cover that wraps around and snaps closed with a magnet.  I was looking for something similar.  No such luck.  I selected this product primarily because it is leather and would offer some protection if dropped.<br /><br />The HD has a key hardware design change impacting case design; the charging port was moved from the end to the side.<br /><br />This case has a hard plastic holder that keeps your HD very securely in place. It is attached in a way that allows you to turn your HD to allow portrait (vertical) and landscape (horizontal) viewing.<br /><br />The three part cover lets you stand the HD on a table and adjust the viewing angle.  I watched one movie in bed with the HD resting on my stomach, but otherwise I have not use these functions.<br /><br />There is also a strap to slip your fingers/palm under to help you hold the HD.  Before I got the case, I questioned its value, but I found myself using this feature a lot.  You can relax your hand and still maintain control.<br /><br />The case is held closed with an elastic strap. It is also used to &#34;lock&#34; two of the three case sections together when holding your HD. Your thumb prevents the third section from flopping. While I question the strap's durability, it also allows charge port access when the case is closed.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Life of Pi....EXCELLENT. Great movie with introspective reflection of one's life, beliefs, and struggles with conflicting life decisions. Oh yea...there is a tiger in the mix. I liked this movie a lot!..highly recommend! Plus the ending is a great hmmm what do I think about it or what really happened twister. Watch to found out...you won't regret it.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I was so scared while reading this book. I found myself sitting on the edge off seat in  suspension. Overall this was an excellent book.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie...action...brooding batman, demons of past...villains...great equipment...drama..betrayal and it is all in one movie. Long and entertaining movie. They really packed this movie with as much as they could and they did a great job of it.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I really enjoyed this game until I realized you cannot complete most levels unless you are on Facebook and have teammates or individuals who will gift you a puzzle piece. I am not on Facebook for personal and professional reasons, but I should be able to play and win on this game regardless.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I had high hopes for this film as I love the Lord of the Rings and while it was good it just did not entertain as much I had hoped. I know the fans of this film will bash me but I felt the movie struggled initially. The good news is if you stay with it it does get better. I think the second movie will be better. Good action scenes and also great to Gandalf and have some explaining to the back drop of the story prior to Lord of the Rings.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun until you run out of energy. I feel like I could spend hours playing this game.  If you like hidden objects games give this one a try!
B008EQIEWS|4.0|The original is better but this one is a excellent modern take on it. I liked although Pegasus riding looked a little to CGI at times. Good watch.
0099513757|3.0|Tjis book was recommended to me by someone he said it was a great book. I started it but didn't like. I will not read it.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|The movie with OK...kid friendly and entertaining. Probably something great to watch with kids or family. This movie probably needs to be the end of the line of MIB movie franchises as some movies need to be allowed to retire peacefully.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars...three days after closing the book. My greatest regret at this moment is that it took me so long to read it. I have had it sitting on my shelf for nearly a year. I had to steel myself to read it because I knew it was a \\"kids with cancer book\\". No, I knew it was a KIDS WHO DIE OF CANCER book. I have a kid, and I know kids with cancer. See my problem? Days ago I forced myself to read the first two chapters. I was OK. The next night? I fell in love with the main characters, Hazel and Augustus. These were NOT kids dying of cancer. These were kids trying to squeeze every minute of life they had remaining out of their early termination notice. These kids were REAL. They were funny, angry, realistic, day-dreaming, pain-in-the-you-know-where teens LIVING in that flash in the pan moment between birth and death. I read everything but the last 100 pages. When you read it, you'll know why...and you really should read it. Again, I had to rally my forces. The last 100 pages? I cried an ocean. Not because John Green was yanking my chain or because I cry over puppy chow commercials (okay, sometimes), but again because these voices were real, and heartbreaking, and somehow amazingly hopeful. That book is now sitting on my shelf waiting on my 10-year-old to read it in a few years, when she and I are ready to share it and cry another ocean. This is YA literature at its best as far as I am concerned. I am a lifetime member of the John Green fan club even if he never writes another thing except cereal box ingredients. *News Flash: Today, our literacy coach called me on the phone to tell me one of her students just finished reading TFIOS, walked up to her and said, \\"I think I need to go somewhere and take a minute.\\" You too will need a minute...or hours or days...to recover. Get those Kleenex out. You have been warned!
B002YCVX5S|3.0|It has its good points for sure....I know its comedy of sorts but I found the accent Brad Pitt portrayed profoundly annoying. It is campy comedy.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I went gluten-free over a year ago, and although I felt a little better, I still felt like I was struggling just to get by every day. I read this book and did two Whole 30s back-to-back and this is the best I've ever felt.<br /><br />My recommendation: read the book, give it a try. This isn't some fad diet, it's a healthy lifestyle that brings you to a place above and beyond &#34;I feel okay.&#34;
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Looper = Bruce Willis fighting to survive while trying to preventing his younger version from killing himself in the past that will cause death in the future. I know what your thinking...HUH? Yea...it gets confusing at times but it is a great sci-fi movie. I know at times I wish I could go back in time and smack the younger me! Good movie...would watch again...if I was not afraid It may cause problem in the present forcing me to wait to kill the future me while in the past...huh? yea it is confusing lol.

I have a Kindle Fire and there are times when I'm doing my email and need to print a document and couldn't before, but can now that I have the ePrint app!  It works so slick!  This is definitely an advantage for those on the go with their mobile devices who would need to print something.  You can send it and it will be waiting for you when you get to the printer!

B000000W57|5.0|Vintage Stones for anyone wants to know the Stones.  I've heard there is a &#34;newer&#34; censored version and whoever decided to distort good music into something nice and bland for the delicate of ear needs another job, unless somehow they are just boosting prices of the re-release.  Nothing wrong with marketing gimics if that's what it is, cause they know any classic rock fan will only settle for what was once original.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|I LIKE TO WATCH IT WHEN THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO. NOTHING SPECIAL, JUST SIMPLE STORY, GOOD HUMOR, SOME PRACTICAL INSIGHTS. MANY PEOPLE CAN RELATE, ESPECIALLY WOMEN.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|Growing up and attending college in the 60`s, I read Brabara Tuchman's Guns of August and I had pretty much accepted her thesis, voiced by John Kennoedy that when it came to understanding the causes of World War I. \\"Ach... If we only knew.\\" Was the phrase teachers and commentators used over and over again.  I came to understand that the nations stumbled into was and never quite knew what happened.<br /><br />Clark's book, Sleepwalkers, How Europe Went to War in 1914, totally challenges that thesis. With incredible detail, Clark takes us back through the last decades of the 19th century and the beginnings of the 20th to show the tensions between the major countries in Europe, how Serbia and its government and its underground guerrilla movements both was used as a cause and a ruse to ignite the Great War.  We see how the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was not just a triggering event, but really the final act in the conflicts between Serbia and Austria-Hungary.<br /><br />Beyond that conflict, Clark makes a convincing case that the major powers, France,Germany, Russia, and England wanted war.  They each believed that going to war in August of 1914 would be advantageous for their countries and its policies and ambitions. Clark walks us through each governments debates, treaty obligations, and decision making process which demonstrates  how such arrogance and blind ambition led to the catastrophic war.<br /><br />The lasting impression for me was how contemporary this book and its lessons are.  We have just experienced such \\"wars of choice\\" and seemingly have failed to learn the lessons of WWII. Clark also convincingly argues that each of the warring nations saw itself as the \\"victim\\" of threats and potential attacks, thus making their decision to go to war justifiable. Our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan fall into the same categories with the same reasons for going to war.<br /><br />I would send every president,prime minister, and military chiefs a copy of Sleepwalkers and hope they might hesitate the next time they feel they ARE FORCED by circumstances to send young men and women to war.
0345803485|1.0|i should have read the reviews before starting the book! im glad i 'm not the only one who feels this way. as someone already said the reviews are more entertaining than this joke of a novel. i cannot understand how this book got more than one star. considering that it was written for mature readers i felt i would have liked it better when i was a teenager reading mills and boon novels,no they were better written. i have read some crappy books in my time but this tops them all. the characters too shallowly portrayed to connect to, the story watery with sex scenes floating around like sapped out meatballs, the wording repetitive to the point of me gritting my teeth at every \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"the crap series\\". the heroine was too naive and self-absorbed, the hero vague and for all the description of his manliness, not manly enough.<br /><br />what was she thinking? did she just sit back and let some teenager write it? seriously, how did it get to the bestselling list? that's the biggest mystery. ugh, what a big fat waste of time reading it, thinking \\"wth did i read this\\" and now writing about it. please save yourself the energy.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|I bought this for my son as a gift -- and was really surprised at how tiny it is once assembled.  He's 9, and breezed through assembling -- and ended up with a 4x4x4 inch cube.  Guess I thought for the price and number of pieces that it would be equivalent to other Lego sets of similar price & pieces, but every piece in the box was one of those tiny, single peg pieces.  So a little disappointed at what I spent on it overall, but my son does like it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Solved the problem -- my Kindle now charges to the maximum.  thanks.  Your technician solved the problem without too much fuss.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great story, mixed with time travel and history.  What's not to love?  I had given up reading King for awhile, because his books were too long with not enough &#34;meat&#34; to them, as if he were writing to see just how many pages he could make his books.  Bottom line, read this book!
0345803485|4.0|I do have the above subject qualities and was very surprised this story read so easily (although a bit repetitive).  Certainly it is for adults only.  However, these are one inexperienced and one very damaged individual who obviously fall in love.  I'd not expected to become so involved in what will happen in the next 2 volumes, but I do now want to see how any of their problems are resolved and if any damage can be helped.  Oh graphic it is, so open minded people only should be reading this as well.  Thus the varying degrees of like or dislike.  It's plain and simple and easy reading.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I can tell why this game is a best seller.  It is fast, fun and colorful. The goal of the game is simple: eat as many fish as you can before a hungry killer whale eats you.  But to win takes strategy and planning.  You must maneuver your two penguins around the ice float gathering fish and trying to trap other players without getting yourself trapped (and eaten).<br /><br />Fun, and not too hard.  Great for kids or for adults who just want an amusing diversion.<br /><br />The Pros are numerous:<br />* great user interface<br />* cute graphic<br />* games that is easy to play but takes planning and strategy to play well<br />* it has a tutorial, navigation buttons, and an actual Exit button.<br />* music and sound effects are cute and they included seperate volume controls for each<br /><br />On the Con side I can't think of much wrong with this game.  Give me a minute. Nope can't think of anything.  Well maybe one thing. Instead of the last penguin getting eaten like the rest, I would like to see him flip off the killer whale and paddle his ice float to safety.<br /><br />*** Edited to change sharks to killer whales.  Thanks, George! ***
B005K17RU0|5.0|Haven't used a free app this nice in...Well ever. The interfaces are easy to read and understand and it even offers local weather videos and news stories. 10/10 I'd definitely recommend this app to anyone who has a need for getting weather updates on the go.
B00A9X9VAI|2.0|The words that came to mind while watching this movie were: disjointed, disconnected, confusing, and unrealistic.  There were many more similar to those, and the list got longer the more I watched it.  First of all, it is not science fiction, it's fantasy!  For a million reasons, there is no time travel, there will be no time travel, the whole concept is totally speculative at best since you would have to rearrange the rules of the universe to accommodate it, not to mention use a ton of power to effect it.<br />  As some have pointed out, there is no need for \\"loopers\\" in the first place, scifi or otherwise, which are a ridiculous construct to try to fabricate a storyline.  This is a \\"story\\" that happens when writers don't know the difference between scifi and fantasy, or just don't care.  This movie suffers from actually not being either.  There have been many stories about time travel which are fun because they don't try to take themselves too seriously, and so they're interesting to watch in the \\"what if you could ...\\" vein.  But there is NOTHING in this movie that can actually EXIST, even potentially!  Every bit of it is so preposterous, that it just can't hold your interest. There is no real drama, because what is here is simply thrown at the viewer, like spaghetti against a wall, whether it makes sense or not; you are always aware it's totally made up, destroying your \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\"; there is nothing which hangs even remoptely on anything scientific or plausible, including their \\"TK\\" (telekinetic) people.<br />  Telekinesis, if there were any, still would need POWER - it's not magic! And to create winds, throw entire rooms of furniture around, and blow people up, it takes POWER, that is, ENERGY.  A human being cannot MANUFACTURE it, he would have to BORROW it from somewhere, in huge amounts. They didn't do that here, they just materialized it out of thin air to create an effect: an impossible one, which makes it a silly one. This is one moreimplausibility on top of a host of them that make no true sense and are genuinely imposible and will always be impossible.<br />  \\"Looper\\" is not a story about MAGIC, which it should be to make all these various things occur, and places it clearly in the fantasy realm; but pure fantasy stories are much better and more believable than this, like the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies, for instance.  Good performances by the actors here save the movie from being worse than it is, but can't elevate it to a more engaging vehicle. One always knows everything that is happening is impossible and preposterous, and that saves it from being any kind of moving or productive drama. It abandons your intelligence, and thus abandons your heart, leaving you with nothing but a puzzle that has no answers.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I just love Josh Groban music.  He just outdoes himself with every album.  I look forward to his next tour!!!!
0345803485|4.0|So, is there faults with this book?  Yes, many.  But did I enjoy it and have a hard time putting it down.  Yes, very much so.  I actually liked the story and development of the characters and will read the next two in the series simply because I'm hooked on what Grey has in his past.  Are some the the sex scences over the top.  Extremely.  Even if in ever sexual encounter they could have ended it with just one time--but they have to do it like 2-3 times, everytime.  How can he keep it going?  And wow, can she have multiple orgasms.  Pleaseee.  My goodness, enough already.  I mean when you start to skim the sex parts of the book...And yes, he is a posessive freak and she needs to get a grip and leave, but, I finished it in 2 days and will read the next two books.  It's just what it is...a little naughty novel that's a bit over the top, but a quick and fun read.
1936891026|5.0|Reading this book is a lot like sitting yourself down and having that hard truths talk about all of the things that you know you are doing by not &#34;doing.&#34;<br />Being a functional creative most of my life and entertainment industry professional for over 15 years, I'm no stranger to getting up every day and placing myself in front of my work rain or shine, so a lot of this book had me nodding with a slight smile of recognition saying, &#34;yyyep! I know, I know...&#34; So it really reads like a trusted friend putting a hand on your shoulder and looking you in the eye to reassure you that this is all very natural, but seriously, the clock is ticking, get to work, you'll be very glad you did.<br />I'll be reading this one over and over for quite a while and then picking it up tattered years from now when I need a little kick in the ass, yet again, because that's just how it goes.
B002JWD6AS|2.0|I love stuff like this. I even live in Minnesota. I RARELY abandon books or series- I like to see them through to the end. This one just did nothing for me. I didn't like the characters. It was boring. I gave it two stars because the writing (as I remember it) wasn't bad. I think it's just a lack luster story to begin with. Very disappointing.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|loved this DVD. It's better than the movie in many aspects.  Beautiful talent and you feel like you are actually there.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A well written (if forgettable) love story. It was a very quick and painless read for me. Probably not one that I'd go back any time and do again but I really enjoyed it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Great second book. I loved guessing along with America about the true motives of everyone around her...give me the next book in this series quickly!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not so good with sappy anything- not books, not movies and not tv. This, I liked. It made me wonder why I don't read more of his books. Great characters and an entertaining (if somewhat creative) storyline.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I'm extremely satisfied with this case.  I have my kindle fire hd in the case in a direction that allows me to charge it with the cover closed.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is backwards, but no matter which app I'm using it works in that direction.<br /><br />The materials feel good in the hand and look like they will be very durable.<br /><br />I'd recommend this case.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I love these books but this... this was not my favorite. To be fair, this man keep SO many plots and characters in the air at any one time that there just had to be a point where he'd have to start wrapping things up. Logically, I know this to be true. My advice for the brave reader who is thinking about taking them on is to not worry about losing track of details. Martin does a great job of reminding the reader who everyone is as he goes... just keep plugging along and you'll be fine.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Love love love this cd, definitely a favorite. It came quicker then expected, the packaging was great, no scratches on the cd or any problems playing the cd. Everyone should own this one

B003N9ASEI|5.0|I was in H.S. when this came out. This movie,to me, is in the easy top 5 best movie comedy's of all time. Give it a look, you will laugh your bottom off!
B004SBQAN8|5.0|great story with some &#34;holes&#34; but would have been great if 30 or more minutes longer. I just bought it because I'm collecting Olyphant's movies. Better than I had hoped for though. Tim does not normally lend himself to anything not worthwhile. Good movie overall.
B00005JCCE|5.0|As a second year medical student, and rather accelerated in age, (smiles) this film reminds me of some very rare and exceptional doctors who were able to achieve at a  minimum what the fictional Patch Adams does.  I have ascended to the ardor of Don Quioxte-ness in wanting to return to becoming a physician, and find that my own medicinal qualities are done in respect and honor of the soul living inside of a terminally ill body that just wishes to have one last go at life as portrayed in this film.<br /><br />Although Dr. Hunter Adams did not care for the portrait of the sceen version of him (for which i agree his perspective and viewpoint) the quality of the film reminds the medical community of the 1990's of a wake up call that never got answered. I realize that altruism in some respects is an inherent quality that is nurtured over time, but at this stage in my life, I find that I was simply waiting for the time to come when I would embark upon such a journey.<br /><br />The film is heartwarming, and the role of Hunter Adams was scripted and written for Robin Williams---who went through his natural aesthetics of what he would do as Dr. Adams. That is where I believe that a lot of where the screenplay took a risk due to the popularity and draw of the character actors involved for the screen version, and where most of the criticism is stemmed from.<br /><br />The direction and behind the scenes material is a must have. There is a lot of what helps the audience to understand the tragic mix in this melodrama that has a redemptive, bittersweet quality. Take a shot and put this in your keepers vault of media. It is an awesome film that goes to the core of who we really are: Human.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|A well crafted story, each word chosen with care.  Unexpected descriptions and poignant use of metaphor act as &#34;palate cleansers&#34; so that the twists and turns of the narrative defy prediction but taste just right.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book! I dont normally go for romance novels...but this was great!! She is a a gifted writer!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It is well written, holding m th attention from beginning to end as well as making me laugh as well as cry.  I really was fascinated that it was written from the dog's point of view; makes you wonder if our pets can really think and try to c o communicate with us.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I was happy to hear Peter Jackson would be directing &#34;The Hobbit&#34; because I thought he did a terrific job with &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34;. I really liked the way he incorporated the first part of &#34;The Fellowship of the Ring&#34; (with appropriate additional scenes) into the opening of &#34;The Hobbit&#34;. I saw the movie in 3D at the movie theater, which was pretty cool. But even the HD version without the 3D is still stunning visually. I am sooo looking forward to the rest of the tale. I am equally excited for the &#34;extended&#34; version of this movie to come out.
030758836X|4.0|I give this book four stars in spite of really disliking the ending. It's a clever and intelligently written book that captivated my attention. By the time I realized one of the characters is a psychopath, I was too far into it to care. At first I feared it may be another book like We Need to Talk about Kevin, and in some ways it is, but the tone is really much lighter and at times more entertaining. I truly appreciated the scathing indictment it makes of the ridiculous rituals men and women do in the name of romance. I felt the subtext of the insane relationship the book chronicles is that there is something seriously wrong with heterosexual romantic love in general and gender roles in particular. (The character Amy's rant about the phenomenon of the \\"cool girl\\" was for me the highlight of the book!). Of course, the situation in the novel is most extreme (and most relationships are merely neurotic rather than psychotic like this one), but then this is fiction. I did enjoy Gone Girl, but I felt the story went on too long and the dynamics were just too much. After a point I was sick to death of both Amy and Nick and didn't feel any payoff at the end.

0802130208|1.0|There is no middle ground with the readers of this book. You either love it or hate it. Intensely. If you don't find it to your taste within the first 3 to 4 pages don't bother expecting it to get better. If you do, you will find this a joy worth reading for years to come. I was in the hate category. I found that all of the characters are intensely dislikeable and I wished armageddon on every....single....one. The lovers of this book may say that I just missed the subtleties of the writing but whilst the writing was actually excellent, the content was, to my tastes, neither intelligent, surprising or thought provoking. There were no surprises just continous banality with a few mixed absurdities. It was, however, completely aggrevating.<br />I hold no anomosity to the lovers of this book. If this is your thing, peace be with the legions of fellow fans. Just don't think that everyone will be one of them. It is one of those anomolies that delight some and reduces others to tears of boredom. Remember, 3 to 4 pages.....
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of the best games out there to both make time go by and have fun. I am planning on getting the PC version but I think Minecraft is better than Block Story, Survival Craft, and those blocky games like that. So if you like Survival Craft or Block Story do those have online multiplayer? The new update of Minecraft will have it ( 0.7.0 ). I don't think so. This has easy controls ( my sister is horrible at games and she can do it ),it has mobs like monsters,chickens,and cows. This might not be worth 7 bucks now but after 0.7.0 it will be worth that so you should get it now while you can. I think this is a better choice than other blocky games<br /><br />  ---- By The Best Game Reviewer

B004SBS8LA|3.0|This is probably my favorite AB game, although I like them all enough to have paid for the non-ad versions.  I recently upgraded to a Droid DNA which has an HD screen.  Suddenly all the graphics have shrunk to miniscule size.  This has happened on all the AB games, but on this one it is especially bad.  Yes, I can zoom in within the game, but the menu/episode screen is really hard to read and the buttons are very tiny and hard to push accurately because you have to be so precise with your touch.  HD should make things look BETTER, not worse.  Rovio - please fix!  If you do, I will upgrade to 5 stars!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I would play it then I would go out of it and when I went back in it wouldn't let me!!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Being a Vietnam veteran I can relate about serving your country...and not always appreciated.  I thank God for very brave men like Chris Kyle. He did what he loved, and loved what he did with an extraordinary zeal. I truly admire his sense of<br /><br />duty to his country.  I think the book was well written. It is one you do not want to put down as it is exciting and almost makes you feel there with him. If you are into reading a good biography, action book , and a patriotic book, this is a book you will thoroughly enjoy.  I am so grateful for men like Chris who puts it all on the line for his country. I highly recommend  this book to any occasional or avid reader.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|A good read. Thought the story line was great. I also like the TV show. That's what made me want to read the books. On to the next one .
B009M588K8|5.0|Got this for the gramp who likes historical biographies and came with me to the opening of Zero Dark Thirty and pretty much narrated the whole time. Apparently it's an informative read, and satisfying for any military history buff to sink teeth into.
B001G1ACVY|5.0|I Love Jason Mraz's music and this cd is no exception. The DVD is a great bonus and I throughly enjoyed watching the live concert. Great product!
B003E8P9G0|3.0|This book is good. Has a great and captivating beginning, but it's not like the Percy Jackson stories. The characters are teetering on the edge of puberty and there is a boy and girl that the book centers around. I am not sure who the protagonist is, and I'm halfway through the book.
1476719071|1.0|I got half way and had to stop. I mean who is she kidding? what college campus gives two hoots about one girl's love life? To think that the whole college campus of kids really cares about the reputation of one person? that they spread rumors about her relationship or flock around her cafeteria table to listen to her conversations? Ridiculous. I wonder if Ms. McQuire began writing this as a pre-teen. What adult seriously thinks a man & woman can have such a relationship --living together, sleeping together, eating together, spending so much time together for a month with no physical or intimate activity happening? And then to have Travis as this guy who wants to be \\"just friends\\" with her--no he doesn't want to sleep with her; he just wants to be friends. c'mon--really? Travis is such a sad character. Out of the blue he decides he wants to be friends with Abby. He pursues her just to have as a friend, yet gets hostile with her for wanting to date someone else. Gets hostile with others who pursue her. Fights as a hobby. i was looking forward to reading this book. Got halfway through & thought i was wasting my time. Maybe a teen would enjoy this, but not an adult woman. Give me sonmething with a little more substance.

1451648537|5.0|I finally read the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson. I hesitated a long time (the original edition was published in 2011) because I feared disappointement. I had read the excellent The Apple Revolution as well as Return to the Little Kingdom. I finally read it in French and it is excellent. Read it if you have an interest in the topic. I'm not going to do any analysis, but as I usually do just mention some striking or subjective extracts. The citations refer to the French paperback release dated October 2012.<br /><br />Silicon Valley<br /><br />Various cultural earthquakes upset San Francisco and SiIicon Valley in the late 1960s. There was the technological revolution, initiated by the increase of military contracts, which had attracted electronics companies, chip manufacturers, designers of video games and computer manufacturers. There was a sub-culture, the pirates - inventors of genius, cyberpunks, dilettantes as well as pure geeks, they also had in their ranks electronicians refusing to fit the mold of HP and their impetuous children who wanted to break down all barriers. There were (quasi-academic) research groups, who led in vivo experiments on the effects of LSD, such as Doug Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center, who would later work at the development of the mouse and graphical user interfaces, or Ken Kesey, who praised the psychedelic drug in shows, combining music and light, run by a group of musicians who became the legendary Grateful Dead. There was also the hippie movement, from the Beat Generation of Kerouac, a native of San Francisco Bay, and political activists, born out of the Movement for Freedom of Expression of Berkeley. And encompassing all that, there were various spiritual movements seeking inner enlightenment - Zen, Hinduism, meditation, yoga, primal scream, sensory deprivation and Esalen massage.<br />Steve Jobs was the embodiment of the fusion of Flower Power and microchips, the pursuit of personal revelation and high tech: he was meditating in the morning, followed in the afternoon courses in physics at Stanford, working the Atari at night and dreaming of starting his own business. [Page 114]<br /><br />A passion for entrepreneurship<br /><br />Bushnell is of this opinion: \\"To be a successful entrepreneur, you must have something special and I saw this thing with Steve. He was not only interested in electronics, also by business. I showed him that one had to behave as if one would succeed in what one wanted to achieve and then everything would naturally follow. That's what I always say: if you pretend to know what you do, people will follow. \\"[Page 111]<br /><br />His closest friends think that having learned so young, he had been abandoned at birth had left indelible scars. \\"The need for total control of what he did comes from this injury\\" [Page 34] ... \\"The most amazing thing about Steve is that he cannot help being cruel to some people - a kind of Pavlovian response. The key to the mystery is the fact that he was abandoned at birth.\\" [Page 35]<br /><br />So he went back to Nolan Bushnell, \\"Steve asked me to put fifty thousand dollars on the table and in exchange he'd give me a third of Apple's shares. I thought I was smart and I said no. When I look back, I still laugh. Not to cry!\\" [Page 142]<br /><br />The reality distortion field<br /><br />- \\"This is madness. It is impossible. \\"<br />He was answered that Jobs would not listen.<br />- The best definition of this oddity, you find it in Star Trek. Steve creates a reality distortion field. In his presence, reality is malleable. It can make anyone believe almost anything. The effect of course disappears, when he is not there, but it prevents you seriously to have realistic expectations for anything.<br />RDF was a confusing mix of charisma and mental strength, it is the willingness to bend the facts so they fit the mold. [Page 207]<br />When Jobs decreed that the sodas in the fridge would be replaced by organic orange and carrot juice,someone on the team had printed T-shirts with: \\"Beware of Reality Distortion Field!\\" And on the back: \\"It comes from the juice!\\"<br /><br />There is a small bug page 225: To draw circles, Atkinson found a trick based on the fact that the sums of odd numbers gave a succession of perfect squares (for example, 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 3 + 5 = 8, etc.) [The statement is correct because the last sum is 9 and not 8!]<br /><br />Being a pirate<br /><br />\\"Better to be a pirate than join the navy\\" [Page 248] And the Jolly Roger decorated with the Apple logo floated for a few weeks on the roof of Bandley 3.<br /><br />The chapters on Jobs' private life and Pixar are quite interesting. About the IPO of Pixar: \\"Earlier that year, Jobs had tried to find a buyer for Pixar, for fifty million dollars, just to recover his funds. At the end of this historic day, the actions he had kept - about 80% of the company - were worth more than 20 times that amount: one billion two hundred million dollars! It was nearly five times more than he had gained with the Apple IPO in 1980. But Jobs did not care to make a fortune, as he told John Markoff of the New York Times: \\"I do not intend to buy a yacht. I never did it for the money.\\" [Page 471]. He is in this respect very different from Larry Ellison, founder and CEO of Oracle with whom he became a friend who helped him to return to Apple.<br /><br />Return to Apple<br /><br />In this regard, there is an funny anecdote page 482: \\"Two years ago, Guy Kawasaki, Macworld magazine columnist (and former Apple evangelist) published in the magazine a parody telling Apple was buying NeXT and elected Jobs as CEO. The article featuring Mike Markkula talking to Jobs: \\"You want to spend the rest of your life selling Unix with a nice coating, or change the world?\\" And Jobs replied:\\" Now I am a father and I do not want to play adventurers.\\" The article made the assumption: \\"Following his troubles with NeXT, it is possible that Jobs, in his return to the parent company, will bring the Apple management a dose of humility. Bill Gates was also quoted; he said that if Jobs returned to the business, Microsoft would again have innovations to copy! Everything was invented and purely humorous. But the reality has this annoying habit of catching up all satires. \\"([Page 482 and see below]<br /><br />And on his return: \\"His credo was perfection. He was not very good at compromise, or to arrange with reality. He did not like complexity. This was the case for the design of his products and the furniture of his houses, it was the same for his personal commitments. If he was sure of himself, then nothing could stop him, but if he had doubts, he sometimes preferred to throw in the towel rather than ending up in a situation that did not satisfy him completely. [Page 509]<br /><br />Death<br /><br />[With Markkula] They spent the rest of the time talking about the future of Apple. Jobs wanted to build a company that survives him and asked for his advice. Markkula replied that companies that remain are those who knew how to renew. That had been constant with Hewlett-Packard, beginning by constructing measuring instruments and then calculators and then again computers.\\" Apple was ousted by Microsoft from the market for personal computers, Markkula explained. You must change the course of Apple to another product. You have to be like a butterfly and accomplish your metamorphosis.\\" Jobs was hardly talkative, but he retained the lesson. [Page 515]<br /><br />The music was obviously an essential art in the life of Jobs. We know his passion for Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and the Beatles. But here's a most interesting part: Bach, he said, was his favorite classical composer. He particularly liked the contrast between the two versions of the Goldberg Variations recorded by Glenn Gould - the first in 1995 by the little-known pianist of twenty-two years that he was, and the second in 1981, a year before his death. \\"They are like night and day, Steve told me one dayafter having listened to one after the other. The first is exuberant, young, brilliant, played so fast that it is a revelation. The second is more efficient, more austere. It reveals a deep soul, a painful experience. \\"Jobs was sick for the third time when he listened to the two versions. I asked him which was his favorite version. \\"Gould preferred the latest version. In the past, I preferred the first, the exuberant. But now, I understand better what he meant.\\"<br /><br />Isaacson ends his book with a brilliant remark by Jobs on the topic of life and death. \\"But on the other hand, maybe it's like an on/off switch. Click and nothing more!\\" He paused again and smiled. \\"This is surely why I never liked the on/off switches on the Apple products.\\"<br /><br />The legacy<br /><br />I could have put these final remarks earlier in the section A passion for entrepreneurship. \\"My passion has been to build a sustainable business, where people were motivated to manufacture great products. Everything else was secondary. Of course, it was great to make a profit, because it allowed us to create good products. But the motivation is the product, not profit. [...] The difference is subtle, but in the end it is crucial because it defines all the people we hire, those we promote, the topics we discussed at meetings. [...] People do not know what they want until they have it in front of them. That's why I do not care about market research. [...] The intersection between the arts and sciences. I love this juncture, IL has a magical aura. [...] Our innovation holds a large part of humanity. I think great artists and great engineers are similar .. Both have the desire to express themselves. [...] I have my own theory to explain the decline of companies like IBM and Microsoft. The company did a great job, innovates and comes almost to a monopoly in some areas. It was then that the quality of the product becomes less important. The company praises great sales people [...] that eventually take control of the company. [...] I hate people who say they are entrepreneurs when their sole objective is to build a start-up that they will sell or go IPO. They do not have the desire to build a real company. [...] People should never stop innovating. [...] I think most creative people want to thank their predecessors who left their legacy.\\" [Pages 889-892]will bring the Apple management a dose of humility. Bill Gates was also quoted; he said that if Jobs returned to the business, Microsoft would again have innovations to copy! Everything was invented and purely humorous. But the reality has this annoying habit of catching up all satires. \\"([Page 482 and see below]<br /><br />And on his return: \\"His credo was perfection.

B00BDSRISA|3.0|Light, fluffy French disco pop. Nothing wrong with that for when the mood strikes. When done well, it is tres bien. The problem is that they are VERY heavy handed on the synths, causing general fatigue & loss of interest for the listener. Air does what Phoenix tries to do with much better results. There are a few cute songs here, nothing worthy of a SC soundtrack. All in all, this album sounds like it was birthed following a wild, long three day weekend in Paris. Going to listen to some Nick Drake now.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have not stop reading this book yet !!!!!<br /><br />I enjoy this book entirely. It has not let me down yet with each point and reference. Very interesting and enlightening.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is very addicting...it is very simple but fun..I work on the phones and this game is perfect I can turn away and focus on who I am talking to while the coins regenerate and when they are back it doesn't require so much focus that I cant pay attention to my customer while I play...I would definitely recommend :)

0743270754|5.0|The most complete and interesting books on the Lincoln presidency I have encountered.  Research and insight of Doris Kearns Goodwin makes this book a must for anyone wanting to understand who Lincoln was, and what made him a truly great American and president.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am not a normal Book reader.  But when I got Hold of this book, I just loved the Suspense and I could not put the book down.
B009O07NDY|3.0|I am not a big fan of movie sound tracks, if you are, it probably would be rated higher by you.  I bought this as a present for my wife who mentioned, after seeing the movie that she liked the soundtrack.  Like most soundtracks, she loves certain selections and others just come with it.  So, like the background music it is, if you want this type of background music playing at home or office, it's good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Like the Suspense.  I llike the fact that I could get the book on my iPad. Was easy to order.
B00APUQJLO|2.0|But this movie was a little bit out there in my opinion. But that's ok I will still watch anything he is in.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I liked the game.  I didn't realize you needed a Face Book account to continue to play the game, so I could only play for a short time before I have to wait to play again.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Its typical BAD fan-fiction really. However it is good for a gag gift. Its really insulting to real literature. Is it really mostly desperate housewives that read this piece of junk? BDSM has been around for a VERY long time. I don't know why this even woke people up to it. Its not even good for a beginner! VOMIT!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Its a fun little game but it can be puzzling.  You have to really think when you play.good artwork. The self drawing is difficult though haha.
B0069JBKHI|3.0|camera resolution is good but there is quite a lag on data transmission. sensors are not very sensitive. worst of all battery life is extremely inadequate
0553386794|3.0|I love Game of Thrones, so I decided to purchase the books. I started with this one as its the first book in the series to read. I was happy and all excited I would get it this Friday ( When it said I would get it ) but it hasn't showed up. Its Friday, no book, I doubt they will give it to me on the weekend, so I would have to wait till Monday, probably. This is very sad and not expected. I always got my items when they said I would. I paid extra for the shipping to get it today. But it didn't show, I am now choosing if I should cancel my order because of this. You might as well order for 16-32 days because you won't get the book on the day it mentioned it would arrive.<br /><br />I am only rating 3 / 5 stars  - purely because I love Game of Thrones. I have wasted my money for when it said it would be shipped to my house on Friday 26 April. It hasn't arrived,<br /><br />So a book that costed $11 dollars ($13) USD --&#62; AUD and $30 shipping ( just so i can have it by Friday) and it hasn't arrived. Cancelled my order and this is just depressing that a Company that says buy now and get it on Friday, doesn't live up to its expectations.

B00005LIN0|5.0|Exceptional casting, music and story line perfect meld.  Porgy throwing off his canes at end and struggling on indelible image of his futile efforts.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|I saw this classic American western saga many years ago, and wanted to revisit it. Love the cinematography! Robert DuVall and Tommy Lee Jones and Dianne Lane add a dimension of real characters with real feelings that you don't see in many westerns. They embark on a long 2,500 mile cattle drive from south Texas to Montana, and this story takes you on their long journey as if you're part of the group. Along the way, they have real trials and tribulations that would have surely occurred back then. They encounter storms, horse thieves, hostile bad guys, death and life's memories and regrets. This is probably my favorite western, it has everything a great western should have, cowboys, horses, wagons, cattle, small dusty towns, the beautiful western plains, shootouts and an ending that's touching and hard to forget. If you haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it.
B00290FWYS|5.0|\\"Caf&eacute; Del Mar Vol. 16\\" (Caf&eacute; Del  Mar Volumen Dieciseis) is a two cd set with 16 various artists on each set.

Jillene Luce, and \\"Atlantis\\" by Rue Du Soleil are some of the chillout songs in this compilation that have a mystical element to them.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|Not even close to deserving description of psychological thriller.  Sadly unrealistic,  predictable, and full of holes.  Finished it to see if it was what I was expecting, which it was, then removed it from my kindle.
0385349947|5.0|Great book! I was actually surprised by how many 'lightbulb' moments I had while reading it. She really brought to light the gender differences and expectations both in the work place and in the home-for both men and women. It has challenged me to change my way of thinking about my career, accomplishments and the worth of my opinion.

B00AFROVQC|2.0|Plot moves quickly but story doesn't actually have a resolution even after reading all 4 published books. This is NO Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings or Rowan of Rin. It is a poor attempt at a coming-of-age/hero of all time saga with very poor character development.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|Without question the finest stage rendition of this show I have ever seen.  Alfie Boe is a genius.  He is a man with a voice and presence unrivaled.<br /><br />All I will say is this......I could have done without Nick Jonas.  He was, without question, the ONLY weak link in this performance.  He belongs on lunch boxes of 12 year old girls.........not in stage performances that would have otherwise been considered one of the finest casts of all time.
1781164266|2.0|Overall dead space it's awesome, Love the art work and Layout is awesome, but lack of detail on how they implemented on their art production left me very disappointed, as a 3d  artist myself i'm curious how they implement it on their 3d models, and they put nothing in it, none-zero....sigh*<br />also their dust jacket material is rather disappointing, it left your finger mark on it, and it's annoying....

B00BHXUC4S|4.0|Jeff Lynne's first solo album has many of the hallmarks of the work he did with George Harrison, Tom Petty and the Wilburys--it's tuneful, filled with hooks and terrific playing (and I prefer \\"Armchair\\" to \\"Zoom\\" only because there's a real drummer for the album whereas Jeff plays drums on most of \\"Zoom\\"--he's capable but his stuff benefits from a real, skilled drummer).<br /><br />So, if you're not a fan of Jeff Lynne's production style or sound found on those albums, then you might not like this. Having said that, it fits in nicely as a \\"lost\\" Wilburys album at times since George Harrison appears and Tom Petty co-wrote a track (\\"Blown Away\\"), as well as, Lynne's idol the late Del Shannon who appears as a backing vocalist on one track.<br /><br />This reissue has been remastered and it is compressed compared to the original CD (issued in 1990) which means it's slightly louder. The dyanmic range for the album runs in the 10-11 range compare to the 12-13 for the previous CD. It's still quite good sounding.<br /><br />The album, curiously, doesn't include all the b-sides and any remixes that were released at the time as bonus tracks (which would have made this the definitive version of the album) and that's a missed opportunity. I'm not sure why Jeff and his management team elected not to include these other versions but it would have been nice.<br /><br />On the other hand, we do get two bonus tracks--one of which WAS a b-side for the single although it's been remixed with some additional re-recording happening making it slightly different from the previous version--that song is \\"Borderline\\" which was on the CD single for \\"Life Me Up\\". \\"Forecast\\" is a previously unreleased song that was originally begun for the 1989 album.<br /><br />The bit at the end with the flying saucer sounds, birds and \\"It's still going you know\\" comment from Jeff has been relocated from the original CD track \\"Save Me Now\\" (hence the different running time)to \\"Forecast\\" since that now offically ends the CD.<br /><br />There is also an exclusive bonus track on the Japanese version--it's a live version of \\"Strange Magic\\" from a performance recorded at Bungalow Palace.<br /><br />The liner notes are quite good with an amusing essay from Eric Idle, the original credits and a brief essay by David Wild on the original album and the reissue. The cardboard sleeve is designed like a gatefold CD sleeve and while there isn't an insert protecting the CD, it appears that the manufacturer in Italy (yes, all editions are imports) did a nice job as mine had no blemishes or scratches marring the CD.<br /><br />Although this isn't the definitive version of the album (that would include ALL the single cuts, remixes, etc. and would have been mastered the same as the original CD which sounded terrific), fans will want to pick this up for the bonus tracks (and, if you prefer the sound of the original CD you may want to just download the bonus tracks as Jeff and his management have, nicely, made them avaialble for precisely that purpose).y ends the CD.<br /><br />There is also an exclusive bonus track on the Japanese version--it's a live version of \\"Strange Magic\\" from a performance recorded at Bungalow Palace.<br /><br />The liner notes are quite good with an amusing essay from Eric Idle, the original credits and a brief essay by David Wild on the original album and the reissue.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|The best explanation I have ever read regarding the controversies in recent years over weight-loss diets.  I highly recommend this book to anyone struggling to lose fat or keep it off and who is diet-shopping or has had unsatisfactory results with typical American weight-loss methods.  I know from personal experience that Taubes has it nailed.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I love analog photography...<br /><br />Recently I discovered that Fuji was making film that can work in the old Polaroid Color Pack 2 cameras.. SO! MUCH! FUN! And waaaay less expensive to feed than the SX70 or 600 Polaroid cameras with the very expensive Impossible Film.<br /><br />I will truly be sad if Fuji ever stops making this or the color peel apart film.
0307887960|5.0|Having reached the age where it's difficult to avoid gaining weight and having tried and failed on some other diets and weight-loss methods--that is, little or no weight loss despite being hungry and lethargic or quickly gaining back the precious few pounds lost, I bought this book early last year and enjoyed a significant weight loss.  While most people would not have considered me obese in January 2012, I was carrying too much fat (compared to lean muscle) on a small-boned frame, which had built up over the years, beginning in middle-age.  As I got older it became more and more difficult to keep weight off, not to mention trying to lose weight--and this was fatty weight, the worse kind.  Following Dr. Dukan's method, I was never hungry and had plenty of energy; I felt the best I had in years.  All my friends commented on how I seemed to have found the fountain of youth.  (OK, part of that is also genetic, as it runs in my family to look years younger than our actual ages.  But the weight loss and newly found energy was a significant factor.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, I allowed a few pounds to creep back on during the winter holiday season--easy for me with my sweet tooth and love of carbohydrate-rich foods.  So starting this January (2013) I began attempting to lose those regained pounds (again, this was fat, not lean muscle) using a few other diet and exercise methods.  No success!  Following a typical American weight-loss regime--that is, eat less and exercise more--I couldn't overcome hunger, lethargy, and sugar/carbohydrate cravings.  This went on for two months until I recognized that returning to the Dukan Diet (to lose the fat and keep it off permanently) was my only hope.  I pulled this book off my bookcase shelf, dusted it off, and began again at Page 1, and very shortly shed those regained pounds--once again, without hunger or lethargy.<br /><br />While returning to the Dukan Diet, I also sought a deeper understanding of why this method works, so I recently purchased Gary Taubes' book &#34;Why we get fat and what to do about it,&#34; also from Amazon.  Taubes' advice differs slightly, but not significantly--in my opinion, from that of Dr. Dukan's, although either method should produce the same weight-loss results.  I know from experience that the Dukan Diet works, and now I understand why.
1476712042|5.0|What an amazing story of friendship turning into love, with some drama & action thrown in.  Abby Abernathy is a nice, good girl trying to leave her past behind & begin anew attending college with her best friend, America.  But then she meets Eastern University's One Night Stand, no commitments & definitely no promises, Travis &#34;Mad Dog&#34;Maddox.  He's hot, tattooed & all wrong for her. Or is he??  Abby is torn between wanting & needing to avoid him. Travis isn't used to this girl resisting his appeal.  All the other girls fall at his feet, why not her?  It's not the challenge that he goes after, Abby is like no other & he finds her refreshing, smart & funny. I love his nickname for her &#34;Pigeon&#34; or &#34;Pidge&#34; for short.<br /><br />I loved Abby & Travis's friendship turning into more than they ever thought it could. It's not all sunshine & roses.  Travis, at times, could be a real ass.  But I felt his actions/words came from just plain not knowing what to do or say at times & he is not familiar with how relationships work. And he's afraid of doing or saying something wrong.  I love, love, loved Travis's words and actions for the most part.<br /><br />Some quotes....<br /><br />&#34;I know we're f*#@ed up, all right? I'm impulsive, hot-tempered, and you get under my skin like no one else.  You act like you hate me one minute, and then you need me the next.  I never get anything right, and I don't deserve you......but I f#*^in' love you, Abby.  I love you more than I've loved anyone or anything, ever.  When you're around, I don't need booze, or money or the fighting or the one-night stands.......all I need is you.  You're all I think about.  You're all I dream about.  You're all I want.&#34;<br /><br />Another....<br /><br />A pained look shadowed his face.  &#34;You know why I want you?  I didn't know I was lost until you found me.  I didn't know what Lone was until the first night I spent with you in my bed.  You're the one thing I've got right.  You're what I've been waiting for, Pigeon.&#34;<br /><br />This book is written from Abby's POV & I enjoy this because I get inside her head.  Both Abby & Travis have a lot of &#34;baggage&#34; to work out to find a HEA.  The other characters in this book&#34; Shepley, Travis' cousin is also the boyfriend of Abby's best friend America. There's a strong connection between these four. And I enjoyed seeing it.  Beautiful Disaster grabbed ahold of my heart from the beginning & kept squeezing it throughout this book, right til the end!
B000XUBC5E|2.0|I wanted good read and decided to try this book based on the good reviews. Very disappointed. Yeah, author tried to make it interesting, there are twists and turns, but characters are completely one-dimentional and the whole thing looks naive. Just boring. I appreciate that other people loved this book, but it's just not my kind of good read.
B007CIQ4B2|4.0|Bought based on recommendation.  Like it and so do friends.  Enjoy today.  Try it....that's all folks.....my comments are complete. Bye
B003HKN52U|5.0|I'm a huge vampire fan.  I love the actors in this movie, it's such a classic.  I could watch this movie over and over.
B009ANP4F4|4.0|If your into great dancing, cinematography, guys getting on with chicks.  Then this dancing/chick flick is for you.<br />Some really cool dance scenes on this DVD.
034580404X|5.0|I couldn't put these down!  The love story is fantastic.  I had to make myself put the books down and go to bed or I would be up all night.  The characters are great.  I can't wait for the movies.
B00A8307BG|3.0|If you really like old blues, remakes of old blues songs and a good artist on guitar then this would be a CD for you.<br />If your looking for something new from &#34;Robin&#34;, then I would stay away from this disc and buy the &#34;Playful Heart&#34;<br />and I am a guitar player and fan of Robin Trower................I own all his albums!
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I kind of like it but is slow to read as it never really gets you hooked to finish it
B007FC3AAI|4.0|I saw this at the movie theater so I knew it would be great!! A great price to have on hand.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|great, thrilling movie. music in movie is great.explains the previous lord of the ring movies.3d is the only way to see this movie
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is written in an interesting manner with the chapter going back and forth with each chapter. It is well written with many profound meanings of life.  It is full of surprises and psychological conflicts.
B003L16FAE|5.0|It's a shame Amazon doesn't separate the old bluray reviews from the newer edition. I don't own the older one but the Ultimate Hunter copy looks very good for such an old film. Get to the choppa!!!!! And get this copy.
B00B9EQS98|5.0|I bought this movie to show my 4th grade class during a very rainy week.  They had so much fun and laughed throughout the entire movie.<br />It is great entertainment and appropriate for the whole family!
B0000024YL|3.0|If you were a kid in the '60s like i was.  I was born in 1959.  Or if your older and have more vivid memories of the '60s.  Then you remember that Simon and Garfunkel were everwhere.  I thought at the time they were as rock an roll as the Beatles or Elvis or anybody else.  But as time has gone by there songs to me sound more folk music.  I mean what kind of song is The Boxer?  And Scarborough Fair is an old traditional English folksong.  I think they just put a medly together with Canticle to get songwriting credit.  Mrs. Robinson from The Graduate may be there biggest song.  The Sound Of Silence, I Am A Rock, Homeward Bound, and of course Bridge Over Troubled Water are all songs that could be some of the biggest songs in the '60s.  And Art Garfunkle singing lead on  Bridge Over Troubled Water had the perfect voice for that song.  It is a very hard song to sing.  I always thought he was very underrated.  I could see though how there could be trouble between the two of them.  Paul Simon played guitar wrote all the songs.  And Garfunkle just stood at the microphone and sang.  The rest of this cd is good.  And I cant remember the movie but I think that El Condor Pasa was in the sound track of a movie also.
075640407X|5.0|It’s always refreshing to find a book that keeps you wanting more – Rothfuss’s “The Name of the Wind” is just such a book.  Really a fun adventure, with a writing style that is graceful, intelligent and intertwined within humanities emotion; basically said the reader can easily understand the main characters reasoning for in his struggles between good and evil.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It is a challenge for me but I keep playing to win.  reminds me of Mario Brothers but my son isn't here to help me.  LOL
0802473156|4.0|Good food for thought, but you have to put it into practice too.<br />If you are willing to try it can really help you to translate that, &#34;To him taking out the trash= I love you&#34; and for her it may be flowers, or a weed eater (a gift)
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have the first 4 seasons, and season 5 is just as good.  This show is absolutely hilarious - everyone I know watches it!
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|I am a very avid fan of all of Jackson's LOTR movies.  They were superbly executed, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />When The Hobbit came out, my friends and family went to see the movie at the theater.  \\"It's great!\\" they said, \\"you'll love it!\\" they said.  Turns out, my suspicious were horrendously accurate.<br /><br />The Hobbit is a child's movie - and, I guess, to be fair it was a child's book so that fits.<br /><br />What I WASN'T prepared for was the sheer ineptitude of the acting and the almost monotone cast of characters.  I mean - let's face it, there IS a limit on how many of us out there actually want to watch a 3.5-hr long movie about a band of grumpy dwarves.  But - okay, I thought, I'll give it a go.<br /><br />The first inkling that something was very wrong with this movie was during the \\"prologue\\" section of the film (which is long-winded and boring, and has graphics that quite frankly are no better than the LOTR trilogy's).  When it portrays the dragon Smaug decimating the dwarves' city, it did not give one actually gripping shot of the dragon.  All we saw were fire explosions, and a hint of a tail here or a big claw there.  I mean - I'm sorry.  This is Peter Jackson.  He created the movie versions of the dragons the Ringwraiths ride on, and everything!  I found that VERY anticlimactic and cheap.<br /><br />Then we enter into the \\"setting the scene\\" bit of the movie, where we are introduced to Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf.  There is absolutely ZERO chemistry between these two on-screen, and it shows.  Bilbo is an obnixious old hobbit who wanders around his burrow grumbling and setting things straight all the time.  He has as much charisma as my left pinky finger.<br /><br />Then - oh GOD then.  THEN the dwarves appear.  Just randomly - like knock-at-the-door oh-look-its-a-dwarf random.  So like 13 of the little buggers all descend upon Bilbo's house, have a feast, eat all his food, Gandalf shows up, produces a magic key, ominous dark dwarf prince leader shows up, they break into song twice, do a stupid little routine where they clear up the feat plates and cutlery - and that's it.  My toes were literally curled in a cringe throughout 98% of this scene.<br /><br />And then - after about an hour or so of movie, Bilbo finally gets is hiney out the door and runs after the dwarves.  We are supposed to believe that this cantankerous, grumpy, introverted old hobbit wakes up the morning after the feast, and has a sudden attack of conscience, and decides to do something with his life.  Mmmmkay - fair enough.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is your standard cringe-worthy action-fantasy-adventure.  The scene with the three trolls belongs in Shrek or something - not a LOTR movie.  I felt like I was watching the Three Stooges combined with Laurel and Hardy.  Even Hugo Weaving as Lord Elrond falls flat.  I mean - that is something no-one should EVER.  HAVE.  TO.  SEE.<br /><br />So - dwarves visit elves, elves give a little help, Galadriel smiles, they fight on an open plain with wolf-mounted goblins, blah blah blah.  Oh - and there's this REALLY odd man-mountain bit where we watch two rock-mountain-giant-leviathan-things punch each other's heads off while the party cling to their legs.  Yeah.<br /><br />I'm not even going to touch the rabbit-sled-forest-wizard with a ten foot bargepole.......I do believe that you had to be smoking something to understand all that.......and enjoy it.<br /><br />The ONLY redeeming piart of this movie comes at the touching moment between Bilbo and the dwarf prince (no idea what his name was), when Bilbo satiates the dwarf's hatred towards the lazy hobbit by telling him that he has a home to go back to, but the dwarves don't - and so that's why he is helping them.<br /><br />What a shame.er shows up, they break into song twice, do a stupid little routine where they clear up the feat plates and cutlery - and that's it.

B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I missed most of the first season, but I'm a loyal viewer now, and season 1 absolutely does not disappoint!
1449320104|5.0|I would say this book is good if you know a little bit about programming but need to learn the C# language specifically.  If you have no entry-level programming experience at all from a &#34;programming for beginners&#34; book from another language or something then you might want to stick with something that is more of a beginner book.  However, if you have even a little bit of background knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, then this book is wonderful.
1466401885|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was a little bit slow in the beginning.  But I fell in love with the characters.  It wasn't what I expected, because I read a lot of &#34;erotic&#34; romance so when this turned up in my recommendations I thought that's what this was.  She really pulled me into the story and the history of Abby & Travis.  I just ordered the continuation.  The story told by Travis called Walking Disaster and I hope it gets here soon!!
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|I have an addiction to this story.  I literally would have loved to try one of the delicious meals prepared. The characters are so real, so full of life and the costumes are like a cat walk. Expecting the 4th season..... 2014 is eternal.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked this book. I didn't like the ending. I prefer for evil people's to get what's coming to them. But Amy was a brilliant liar
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I know many people would rather watch the movie but the book leads to a deeper understanding of the characters thoughts and struggles. Great book for anyone who understands loss
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great book. I only had one issue. This is a long series that just started so it will take time before it can be finished.<br /><br />Sanderson clearly learned from helping finish the Wheel of Time series. Lots of foreshadowing shows that he has planned out the books so they don't lose focus. Very excited for the rest.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful LOVE story about finding your soul mate and the ups and downs in a relationship!!!  College was a good setting.
0765325950|5.0|Great ending. Sanderson did a fantastic job with the series. Yes, left a few things on the table but I couldn't have asked for more.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Not as well constructed as some of the others Clancy has given us. Starting to get formulaic, understandable after this many
B00BHMF578|4.0|i was expecting a better movie (not sure why), but still thought it was great. full of suspense, well worth the $3.99 or whatever to rent.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|Even with his disability he has a beautiful voice. I love this type of singing. I can listen to this type of music all the time.
B007HIEBV2|5.0|Very cool sound mixing 1930's and 40's jazz with an electronica/dance sound. Definitely a great addition to any music collection.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I liked the second Season as much as the First Season.  Greed, Mean, Hateful. They are trying to out do each other. The pope centers on Family more than anything.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It may seem simple when you sart to play but then you have to study the entier grid before you make your 1st move if you want to win with the eact number of times it should take to complte each color pipe! Makes you think how this game can not only help your child learn to match colors and learn left, right, up, down & diagnol lines but it also makes children and adults use their brains while they play and then before they play!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Lots if ups and downs but the laughs were continuous. Can't wait to watch again.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|I did not know what to expect from this book.  It started off a little slow but in the end I loved it and did not want it to end.
B008JEJN8Y|5.0|Most comfortable crocs I ever had. Getting ready to purchase another pair. Different color ,get a lot of compliments on these .
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Only read a quarter of this book and then had to stop.  Not only is the writing horrible this book promotes spousal abuse.  I reject being talked into buying this whole trilogy.  I wish I had purchased had copies of this trilogy so that I could use them to start camp fires this summer.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good game for all ages.  Hold your attention but easy to re-enter after a break.  Not scary for my grandchildren.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I bought this book along with the other 2 thinking I would read all of them. I did not even make it to this book. I could barely get through the first quarter of the second book.  If this was not a digital book I would burn it!  These are the worst books that have ever been written.  These books support spousal abuse.  The main charter is a spineless idiot who has low self esteem and is in a horrible relationship.  This is not an empowering book.  It is a disgrace to women.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Read this book in about 4 hours. Couldn't put it down. So excited for the next book in June! Better than 50 shades.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Huge fan of the Hunger Games.  It is great to see a book with a very strong female charcter.  I read this book in 2 days I could not put it down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun playing even when the puzzles are tough.  Lots of challenges as well l as easier levels kids would like.  My favorite waiting to room time waster
0743201140|5.0|This book is a great continuation to learn more about your strengths and how to use them to your advantage.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game. I love it. Play anytime I have free time. Easy to play. Easy to understand. Can be a quick game or long.  I like the ease of options.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I'm so glad they remade this movie on bluray. This movie is excellent to begin with; bluray makes it shine!
1439170045|5.0|There are very few books that have an everlasting effect on me.  I usually remember them all, but every now and then I read one that stays with me afterwards for a very long time.  This is one of them.  Still Alice a beautifully written book about one woman's battle with early onset  Alzheimer's Disease.  Alice is able to pull you into her world and makes you see what she does and makes you feel what she feels.  I don't know how anyone could read this and not feel apart of Alice herself.  I won't lie, but it is a pretty scary feeling.  When she panicked I could feel it.  It is such a heart wrenching story that I don't recommend reading it unless you are in the right frame of mind.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I love this CD as I do all of Yanni's music. If you love his music you will enjoy Truth Of Touch. His music is food for the soul. I am very happy with this CD.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I like the characters for the most part, though Ky does not feel fully fleshed out.  Cassia is choosing him, but there's not enough information about him to have that choice make sense.  There seems to be a little too much mystery without enough satisfaction.  And, I hate to say it, but it feels a little like The Hunger Games without the adrenaline rush.  It's slow, with too many clues and not enough answers along the way to make it satisfying.
B009PAETCG|5.0|This is a fun game and its free. It's a challenge to do give it a try. I really think you will like it if you like a challenge.
B00181MHQU|5.0|Watched it with the kids (7 and 10) twice this week.  They both love it.  Taking them to see the stage version this weekend!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|How is it that I am right in the middle of a Clancy book when the plot comes to the forefront of what is happening in the real word?  Amazing imagination set in the most current  of possibilities for a plot.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Thank you for reminding me not only of what I already knew, but for giving me permission to give myself permission to really do it.
0345803485|1.0|This is so awful.  Better (far better) writing is to be found in my 10 YO daughters' books by AVI, Angie Sage, K. DiCamillo, Scott O'Dell, Andrew Clements, J. Spinelli, R. Dahl.  True that perhaps one does not pick up a book like 50 Shades of Grey for great writing, but shouldn't \\"good\\" writing be a minimum qualifier to get to a best-seller list?  This book is Painful - and NOT in a good way.  I think I'll stick to Game of Thrones, the Borgias and Boardwalk Empire for any necessary small dose of \\"erotica\\"...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This novel will have your attention from beginning to end. Very touching and beautiful.  A must read for any dog lover
0446547638|5.0|The Best of Me is another one of Nicholas Sparks beautiful, heartwarming novels. I couldn't put it down, and am passing it on to my daughter to read. Buy it.  You'll love it.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I like the game and want to see the ending it is really great, I just might have to install again. and you dont need wifi to make it work.
B008LFY6NI|3.0|It's quite fun to play with but you're quite limited in what it can do. The picture shows sparkles and you don't get anything to add sparkles with. Might be a nice upgrade if they added some glitter or ability to blend better and coloured backgrounds to start with.
B000FZETKC|5.0|Watched this in my 20's. It is a timeless story and one that I am happy to now have in my collection. Thanks for offering it for purchase.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|sometimes it seems to lag a little, but then so do I!  I've spent way too many hours playing to say I don't enjoy it.....
B00866JL96|5.0|When I heard that this book was coming out on video, I was anxious to get it. I was not disappointed.
030758836X|4.0|i liked the suspense and the writing, especially how it was from 2 points of view. I didn't want to put the book down. I was so upset about the ending and thought it ruined the whole story. how frustrated i was at the end shows how invested i was in the story. I would recommend it to others.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I couldn't wait for this season to come out on video. I was not disappointed. It is a great show. I hope to see many more seasons.
0486414124|5.0|It arrived on time and as expected. The novel itself is a piece of wonderful literature. I love Jane Austen, and having read all of her other work, I actually feel that besides PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this is my favorite. It's a play on the ever popular Gothic novels of the time period, so it was interesting to see Austen's take on it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It was easy for me to create my own chanel so now I can listened to my prefered songs where ever I am thank you
B005LAIIHG|5.0|An excellent movie. Very creative. It was nice to watch a movie that for once has no swear words nor nudity. Refreshing.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thought this book was amazing, you really get to know all of the characters and what goes on in their minds. It can make you see the work in a different light. Everyone should take the time to read this novel written from the core of the author's heart.
B009AMANH4|2.0|I could not get into this movie. There was not enough action for me. I loved all other Cilvil War movies but not this one.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|This is a brilliant set of songs from a great group. I've loved it since it came out, and my kid grew up on it.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|It was a little slow starting off but toward the end it got exciting. If everything is true, in this movie, I did not know that a female had an important rule in taking down Osama bin Laden.
B00000F5KH|4.0|I stumbled upon this, as it was a preview for some other movie I was watching.<br /><br />In contrast to my expectations, this was a very moving and touching story/movie. The acting is raw, genuine, and heart-wrenching. I cried at the beginning and I cried at the end.<br /><br />Kids--especially boys--and regardless of their culture--want their dads. This story covers the psychological and physical search of a boy for his dad, albeit through challenging circumstances. The 'story' that happens along that journey is intense and heart-felt.<br /><br />Anyhow, the movie flows well and it 'held' me throughout. It's almost like a love story on so many levels; child-to-adult, adult-to-child, friend-to-friend, brother-to-brother, community-to-community, stranger-to-stranger. The movie speaks to the invisible thread that ties 'family,' be it in our memories, experiences, or fantasy.<br /><br />Very touching.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|It is a Great book! I Can't wait to see what's next and where they end up! I highly recommend it.
B004N0I3U2|1.0|I am a Bond fan, but not of this movie.  I even question the pg-13 rating of this one.  Having an orgasm while killing a victim may be unfortunately realistic, but it was very disturbing to see, especially with the huge smile the whole time.  I continued through one more scene, but had to stop watching because I was still too disturbed.  Bond movies are supposed to be escapist.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The Dwarf's show up with Gandolf and take Bilbo on an adventure. The cinematography is incredible.. The Queen of the Elve's is in this movie but does not actually appear in the book. She communicates with Gandolf without speaking which provides a nice effect. Smeegle is in this movie and loses the ring to Bilbo.<br /><br />Ton's of action scenes in this movie. If you saw the Trilogy you can't miss this movie.
B00BEIN9VO|3.0|I think this album was OK. The problem was each song was about 7 minutes long! I got the 20/20 exprience on a record(vinal disk). It could've bean better.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband since he likes Adam Sandler movies. This movie is pretty much his lullaby!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I truly love this book. It has made me appreciate every little detail in my life and helps those who want to do so but don't know how. 'The Secret' was the best. 'The Power' was sublime. 'The Magic' is the cherry on top. The true way to encounter happiness through appretiation. I am very very grateful of having encountered Rhonda Byrne's books and film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have been using alligator for several days now. I love that I only need to touch a card and it automatically snaps into place!
B008602KQI|2.0|The novel is a great read, but the movie version is a sad take on it. Very disappointed in this.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great price on the Hobbit 3D Blu-Ray DVD. So far viewed the first disc, as the movie is quite lengthy. Quality picture on my Samnsung 55&#34; 3D Smart TV. Amazon more than 75% has the best prices on Blu-Ray DVD's, and their shipments are secure, efficient and arrive in minimal time to the APO (Overseas Military Base).
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|Finally, a FAOTD that doesn't have extensive and unnecessary permissions, that is fun to play, and its free! I can easily see myself opening this app to play a round or two to kill a few minutes and before I know it an hour has gone by. I would definitely recommend giving it a try, especially while its the FAOTD.<br />This app works beautifully on my KF.
B004ZG5F28|5.0|Wife is a huge fan of Colin Furth and this movie. Wanted her own copy for viewing at her leisure. Great price, and she is a happy &#34;Bridget Jones's Diary&#34; Blu-Ray owner.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Bought this mouse for my son.  He said the only thing he didn't like was the position of the buttons above and below the scroll-wheel.  He said they feel uncomfortable.  Really likes it, though.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It is a really good game but if want to get the stuff that costs meadls well u might as well buy them plz think this was a good opinion if u feel me
B007TXN4TK|5.0|It is easy for my granddaughter to follow.  She loves it and so do I.  I am glad I found this on Amazon.  Will be looking for other products like this to entertain my granddaughter.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I can't say just how amazing this book is in just a few sentences. See my full review at [...]
B003YBNREI|3.0|Bought this as gift for someone, I think he liked it very very much. I have been a fan of the Doobies.
0060833459|2.0|I read exclusively history and leadership books. This book seems to be irrelevant in a leadership world. I found the information dry and outdated. This book was very easy to put down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book two was just as good as the first. Going to start book three now. Suzanne Collins is a wonderful writer. Definitely a five star rating!!!
B0091ICDHU|5.0|What a fabulous, heart breaking, funny and amazing story! I loved laymen and will..laykens mum and the 2 little brothers so much! I can't wait to start the next one now. I purposely waited to wait for the 3rdone to come out because colleen hoovers books are so wonderful I knew I wouldn't want to wait!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This is my sister's childhood favorite movie. I gave this to her for her birthday, and she is very satisfied. She may be twenty, but it was her favorite gift.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|i really like this dvd, very powerful and moving, also true of today's society and families, wish that more Dads would treat their families like this
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I gave this as a birthday gift for a die hard fan of the series. He is very satisfied with the image quality and the special features. Highly recommended.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|the original &#34;Fright Night' was good during my high school years, this recent version was good and i liked the cast, good special effects also
B002JVWR4U|5.0|If you enjoy Joss Whedon shows, this is a must see. I know a lot of people are put off by the cult following Whedon shows have, but please don't let that effect your decision. The packaging is also a great and appealing.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Downloaded the game for my son who loves nemo but I srated playing now we both enjoy helping nemo build his reef. Wish they could talj instead of reading so you can hear their voices
B004SUWR2C|5.0|good app if (please heed the last word) ya love uno. The game keeps me occupied if im sitting at the eye doctor for 2 hours. Then there is the fact that the game opponents STINK on normal. Ugh. But other than that, great game!
B004FK24ZA|5.0|I watch this every holiday season and recommend it to all my friends annually. It's a classic &#34;warm fuzzies&#34; movie.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|This is a adorable movie! It looks great on BluRay. The movie does not contain any extra discs (as expected and described in the item describtion).
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Miserables was an incredible recount of a horrific historical event in France. The musical superbly portrayed actual events of that sad passage in time.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|This gift the &#34;best&#34; per my friend.  I have this to her for her birthday. I may purchase a copy for myself. Thank you.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Unlike other series I have read The Clifton Chronicles does not drag or diminish in its quality as the new books come out. if anything it gets better. This third part of the story does not disappoint. Just like the first two instalments of the Clifton Chronicles, Best Kept Secrets left me hanging out for the next book.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|One of Paul Newman's greatest roles. Wonderful script and memorable characters. Lines you never forget, such as &#34;What we have here is a failure to communicate.&#34;
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I enjoyed the music, also have the CD, and the acting all around was so diverse it kept you fascinated! I would compare it to Dr Zivago, which to me makes them Classics.
B008XG1X18|5.0|DISCLAIMER: I'm addicted....you will be, too.<br />Pinterest is such a great app! You can post funny pictures, crafty pictures, stylish pictures...the options are endless.:) It's fun to discover new pictures and pin them yourself. This is probably one of my favorite apps. It's really entertaining, a great time-killer, and perfect for when you just need some inspirtation! :D Love u, Pinterest.
1466311649|1.0|To start sorry about my bad english!<br /><br />About this product all i can say is DONT BUY IT! The images a bronken, pixelated and most of them you can't even see it i mean those images are like everything for the book and you CANT SEE THEM!<br />The publisher and printer must pull the item it down because of its really bad quality ,George Bridgman is one hell of an artist but the  crappy way this book was published its just not worth it...
0812993845|2.0|I LOVE Sophie Kinsella books. . .but this one?<br /><br />Not so much.<br /><br />I found myself looking at the clock, looking ahead 40 pages to see if it got better, looking around. . .anywhere but the book.<br /><br />I wanted so much to like it.<br /><br />It gets long-winded, and I found that I didn't care about the characters like I do her other books.<br /><br />That said?<br /><br />Her other books are fabulous.<br /><br />But wait for paperback for this one. . .
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it a good game for all ages i even like to play my 2 year old niece love this game and i like seeing her enjoying it
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I enjoyed the book because it was thought provoking and not preachy. It reminded me of Malcolm Gladwell books which I enjoy very much.
0062059963|3.0|I sympathized with America and adored Maxon in the first book, and I hoped that the plot of this book would deepen and evolve into something more complex. Instead, the plot just seemed to be a longer, more abrasive version of the first plot.<br /><br />336 Pages of<br /><br />1. America's tears<br />2. America's temper tantrums<br />3. America's double standards<br />4. America's fickleness<br />5. America's self righteousness<br />6. America's mood swings<br />7. America's distasteful trysts with Aspen<br />8. Maxon's unrealistic forgiveness of America's horrendous behavior (Why does Maxon even love her anymore?)<br /><br />There is so much potential with the subplots, but they were largely undeveloped (or under-developed). If this is truly meant to be a trilogy, Cass better marry Maxon to somebody right away in the next book and spend the rest of the plot solving the problems of Illea.<br /><br />Still, I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. A desperate hope that America would redeem herself, I guess.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The app was great the way it was.  This redesign is absolutely horrible.  I uninstalled all updates to get back to the version that came on my device in order to get rid of this latest version.<br /><br />The menus and interaction with your library have changed, and it's just not how I want to interact with it.<br />Plus the Android \\"back\\" button used to close the app, which is the behavior I wanted.  Now it just navigates back within the app.  Totally annoying behavior.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|One of the best put out by Hollywood in a long time. I hope they put out more musicals in the future.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful characters and drama plots. Can't wait for season four. I watched season three in one weekend that's how much I loved the plot twists.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|There are a lot of back tracking and things to figure out.  There aren't as many hidden object searches or puzzles to solve but it still was a challenge.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows--I saw it live on Broadway some years ago.  The movie is much better more colorful, more action, which can be done in movies rather than stage.  However, the whole cast was fantastic and Ann Hathaway was superb.
B008JFUO4U|2.0|For a movie to be released one week and then be available for pre-order the next week makes me kind of suspicious...just sayin!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I'm a history addict and formerly from PA very near Gettysburg and within easy driving distance of the battlefields in VA.  This was fantastic.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I've read this book about six or seven times, the first being when I was ten years old. It's a beautiful story. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00BHXUC8E|5.0|I have been a Whitesnake fan since 78 with their first album. This is great stuff from a great hard rockin' blues band. David Coverdale takes what he did with Deep Purple and blows it up. Great cd & great dvd. Whitesnake fan? BUY IT!!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I started unsure but once I started I can't stop.  Love this game. I also got fair edition and I plan to buy more.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't understand the people's obsession with this book the characters are terrible and the smut, if you can even call it that, is even worse.
B002OMZTSK|5.0|Despite this book was not what I was initially looking for, the writing  and story were really compelling. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG!!!! I love this game so  much me and my friends play it all the time!!! even my brother has it on his kindle<br />fire!!!! :)
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|I play this album all the time. The tracks sparkle with Steve's unique sound and presence. Don't overlook the vocals either, he always has been a great tunesmith and a \\"Known great guitarist\\" but he is a top line singer too. This is great Steve.
B000002GHH|5.0|I have listened to this disc since it was first released, and I rank it in my top 5 of all time. I own and listen to a lot of music, but to me, this disc epitomizes Hiatt and his songwriting and singing ability.<br /><br />I do like almost all Hiatt's other discs, but not one comes close to the completeness presented here. It's worth your time to seek this gem out, grab a beverage of choice and sit back, listen and enjoy.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Why?????? This was perfect. The first thing I looked at every morning!  Thanks for the 'down'date. Time to shop around for a new weather app.  Seriously........
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Everyone in our family (5 years old to 40) loved this movie.  It's got drama, romance, action, comedy - I can't think of anything it doesn't have.  Full disclosure - I think the cyberbugs are a little scary for some 5 year olds but the influence of the older kids next to her and I think she understood it wasn't real helped.<br /><br />It's at the point where this is one of my kids' favorite go-to movie and now they are quoting full swaths of the dialogue.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|THIS BOOK IS FUN READ.  THE PLOT IS ENGROSSING.  HUGH HOWEY'S EXCELLENT WRITING ALLOWS THE READER TO EASILY ENVISION THE CHARACTERS' LIVES WITHIN A SILO SURROUNDED BY A DEVASTATED WORLD.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book will keep you guessing right up to the end.  The way it is written with parts of the trial written in all through the book, it really drew you in.
0618871713|2.0|This graphic novel is weird, and I was more than unimpressed with the story, the art, and the well-known creator.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Crashes EVERY TIME you click a link off the home screen. Completely unusable. I had to reset to facfory install to access my books. (Kindle app on Android tablet)
0449911357|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie, and having seen this film over two dozen times, reading the book was a strange experience!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|All of us are on a journey whether we realize it or not.  The Alchemist makes us think about our personal journey; who we are and where we are utlimately going in our lives.  The Alchemist can be a &#34;quick&#34; read or you can take the time to reflect on the many lessons it contains.  It contains the power to make the reader question his/her life goals, to reflect on owns' personal truths. This is the kind of book that I love to read a chapter or so just before I go to sleep at night.
014241543X|2.0|Before I get into my thoughts on this book, I have to say that I'm not a big Young Adult (YA) reader, but I have loved a couple YA books. The YA books I loved (The Hunger Games trilogy and The Fault in our Stars) were ones where I forgot I was reading YA; however, I felt the \\"YA-ness\\" of If I Stay every step of the way. Despite the serious and sad topic, the story felt shallow to me.<br /><br />Call me dense, but I wondered where this book was going for quite awhile (maybe I should have just paid more attention to the book's title, but I have a newborn at home and paying attention to things is not in my wheelhouse right now!!). I figured it couldn't just be a timeline of Mia observing the aftermath of the car accident - there had to be some bigger purpose. Thankfully, Mia finally begins to talk about the decision she has to make about 70% of the way through the book. Though I was glad to finally learn the book's bigger purpose, it was too little too late.<br /><br />The dynamics of Mia's family and particularly their dialogue also bugged me. They seemed unrealistic, contrived, and too witty in a cheesy, trying too hard kind of way. In my experience, teenagers don't usually \\"banter\\" with their parents.<br /><br />Finally, the ending was completely obvious and lacked creativity.<br /><br />The good part about all this was the book was short and I only spent a few days on it...silver linings! There is apparently a sequel called Where She Went, but I kind of don't care where Mia went and, needless to say, won't be reading it.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It keeps me awake when i need to be. I play it on my kindle fire and on my smart phone.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Most favorite game I've ever played on internet I play it every day numerous time and tell all my friends and family
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Inventive, clever, imaginative, suspenseful,  heartwarming, enjoyable, page turner, and a lot more.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any adult, language could be a little difficult for young teenagers.<br /><br />Reminded me of one of the first books i ever read -- Have spacesuit will travel by Robert A. Heinlein (OK 1958)<br /><br />A fun read in 2013.
0062238868|5.0|I READ THIS BOOK AND IT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING. LOADED WITH DETAILS HAD ME WISHING I WAS THERE WITH HIM.GOOD BOOK
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|it was wonderful at first but now it continues to force close. it will even loose my remarks that I add to my documents.  I have a kindle fire and this is driving me crazy. waiting on an update!!
0812993845|1.0|I loved the shopaholic series and a few of her other books. I wanted a light fun read. I practically forced myself to finish this book.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|I have owned this series since it was originally released and it is still one of my all time favorites. Was thrilled when it came out in the e-reader format so I can bring a copy with me everywhere I go and can read them a couple dozen more times.
B002JH3TW8|3.0|I have an external iSight camera that given away by a friend. I had no Firewire ports to connect it, until I bought a MBP. This adapter made possible to use it. It's ok, because now MBPs come with Facetime camera, so the iSight camera is being used with my desktop display.<br /><br />If you have an aging Firewire device you need to use in your newer Macs, this is your adapter.
B008476HBM|4.0|I had to read this book as part of the curriculum for my last year in secondary school. The book started off a bit slow ans unappealing, but as I progressed through, it got terribly interesting. I would consider it a predecessor to the modern Soap Opera. It has drama, relationships, and quite a bit of gossip. If you fancy a good Soap Opera, and like old-school writing styles, you'll definitely enjoy this book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book takes a different angle than the movie does, obviously.<br /><br />It sheds more light onto how this character uses an almost religious like belief in second chances to change his life. It shows the deep psychological trauma he had to endure and how he handles it; or at least how he tries to handle it.<br /><br />The characters are original and deeply conflicted which gives the story a lot more depth.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|There has only been 1 other series that I have enjoyed as much as this 1 !  The characters were so interesting & the way they interacted with each other was fascinating to see.  I felt like I knew these people & I really cared about what was happening to them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you always wanted to own a horse this is the app for you. any horse lover or little girl will love this app. can't get enough of it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This headphone, sounds flat and natural. It mirrors a more natural sound of my audio recordings than all my other headphones.<br /><br />I am satisfied
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I really enjoy most of the Nevosoft Hidden Object Games I have played. I have played half a dozen. looking forward to playing more.
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|Pretty standard instrumental sci-fi stuff, which is by no means a bad thing.  Just don't expect to hear one of these songs 20 years from now and recognize it like a John Williams or Hans Zimmer track.<br /><br />But good stuff none the less.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Sucked me in even further.  What a great sequel and tease into the third book.  Lots of new twists and turns to think about.  Buying it now!!!
B000X2H8G4|1.0|I received this today and have spent the last few hours mucking about with it.<br /><br />My experience so far: It magnifies nearby sounds tremendously. For example, the sound of touching the device itself is clear. Anything beyond a few feet however is either drowned out by the sound generated just by holding it or dimmer than it would be using just my ears.<br /><br />The price point may be attractive, but its actually hinders your ability to hear at a distance.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love it. It is fun and enjoyable for the hole family and kids.<br />The only way to get the best way for you is to play it.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Mystery, romance and history. A grand estate, a crumbling cottage, an abandoned garden. An authoress, a changeling, a grieving woman trying to move on. This book is full of poignancy and grace. Completely absorbing, beautifully visual and perfectly narrated, this was indeed one of the best books I've read this year, and has made me a slavish devotee of Kate Morton. Absolutely loved it and can't wait to read another of her books!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this bingo game!  I play everyday.  My only complaint that keeps it from a five star rating is the daily tournament.  It shouldn't take someone playing over three years, everyday playing four cards, not being able to somehow achieve the jewel of victory.  We have no control over the cards, numbers, power up purchases, etc, but we need to reach a score that the game has set as the goal yet it depends on our collective results.  I have been on with people that have 99 jewels of victory yet most people have never even broken the top 500!!!  There has to be a way to either trade other jewels for it, or so many consecutive plays, some other way to attain it.  Just an idea...
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this works very well as an office app.  The load times are a bit slow but you can do anything on this app you can do on a PC
B0010T0OCY|5.0|I love this movie and its very hard to find. It was really nice to watch it in like 1 point 2 seconds on Amazon.. loved it.
B00B935SUY|5.0|INformative and fun.  If you like music at all you will love this nostalgic look at a time when it was really all about the music.
B009JBZH54|5.0|was very happy with this product. Came exactly as advertised Brand new never opened. My fiance was ecstatic to receive this for her birthday

1451668945|5.0|One of the best writers of all time! MHC always aims to thrill and this novel lives up to any MHC Fan!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really liked this game. It's a lot easier to play than its predecessor. My only issue is that sometimes it doesn't work write if I have my kindle held a certain way.
B008S80OU2|5.0|This is the first box set I picked up in years! Since it arrived I have had the Rarities and Radios Appear discs working overtime in the car! I love it and have yet to even download the 4 shows included. If thinking about purchasing this set, I recommend you do it before the supply is gone as I don't think Sony will be smart enough to keep it in catalog.
0743219619|3.0|This was the fifth of James's novels featuring Commander Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard and even though there's a thirteen-year gap between the first novel and this one (a pretty slow rate), it has more in common with the beginning of the series than with the later efforts. Dalgliesh has been in hospital with what he thought was terminal leukemia and had psychologically begun the progress of letting go of the world. But then (surprise!) it turned out to be a wrong diagnosis -- \\"Only mononucleosis, you know.\\" He's almost annoyed to be told he'll recover. But he has decided to give up his police career anyway. (Throughout this story, Adam seems slightly unbalanced, actually.) But first there's the letter he received from the elderly Father Baddeley, whom he had known as a boy and who has now asked him to come and give his advice on a problem at Toynton Grange, down on the Dorset coast. The Grange is a country house converted by its owner, Wilfrid Anstey, into a hospice for young, chronically and degeneratively ill patients, in honor of his miraculous cure at Lourdes. So Adam finally makes his way there, figuring he'll convalesce for a bit while visiting his old friend, only to find that the priest has died, apparently of natural causes, and has already been cremated and buried. Something's not right though. And at least one of the patients has also recently died under what seem to be questionable circumstances.<br /><br />And there's the set-up. The cast of characters, of course, is limited: The half-dozen patients, all in wheelchairs, Anstey and a another half-dozen staff (all of them losers in one way or another, which means they work cheap), and a couple of odd people renting cottages on the estate. James leads Adam (and the reader) from one player to another, almost by the hand, but it's frankly hard to maintain interest. Adam, as I said, is off his feed, doesn't want to get to know any of these people, resents having to stick around to look into the problem of the priest's death, and only wants to get on with things. None of the patients is much more than pathetic. None of the staff is sympathetic at all. All the smug, rather self-righteous Wilfrid (he goes around in a brown monk's cowl, for God's sake) is the biggest loser of the bunch. The result is a not terribly interesting plot and a pace that drags on and on -- although, in the last chapter, the bodies really begin to pile up. It took some resolution to finish the book, frankly. I'm happy to say that James has improved a very great deal since these early days.he priest's death, and only wants to get on with things.

B005LAIIKI|4.0|Quentin Tarantino is obviously a movie lover. He takes on so many genres in his film making that he creates a blend that is uniquely his own. Django Unchained is a reimagining of the 1960's spaghetti westerns and for the most part the film works. The viewer gets caught up in the action and the story progresses well if a little slowly at times. Set mostly in the pre Civil War South, Tarantino makes what he calls a \\"Southern\\" rather than the traditional Western. In telling his tale he takes on the institution of slavery and racial injustice.<br /><br />Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx) is a former slave who has been given his freedom in order to join Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a bounty hunter to track down and kill the vicious Brittle Brothers. Once this job is done Django is paid seventy-five dollars and given his freedom. Django  decides that he is good at the bounty hunting business and continues on in his  business venture with King. Django's ultimate goal is to find and free his wife Broomhilda Von Schaft (Kerry Washington) from slavery. Django and Schultz learn that she is now at the Mississippi plantation of Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). In order to free her an elaborate ruse is set up involving Mandingo type fighting which is ultimately discovered by Candie's house servant Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) and the inevitable Tarantino bloodbath ensues.<br /><br />The film ,while excellent in its own right just doesn't stand up to earlier Tarantino efforts. While the screenplay and acting are very good throughout there is simply no reason that the almost three hour length was necessary. The movie slows considerably in the second act and the film 's ultra violent conclusion may be off putting to some viewers. This film was one of the features that I was most looking forward to of the Occar contenders and while good did not measure up to the likes of Argo or Zero Dark Thirty. That is not to say that it is not a good film or a fun film to watch just a little bitunderwhelming.<br /><br />The film in addition to great acting by Waltz offers a script with some admittedly great lines. The Regulators scenes are particularly effective at blending humor and over the top action. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is always crisp and beautiful.<br /><br />While this may not be the film of the ages it is certainly worth checking out,
B000JMKRKC|4.0|This was a wonderful story to read, it took me the better part of a full day to read but it really was worth it. A long well thought out free book? You can't go wrong!!
0553801473|1.0|I held off on reading this when it was first released, because I wanted to wait until the series was finished. Now, a few years later, I picked it up so I could stop dodging spoilers. Unfortunately, there was basically nothing to spoil: very little happens, and most of what does is either pointless or horrible. I can only hope the back half of the series will pick back up again, but if it continues this way, I'm going to mourn the series I used to love.

B00A8OBSX6|5.0|\\"Venezia\\" is the latest offering by Max Emanuel Cencic, one of the brave new male soprano-scholars exploring the nearly forgotten music composed for the Baroque castrati. Cencic seems to be engaged in a friendly rivalry with his colleague Philippe Jaroussky, where the pair of them are vying with each other to see who can produce the next exciting disc of rare and gorgeous music from this magical period of music. Each pushing (or pulling) the other to even higher levels of genius and skill. Venezia is magnificent, offering a delightful mix of challenging and exciting bravura arias, and slow adagio arias of exquisite beauty. We have a chance to to hear operatic works performed in Venice during the height of the opera craze: works by Caldara, Gasparini, Giacomelli, and Albinoni-- giants in the opera field in their day, now largely forgotten. There are also five arias by Vivaldi. After hearing Cencic sing the bravura arias of Handel with power and authority, one might wonder whether his voice could address adagio arias and laments with the same heart-wrenching sweetness of Jaroussky or David Daniels-- but here Cencic proves he can. The aria by Albinoni is especially beautiful. What a joy it is to live in a time when we have great male singers capable of resurrecting this wonderful music! This disc is a 'must have' for fans of Baroque music! To complete your collection, may I suggest also purchasing the following: \\"Duetti de Camera\\" (Jaroussky and Cencic, conducted by Christie), \\"Caldara in Vienna\\" (Jaroussky), \\"Cerestini- The Story of a Castrato\\" (Jaroussky),  \\"Vivaldi Heroes\\" (Jaroussky), \\"Handel- Messzo Soprano Opera Arias\\" (Cencic), \\"Caldara- Kantaten\\" (Cencic).

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much... it is great for people who LOVE horses and barn work. I would definatally suggest this app
B006C1DH92|5.0|Love this game but wish there was a little more variety and that you could get more points at the end pi&ntilde;ata most we've ever been able to get is 1400 which is tough
B003ES61EE|4.0|Works just as it should, however it could be better.<br /><br />My only criticism is the direction of the built in clip that allows you to clip it on pocket... it stands the brush side up which is uncovered, allowing a small amount of dust to collect on the bristles even when the brush is retracted.  Other than that it's a winner.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Same game as usual, but still good. Good game for anyone who likes Temple Run, but wants &agrave; different look and feel.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|Overwhelming emotion...very wonderful and meaningful. I truly enjoyed this book and the meaning it shows and the love a mother has for her son and vice versa.
B00005N6KG|3.0|These are the only headphones at this price point I have found that are good for running. No matter how gingerly you handle them, treat them as a disposable item you will be replacing every 1-2 years since one or both of the sides will eventually go out. I have opened them up in the past and repaired them, but it is probably easier to buy a new pair since it will eventually fail again.

0143122916|5.0|I always think that education is the root of getting ahead in life; but I must remind myself that there is more than one type of education. For billions of people, education is not acceptable for reasons such as a religion or of location. But what if you are literally born purposefully into an environment of slavery, such is the case with Shin?<br /><br />This young man taught himself survival skills by having to follow the rules of a slave by his oppressive guards.  He had never seen the outside of the compound he was born into. But Shin kept a keen ear and eye open for more than just doing as was told, because if not, the death penalty would be inforced for any display of hunger, happiness, or of any type of disloyality to this camp's laws. He could be shot for any reason willed upon by a guard.  But Shin beat the odds of having to spend his life in this barbaric camp by route of escaping, after having stories told to him in whispers, about a different life outside of North Korea.<br /><br />Once free and living life differently, still, the scares from torchure on his body faded a lot faster than the scares of not having lived a life with an identiy within himself.  He had to learn that positives and wantings were acceptable choices in life, and would not derive punishments from accessing them.  But trusting and knowledge were to be his demise when trying to make decisions.  I hope that he can make and accept these changes deep inside of himself, as well as letting go of so much<br />of the structured, ridged ways in which the North Korean guards molded him to be, then he will find his path to inner peace.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you are interested in human rights, and/or stories of the stonch, barbarically ruled country of North Korea.

1451695195|1.0|I wanted to like this book. I wanted to believe it. The author seems so sincere. Who would not like to think that there is something beautiful beyond death, that there is nothing to fear, that we can do no wrong and we will be unconditionally loved? Yet, my determination was severely tested by the author's presentation. When Eben Alexander describes his (NDE) Near Death Experience, in 2008, brought on when he descended into a coma from a rare form of an e-Coli Virus,from which there was little hope of his recovery, he fills his tale with a rather large view of himself. He often apologizes for this, but kind of arrogance is, nevertheless, ever present. I felt as if he believed someone had elected him to the top post, to sit at the right hand of G-d. His explanations were often too technical or needed to be accepted based on his word or blind faith. Because he is a man of science, he came with good credentials, but the book left me wanting more. I needed some substance and the book felt thin in that department. If people coming out of comas go into psychotic states, hallucinating, why is it not possible for them to go into a psychotic state and also hallucinate entering into it? If scientifically it is impossible when the Neo Cortex is compromised completely, perhaps the science is wrong. Surely we know little enough about the brain and how it works to simply believe that what he experienced was real and not a dream state of some kind. He had been unhappy in prior years. His family life and professional life had suffered. He was adopted and was unsuccessfully searching for his roots, until a recent contact with a sister proved somewhat fruitful, and he learned of other siblings. He learned that his parents had married and he had a sister who had died. Perhaps his NDE was merely wish fulfillment, on his end.<br /><br />When describing his NDE , he speaks of the Realm of The Earthworm's-Eye View, a place of misery, The Gateway, a place of celestial beauty, where he met the beautiful girl on the butterfly's wing, and The Core, where he felt communion with a greater being, where he felt close to the Creator, to Om, to G-d, to Jesus. Although he justifies the validity of his experience with claims that these are concepts that are new to him, it seemed doubtful to me, a non-Christian, so how could it not be so to him, even if he was not a religious Christian at that time? Are those concepts not universally reminiscent of Heaven, Hell, Purgatory and/or Limbo?<br /><br />Eben realized, as an adoptee, that he had always somehow felt abandoned, unloved and when he thought about his NDE, he wondered why he was the only documented case of a person who had an NDE that had not been aware of who he was, during the experience, and the only one who had not met anyone who had died during his life who would lead him through and comfort him, as others had. Why had his father not come to comfort him, to tell him everything was all right; he had not been able to please him and he wanted his forgiveness. These thoughts reinforced his feelings of abandonment. He began to question the legitimacy of his own experience.<br /><br />When he was still a doubter, in 2008, shortly after his recovery, he went to church and was asked to light an advent candle. Walking up, the music and scenes and sights before him seemed more beautiful than they had in the past, and he was overwhelmed. Since his illness, it would seem that this environment had more meaning for him, and he was brought to tears. The experience evoked memories of his NDE. Eben began to realize that we are so much more than our physical bodies. Still unsure of himself, there was one final act that convinced him he should spread the word about his experience in order to enlighten the world. As a scientist, he believed his word would be more credible than the word of others who had had similar experiences. So when he received a picture of a deceased sister, sent to him by his biological sister he realized she looked oddly familiar. Soon he realized, the last piece of the puzzle had fallen into place. He had met someone he knew. The girl on the butterfly wing in her angelic form was, he believed, his dead sister. He had been reading a book by Elizabeth Kubler Ross in which a young girl relates a NDE to her dad and explains that she met her brother, but she had no brother...her father confessed that a few months before she was born, her brother had died. This revelation about his own dead sibling, gave him renewed hope and faith in his own NDE.<br /><br />Eben believes that consciousness resides some place other than the brain. Paraphrasing, he says, \\"we live in the dimension of the familiar, but the grander universe is here, now, with us, in a different frequency.\\" He believes you don't have to die to access this frequency, \\"to access the truths behind the veil\\", you just have to learn how, but don't try to hard, for that will defeat you. Meditation is a useful tool. To understand the grander universe, you have to be part of it, become one with it.\\"<br /><br />Eben himself admits that his experiences are very hard to describe and it is evident in his writing which is unclear, at times. I found that there was too much information, too technical at times, but there were not enough facts to make it credible. He says his experience in the Core was greater than his ability to understand it, to put into words, that he was able to absorb knowledge at a faster rate, immediately understand things that would take months, even years in ordinary time. In this place, time didn't matter. So, although he couldn't explain it, are we to accept his explanation and beliefs on blind faith? Why was he chosen to pass on this message? I thought the connections he made could be coincidence rather than providential. He had been scientific in his thinking, but now he was more spiritual.<br /><br />Eben wrote that the Creator allows evil to exist because we have free will, but who is the Creator? He says we are all part of the divine, part of G-d, who is all loving and forgiving. He says the divine is always with us, and our job is to grow toward the divine. If we are all part of this G-d, this OM, then who is it or what is it? I have trouble with blind faith. The book feels too Christian in its concepts to be universally accepted. I believe Eben is being a bit presumptuous when he assumes we can all achieve this divine state. Can Jews or Muslims, or Budhists or Hindus achieve this state without disavowing their own faiths?<br /><br />After his experience, he founded ETERNA, a non-profit organization to serve the greater good, to advance research into spiritually transformative experiences. The organization offers comfort and spiritual guidance to those going through difficult times with illness, etc. (Eben believes that you have to earn your entry into the higher planes of the realm he visited. Perhaps, he wants to earn his own by being G-dlike, good and compassionate.)<br /><br />There simply was no PROOF OF HEAVEN, for me. The pieces fell into place, all too conveniently. However, I encourage other readers to draw their own conclusions. Your own background may alter your view and you may find greater inner peace than I did, when you read about what happened to him from the onset of his illness to the time of his recovery and then also learn a bit about his past. As a physician, he also has checkered history which warrants investigation. Perhaps this is all about Alexander's need for love, compassion and forgiveness. He believes, from his NDE, he learned that everyone is loved, they have nothing to fear, and they can do no wrong. That is the strongest message he received. That is also his strongest need, so perhaps it was his own wish fulfillment during his coma, rather than an \\"other worldly\\" experience. At the end of the day, though, do we all have to be Christians to have this experience, to attain this afterlife?<br /><br />I have told little about his experiences, so the reader may draw their own conclusions as they read the book.reator?

B000T3NMYE|5.0|Just as Art Blakey And The Jazz Messengers had already topped the jazz charts         while making their rounds with their live performances, they released another highly         acclaimed album in 1958 that became another part of their long spectacular legacy,         one that would become an apex in The Jazz Messengers’ position on the top of the         jazz charts.  Fronting a new line of Jazz Messengers that solely include the dashing         trumpeter Lee Morgan and pianist- composer Bobby Timmons, they scored another         blockbuster hit with Moanin’, released in late 1958.  What makes this award-winning         hit so ironic is the exclusive appearance from saxophonist-composer Benny Golson        who provides several of his greatest and best known compositions, as it showcased         another phase in their creative artistry.  Headed with an excellent track set featuring         that begins with a brief warm up and dialogue by Morgan and Rudy Van Gelder, the         the robust track set begins with the title track and conclude head on with classic hits         like Along Came Betty, The Drum Thunder Suite (a mesmerizing piece made up of         three movements), Blues March (which call on the fleeing of New Orleans marching         bands) and their take on the standard Come Rain Or Come Shine, until ending with         the alternate take on Moanin’.  Hailed as one of the archetypal hard bop albums of         of all time, the power of this album come directly from the command rhythm section         that is abeited the highly modified lilting arrangements, while Golson hits outlandish         intensity in his fast solos and Timmons gives his piano solos a solid majestic touch         that adds to the magic.  Filled with outstanding musicianship, solid music, excellent         timing, dynamic artistry and high voltage hard bop performed with such astounding         power, Moanin’ is a stunning work of art that ranks as one of Blakey’s greatest and         most important achievements, one will it always remain a timeless turning point for         for the rich spectacular legacy of Blakey and his Jazz Messengers.

B00973CGXK|5.0|After taking there two-year absence from the spotlight, The Killers made their<br />  fabulous return to the music charts in 2012 with this highly versatile tour de force<br />  as they delivered another critical acclaimed listening experience.  Battle Born not<br />  only brings the band into the 2010's in full force, but showcases a superb kind of<br />  compassionate musicianship where they fight the good fight to make their return<br />  a solid success, which they certainly did.

B008JFUO36|4.0|Oblivion is a story about Jack Harper (played by Cruise) serving as a security repairmen stationed on an evacuated Earth. Part of a massive operation to extract vital resources after decades of war with a terrifying alien threat who still scavenges what's left of our planet, Jack's mission is almost complete. In a matter of two weeks, he will join the remaining survivors on a lunar colony far from the war-torn world he has long called home. Jack's existence is brought crashing down after he rescues a beautiful stranger from a downed spacecraft.<br /><br />Watching this in the theaters, I was amazed by the stunning and beautiful special effects. This movie makes the destroyed earth look strikingly realistic. The special effects are definitely the highlight of the movie.<br /><br />Cruise brings a solid acting effort along with Freeman although his (Freeman's) role is relatively short as over half the movie is over when he makes his first appearance.<br /><br />The movie starts a little slowly and takes a bit too long to give the background of Harper's job and relationship with his \\"wife\\" but once the movie gets rolling into the story it is entertaining until the end. This along with a few plot holes, which I won't give away here, keeps this from being a five star review. The plot is an interesting one but there are a few things that you will have to not think about while you watch or the plot will fall apart a bit.<br /><br />Even with its flaws, Nonetheless I think this is a good sci-fi movie and is worth watching.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I couldn't put this book down and finished it within one day.  I didn't like it as much as the first or second book in the trilogy, simply because I found myself reading quickly over parts that didn't have anything to do with Katniss and Peeta (because I wanted to know what was going to happen between them).  While I liked the outcome of the story, I felt like the ending was just a quick summary, when it could've been drawn out a little bit more.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I had never seen this movie before and it is one of my husband's favorites.  I bought him a special copy of the movie and we watched it together.  It was one wild ride.  Jeff Bridge's exudes cool in the movie and he keeps you guessing as to what the Dude will do next. There are many classic lines that come from this movie such as \\"the Dude abides.\\"  If you are looking for a funny movie that keeps you entertained start to finish, The Big Lebowski is the movie for you!
0525478817|5.0|This was, in all, a heartbreaking story with a slightly predicable ending. However, I enjoyed the overall attitude of this book and just the way that John Green writes. He seems to write in a language that most teens can recognize and relate to. I thought the emotions are to be described as simply raw, and this aspect greatly contributed to the book and the feelings that the reader got from reading it. Despite the two teens having cancer, i thought the lessons from the book are relatable to all audiences. The book was a quick to read and was totally worth the week i spent on it. It's a book that will always stick in the back of my head somewhere, reciting the sarcastic and witty quotes.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I love this book. It is the best \\"science-y\\" science fiction that I've read in a long time. It is a perfect teaching tool for scientific method, critical thinking, chemistry, math and so much more--not to mention it's a very engaging story. I could use this in my middle school science classroom with the new common core standards that are being implemented, but the language prohibits that. I wish the publisher would send out a \\"classroom\\" version. Omitting the expletives will in no way harm the integrity of the plot or the character.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I think this movie does not need recommendation is a classic  thank you and enjoy with your family  if you buy one
B003ELY7PG|4.0|Brief and to the point.<br />Its a must read for professionals struggling to get results for their hardwork.<br />It confirms on our ideas what works and what doesn't in a workplace
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I like this light comedy,  thank you very much and it was just in time to enjoy with my friends.
B0095P31L6|5.0|This was a very silly show, and to be honest I loved it.  I have seen it a couple times now and would watch it again.  i did not see a big difference between dvd and streaming digital.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Wonderful movie, that you could watch numerous times and still come away thinking about it.  The photography was amazing, 3D exceptional.  We've enjoyed several showings already with family and friends.
0307592731|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's memoir of self-destruction after her young mother's death, and redemption on the Pacific Coast Trail, is one of the best books I've read this year. As a writer, I intend to study it page by page and learn how she keeps the reader's rapt attention as she describes her journey in agonizing detail. This is an amazing accomplishment.
B004G600A4|5.0|I was very pleased with my movie purchase. This item came almost brand new. Shipping was fast and nicely packaged. I will definitely order again. My daughter was very excited to receive this and have played this movie many times.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I'm not sure I see an Oscar in this, but it was a fun little movie, and the acting was impeccable.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I love most of Liam Neesen movies.  This move had a lot of action and kept my attention throughout the movie.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|The transition to blu ray was very good. Great picture quality. Decent behind the scene and historical information as extras. Worth the money I paid for it.
B004MSWLU8|3.0|Depends on the use you want to give it. I bought it for a teenager girl who is not a native english speaker and I  found the book a little too long.(i consider it can be shorter not losing it's essence. Plus the small font of letter may it harder to read.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I gave up running over ten years ago due to knee pain. I've missed it ever since. I was never a competitive runner and never wanted to be. I just liked to run. I started to become interested in barefoot running when I started to hear about the potential for injury reduction and recovery. This book was repeatedly mentioned in my research, so I picked it up. I expected a nuts and bolts textbook based on anthropological studies and I was so wrong.<br /><br />There is a ton of interesting information, to be sure, about barefoot and minimalist running in this book but mostly there's a fascinating, gripping story about the love of running that makes for a wonderful and moving read whether you're interested in running or not.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I gave it a four because it had its ups and downs of love and hate. Kept u on it feet
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Was very excited to see this movie and it was very good. Cheapest on Amazon. Checked my other options and this was definitely the best deal.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This is a great game to kill time for adults an kids a like so try it you just might be hooked an if you are pass it on
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I am able to track my exercise online using my Garmin great way to see how I am progressing.  Setting it up can be confusing so recommend you go online and view the instructional videos on You Tube.
1932735410|5.0|An author of a PMP book recommended this one in preparation for the PMP exam.  I'm glad he did!<br /><br />Rita gives tips, tricks and insights that aren't offered in the PMBOK.  She even says things like \\"this isn't covered in the PMBOK but you need to know it for the exam.\\"<br /><br />I like that there are practice exams at the end of each chapter.  And explanations of the answers following.  It has helped me learn & understand the concepts a lot more.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that the voice is very demeaning.<br /><br />Note: Rita passed away so there might not be a new edition of this book that covers the PMBOK v5.<br /><br />Also, a word of advice:  Don't take the PMP Boot Camp by your local PMI chapter.  I did and it was terrible!!!!  If you want to attend a boot camp, spend the extra money and sign up with a company that specializes in training.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed this game because of its simplicity. It was easy to follow and I could play at whatever level I wanted, from casual to a stricter regimen. Nice game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|...what are you waiting for? Easily one of the best works I have read in years, Howey creates a fully realized world (or, perhaps, a world within a world) that is populated with fascinating and heroic characters. I was on the edge of my seat on every page, and I expect you will be too!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Amazing sound, amazing shipping, amazing price, this is a must buy for people who listen to music around the house and dont want to bother anyone
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I knew very little about The Life of Pi before I began to read it. I knew only that it was about a boy in a lifeboat with a tiger, and that it was highly recommended to me. I bought the book probably two years ago, and it sat on the shelf, continually pushed aside by other acquisitions. Recently, I began to see previews of the movie based upon the book, and my interest was renewed. It seemed a foregone conclusion that I would see the movie; I should read the book before I saw it - a habit I have tried to follow, though at times I am wholly unsuccessful.<br /><br />The version I had purchased was the illustrated version, featuring paintings of certain scenes described in the book. As I understand, there was a contest to compete for the honor of illustrating the novel, and Tomislav Torjanac won the prize. To be honest, the illustrations did little for me; I cannot specifically recommend the illustrated version moreso than the non-illustrated one. They did not detract from the experience, but in my opinion only marginally enhanced it.<br /><br />The book is in three parts: before, during and after the time spent in the lifeboat. The majority of the book is in part two, and I must admit I was pleasantly surprised - given such a limited setting - at how fresh the content was. Part one was very fun to read, as it provided a wealth of background information regarding the business of running a zoo, and how this business is viewed by a young child. Part two was an exciting adventure, fraught with terror and anxiety, as well as a nice insight into the ingenuity of young Pi. Whether his actions are believable for someone of such young age, I leave to the reader to determine for themselves. Part three has a fantastically ingenious twist in it that gives the reader a new perspective on the story just concluded.<br /><br />I heartily enjoyed this book, and burned through it quite quickly.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|Hadn't watched this in a long time. Didn't disappoint the second time around.  Seven more words required to qualify for post.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|forgot I had this one.  I watched it again and put it on the shelf.  I'm sure I'll watch it again in the future.  Was here in good time and well wrapped.
B00005JL0I|5.0|fine bargain
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was really into this book tracking the missing wife.  However, I was really disappointed at the ending.  What a let down.
B00881PTRC|3.0|This game would be better if they eliminated short words. It's frustrating to have a game ruined because a four or five-letter word pop up that you can't reasonably figure out.<br /><br />r
B001H1SVO8|5.0|got it in good time and is a great movie. Apparently I have to put more words here which is ridiculous to ask from someone who is already giving their time writing this, let alone anything at all
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This a great free app... Gets her up and makes my life easier because I don't have to. She is a bear in the morning LOL
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game. I cannot put down this game; I want to keep playing until I beat the next level and then the next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I first heard of the app I thought it was just another stupid app but when I played it I was stunned.  I love this app it was all worth it. &Agrave;NY MINECRAFT = AWSOME
B004QL7K6G|5.0|Love this movie! I wanted to live there so much! Live off the grid, naturally! (But I gotta have real coffee!) lol Movie was in excellent condition. I wanted this for my collection. I love Jen, and have most of her movies. Get some wine & popcorn & enjoy!
B00001OH7Y|5.0|A few months ago I was in a used record/CD store and on the speakers was the David Bowie album &#34;Scary Monsters.&#34;  Yes, it had been years since I have played this album on my stereo system (the vinyl remains tucked away in a peach crate with several thousand other vinyl offerings) and had forgotten how wonderful this album actually was.  While browsing for other CD's, this album just seemed to get better.  Sure I looked for it in the used CD bin, but it was not in there, so I decided that when I came home I would order it on line.  Well, it came the other day in my mail box and it is now being played on my CD player and it rocks my world.  Could I name a few of the top songs?  Sure, but I won't because there are so many to choose from, buy the CD, play it and make your own decisions as to what tracks you like the best, it is chock full of some real gems!
B004LWZW88|5.0|My kids love this movie.  I have seen this movie a thousand times thanks to my kids and I must say I not sick of it yet.
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|This is truly an amazing concert.  Back in the days when the ticket price was $5.50 and the musicians were talented and raw.  Wouldn't it be great to go back in time and go see a Bowie show (or any other for that matter) where it didn't cost you a weeks pay to attend a concert?  This is basically the ultimate Bowie concert and thankfully it is captured on tape for those of us who missed the tour the first time around.  To hear Mick Ronsons guitar again was truly amazing and so nice.  The set list is perfect and the version of &#34;Space Oddity&#34; is priceless.  I need a time machine so I can go back to Santa Monica on October 20, 1972 and attend this event.  WOW!
B008JFUS5A|5.0|The HUNGER GAMES is awesome but catching fire is better<br />I LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES!!!!!<br />THE HUNGER GAMES IS AWESOME
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I THINK ANYONE READING THIS BOOK MUST BE HORRIFIED  OF THE MISERY THAT THE ORDINARY NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE HAVE TO ENDURE.  THE AUTHOR DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF COVERING THE DIFFICULTY FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON TO SURVIVE .
1419705849|5.0|I didn't read it, but it's keeping my son busy - and he's reading!  Any time they're reading is good.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I've enjoyed the teacher series, however I not read the first book. I waited a long time for it too.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|First heard them on TV, either Jimmy Fallon or Ellen Degenerus (my go to for new musicians source).  I liked their sound immediately and the CD has not disappointed me.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Nicholas my great nephew absolutely loves this dvd he loves the crocodile and this dvd suits his age of 3<br />thank you
B006LSZECO|3.0|This may be the most horrific book I've ever read or it may be one of the best. Either way, it held me spellbound.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I love all crime stories, but this one kept me guessing. Even though it is for a generation younget than I, I couldn't help but love it! I have read it multiple times and enjoy it as if it was the first time I have read it!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I recommend this product, it protects my little ones kindle and it has a nice finish. a bit expensive compared to other cases but it is worth.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My two girls really enjoy this game.  They love the daily challenges to try and earn gems and currently have purchased with coins 3 horses.  However, many items require gems, which can take awhile to earn.  A downside is the amount of ads you have popping up.  After almost every mini game there is an ad, and it has happened that the ads have locked up my kindle.
B007EECSFA|5.0|We read this for book club and everyone enjoyed it.  Loved the ending!!!!!  Kate Morton is such a good author!
1416549447|5.0|I have been running for many years and this book has really allowed me to change my form to the point that it makes running fun. Far less impact on my feet than ever before and less effort to actually run. I recommend it to anyone who is running or wants to start.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Loved it, read right through it and Couldn't wait to read the next. I'm half way through the third book. Love them!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was great from the start. I love movies based on true events.  They even show pictures of the real people involved at the end which shows an excellent job in casting.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Ive just completed the second chapter and am having a blast!  I love the way this game keeps drawing you further in.  Unlike any other I've played.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie stayed true to the book, was well acted and had plenty of action.  The challenge will be with the two ensuing books.  Should be a fun trilogy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It a great game when you have had one of those day and a book just won't work. The game help out.
B006KP3XCQ|2.0|The movie was unopened in a slightly damaged package.  Packaging did not bother me but there are several scenes in the movie that &#34;stick&#34; (you have to skip scenes entirely to resume play of the movie).  DVD player is brand new and this is the only DVD that this problem has occurred with.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this games is awesome and I love it it is even better when you love horses you can do all kinds of stuff and not very hard I hope y'all like it
0345529057|5.0|Best series I have ever read. Definitely worth many rereads, I am on my third right now and I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting and the quality is great on the kindle! My whole family loves it as well as I love it! If you need something to get you occupied, get this game NOW!!!!!!
1451695195|4.0|The writer did a very thorough job of describing his experiences on the &#34;other side&#34; and should make believers out of &#34;non believers&#34;.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect, but they kept the movie so close to the original I was a bit surpised, even the dance moves were the same!  This just had an awful soundtrack in my opinion; nothing will beat the original
B000OC5VVW|5.0|To be truthful about this i only rate is a good<br />The record did play nice, but the front of album had pen marks drawn to the ladys face.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Had enough werewolves, zombies,etc.? This is hard Science fiction in the spirit of Hal Clement or Heinlein's Roads Must Roll.  Bravo!! More!!
B009AMANH4|5.0|After the movie I read the book. The film starts at the 80% mark and is excellently portrayed. Lewis does a magnificent job.
B0076NAW48|4.0|I wanted Blues piano examples, this CD with its notes is OK by me.<br /> As Chuck says, the guitar has taken over and the<br />piano as a jazz instrument overshadowed.
B0031RS2XG|5.0|What an Awesome insight to how to get your message to more people I loved it. I will use it forever now.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love it because it takes me back to when it first came out. I wish I could play as well as I use to.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|There were some great scary moments. Unfortunately, the movie as a whole was a disappointment. Maybe the next installment will be better.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Wont work right on my tablet. Play it on your pc or laptop. Wastef my money on this one for 6.99
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Philosophical,interesting characters and story line. Long winded though. Many universal truths, great understanding of humanity,society and spirituality. A walk through French history.
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|There was a very confusing part to the game. Was fun at first then the hard puzzle could not get through it
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have never been in love with a free app like this one!!!!! its the real deal!!!!!!! u can dress him as u want, have your jetpack to the one you like, your gadgets are in cool combinations( just wish u can use more than just 2 gagdets) and look at your achievements whenever!!!! its my dream come true!!!!
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Love this eriter cant put it down..read all his stuff he is great characters seem real and awesome , magic system. No elves or vampires
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I bought this box set to replace my old, worn out vhs set of the original 6 star trek films. I have not been disappointed! And as for the price, outstanding! Amazon delivers great deals and this is no exception. Forget those ridiculously expensive original star wars movies that are available on dvd and buy the original star trek films instead. They are more entertaining and fun to watch anyway. I like the quality of the transfers overall and the extras are a nice touch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is the most amazing game in the world!it's fun, but challenging.it's like a new world of sunshine.and well yup.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|this by far, in my opinion; is the greatest acting that I have seen from Jamie Fox. I am astounded. This is Quentin Tarantino at his best. The support cast was spectacular.
B00980IA3M|4.0|You have to appreciate DG's policy here. This is an opportunity for them to tap a huge market of collectors who may have purchased one or the other single release, but picked and chose what they saw as the best. In general, this would have included a hefty swag of Solti and/or Karajan recordings. Under these circumstances it would have been foolish in the business sense for DG to offer Solti or Karajan recordings again. They would not sell in large enough quantities to warrant it, since the risk of buyers acquiring too many duplications is too great. Whereas with the price asked for this box, many collectors may jump at the chance to acquire what they miss and accept second-string recordings as a gift. I don't see how one can sensibly criticise DG for their decision. After all, there are a few first class issues here, and even their second stringers are not to be despised!<br />So this box does not call for an objective review and assessment of the merits of each of the recordings. It asks whether the buyer receives value for money, pure and simple.<br />And to this question the answer can only be \\"yes\\".<br />For an idealist with a lean budget, the cost is severe of course. Should you (for example) buy e.g. a missing Holländer and Parsifal from another company at probably the same total price, or take what you get in addition to your needs and put up with less than the best for the rest?<br />I'll be candid with you and say: When I was an impecunious university student, I would have run so fast you wouldn't have seen me for the dust, to grab hold of a box! Meanwhile I have acquired all the recordings I want, so the box holds no attractions any more - circumstances alter cases! And this, I think, is what DG is banking on.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Was easy to download. Not sure the time limits on replay, but would consider using again. I did not even know the service existed
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this is the best game in the world and I recamand ot for every one ah who am I pudding this game sick bad I wouldn't recoomand it for anyone
B002PEP4C8|4.0|Good to read for feeling that life might be hard but we survive somehow. I picked this up at the book store.. read some.. then couldn't get it out of my head so I downloaded it so I could read the rest.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My 4 year old loves it- her favorire game. only negative is that its forcing me to write a review before she can continue to play.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|This is a great classic movie and a great addition to the Indiana Jones collection of movies. I wish they would have included it the boxed set.
B000UZ4OYS|5.0|This is a beautiful album full of beautiful songs. This is one of my absolute favorites. José González has a great voice and musical style that's capable of transporting you to otherworldly places.
B003KRGCTI|5.0|This is a terrific movie with Denzel Washington pretty much kicking butt (kill) and not bothering to take names of anyone who gets in his way of his goal to take his book West. Gary Oldman plays his his role as bad-guy wonderfully.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|.I really liked the info.  Saw him on TV and wanted to know more.  But it is just too hard to scroll back and forth on the Kindle to check info and reread ideas and recipes.  So order in book form.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying All That Echos. This CD is true to the quality of music and lyrics produced by Josh Groban.
1932735410|5.0|The book helps readers understand real-life situations and how to apply PMI processes. I recommend it to those who want to get certified.
B000FBFM9S|4.0|A hell of a first novel, although I prefer \\"On Beauty,\\" which reflects a more matured author. White Teeth is loaded with enough symbolism and themes for a semester of English literature - colonialism, imperialism, inter-generationalism, religion, duty to family and country, hero worship, tradition, class, culture, science, and like any good English book, keeping up appearances. The author has a talent for getting into the heads of a wildly diverse cast of characters and realistically predicting how they will evolve and interact when matched up with one another. It's also very funny, sometimes in a clipped Oxford way, sometimes Irish gallows humor, sometimes just broad comedy. If there's a flaw, it's that the book meanders a bit too much and abandons a POV character just as you were starting to empathize with them. Some have complained that it lacks an overarching plot. I disagree, but I do find the first half of the book more engaging than the second. Still, it's worth the ride.
0596522347|5.0|The book helps to avoid boring presentations and to explore the full power of PowerPoint. I use what I learned in my elearning designs.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|\\"Probably another sugary sentimental piece of crap like Marley & Me, corporately designed to play your heartstrings like a Bieber ballad,\\" I thought as I skimmed the first few pages. \\"But I like dogs, and the dog is the narrator in this one. Gee, I wonder if the dog's love saves the owner's life? What claptrap.\\"<br /><br />Three waking hours later, I was on the last few pages of the book, standing in a subway train on the way to work, desperately fighting the urge to cry while wearing business casual. \\"That poor dog! His love saved the owner's life!!\\"<br /><br />Unless your heart is made of iron, you will fall for this book and the dog Enzo, hook, line and sinker. Beware. Don't finish it in public.
0394826817|5.0|I read this book to an ESL preschooler I tutor.  He loved the story about animals and manners. I asked questions about the names of the animals and the preschooler answered the questions correctly and in full sentences.  I had to pull the complete sentences out of him; however, he did well.  He knows that when I come, he is to use English using complete sentences.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Love it so far still reading it when I start reading it I don't like to put it down because it gets good but I end up falling asleep reading it
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I bought for an insanely low price, and I absolutely love &#34;Madness.&#34; Some of the other tracks just aren't really listenable to me, I find them more annoying than enjoyable. Some are okay though. I wouldn't say I'm a Muse fan as much as I'm a &#34;Madness&#34; fan at this point.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Installed Angry Birds from 3 different app stores, they were free downloads. ALL 3 were infected with malware.<br />So, for a measly $0.99, Amazon gave me satisfaction, safety and a guarantee. Oh, and don't forget ad-free!<br />A free, infected, useless app compared to a $0.99 guarantee; leaves no room for debate on where to go for apps if you want satisfaction and peace of mind guaranteed.<br />Thanks again Amazon!<br /><br />Moreover, with Amazon's Angry Birds app, the power-ups are totally cheaper then the ones sold with the app from other app stores. Just one more instance where Amazon hasn't failed in giving me customer satisfaction.
0307744434|4.0|And to think that before I read it I had assumed that this book must have been inspired by a dream the author had one night.  I expected The Night Circus to have a lot of mood and aura (which it did), but hadn't expected the engrossing plot.  Very, very nicely done work of fantastical fiction.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this game is sk good I some times play it at school and dding read aloud my teacher reads a books and survivalcraft is the best
1848366159|1.0|Note that the Kindle version contains much less information than the paper book... it is highly abridged. Also, the maps are useless since when you zoom in they become blurry and completely unreadable.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I kinda felt like this had the right vibe for Dredd but felt like Urban was channeling Stallone too much. All in all, this was a great movie for Dredd fans.
1603427244|5.0|Edges are so important to the look of a knitted garment. I very much wanted to learn more than the long tail cast-on & the cast-off method I most often use; i.e., knit 2, then slip the first knit stitch over the second & slip off the needle. This excellent guide does that,<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to those who want to continue learning new knitting techniques & skills.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This is a huge marketing platform for adware....and you get the weather with it. There are better solutions. You also have to allow more access to location and privacy than you should.
B0096HL33G|1.0|I hate slow moving plot lines and story telling.  Glad I wasn't in a theater.  Would have hated myself for setting aside an evening of disappointment.  Glad I was able to switch to another movie.  Thanks to video streaming.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three books.  I actually reread all of them.  Underneath all the sex is a beautiful love story.  You can't help but fall in love with Christian and Ana.  Highly recommend!
B0079IJ0R0|5.0|I happen to come across a 1 minute sample of this opera over on iTunes one evening and immediately became mesmerized by the seductive interpretation of the character Carmen by Elina Garanca.  I ended up ordering the blu ray version and once the disc arrived, sat down to which I thought would have been an excruciating three hours.  Mind you I tend to stay far away from operas not due to the music but simply due to the length of the performances.  What I can now say I fell in love with this performance and couldn’t believe how quickly the time flew by on this show. I fell in love with Miss Garanca’s performance and to date this is the perfect version and one that will get repeated viewings.  This performance also opened my eyes to Miss Garanca’s other works which I tend to visit in the near future.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good Read!  Not as great as Fifty Shades, but I liked it a lot.  Highly recommend if you liked Fifty shades.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Another good read..I will read them both again before the third one comes out! Can't wait for the third one.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|the movie was great kids loved it I loved for a family movie cant go wrong with price toys didn't work but everything else was fine love ordering movies from AMAZON
B008HK3XU4|3.0|In all fairness, I should state I got this cover to try out on a Kindle that is not a Fire, in order to use it as a vertical stand.  It just basically had to stand vertically, without constantly falling down, with the Kindle resting in it.  If this case stands vertically, however, I can't figure out how it does.  It was only pictured in the instructions as standing horizontally.  It's a nice color purple, though, but it definitely does not have the look of a really nice leather case.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book is amazing! I cannot even describe all the feelings and thoughts that went through my head.everyone in this book had a 3 dimensional feel to them. At times i caught myself wishing they were real so I could give them a piece of my mind with a hug or a high-five( to the face at times). The pacing kept me turning  the pages, and I can't wait until book 3.
0812550706|2.0|A nice story about a boy that gets thrown in and around combat schools to become a commander and take on alien invaders. For anyone unknown to the genre it is a nice litlle book, for anyone used to reading space opera this is only an introduction that is a bit dull in comparisson to any Hamilton or Simmons book. Personally I think it is not possible to put a sci fi novel in 326 pages...it will always end up in a normal story with a sci fi setting. I like to have the story come from the setting with the story comming from the scifi side. This book uses scifi as a kind of gravy to tell a nice futuristic fiction novel.
0452295548|5.0|I thought the first part about the actual process of the stroke was interesting, but I was really taken back by the recover part.  The emphasis on positive thinking, taking mini steps to conquer something hard, speaking quietly and with respect, even though the patient can't respond were just some of the ideas I can incorporate in my life.  I had read someone elses book and enjoyed it so much, I wanted to have my own copy.  Definitely a reference keeper.

B003NS2T9G|3.0|I watched it because I love sci-fi and there is not much sci-fi out there; however, it is a it to dark and the stories often &#34;just fit into the time schedule&#34; and end without full development. The actors are good though and the sets and such are good.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I am glad I read the written versions nothing like the movie. I never realized that there was so many characters.
B003FBMS4W|4.0|Beautiful settings, the first movie made in iconic Monument Valley, Utah, despite the intro banner telling us it is Texas.  The movie reveals the defining character for the John Wayne persona of later movies. It is uncertain why director Ford was showing us the blatant racism against Native Americans, which is amplified and aggravated by Wayne's character.  Is Ford empathetic with the native peoples, or does he support Manifest Destiny of Europeans occupying the west?  It is certainly a movie well worth watching, but unsettling given the understanding we now have of the plight Native Americans have suffered at the hands of the Europeans taking over their historic lands.

B00B2166BS|4.0|...but it didn't. So another company came up with this cable. Works well, another review states how well it works electronically. For some reason it doesn't really connect well the other way around, although that was seemingly supported.<br /><br />Minus one star for length of cable, it's just inconvenient. 2 or 3 feet extra would've been nice. Price also didn't push it up to 5 stars.<br /><br />The quality of the cable is fine, nothing wrong with that. Not something ultra cheap that'll fall apart.
1451638450|5.0|I love Lois McMaster Bujold's books, and this was no exception. It was really fun to have an Ivan-centric story, getting to see the world from his perspective. The cameo appearances by other major characters from the series were really fun, but didn't overwhelm the Ivan part of the story. I do think this would probably have been a little harder to follow if it were someone's first introduction to the world, but for anyone well-versed in the Vorkosigan Saga, this is another great story.
1452115567|5.0|The book is an experience in itself. I did not purchase it from amazon, rather a barns and nobles during a signing. It's not just dog pictures but the feel of adventure. Not to mention meeting Maddie and Theron at the signing was a very humbling experience. Yes there are many awesome pictures of a well trained dog but there is also a love story with Theron and his dog, his love for photography, the places he's gone, and the friends he has met there.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I absolutely love Tina Fey. Can't get enough of her! Her book is just as good as I thought it would be...even more so! I really enjoyed getting to know her background a little bit more and realizing that she has the same worries and concerns in life that we \\"average folk\\" do (only her handling of the aforementioned causes endless laughing in the masses). I highlighted so much of the book for her quick-witted, hilarious anecdotes that it's mostly shaded in! :)
B009MF56GC|4.0|This sequel to the Expendables was as entertaining as the first, with a few more twists thrown in, a ton of catchphrases, some damn good fight scenes, and a lot of explosions.<br /><br />If you are looking for a deep thoughtful plot look elsewhere.<br />If you want an adventure to suck you in and make you alternately laugh and cringe, this will do just fine.
B005NQ94KS|4.0|I liked this movie a lot because parts of it hit close to home. Yes, sometimes it may take years for you to realize that the one has been sitting in front of you for many years, sometimes it just takes a touch to realize that your best friend with whom you have played the stupidiest versions of yourself is really the one. I loved that fact that in this story, they did a get chance to discover and live this romance. This movie has a very positive message. True love truly forgives your past and overlooks past mistakes, in exchange for the wonderful experience of falling in love with your best friend.

0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson did a fantastic job of tying up a multitude of threads in Robert Jordan's epic weave.  \\"The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills.\\"  I wouldn't be surprised if this series develops a Dianetics type cult following now that it is complete.  I have been reading since book One and I have waited years between sequels, anxiously and silently cursing Robert Jordan.  Who tortures like this!! Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan have elevated themselves to Isaac Asimov, Sci-Fi Hall of Fame standards.  Buy it.  Read em all!!!
B00AF6B22E|3.0|I guess it appeals to some crowds but I really didn't see what was so thrilling or over a documentary about the &#34;miracle on the Hudson&#34;. It just doesn't do much for me. It's one of those movies that you watch once and then file it forever.
B007N31ZKQ|5.0|I bought this for my blu-ray collection and I love this movie.  It is a classic!  It's weird and amazing in that special Coen way.  Everyone is great in this movie but Jeff Bridges is a stand out and hilarious!  Buy this movie for your collection.  Enjoy!
0425252868|5.0|I read \\"A Higher Call\\" in three days.  It totally absorbed me and left me wanting more, much more.  No writer of fiction could have created a more intriguing character than Franz Stigler, the Lufthansa come Luftwaffe pilot around whom so much of the action revolves.  Reading this was a wonderful experience.<br /><br />John Palshaw
B00000J2PH|5.0|I finally got around buying CDs for my CD collection to put on my ipod.  I have the album and the cassette tape.  One of the best albums ever made.  The writing is stellar.  I also purchased the Tapestry CD that was done by various artists.  It's okay but doesn't compare to the original.  Buy this CD for your collection.  Enjoy!
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This is a great puzzle game. It doesn't take much to master the easy level, but the higher difficulties make it challenging. It is great to have a Gabe that does not ask for intrusive permissions and that doesn't bombard you with constant in-app purchase suggestions.

B00633W614|5.0|This is a wonderful read.  You won't regret opening this book.  This is a family saga that spans generations.  There are tons of surprises like murder, love, hatred, extreme wealth, poverty, prostitution, and friendship.  What else do you expect of an author?
B003T0G9XU|4.0|Similar to the previous Tiffany Aching novels in humour and incite, but with yet another unique storyline. Probably not one to be read without having read the previous books, but this is very enjoyable.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading Cat's Cradle. The novel points out the futility of man's thoughts. A must read for Vonnegut fans there are some laugh out loud moments and passages that bring on deep thought.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I was looking for another book to read that was as engaging as the Hunger Games. This book provided the same excitement, unexpected plot twists and I couldn't put it down. Immediately after finishing I purchased the sequel. If you liked the Hunger Games Series or a book like The Host, I would highly recommend reading this series.

B00AWQEKIK|5.0|By Stephen Roeser<br /><br />In the late '90s, I was writing for a magazine, and one time was granted backstage access at a benefit concert put on at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.  Among the many great and legendary musical performers on the bill that night were Crosby, Stills & Nash.<br /><br />After arriving by myself and receiving my credentials, I was directed around to the stage door.  Suddenly, walking right in front of me, there was David Crosby.  \\"Wow,\\" I thought, \\"I didn't know I'd be allowed to go in the same entrance as the musicians.\\"  But I was.<br /><br />As I slowly made my way into the darkened backstage space, behind the closed curtain, about 30 or 40 minutes before the show was due to start, I stopped several feet away from a husky, balding guy facing the other way, in mid-conversation with someone.  He had one arm extended and leaning on an amp or something, and I noticed the guy's wristwatch.  He was wearing a Guess watch.<br /><br />I looked around and recognized a number of other singers who'd be performing: Emmylou Harris was there, Dan Fogelberg, Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt, the fabulous Carole King...Jackson Browne squeezed past me at one point, looked at me and said, \\"Hi.\\"  Nobody knew who I was (there was no reason why they would), but perhaps thought I might be somebody's agent or manager.<br /><br />I wasn't listening in on the conversation of the guy wearing the Guess watch, but I thought the tone of his speaking voice sounded very familiar.  Then I realized, I was standing next to someone who, from the age of about 15 (or younger) I had always thought of as one of my music idols: Stephen Stills.  That is a disorienting experience, if you've ever had one like it.<br /><br />Part of me, the part that is pure fan and can't help admiring superior musical excellence, wanted to wait for a chance to speak to the man with the Guess watch, and simply tell him how much I'd enjoyed his music since I was a teenager.  (How many times could hehave heard that one before?)  But the part of me that was a professional journalist, combined with the part that is sensible adult possessing a semblance of manners and civility, reigned in \\"the fan in me\\" pretty quickly.<br /><br />I did not want to interrupt his conversation.  I did not want to abuse the privilege of having been invited backstage at this wonderful event.  I did not want to bother Stephen Stills while he was preparing to go on stage to play his guitar and sing in front of a packed house.  I also did not want to make an idiot out of myself.<br /><br />So, I remained silently standing where I was for another few moments, glanced once more at the Guess watch strapped to the wrist of Stephen Stills, then slowly drifted around to another part of the backstage area.<br /><br />The show was great.  I got to watch everybody perform from the wings.  And the next week, I went out and bought for myself a Guess watch exactly like the one that I'd seen Stephen Stills wearing.<br /><br />As a fan, that was my delayed reaction (I Guess) to have found myself standing elbow-to-elbow with one of my personal rock idols.  Stephen Stills could probably afford to purchase any kind of watch made anywhere in the world, even THE most expensive one.  But he wore one that even I could afford to buy.  I kind of liked that.<br /><br />Any rock 'n' roll artist roughly equal in stature and accomplishment to Stephen Stills (granted, there are not very many such people), who finally gets the box set treatment--long overdue, one might say, in the case of Stills--faces the same dilemma in the marketplace.  (In fact, \\"rock 'n' roll\\" is but one musical genre at which Stills has excelled.)  The music enthusiast, actually, is the one faced with the dilemma: \\"How much Stephen Stills music do I really NEED?\\"<br /><br />So, to keep things simple, let's divide Stills fans into two categories, \\"casual\\" and \\"hardcore.\\"  A fair number of the hardcore fans surely knew about this box in advanceand either purchased or ordered it as soon as they could.  The inclusion of a couple dozen previously-unreleased tracks was justification enough to spend the money.<br /><br />The casual fan, basically content to listen again to his/her LP or CD copies of the classic CSN and CSNY albums, may not be in such a hurry to get it.  But, as informed Stephen Stills fans have long been aware, there's a lot more to the man's music career than his collaborations with Neil Young, David Crosby and Graham Nash.  Nash, who co-produced (co-curated?) this collection, is certainly someone who knows that.<br /><br />For example, Stills has also played with ex-members of such bands as The Rolling Stones (Bill Wyman), The Byrds (Chris Hillman), The Yardbirds (Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page), Beatles (Ringo), Electric Flag (Harvey Brooks, Barry Goldberg) and Band Of Gypsies (Buddy Miles, and another pretty good guitarist named James Marshall Hendrix).  And that's just for starters.<br /><br />It should be pointed out that Carry On surely does cover a lot, but that's not to say it covers everything.  Why, for instance, could not at least ONE track from Super Session have been included on Disc 1?  Stills was NOT a sideman (see Joel Bernstein's \\"Selected Sessionography\\" on page 111 of the elaborate booklet) on that celebrated 1968 LP, but a featured player along with Al Kooper and Michael Bloomfield.<br /><br />The ideal choice would've been \\"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry,\\" to go along with two other Bob Dylan covers that are on Disc 4.  Super Session was a key project that Stills was involved in (as short-notice replacement for Bloomfield, Side 2 only, guitar only, no vocals), done after Buffalo Springfield, but before CSN.<br /><br />Surely a track from this important album could have been licensed for the Stills box.  Then again, it might've been a case where the rationale of Nash and box co-producer Bernstein was such that they did not want to include any tracks with a different lead singer, and Kooper did sing on that one, not Stills.  Oh well.  Stills fans must also seek out Super Session, if you are lacking a copy.<br /><br />On the outstanding Disc 1, there are enough Springfield tracks (11) to firmly establish what a creative force Stills was in that great but short-lived group.  For more, one is encouraged to track down a copy of the out-of-print Buffalo Springfield box set, released in 2001, which Neil Young ostensibly had a significant role in assembling.<br /><br />Years ago, when interviewing Peter Lewis of Moby Grape, this writer was told that, long after the recording of \\"For What It's Worth\\" (Stephen's earliest commercial success as a songwriter), Stills admitted to Lewis that the song's musical structure was essentially built upon two Grape tunes--one of which was \\"Murder In My Heart For The Judge\\"--that the members of Buffalo Springfield heard when they would go to see Moby Grape play live in 1966.  Shortly thereafter, Stephen's creative confidence apparently zoomed up so high that he felt he needn't \\"borrow\\" anyone's musical ideas anymore except for his own (as he did when he incorporated a major section of his Buffalo Springfield song \\"Questions\\" into the CSNY classic \\"Carry On\\").<br /><br />Disc 2 dives immediately into the Stills solo work, starting off with \\"Love The One You're With.\\"  His self-titled 1970 album is one of the all-time great debuts by any rock artist formerly in a notable band.  (I would rank it right alongside John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band, Dave Mason's Alone Together, and maybe even George Harrison's All Things Must Pass.)<br /><br />Most of the tracks from that album are here, a couple in different mixes (i.e. \\"To A Flame\\"), but one great track is missing: \\"Sit Yourself Down.\\"  (It would've been cool also if the live band performance of \\"Black Queen\\" from Supershow, with Jack Bruce and Buddy Miles, had been put on Disc 2.)<br /><br />Manassas, yet another excellent Stills musical phase, is alsorepresented on Disc 2.  But the credits are incomplete.  Stills is credited with having played vibraphone on \\"It Doesn't Matter,\\" when in fact it was Buzzy Linhart who played the vibes on that track.  (Buzzy himself told me, and I believe him.)  Buzzy's name was left off of the original LP credits, \\"for contractual reasons\\" (he was signed to Buddah Records), but that was more than 40 years ago.  Now, \\"it doesn't matter,\\" and Buzzy Linhart could have finally been given his proper credit in the box's booklet.  Too bad that he didn't get it.  (Dallas Taylor, of course, played on many of the tracks on Discs 1 and 2, and he is appropriately credited.)<br /><br />Speaking of that booklet, it's pretty darn great (except for the omissions), and one of the main reasons you ought to get the physical box of CDs.  Nash and Bernstein both have their photos of Stills all throughout its pages, as does Nurit Wilde (the early days), and great ones by the photographer who has perhaps known Stills the longest and photographed him best and more often than anybody else: Henry \\"Tad\\" Diltz.  (Henry, it is recalled, is the man who took the album cover photos for the first CSN LP and the first Stephen Stills LP.)<br /><br />Another thing I like about the booklet is the essay, published therein, by Daniel J. Levitin.  Levitin is obviously a trained and schooled musician who knows Stills personally and knows his music thoroughly and intimately.  I was completely fascinated by what he wrote about the genius musical and recording techniques of Stephen Stills, despite the fact that (for the most part) I really had no idea what he was talking about(!)  I had never heard of \\"whole tone hammer ons,\\" but Levitin explains in minute detail how Stills has perfected the use of them.  Reading his essay was almost as good as listening one of the classic recordings of Stephen Stills.<br /><br />I will admit that Discs 1 and 2 are SO chock full of tremendous tracks that I'll be more likely to be going backto those two more often than I will be putting on Discs 3 and 4.  But as the box's second half proves, Stephen Stills never stopped creating outstanding music.  It is simply clear that, after a certain point, Stills grew to be less musically-prolific (although never less adventurous), and that after about 1982, let's say, he must have developed other interests outside of music.<br /><br />Having achieved major success in his field, Stills probably concluded that there was more to life than just music, and he slowed down for a number of years (re-emerging on occasion), for a long time maybe only picking up his guitar and playing it for sheer enjoyment, not for work.<br /><br />But when Stills was totally focused on music, in the Sixties and Seventies, HIS obsession was OUR enjoyment.  And that's why, ultimately, you will want this career-spanning compilation.  I am not dismissing Discs 3 and 4, by any means.  Again, the hardcore fan (as well as the merely curious) will find much to love on there as well.  \\"Treetop Flyer\\" is an incredible tune, the version here a different one from what was on Just Roll Tape, with some of his most amazing-ever guitar playing and singing.  The recent live take of \\"Girl From The North Country\\" with Crosby and Nash is a revelation.  \\"The Ballad Of Hollis Brown\\" is one of the best interpretations of a Dylan song there has ever been.  Decades after his early '70s peak, Stills continued (and continues) to be a highly-respected musician and singer.<br /><br />But, like a Hall Of Fame athlete or heavyweight champion, whose awesome physical prowess cannot last forever, Stephen Stills had his greatest years when he was in his 20s and 30s.  There's no shame in that.  Nonetheless, he's been able, from time to time, to \\"put up some impressive numbers\\" on the board during the later stages of his remarkable career, and this compilation bears that out.<br /><br />This box will be most enjoyed, I think, by Stills fans now approaching official retirement age who, for one reason or another, lost touch with the artist and his recordings after about 1974.  (And to put this music in its proper historical perspective, the perfect visual counterpart to this set is Harvey Kubernik's most excellent book, Canyon Of Dreams: The Magic And The Music Of Laurel Canyon, which has even more great photos of the young Stills.)<br /><br />As far as studio work, Stills had his greatest creative period while he was with Atco/Atlantic, from the first Buffalo Springfield album, on through the early years with CSN and CSNY (including the live 4-Way Street album, which is barely touched on here) and then into his first two solo albums, and the Manassas records.<br /><br />The reason for that may be because, back then, Stephen Stills was young, hungry and musically-inspired, as well as musically-gifted.  But it was also because he was (in the immortal words of Warren Zevon) \\"...riding the crest of classicism.\\"  In the late Sixties and early Seventies, there was a tidal wave of great music happening, and Stills had the skills and the tools to figure out (like few others could) how to get up above that wave, and ride it for all it was worth.<br /><br />But the tremendous musical output of Stephen Stills during the years 1966 to 1972 could also be owed to a couple of musical visionaries who are no longer with us: Ahmet Ertegun and Arif Mardin of Atlantic Records.  These men knew how to get the very best out of talented musicians and songwriters.  They were so good, they could turn average artists into great ones.  Stephen Stills was always above-average but he aspired to become great and, with their guidance, he did.  But it didn't happen just by magic.  There was a lot of hard work involved.  This box set is dedicated in memory of only two people, and Ahmet Ertegun is one of them.<br /><br />I hope to find myself, someday again, standing next to Stephen Stills.  And this time, I will speak to him.  I'll ask him if he still has his Guess watch.  I know I've still got mine.

B001AGXEA6|5.0|Beetlejuice what a great and fun movie to watch by yourself or with friends and family. The Blu-ray has the same features as the DVD release other then menu layout is different and I think Blu-ray copy looks better then the DVD one. another nice feature of the Blu-ray copy or the one I got had a Soundtrack sampler CD with it which is a plus for me.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|The Dark Knight (No. 2) was a tough act to follow and The Dark Knight Rises (No. 3) only succeeds in finishing the trilogy in honorable -- but not spectacular -- fashion. Seems like a lot of vignettes -- with Catwoman, collapsing football field or Miranda (Ras Al Ghul's daughter) -- are just thrown in to help make sense of the interplay between Batman and Bane.<br /><br />Can't say its a bad movie (far from it) but keep your expectations moderately low if you still remember Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. That was wacko, this one is...nice.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love playing this game.  Keeps me stress free for a while.  Learn something new every time I play it.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|I loved this movie when it first came out at the Cinerama theater...for the racing, of course, and not for the love stories. Many decades later, I wanted to introduce my teenaged son to this GP, so I warned him of the distracting love stories. Well, they're still distracting but less so than I thought.<br /><br />GP still has great racing footage, even with today's miniature video cameras inconspicuously attached to helmets and other parts of cars. The split screen(s) are kind of retro-looking now, but still quite exciting. Turn your volume up and step into the past.

B0000DIXDR|3.0|Without the dancing this would be a very tiresome movie. There is nothing original or new about the story or the acting. Although the inclusion of Jerry Orbach makes it hard to say that. Patrick Swaze was good but he mainly dances. Jenifer Grey learned a lot from her father,Joel Grey. but there is no real coming together of the characters. The dancing fills in between the story of Baby and the story of the Catskills vacation retreat. The dancing takes over the story and becomes the whole picture. It glows and shimmers and is carried up by the lighting and the romance. It is as though the two dancers are extracted from the mundane script and elevated above the flat story. Watch if you like dancing but it would wear thin if you want a good story. Definate &#34;chick flick&#34;.gotten from Amazon.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Having a sharp knife is sometimes a life or death issue when sailing off shore.  I've been sailing for decades and there have been times when having a sharp knife to cut a line, sever a plastic tie, or open a stubborn container has made the difference between a situation that could have become a tragedy and one that was just a minor problem.  Over the years I've had a number of stones or other tools for sharpening my blades that have worked well and sometimes not so well.  This little Smith Pocket Pal has done just fine at keeping the multitude of knifes I carry, either full time or keep on the boat stowed in strategic places, shark tooth sharp.  The diamond bar is great for putting a fine edge on serrated blades.  It is an easy tool to use and best of all it takes up very little space which is at a premium on my 37 foot Northern Ketch.

0812984412|5.0|I had seen the movie first, which I found visually stunning and emotionally intriguing.  While the movie intersected the stories very often, the novel has them build up one on each other, then back down.  Each story is very compelling, you want to read on.  A very good read.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I saw this on stage about 15 years ago, I loved it then and love it even more now.  The music, the action the emotion are all wonderful.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|GREAT FOR LITTLE KIDS. My son was a big fan of the game. He is only two and a half. My five year old daughter loved it, but finished it easily. I like games that they'll use over and over. So it's the best for a few days.
B002VPEAM6|1.0|I enjoyed most of the story. It was slow and at times, and even a bit depressing. The ending however was horrible. It was like the author was tired of the story and cut it short. There are many lose ends and it is definitely not worth the time. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time on the book. Soooo disappointing.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard Cohen is a personal favorite.  I ordered two CDs to send to friends so they could enjoy his poetry
0525953728|5.0|I purchased the book without bothering to read any reviews from individuals who had read and commented on the book prior to my purchase.  I found the book well worth reading for the following reasons.  First, it gave credit to all of the various SEAL teams by stating that any one of the teams could have conducted the raid to capture/kill UBL.  Second, the author also spread credit to a wide variety of other members of the military including Army Rangers, helicopter pilots, and others.  Finally, he gave insight into his own concerns, fears, shortcomings and wanting to always be value added to his team.  If there is a big ego somewhere within the author I did not get a sense of it from his story.<br /><br />It is especially appreciated that the last few pages of the book were dedicated to the acknowledgement of the SEALS whom have paid the ultimate price. The author also goes on to identify military charities people can support.  The authors descripiton of riding on the train an analogy for his career as a SEAL seemed to me to capture for an outsider a little of what it must be like to be a SEAL.  I highly recomment this book for those of us who appreciate what our military does to protect the United States.<br /><br />This is the third book I have read whose subject was entirely on Navy SEAL's.  Each of the books (Lone Survivor, American Sniper and No Easy Day) has a different story to tell but each had some similar themes, those themes were sacrifice, team work, love of country, and humility.  Each of these books is worth reading and redefines the word hero.  After reading these books I no longer tolerate the word hero when it is applied to an athlete.
B000FC12SM|5.0|As a man reading this book I was skeptical, but after reading it I understand my self and my out partner more.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|it was a cute movie, that i would recommend to little ones everywhere.  my friend's kid can recite quotes from this movie.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|Sawdust is a compilation album of rarities, b-sides, covers and remixes and two singles recorded between 2002-2007 by Vertigo and can be said to be an indie rock recording. The best tracks are Shadowplay and Tranquilize. Truly a great recording that I really liked listening to. Highly recommended. 5/5.
1476715904|4.0|Slammed is a moving story about loss and the acceptance of death, the only thing inevitable in life.<br /><br />Will and Layken form an instant connection when they meet, and it's hard to see them make the painful transition from potential lovers to just being friends when a cruel twist of fate forces them apart. It's rough on them both, seeing each other on a daily basis, and there's tension there for sure. However, despite all this, Will helps Layken in the best most selfless way he knows how when life deals her family yet another unexpected blow.<br /><br />It's touching to see the sacrifices made in the name of love, but heartbreaking too.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I also really loved the incorporation of Slam Poetry, as well as Eddie whom is such an amazing secondary character. I wanted to hug her on more than one occasion, and wish I'd had a friend like her growing up.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of YA books but this one is definitely worth reading, no matter what age you are. There's some valuable life lessons to be learned here; and, though death is a tough subject to tackle, this book will successfully make you smile, laugh, and maybe even cry.
B000GY729M|4.0|Sam's Town is the Killers second studio album and was released in by Island Records and is a mix of Indie rock, heartland rock, post-punk revival and new wave. Songs that stand out are Bones, When You Were Young and For Reasons Unknown. Whilst not as strong as their debut album Hot Fuss it is still a quite good sophomore effort. Recommended. 4/5.
B0086700CM|5.0|I couldn't get this game on my Windows 8 tablet; so I looked for it on my Kindle Fire.  It's distractingly fun.
B008RTE09S|5.0|I would recommend this to all Beatles fans.  Every time I watch it it gets better.  Amazing special features as well.  recommend not being of sound mind while enjoying Magical Mystery Tour.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its free and good.  Compared to other free games I have tried-subway surfers is superb.  It does take a bit to load for me and sometimes the adds freeze the game.  Overall the game is great and very addicting.
0062059963|4.0|I loved The Selection so much and just couldn't wait to dive into The Elite. It has such a beautiful love story and it's impossible not to root for Maxon and America. I was a little apprehensive, however, because Aspen was brought back into the story at the very end, and I was very much against that particular plot twist.<br /><br />After having read The Elite, I am happy to report that the Aspen story line wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The Elite sucks you in, just as The Selection did and it is impossible to put down! I absolutely devoured it and cheered for America and Maxon the pretty much the entire time.<br /><br />Reading The Elite was a wonderful experience, in part because I read The Prince first. The Prince is a novella told from Maxon's point of view, and while it isn't critical to the plot in anyway, it does provide crucial insight into Maxon's character. There are so many times that I wondered what Maxon was thinking, and The Prince gave me the understanding I needed to figure it out.<br /><br />My only gripe with The Elite is that it is very love triangle focused. The Selection was more of a complicated love story, and although there was a love triangle, it was more muted than in The Elite. The entire novel felt like a love triangle this time instead of a Maxon-America love story. I can't help wondering what this novel would have been like as a stand alone, since it feels like the love triangle overdose exists to draw the story out into a trilogy, when it certainty could have been wrapped up very nicely by adding another 50 pages to The Selection.<br /><br />We did learn more about Illea's history, how the United States came to an end, and why the caste system evolved. I'd love to say it was interesting, but I'm not really interested in the world-building since the love story is why I am reading The Elite. Readers will instantly draw parallels between our current political situation and leaders and the history of Illea, and I have to commend Kiera Cass for making a statement whether I agree with it or not (note: I'm not stating whether I do or don't agree, but it's nice to see political issues addressed in YA, subtle or not).<br /><br />The Elite still has that je ne sais quoi that makes it impossible to put down. Readers will absolutely devour it, and despite the love triangle being a bit over done, it is still a lovely story. Those who have been anxious for more world building will not be disappointed as Kiera Cass provides us with a healthy dose of history for Illea. At it's heart, The Elite is a twisted, tangled love story and I am so looking forward to the conclusion, which will hopefully end happily for both Maxon and America.iera Cass for making a statement whether I agree with it or not (note: I'm not stating whether I do or don't agree, but it's nice to see political issues addressed in YA, subtle or not).<br /><br />The Elite still has that je ne sais quoi that makes it impossible to put down.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I would have deducted a star from this rating because I was totally immersed in the mind of the main character experiencing her emotions and finding myself locked onto the screen, but then I realized that only truly gifted authors can weave such a beautiful journey with only a pen and paper for a spindle and imagination for thread. This book is why movies are NOTHING compared to their novels. I can't create a comment fit to commend the author. It just wouldn't do her justice.

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|It freezes, shuts down . Hopefully it gets fixed before I get tired of it. Then a lot more people will enjoy it too.
B005MMYT76|5.0|good movie, recommend it to young adults and teens. Actually ends up being a good life lesson movie. I like when the kid starts to stand up for himself after being bullied.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Someone said there wasn't much character development, that couldn't be further from the truth. It has great characters, but obviously focuses on one. Hope there's more to come!

B0006Q0XDW|5.0|This album does everything a punk rock album should do: Violently discuss politics, quick jab authority, and ask the same time how educated are they and how much drugs do they have in their system? The Clash were at the height of their powers with this 70 minute roller coaster. I don't want it to ever stop.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is fun and engaging. I get bored very easily, but I love horses, so this game is good for me. There's always something to do. Thanks for the good game. :-)
B000007UTN|5.0|Of all time. It is hard to deny the greatness of this album and the sheer skill level of Radiohead. It's haunting and thought provoking like the band has always been.

B0031Y4ALC|5.0|Swimming the Same Deep Water As You, Lovesong, Fascination Street do you need more reasons to purchase this vinyl? How about the legend and majesty surrounding this album? Or that The Cure are one of the greatest bands of all-time? Just ty it, it is so wonderful.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|A fun and addictive game. I like the extras:collection items, treasure chests, coins...New rooms more frequently than other games I've played.
B002PHVHFI|5.0|Hard to find, difficult to create, beautiful to discover. I love this album and it will adorn my wall until the day I die.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|The movie is good. You really have to pay attention to follow it.  The acting is superb and I enjoyed it.  It is a little hard to follow but a really good story.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had heard so much about Downton Abbey and missed it when it first aired on PBS.  After seeing Seasons 1 and 2, I had no idea what I was missing.  I knew it was going to be good, but it is so much more.  The story, the acting, the attention to detail, everything about the show is terrific.  I can't wait to purchase Season 3 and begin watching.  And I'll be waiting with anticipation for Season 4 to begin.  I can find no words to express how wonderful this show is.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Blu-ray is great. Excellent movie for kids, real gem from the 80s.  Commentary is especially good.  One of my favorites!

0880796863|1.0|I bought this deck for my husband, who is learning Tarot. I am very disappointed in the quality of it. It appears to be a reproduction of a reproduction. The lines are not as neat and detailed. Some cards have details that appear to be missing (the 5 of Pentacles - the first mans arms are missing or obscured by the poor quality). Almost every card appears pixilated. I could go on with the list of problems but I think I will stop there. The only pros to this deck are the heavy card stock and the mini book that comes with it.<br /><br />I will be uploading pictures of these cards (via Photo bucket since Amazon doesn't allow uploads on this item) compared side by side with my Waite/Smith deck so you can see what I am talking about.<br />[...]<br />[...]

B00B2TTVNU|3.0|I come to this review as a professional pianist of over 30 years.I was classically trained and although my technique was not big enough for these concerti,I KNEW how I wanted to hear them performed.Not that there is anything wrong with these performances, but here goes. I found it interesting in her CD bio that she\\"hated Rachmaninoff\\" due to generations of fairly standard Russian interpretations.Yet these are indeed a fairly Russian standard approach.Lisitsa obviously is immensly talented and is surely up to all the technical challenges of these pieces.And her performances on occasion do take fire,but not for me,that often.This is my problem.First...her sustain pedaling to me is troublesome.I noticed it particularly in the big cadenza of the first movement and in the slower interior movements of the other concerti where her holding down the pedal and not letting up causes a mish-mash of notes.She talks about going back to the composers original recordings yet I dont hear that.The finale of the second is much, much slower than the composers.I think the other problem is the fact that her first choice conductor was unavailable and Michael Francis was appointed.I admit I have never heard of him.He merely accompanies.Where the great finales should be as exciting in the orchestra as they are for the piano,they are not. I know I will be in the minority wiht my opinion.These are very good performances.But a good back story and glossy pictures of this attractive pianist in flowing gowns dont make them my first choice.That will be the Steven Hough live performances on Hyperion.There you will hear the composers original intentions and a pianist,conductor and orchestra who approach these concerti with freshness, and edge of your seat music making.Sorry...but thats how I feel.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This lastest CD from Blake Shelton is Country at its best from &#34;Boys 'Round Here&#34; all the way through to &#34;Granddaddy's Gun&#34;.  It is a must by for any Blake Shelton fan or for that matter every fan of Country Music!

B00BESCJII|5.0|Has a little of everything!  It's one of those movies that feels like an IFC gem. With good music in the right places.  The right amount of fun and drama.  The kind of music you love: trip-hop, mello-Matrix, alt, and not a lot of historic/dated rock.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|This is a very good movie about surfing the big wave.  Entertaining from beginning to end.  One of this years best!

0062059963|4.0|I enjoyed reading the Elite:) A good sequel to the Selection. However, I do see why some of the fans were disappointed in this book. Nothing super excited happened, but I still suggest fans to check it out and continue to read the series. There are a few surprises here and there both good and bad. America still continues to be torn between Maxon and Aspen. Kiera does explain a little bit more about Illea's history:), but I believe she should have explained it in book one. Another reason I gave this book four stars is that she still has yet to explain why the rebels attack the way they do which she should have done in book 1. And yes, the story continues to show that the ending will be predictable, but I am still going to read the series until the end:) The cover art continues to be gorgeous even more than book 1. Absolutely love the red:) Looking forward to reading The One:) Just wish we didn't have to wait a year:( Hopefully the television show will get picked up:) I hear they are going to make the series a little darker, which I like, and the characters will be older than in the book. I hear they are also changing Maxon's personality a bit and he actually looks forward to the Selection.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|I haven't worn a watch for a few years (retired), but I always liked the idea of an automatic.<br />Now I can fire a bunch of rounds with a single pull of the trigger, and... Wait... Wrong kind of automatic.<br /><br />So anyway, it's a good looking watch I've had for about a week, & so far, so good.<br />It's been keeping perfect time for the week, maybe a couple seconds off, but close enough for retirement work.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because, well, time will tell (see what I did there?).  I crack myself up.<br /><br />I'll revisit the review after a few months & possibly update the 'star' rating.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|It is not family-friendly.<br />His movies: one either loves them or hates them, there is no in-between. This is a well-established fact.<br />Professional critics that do not like his movies and have to go watch them because they are paid to do it must hate every single second. Their reviews show that. Critics on the other side of the street, so to speak, who love them to bits, cannot praise them enough. Let's, therefore, ignore the critics and watch the movie. Unless one has seen one or two of Tarantino's before, and is on the hate-them side. Then, better stay home and play canasta, poker, or do whatever else the heart might fancy at the time.<br />That said, in my opinion, this is the best Tarantino movie ever - except for all the rest.<br />\\"Django\\" does not deserve those prizes it got. It deserves more, but The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for example, has nothing better to give than the Oscar, so it gave it two.<br />It's got all those things someone who cannot stomach Tarantino's creations will say it does not have, or has too much of: real dialog, not grunts and yells punctuated with hysterical laughter. It is slow where that is the right pacing, and it goes fast exactly where it should. There is precision here, nothing wasted. There is violence too: it out-wilds the \\"Wild Bunch\\", for sure.<br />Much has been said about the ever present violence in Tarantino's work, so I'll try to explain my own take on it: With its rivers of blood and stacks of corpses, with all the violent deaths that made those corpses, it is in some very fine company going back to farthest antiquity: all those ancient sagas and epic poems, with their lavish descriptions of fights between bigger than life antagonists: how lungs were pierced, eyes gouged, bones cracked, heads smashed, necks snapped, until one or the other finally bit the dust \\"and his soul fled, raging and howling, to the shadows\\" (as Virgil liked to put it.)<br />It lasts exactly as much as it should. Theactors give their all to their roles. Tarantino has a certain kind of genius for getting the very best of actors and crew. And a very fine cast and crew they are. If you want to see beautiful acting, splendid photography, and listen to clever repartee, this movie's got all that in spades.<br />If you are looking for an accurate portrait of the Antebellum South, or of the horrors of slavery, look elsewhere. The movie has some serious points to make about these, but it does so through theatrical exaggeration with touches of Grand Guignol.<br />This is a fantasy: a fanciful crossover of historical drama with Spaghetti Western (or, rather, a \\"Southern\\", as the director has described it). Tarantino, years ago, said that he thought Sergio de Leone's \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" was the best action movie ever filmed. I do not know if he still sees it that way, but he is showing in \\"Django\\" a deep respect and love for that old genre: here he has taken much from it, and he has used it right. But it is very much his own movie, and of the actors and crew, as it should be.

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I have become a fan of Lindsey from the first song that i heard of her. Being a metal fan and love to play games, i found her music easily on youtube, and i started following her channel. This album consists of completely original tracks and is a gem of an album. All the tracks have their own story to tell and the music speaks of it self. Truely, her violin is more powerful than words and lyrics in her songs.<br />The music spans from different genre and variety, though all of them are very catchy and beautiful. It transcends the time barrier and appeals to music listeners of all ages, something which is extremely rare to find.<br />I would say its a must buy for all true music lovers. There just cannot be anyone who will not fall in lover with her tracks.
B009AMANBA|5.0|It was wonderful, the acting was suburb!  Daniel Day-Lewis did a wonderful job, as did Sally Field.  I will watach it again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My daughter's review: Temple Run 2 is absolutely cool, except it's kind of hard. After you run for a while it just makes a hole where there's no path  on the other side. When you fall, it says \\"save me\\",and it says you need a lot of gems for saving. Still, it has different backgrounds and more obstacles. There also is a giant monkey chaser thing instead of three small ones. Overall,Temple Run 2 is pretty okay.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|There is a great space for a dslr, but not for a second dslr.  The larger of my two a D7000 fits very nicely into the bottom of the case.  All around and above are small sections great for lenses and other gear.  There are more compartments on the inside of the cover and on the outside of the cover.  I did not feel comfortable wedging my second dslr a D40 (quite a bit smaller than the D7000) into one of the small compartments.  The description says room for two cameras.  I would only feel comfortable if that were a smaller point and shoot.  The pack is well constructed and lots of room for all types of gear.

B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Works good.  Mounted in the basement.  When I am leaving my cave at night there is a hall I had to navigate in the dark.  Gives me light until I can get to a light switch.  Twenty words, really?
B004Q3SGWG|4.0|This movie grabs your attention fairly early on and then it gives you reason to keep watching. A good movie in my book.
B00797MB0O|3.0|I thought the love scene was sweet especially when she stayed for breakfast and talk to the sister. The Bourbon Steel was cool.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|this dvds are all defected. they didn't play at at any HD playback unit. i even try it at windows 7 computer and blu ray player, but im really dissapointed. if theres a possible way i could bring it back even i purchased it long time ago to prove my rating on this DVDs......
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I wanted an app that would allow me to find my Kindle files.  This does what it is supposed to do.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Quite a fun game.  I recommend it for all those who are fans of card based combat games.  Excellent graphics and game play.
B004UPANGM|2.0|Even as a 'b' horror, it was quite bad.  maybe they were just trying to be campy, but then they would at least try humor.  Big miss.
B008VBYN80|4.0|the game freezes a lot. plus you cant add your friends from facebook. I know its a free game and it may have a few bugs but freezing after one action is a little much. I do enjoy the graphics after playing RPG on the computer this one reminds me of the old Sega. Genesis classics. hope I'm not showing my age with that statement.
B000SW16M6|5.0|I loved it when it first came out in the 1980's and saw it again last year. It's still delightful, funny and relevant. As a resident of Chicago's North Shore, I can see that very little has changed!
B00AO686L0|5.0|Michael Mann's masterpiece finally on blu-ray, the cuality is amazing, but disc lacks of more extras.<br />Highly recomend this movie.
