B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Deb Harkness has created a fantasy world that I could only wish to come to life...her characters are stunning, her story tight and fast paced....and I found that she is personnally a lovely lady, she answered a note I sent to her in a very gracious, pleasant note back to me.....Love the series and know you will too!
B000001Y7A|5.0|This product was great... I love all my vinyls but this one just made my collection... I would recommend this to everyone that loves No Doubt...
1597801585|3.0|I enjoyed the book but I was not blown away. I don't think it deserves either of those coveted award.  If you enjoy this genre of post meltdown gene hacking sci fi check out WIlliam Rosencrans' The epiphanist. It is a much better book.
B009XY97VC|5.0|This album was great; especially, an acoustic orchestra breaking into a section of dub step in the midst of the first or second track. I would like to point out that Amazon needs more genres to pick from because classical is not exactly what this album is. This is a multi-genre acoustic orchestra album with many talented musicians.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Love this movie! Inspiring and exciting, a terrific movie for the whole family, although the war scenes might be too hard for little ones.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Ever since I purchased my first Courtney Milan book (Unlocked) I have been entranced, enchanted and enthralled by her characters and their stories. I have read every book, short story, and novella available in print and for my kindle (except for one Ms. Milan asked that we not buy because she felt it was inferior) that she has written.  This book is no exception to a delightful collection that is already available.  Other reviewers have written beautiful synopsis's about the book, so I will not waste your time with that here.  I do encourage you to read this book at your first available opportunity. I savored this book from the first page to the last page. In fact, after I finished my copy on my kindle, my husband said \\"What is so funny? Why are you smiling?\\"  This book (and it's ending!) is so good I had no idea I was grinning like that!

B00493E1GI|5.0|This a great movie for anyone, it inspires, motivates. Julia Roberts is one of my favorite actress' I don't like everything she has been in, but this one is great!
0446567337|5.0|Wanted the paperback version of this book and could not find it in stores anywhere! Found it online and for a great price!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have seen this book while browsing many times lately. I was turned off at first because of the price (12.99 for a kindle edition!!!), but I thought I would give it a try since it seems to be so popular. The book was really good..... until the end. I am a divorced male and this book actually struck some chords with me throughout most of it, but the ending just did not fit with what I think anyone in that position would have done, so I guess I would say it was just too unbelievable in my personal opinion. That being said I would recommend people read it, because regardless of what I thought of the ending, the rest of the book was fantastic. This was my first novel by the author, and I did like it enough that I will be reading Dark Places next. 3.5 stars
B009LROCJI|5.0|Absolutely beautiful music wonderfully performed - can't stop listening to it. An old favorite redone masterfully.  Heard it on the radio and downloaded it in a few short minutes - Amazon makes it so easy.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|fantastic once again, I really love the story as I do with them all, and the ending leaves it open for another. I cannot wait for the movies to come out to bring the stories alive, even if the characteristics of Jack are, shall we say, shortened by the actor I think the story lines will hold their own. Fingers crossed
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|I'm a fan of the show and I've loved all the songs, but I was patiently awaiting for the whole album to be released (instead of purchasing songs individually).<br /><br />This album is a surprise - it even included the song that the 2 daughters performed at their school talent show (Telescope, not the radio mix), which is one of my faves!  That alone is worth the price of the album for me.<br /><br />Can't wait for Volume 2.  Even if you've never watched the show, you will still enjoy the eclectic variety of music.  This album does not disappoint.  Enjoy!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I wish this book was longer. Or that there was sequels or something. But I can't hold it against the book. I loved it and would recommend anyone who enjoys Brandon's work to give it a read :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love this game. Can't draw worth beans but am getting better. Great way to spend your free time.Can become addictive!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Great CD...love Kelly Clarkson and I have many of her but it is nice to have her songs on one CD
B00138EV8U|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie? I watch it everytime it comes on TV and now on my Kindle. Some movies just remain classics!
B0013HA838|5.0|What a GORGEOUS production!  Miah Persson is a wonderful Mozartian and Erwin Schrott makes a very dashing and fiery Figaro.  Gerald Finley is probably the most intelligent and polished Almaviva I have ever seen.  Add in the rest of the cast, with their impeccable singing, the very well-informed stage direction (sorry I can't remember the director's name off the top of my head), and Pappano's great instincts with singers and this turns out to be a very rewarding experience.  There are certainly other ways to do Mozart well, but this is probably one of the great recordings of a production in existence.  I would have loved to have been there to see it live!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This is a fun game . What you do is you complete quests, take care of pets, and keep upgrading your town. Over all it is pretty fun.<br />But the problem is that, some stuff isn't free :(  They have this points that you have to buy, they barely have them for goals and a most of the stuff you have to buy with those points.<br />I'm not saying its awful, I'm just saying it could be better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We don't have cable and my sister got hooked on this show and was telling us about how great it is.  For our wedding anniversary, she's gotten us Season One and then the next year, Season Two.  We watched episode after episode and within a few days had finished them all, but wanted more.  We knew Season Three was about to start, but as I said, we don't have cable.  Someone mentioned trying to watch it on-line; yeah you can, but it's just blurbs.  I went on the AMC website and found out about purchasing the show through Amazon instant video.  We were THRILLED !!!  Again, we got caught up-to-date on the show and it just leaves us wanting more !!!  Sadly, it's breaktime right now for the show, but we'll be tuned right back in when the show comes back in February.  THANK YOU AMAZON !!!  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you !!!  We couldn't have waited another year to see this show !!!  And, as stated, each episode was ready for us to watch the next day after it'd aired on tv;  We would highly suggest using/joining Amazon instant video - it's just GREAT !!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Tried other cables that fit the micro usb slot, but wouldn't work for some reason.  It seems kindle micro usb connection is a little bit finicky.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|Giving it three stars because the video recorder keeps crashing. Very annoying. Please fix it. Other than that, I love the camera itself.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|WASN'T SURE I WOULD LIKE IT BUT I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED. I HAVE SINCE BOUGHT IT AND HAVE WATCHED IT 3 TIMES!
0955153077|5.0|I was skeptical at first when ordering, but based on the other reviews i wanted to give it a try and i am glad i did. it's one of those books i can sit down read and experiment techniques that other artists use and enjoy all the great art inside as well. I would say though this is more of an advanced beginners book though, so if you have never painted/shaded and looking for a in depth how to on those this isn't it; this is for the beginner that is just past that stage and trying to improve from the basics.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Antifragile takes everything from Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan and just runs with it. This book really brings the high-level ideas from the other books and applies them to every day life. This book will not only open your mind but should have practical applications for every individual. This is a must read
B007THA4FI|3.0|Well I had great expectations for this book. I haven't read the whole thing but it's slow to start so I'm not tempted to keep reading. Well, that's my opinion.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|.................a Spielberg Classic.......ranks up with Schinlers List,  and Saving Private Ryan....................Should win the Oscar.......a must see.............<br /><br />.................This has been an exceptional year for Academy Award nominees....................
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app took a traditional game and transformed it into a version that is not only customizable, but a wonderful way to pass the time. love this app and would recommend to anyone.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This novel is good but can't compare, in my opinion, to &#34;Unbroken&#34; that depicts like sufferings.  The writing is good but in the end the story gets tedious.
B005ZMTYTQ|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. It had some story line, with decent acting, action, romance, and sci-fiction flavor all rolled into 110 minutes of entertainment.  I am looking forward to a sequel.
1449410243|4.0|I purchased two copies of this book. One for home and one for work. Its a good collection off the website with lots of new ones added.<br />If you like Simon's Cat you'll also enjoy this.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Great series and we enjoy it immensely. Looking forward to the next in the series becoming available. I am certain it will be a pre order.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|For ALL Us Older People.. It Is A Great Movie But I Don't Think Youngins Would Understand It<br />Good Laughs too
0547995660|4.0|The Giver documents a boy coming of the age where he will be told what he will do with his life. The leaders of this world watch the children as they grow, and decide for them what their lives will be. Personality traits still exist, levels of intelligence still exist, but things that are common to us--like colors, pain, and independence--do not. Sameness is the goal of the community, and everyone is treated the same, if you're too different, you might get `released'. Jonas is burdened with the career of Receiver of Memory. With new understanding of the world, Jonas has to decide whether to accept the disguised brutality of the community around him or to try to make a difference with his knowledge, though its might get himself `released'.<br /><br />The story is very moving, you really feel sorry for both Jonas and The Giver. It's also very addicting, and I had a hard time putting it down. I would recommend for preteens or teens around the 7th-9th grade area.
B00005S6K8|5.0|&#34;My wife has been looking for this movie for a long time, and even though this gift is not for her.....because she bought this for her best friend's Christmas gift, we know where to look when she decides to get it for herself!!&#34;<br /><br />&#34;As she says.............Amazon shopping is a lot easier that having to go look in a store for something!!!&#34;<br />&#34;All you need to do is grab a good cup of coffee, click on Amazon.................and go crazy!!!&#34;<br /><br />:)
B004FEFS5E|4.0|I just finished reading the book. It is very insightful and easy to read for beginners like me. I wish it explained the concepts based on compact cameras too and not just on DSLRs (that is why I am giving it 4 starts) eventhough that could make the book harder to read. Anyways, once you read it, you feel like upgrading to a DSLR and starting to practice. I would recommend this book to photography beginners who want to understand a little more about how photography works or who want to go a step beyond the automatic modes, to start creating more elaborate photos.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I look forward to everyone of his books!,  probably my favorite author...just got my 15 year old son turned on to his series.  Enjoy it....
B009IJJ5B4|2.0|video control window frame wouldn't close.<br />Quality was great. Everything was great. Were it not for this user-interface flaw, I'd give it five stars.<br /><br />Love Amazon! Sorry. Thanks,<br />-Al Porter
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I read this 3 books ago so I don't have a great recollection it , other than I enjoyed it!
B0094JX07I|5.0|Wow - how can they keep doing this?  BT3 was my 'best of the year' when it came out, and now can this really be better?  Track after Track, it just keeps getting better.  Songs aren't as morose, perhaps, as BT3 (can anything be as sad as &#34;White Sparrows&#34;?) but then again, I still have to listen to it a few hundred times more.  These guys are amazing!  If you are new to Billy Talent, get this one - if you like great rhythms and incredible lyrics, this is the place.  Amazing!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie has a good story line; great dialog and acting.  All around very enjoyable!  I recommend this movie to anyone over 40.  Younger viewers might not get it.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This was delivered very fast. The movie picture is clear. Wonder classic Christmas movie of all time.  Love this movie.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I was disappointed in this game as it had to goal of any kind, nothing at the end to look forward to such as badge or prize of some kind. I probably wont play it again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Reminds me very much of MegaCal that I used on my Palm TX.  Except MegaCal cost $14.95 and it had a TAX+ function.  This is a nice looking app and the price is right.
B000TGCR38|4.0|Appears to be in more than fine shape, for a used item. Hopefully it plays properly as well. What more can be said?
B000F1IQN2|4.0|In 1972, palestinian terrorists kidnapped and murdered 11 Israeli olympic athletes.  Over the next few months, \\"unofficial\\" Israeli agents track down and blow up several of those responsible.  This movie never condemns nor excuses Israel's retaliation or collateral damage.  But there is an event near the end which changes the nature of the lead agent's motives.  It's refreshingly free of Spielberg's usual sentimentality.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|and I'm very hard to please when it comes to demented-ness.  Season 2 is perfection & a big (awesome) jump from season 1.  I love seeing the dark side of the human psyche...good job, writers!  Looking forward to more!
B0085A9J18|4.0|Plot and characters could have used a little more polish, but an all around good film. The thing that works best here are the fights. Damn are these some good ones.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Proof of Heaven is a wonderful true story, well documented and easily believed, that Eben Alexander III, MD had a legimitate NDE event (or numerous ones), and that his life was greatly impacted by these events where he met 'his Creator' during a coma brought on by bacterial meningitis.  Easily believable by me, credibly documented by author.  There was way too much medical information, statistics, and minutiae incorporated into the body of the book which was very distracting to me.  But as a practicing neurosurgeon at the time of his coma, he may have incorporated this as 'validation' to his fellow colleagues. The fact that he lived through this experienced is very unusual, as mentioned in the book.  The fact that he was able to recall his experiences in such imagry and descriptive eloquence is a credit to his 'mental recall' and determination, and the 'gift' of all this is that is that finally, now, he could relate to those documentated cases of NDE's in medical journals that he had previously written off as unbelievable, made up, or fabricated.
B00633W614|5.0|Excellent read with great character development, and easy flowing language. If you are an Archer fan, you will enjoy the Clifton Chronicles.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Wonderful book that makes you think about how you spend your time and what you spend it on.  Great Buy!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I saw this musical many times at ny. it is great watching again at home. best one and I like it
B009H5IVEG|5.0|The Kindle version is a bit different from the printed version, but it is a good trade if I consider that the book is always with me, and the difference is minimal and it's still the same great message.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book was wonderful. It has a great story that really causes you to thnk. It was well-written and is a very quick read because of how good it is. I highly recommend!
B00005V9HA|5.0|This is a Christmas present for my boyfriend who claims this is his favorite horror movie. I know he'll appreciate that it's also a collector's item! I'm very pleased with how quickly I received it and its condition is exactly as described.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This book is simpoly fantastic! It's a romantic, easy read that has a great plot. I am looking forward to the day when the third book comes out!
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I selected this movie because I love the actresses and thought I would get to see more of India.  It was only okay.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The NIght Circus is a great read. I love the story and the writing was pretty good. The movie rights have already been bought so if you want to be a head of the game- read this book!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I am addicted. Can't wait for season 2.  It is a great story and great acting. A bit unnerving and too believable to ignore.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Loved the interesting plot, not your same ol' - same ol'.  I would have given it 5 stars but it wasn't long enough.  I wanted more!  Great if you want a quick read.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Gorgeous album, every song is just flawless. A true orignal artist and sound, I can't wait for the next album.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie is non-stop laughing. The cast is great and the jokes are great. Makes me wish I had a real life teddy bear.
B005LAIGWS|4.0|Such a great movie. I really enjoy. My favorite actor is Nicolas Gates.<br />All the movies from him are great..
B002RVCD6O|5.0|This Harry Potter movie is one of the best and most entertaining. This a must watch for anyone. 10/10 stars
0545128285|5.0|I love everything about Harry Potter.  I am pretty obsessed, so I think this is a great collection item.  Some people complain about the stories being boring or not up to J.K. Rowlings par, but I think they are fine.  I wasn't looking for her to tell the stories just like she told the story of Harry Potter, so I was not disappointed.  The quality of the book is fabulous!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I was anxiously awaiting to see whether he could out do himself with his follow up album and he sure did deliver!!! Just as in \\"Doo-Wops and Hooligans\\", there is a blending of different styles (reggae, smooth 80s, etc)  and influences. You wouldn't think some of it goes together but he manages to pull it off!! I love the whole thing.<br />If you're looking for something different and authentic, give this a listen.<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]
B007N9FKCY|4.0|This is a fun game. Reminiscent of some classic side-scrollers from my childhood. I know there's some talk of whether this game is racist.  Definitely a dood free download. If you can just disregaurd the title, it's a fun and challenging game. But for real, Bean's quest? A little Mexican jumping bean with a sombrero? I don't even think it was intended to be racist, it's just a little Mexican jumping bean named Emilio. Could have put a bit more thought into the name IMHO.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read it in less than 8 hours. I couldn't put it down waiting for<br />What was on the next page.  I can't wait to read the third book.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|This series became more romantic as it progressed.  The slight eroticism lessened as it progressed.  Still a good read.  I enjoyed it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|great further development of the characters ! Love the endless imagination shown by the writers! Beautiful actor choices too! Thumbs up!
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Became more romantic as it progressed.  This was not a bad thing, unless you were looking for other than romance.  I enjoyed it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play it at night while I'm awake feeding my baby. it's a fun way to pass the time and keep me awake.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Five stars!  Great read to the end.  The plot kept things going fast and interesting.  Good to have old characters back.
B009GIPDQS|2.0|This is certainly not one of Grisham's best and he knows it as he tacitly admits to in the notes at the end. It starts off well enough to engage interest and sort of keeps just enough of  it but just never gets there.  You never get the feeling of involvement in the  book, characters or the plot but just a feeling of hanging in there and hovering around merely out of respect of the author, Because it is Grisham you have faith something will come but nothing ever does and sadly but inevitably you have to read it all the way to the end to confirm this.<br />There is hardly any suspense or thrill. It really is quite predictable.I got quite annoyed with the endless and totally pointless descriptions of the search for and initial interactions with Nathan Cooley. Those acres and acres of pages were utterly boring and painful to say the least. The only slightly interesting twist/sting is the alliance with the guy who he caused to be arrested. His name has slipped my mind because the characters are not that memorable.<br />Most importantly is that  the author gives a very implausible account of being a black man. He does not in the least come out convincilgy like a black man that I wonder why he even bothered. It could still have worked just as well if he had remained white. Grisham just does not know how to be a black man.In fact at no point at all can he ever be imagined and comprehended like a black man except when he reminds you as he constantly does that you are forced to rememebr that you are reading about a black guy. Really? Quite pathetic.<br /><br />We expect so much more from Mr Grisham.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Almost unusable. Most features are broken. Same app on iphone works much better and has deeper 'working' functionality. I probably will uninstall and use the browser instead.
B000YDAYHC|5.0|You won't go wrong with this, the boots look amazing. My hubby really likes it, its comfy, tough and stylish!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|You can't beat the book when it comes to character development.  I've read the series and I am beginning to enjoy books designed for &#34;young adults&#34; because they do deal with social issues and character growth.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Very good book it is so true you can't measure the time, every thing in life happens when is time to happen .
B0076DCT2G|5.0|another thrill a minute ride by demille. a real page turner will keep you glued to the non stop action.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved it,<br />I missed a couple of  episodes, was able to catch up with Amazon.<br />I always will check with Amazon first.<br />Thanks
B007SGLZP8|5.0|another hit from grisham.... great story  one of those cant put down thrillers.... cant wait for his next novel- thanks John
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Bean's Quest is a well designed app with NIFTY 3D MENU that gives lots of Options including an EXIT Button that let's you exit cleanly and Completely (unlike many other recent apps).  Here is what I like:<br /><br />1) Nice combination of Retro Look with Vibrant HD GRAPHICS.<br />2) Music is Pleasantly SOOTHING and Sound effects are very good.<br />3) Gameplay is NOT TIMED making for more enjoyable leisurely playing with NO STRESS.<br />4) Controls work well on Xoom Tablet.  My skills could be better though (I am a little slow).<br />5) Awesome RESTART feature when Green Bean is killed... You get to restart at the LAST CHECKPOINT instead of having to start entire level all over again.  That adds to REPLAY VALUE of game for us Amateurs (ha-ha).<br />6) No Permissions or Annoyances of any kind so far.  This is very Rare Nowadays and NICE TO SEE.<br /><br />Overall, this game is a Pleasant Surprise with a Cute Theme (not racist).  It is good for all ages and is a SAFE App with no negatives that I can find.  If you like Keen or Mario style games, it is a WINNER!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is fun and has so many versions and levels that there is always something else to try.  Will probably be playing this game for years.  It's funny and silly but still makes you think and hone your skills.  Hubby plays it alot too.  We joke that they should call it &#34;Make Me Angry Birds&#34;  when we miss.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not what I expected, a little too much sex.  The premise of the book most likely appeals to most readers of romance, simple, yet sophisticated words are awkwardly thrown in that will throw off a lot of the less educated readers. I like that the writer follows through and brings back into play little bits that could easily be forgotten until mentioned. I did read all three, and felt the same with each.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This is the first rotating cover/stand I have had for a Kindle.  The big pro for this item is that it rotates, my favorite feature of the case is it rotates and did I mention the rotating feature of this case is terrific. Now the con of the case is that it is heavy compared to other cases I have.  For carrying it is fine but if you want to tote it around in a purse it really is too heavy. I find I use my Kindle in this case at home or if I am carrying it book style.  The swivel feature is a bit tight to rotate but it does not move at all once you turn it so this actually is a plus.  All in all I like this case and the black leather is nice and easy to keep clean. Recommended.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|This sharpner will rip alot of steel off your blade. If you respect your blade dont use it. If your looking for a sharpner to put in your survival bag its a good buy.
0525952926|3.0|Winter of the World.The book was cheaper in Costco Canada, but it was a good read. Ken Follett is a favourite author
0345803493|3.0|I READ FIFTY SHADES OF GREY, SO YOU MUST BY THE SECOND BOOK TO FIND OUT WHATS HAPPENING. ITS OKAY!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simple easy to use calculator. highly recommended for quick easy use. I use it for homework/ work/ and paying bills.
B007G8SET8|4.0|This dvd/cds combo was great. Performances were top notch and sound quality was excellent too. My only warning i give to others, is that although my dvd was not loose in the package, it came scratched right off the grip-plate! It only affected one song, 747(Strangers In The Night). But it was repeated on the cd, and still got to see a third of it. Seemed like too big a deal to return and go through that hassel. So my advice is play all discs ASAP...though chances are most true Saxon fans will anyway,right?
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The movie (as always) did not match the details of the book. Provocative subjects to get your kids to read and think
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I like this games, the colors are better then other bubbles game also the background is really good. The colors are sober, it doesn't irritates your eyes.<br /><br />UPDATE : 04/15/2013, I still plays this game a lot, but not that addictive any more. The game is smooth, and never hangs, sometimes the background goes black. There is no settings to change the background.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Yes this TV show is the best production story and acting I have ever seen.<br /><br />Side note love bying my shows off amazon.  Been off cable/sat for 2 years now and never looking back.  120/month min for sat/cable = 1440/year round up the $22 for a season of shows to $30 for easy math and to cover the HBO shows on amazon or if you want HD.<br /><br />You could buy 46.6 seasons of shows in one year!  And with Hulu and netflix you get a ton of great shows to watch (hulu has great BBC shows they have exclusivley).  But seriously are there even 20 shows a year worth watching that you cant get off netflix or hulu?  No so its money in your pocket.  Drop cable/sat and buy from amazon.. let the people who make these shows see its better to just let us give them money instead of us giving it to those gready cable and sat guys!<br /><br />Amazon thanks for getting this content and selling it for a reasonable price.  Yes great price if you think its too much you need to look at that $1400+ a year you spend for tons of crap channels.  And you never surf around watching nothing or stupid shows.<br /><br />Alacart is what I want and this is it!!!!! Go amazon!
B008OOYALE|2.0|The game is too slow and uses too much battery of my phone. Also the graphics is unimpressive, overall it didn't suits me, I played for just 15-20 min and then I uninstalled it.
0783226837|5.0|I enjoyed Kevin Bacon in this movie. I thought it was quite funny. I saw Tremors years ago and always wanted to own it. I think it a good classic horror movie.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This book is nothing short of. It stimulates new thought processes and really offers new perspective. Frankl uses powerful examples from his experiences but does not use this book detail the WWII horrors. He uses them as proof of will and explains the psychological side of those horrors he does share.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I liked the style the author chose to write the story.  In reading it, I thought the boy had emotional problems, but did not find the cause until the end.  I liked the characters that were his friends and their relationship to him.  It was a good story and incorporated many problems your people face.  I hated that the football player turned on his gay lover.  Submit

B000002AGN|5.0|In the years transitioning for the 1950's to the 60's,the American landscape was beginning to change. The civil rights movement began to gain more and more ascendancy, collage students began to examine the very nature of education itself and the beginnings of what would become the political movement of later end of the decade-such as the war in Vietnam. So what does this bit of history have to do with the Dave Brubeck Quartet? Following a visit to Turkey,Brubeck became fascinated by the idea of rondo's,a musical dance done in that country revolving around the musicians improvising in very non Western time signatures. When he got into the studio following this,his compositions had expanded themselves to include what he'd experienced very much in the spirit of Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie's concepts of an all world encompassing jazz. This time though,it wasn't so much about the melody and rhythm. It was the times in which they were played,hence the albums title. So Brubeck and Paul Desmond,Eugene Wright And Joe Morello get into the Columbia studios with Teo Macero to live out this adventure on record.<br /><br />  \\"Blue Rondo A La Turk\\" is one of the most sublime melodic adventures in jazz I've ever heard. The unconventional time signitures motivate the rhythmic patterns and the melodies,which sometimes sound like improvized classical opera until Paul comes on with his bluesy sax break. It's truly an amazing piece of music. \\"Take Five\\" is the other more popular number here. The unusual time aside,the structure of the song expands very much on the blues and again it's Paul Desmond who takes this to it's conclusion. Brubeck himself shines on the \\"Strange Meadow Lark\\",almost solo piano playing melodically out of time itself until the group joins in for what is essentially a 4/4 time piece. Still the melody is gorgeous anyway. \\"Three To Get Ready\\" and \\"Kathy's Waltz\\" are both essentially waltzes and benefit more from melodic expansion than any type of unique time or rhythmic sense. \\"Pick Up Sticks\\" ends the album on it's most straight ahead not,a very bluesy melody with Paul Desmond and Dave stepping out front together in as humanely close to perfect harmony as one could ask.<br /><br />  And none of those things are even the best part about this album. One of the reasons I feel that jazz is ignored more today than it ever was is because of it's reliance on improvising on the same themes the same kinds of ways. Modern day musicians such as Robert Glasper have often touted this point of view. And it has much truth to it. And it was very much true throughout the 1950's,in the years when be-bop began to slow to a crawl and branch off into all too many separate schools of jazz. Dave Brubeck was technically part of one such school known as West Coast cool jazz. On the other hand,by bringing in the inspiration of world musics played in different times than Western rhythms he was able to reinvent the harmonic language of jazz and create a whole new set of themes for others to improvise on for decades to come. That may have been a bit of a tangent,but it indirectly leads to my view on what the best part of this album is-the fact that this music is memorable,hummable and often even danceable in a manner that is intelligently stimulating at the same time. Intelligence and accessibility of art is something a lot more difficult to achieve than one might think. And to me anyway that is probably the most important achievement of this American jazz classic.rhythmic sense. \\"Pick Up Sticks\\" ends the album on it's most straight ahead not,a very bluesy melody with Paul Desmond and Dave stepping out front together in as humanely close to perfect harmony as one could ask.<br /><br />  And none of those things are even the best part about this album.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked this because it was written by a scientist and he's not predisposed to these ideas.  It's also an easy read, short chapters, fast.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the entire soundtrack.  Usually I buy loving at least 3 songs and maybe liking a few more but I found myself enjoying every song on this cd.  Great compilation.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Read reviews on-line & an article by Eben Alexander & decided to order. Have recommended it to my friends. Well done.
0525953728|5.0|This was an incredible book with real heros.  You just can't put the book down once you pick it up.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|its a nice game, I didn't give it a five star because you require gems for some content and gems require money. I guess they have to make $ somehow
B008Q09K2U|2.0|For the record I am a long-time De Mille fan, have read every book and actively welcome new books - particularly when John Corey is the lead.<br />The Lion sub series was marvellous and it juxtaposed Corey and Khalil narrative to keep the story moving.<br />Given the anti-terrorist genre of recent Corey/Mayfield novels I suppose I was expecting the same.<br />The novel commenced with a great expectation as the smarta#%^ first person narrative of Corey bubbled to the surface.<br />Unfortunately, the longer I read, the more it seemed DeMille struggled to keep this book moving at the intensity of his previous books. In Yemen it was quite pedestrian for much of the middle part of the book. There is a clue to this in the acknowledgment as DeMille obtusely refers to the need of support through his editors and proofreaders to stay focused and get an outcome ie finish the book Nelson!!<br />Perhaps I am being too one dimensional, perhaps it is clever writing to give the atmospherics of the waiting game when negotiating with psycho terrorists. The unfortunate thing is that you expect and know that DeMille will have a cracking confrontational finish to the book. Hence, the set up to the finale is long (though worth the wait - which is why I gave a 2 instead of single rating).<br />In summary, the book had a good opening, tremendous finish, though tedious mid-frame - it was veneer for me.
0545265355|5.0|Like everyone else, loved this series and can't wait for the next 2 movies to be released.  Nice to have all 3 books in one set.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Good movie, good special effects, what else can I say, the whole family loved the plot and the characters a lot.
0446541478|4.0|I work in the hi-tech sector in Israel and I can tell you that the book is very accurate. Unfortunately the example that they chose to open the book with (Better Place) is now in serious financial trouble and the CEO/founder has been fired.
B009B0L324|4.0|This is a good live album.  A good mix of old and new.  If you like AC/DC, you'll like this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was very interesting it had sad funny adventures in<br />The mocking Jay .  If you like drama you would like this book also the series

B009DH2PP4|4.0|I've just started homebrewing and this was one of the first books I bought.  You can get much of the content for free from the website, but I having all the information in one place.  My only criticism is that they didn't setup a TOC for the kindle and I wish it was searchable.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|don't buy it if I could I would give it no stars but I have to tell all of you not to buy it so please listen to me you may not believe me but please trust me!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|all of my siblings downloaded this application before I did and I like it more than they do. it had so many different games. it is bound to make someone happy.
B005LAII1C|1.0|When dumb movies offer you a chance to laugh and not take life seriously it is particularly crushing to have said movie suck at being even remotely entertaining.  Having purchased this steaming pile I can tell you that had I spent 1/22 of the cash at a redbox i'd still be angry i traded any of the precious moments of my life enduring one of the biggest let downs of 2012.  This is sure to win a razzy or two.<br /><br />Plus side, If you happen to teach any classes in film making, management, organizational skill building, acting, creative writing, editing or intro to art direction this film stands as an excellent example of any or all of these areas gone wrong.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game can keep you entertained for hours! Fun for all ages and its free! So everyone get it! Yay

B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am a HUGE DeMille fan, but I was a bit disappointed with &#34;The Panther&#34;.  I surely do not regret reading it, and found it enjoyable, but it did not seem to have the same captivating writing as say &#34;The Gold Coast&#34; or other great DeMille works.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|U have love this game but have a major gripe well two after playing for a month on my kindle fire hd the game glitches and would not go beyond the load screen I had  to remove from my device and reinstall guess what my 53rd level character went poof. So my suggestion don't put any money into this game because if u have to reinstall u just wasted your money<br />Wasn't for that I'd be glad to give it 5 stars
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It's fun for a while but I don't play it more that 10 or 20 minutes at a time.  Gameplay is fun, graphics are old school 2D which I like, but there just seems to be something lacking; there's no point, you're not trying to accomplish anything.  I would like it better if there were some kind of levels or an end goal.
1856697061|5.0|I found this book inspirational. Like other people have said maybe you can't wear this stuff but certainly it will make you think about what you can do as far as new shapes. Just play with it and create new forms!!!!
0307960471|4.0|Another fast paced, novel starring detective Harry Hole, Nesbo's trademark omnipotent super hero<br />Harry is returning to Norway fresh from Thailand as an ex cop willing to investigate criminal cases when he run into one where the suspect is someone too close to his affections<br />The story unfolds at a very fast pace, being the stage the underworld of drug trafficking in Oslo, and gets enriched with slang terms of the trade, lots of street language and subtle technical explanations about drugs<br />Though gripping and viciously compelling, the plot was twisted in excess and Harry's luck abused, he escapes time and again from the most life threatening situations with the help of Jo Nesbo's pen, Harry's life insurance, too nice to be true, it merges with fantasy, moving beyond the realm of crime fiction<br />With regard to characters, some of them are very well worked out, like Gusto, the devious seller and junkie, and also those involved in the old game of politics and corruption like Isabel Skoyen the femme fatale, others have one dimension and made to support the former.<br />It has a great ending, smashing the conventions, the most experienced readers would not dare to guess, and this make up for the above commented flaws, showing the author greatness<br />In my opinion, Nesbo is probably the best European crime fiction writer in terms of readers entertainment
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Very funny movie laugh my ass off can't wait for ted 2. Not for children it and adult comedy. Worth the look.
B001MSMULG|5.0|As travel becomes increasingly miserable treat yourself to a great read that will help you completely tune out the noise and hassle.  The book is a page turner.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|If somebody told me that from now on I could read historical romances written by only one author and no others, I think I would have to choose Courtney Milan.  Of course I would miss out on some great stuff by Sherry Thomas, Meredith Duran and a few others, but Milan's work just keeps getting better and better and I'm always looking forward to her next book.<br /><br />This new one is excellent.  The characters are so well written, so real, so flawed, so complex.  The story is so beautifully layered and rich in detail.  If you read Milan's novella [[ASIN:B007WIOP68 The Governess Affair (The Brothers Sinister)]], you're familiar with the horrendous duke who is the late father of the hero of this story and know the back story of his half-brother Oliver.  You don't have to have read that novella, however.  This book gets you pretty well up to date on everything.<br /><br />Hero Robert, the present Duke of Clermont, has lots of emotional baggage from his childhood, with an emotionally-cruel father and an indifferent mother, both intensely disliking each other, with Robert caught in the middle.  His childhood emotional scars color everything he does and feels as an adult.  He dedicates his time to making restitution for the cruelties his father and other members of the peerage have inflicted on those classes with no power.<br /><br />Heroine Minerva is a scarred survivor also, but she is scarred both internally and externally.  She has suffered both emotional and physical trauma in her childhood, which leaves her spending her life seeking invisibility and shunning crowds or any attention to herself. Learning Robert and Minerva's back stories and watching them interact and eventually help each other to heal is quite a moving reading experience.<br /><br />There's so much more to this story than your usual historical romance provides.  Milan has so much detail, so many small events, so many interesting characters, and it all works together to immerse the reader in a complex, multi-layered Victorian world.x, multi-layered Victorian world.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have read each book in the series, with this book continuing to keep me enthralled throughout.  Mr Flynn is not done with this series and keeps enough at the end to know that there will be more books coming...I can't wait.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|wonderful wholesome movie and a great family movie it makes you want to be a kid again<br />and I still believe....
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Another well written and excellent book by David Baldacci.  I always look forward to his work and this one was not a disappointment
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This story is full of surprises and I like how the different characters interact with each other and sometimes don't understand each others motives.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|they describe the product clearly and they got the package in the mail quickly also the price was very good
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|I was also disappointed that Fade into You was not on the cd as shown on the sticker. Why would they do that if the song wasn't on there Strange
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved this. Reminded me of Myst, even though Myst was harder. I had to use the hints for a couple but I think that was due to impatience. great game. Considering buying their other one, Grizzly Manor. I really enjoy these types of puzzle adventure games.
0470913029|5.0|This book has changed my life!  Dr. Cordain's message resonated with me, it's really a common sense approach to eating and living the life we were born to live.  I keep it on my bedside table for quick reviews when needed.  I am a personal trainer with clients that have also benefited from this message.  Weight loss is truly a side effect of feeling great from eating the right foods our bodies were evolved to consume.  Across the board, my clients' annual physicals with their doctors have resulted in lower blood pressure, lipids, LDL, weight loss and balanced blood sugar levels.  This book is my health bible.
B0086700CM|1.0|this game is so addicting and super fun and<br />this is pretty much all I play and I have it for almost every device I have
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Have not received it yet, but have seen this movie numerous times. I bought this copy for my grandson who fifst saw it at my house. I expect it to arrive in great condition as everything else i have ordered from Amazon
0547884591|5.0|First off, this is a beautiful book and would be a great addition even as a coffee table book. If you do decide to make it one, your family and friends will be awed.<br /><br />Great book for people genuinely wanting to learn how to cook. Learning meaning not having to rely on recipes, like how your mum use to do it remember?<br /><br />Awesome book for anyone interested in becoming a polymath. Mastering a skill which may have been scary before will suddenly become possible and manageable.<br /><br />Read the book, apply the principles and prepare for living in High-Def for the rest of your life.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|was a great pick up and came packed good. its a awesome show and definitely a great item to have
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Really, this movie get's back to the flow of Batman Begins. This is a great movie, with lots of action! The movie really brings out the human aspect of Batman, really he's just a man that cares about justice. This movie is a collectors items. Out of the whole Batman trilogy I like this one and Batman Begins the most. The violence was just too much in number two. However, fans can certainly get back in the mode for Batman with this movie because it has so much to offer from story line, to special effects, to action. Bottom line, this is a must see movie, with close to 3 hours of story line.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|a guy at the game store told us about this game,boy was he right!!! once u start u can not put it down, Great game!!!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I give this movie five stars based on the technology, the acting, and the creative re-make of this movie. No, it's not Arnold S., but it is certainly an action packed movie and deserving of a few more stars.  It really has some creative scenes and sci-fi action that enhances the previous movie. This movie is a collectors item and certainly worth the watch for those die hard Arnold fans.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is the second book in the series. Enjoyed it..Looking forward to the next book in this series,,Sylvia Day is a great writer
B007BVOEPI|2.0|Great ideas, great characters, wonderful setting, excellent<br />acting all leading to amazing disappointment at storyline.<br />I have no problem losing a main character if, IF it is worth<br />it.  Losing a main character gratuitously feels like I'm being<br />cheated by the author.  In this case the character you are<br />most invested in is so purblind as to be an outright idiot<br />in the end.  How he became the head of one of the seven<br />kingdoms is beyond the storytelling abilities presented here.<br /><br />Unless you are willing to suspend belief at the level of an<br />animated Disney movie, I would beware of starting this one.
1419702238|5.0|The love all things in Diary of a Wimpy Kid.  Would recommend this for your childre fairly easy to read.

B009CPEOC4|5.0|This movie was awesome! I love Katy Perry it's nice to see Amazon gets some what new movies. I do like that it's cheaper to watch a movie with amazon then on demand and netflix doesn't even have it yet.
B009C7JS14|5.0|I like this weather live, it is great for the day, hour, weather.  This one is easier than the other one I have.

B007N9FKCY|5.0|Addicting and really well-polished, every aspect of this game is enjoyable. The concept is original; the graphics are smooth and simple; the music is appropriately fiesta fun; and the interface is seemless.<br /><br />I'm going to keep and eye out for more games from this developer.<br /><br />Galaxy SIII
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I put several videos on my kindle fire, but there was no way to tell what the order was supposed to be. Luckily this little product does the job perfectly.<br /><br />I had a similar problem reading comics. The picture order would be off in the standard viewer but this little app helps keep them in order.<br /><br />Great stuff.
0307596885|5.0|Alice Munro is among the very best. I love her use of the language, her observations, and her honesty. Well done.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars will never let you down he has always putput out great music. Unorthodox juke box is amazing every song on the album will keep you feeling all of his emotions that he puts towards making an album, this is a classic.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is not what I expected from this book.  It puts women in a very submissive, and degrading situations.  Just today Barbara Walters had EL James on her show.  Barbara Walters also questioned why women would want to put themselves in this kind of situation.  Fantasy perhaps, just not my kind  of fantasy though.
B00164CM46|5.0|Love Guy Ritchie Films. Snatch is the best of them ALL! Too bad Brad Pitt didn't do more movies with him.

B004CQ5GMU|5.0|Compact, well made, good speed. Does what it says, is the size it says. Transcend has always given me good drives at a good price. Never had an issue and none of that specialized partition with cd software that some drives come with.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|This product is simple and effective.  I am not familiar with the software yet so it is quite difficult.  It seems to be a more advanced music recording program.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|The book really worth your reading. In China, lots of young persons are inspired by the book and dedicated to be a maker.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|I really enjoy the movie A Good Year with Russell Crowe, especially the musical accompany the movie. This a really great movie. I first saw it on HBO.

B004AQR29C|4.0|Plenty of action with realistic plot. Lovable characters. Should have been based in the middle east instead of South America.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|love it. itsssssessssssss a amazing.<br />love editing my pic and then I can show them off to the world at the same time. its great. must have app.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Possibly one of my favorite albums ever. If you are wondering whether or not to get it on vinyl, DO IT. Wonderfully written, professionally executed, this group is awesome.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I got 7000 of 35,000.<br />Should have Preorderd on the same day,but had to wait for money to transfer,might have gotten under 5000.<br />This is one of those collectors items that will forever be of growing value, because of the limited amount of only 35,000 in circulation and most of them being oppend everyday,on christmas most of them will be opend.I predict another price increase after the 25th.The original price was $35 and sold out after about 2 weeks.It is now being resold for between $250 (Used) and $350 (Collectible) since the release date.This is the ultimate DKRises bluray collection. Well at-least until a Special Edition Dark Knight Trilogy Nolan boxset is released. But the value of this Limited Edition will grow in worth everyday until the end of the world.Hopefully not 21/12/2012.<br />To add, this is a beautiful boxset that presents well and looks like really good quality.<br /><br />I want to give it 6 stars but there is no option.<br />If you didn't get it for $35 and can get an unused one for $300, then you should get it before it becomes $400 or more.<br />Speed is the name of the collectors game.<br /><br />Merry Xmas
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Great album, great artist. He's a super nice guy and fantastic live. Passenger's songs are simply beautiful. Couldn't have enjoyed this album more.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|My friends have been buying lots of piano apps and none of them do what u want them to. They have been PAYING for them. I still cant beilive this one is free!!!! its awesome. u can change the instrument sound. it teaches u how to play songs. u can record ur songs and it keeps track of how long and which note u hit so u can play it again later.great variety of songs too. u can even adjust how big or small u want the keys to be! get this app now before they start charging u for it!!!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I loved this version.  Before this, there was the Gwyneth Paltrow version, which was nice, but this shows a more mischievous, playful Emma Woodhouse.  The actress is just amazing and the cast is very fun.  Really enjoy this verson.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I like that I have multiple apps for my music,  with many electronic devices it is nice to have the options. I shop amazon often and like that I can purchase music from them too.
B0053TMP24|5.0|after listening to the first book in the series, I had to go buy the rest of the series they are very well written.  And keep you entertained.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|There aren't enough stars for this one.  I loved Bared to You and this is the sequeal.  Can't wait for the third book.  Wish I knew it wasn't going to be released for six months and maybe I would have held off reading this one till I could read both back to back.  Great story and well written
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Im a big fan of &#34;Castle&#34;. This book was as good as I could have imagined it would be. It followed with the show and the closeness of the characters.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|I always read the reviews first so I went into this game knowing at some point I'd either have to quit or pay another $0.99.  I also knew it was a large download.  it's not the first large game I've downloaded.  Having said that up front, it was a good game.  When you initially download the game, it's the whole game.  You pay the additional $0.99 to unlock the rest of the game.  I would have paid the $1.99 up front for the game and I'd like to give it five stars (it is a five star game) but because of the deception I just can't do it.
B007SGM084|5.0|very good books readed all three books within a week. I have told people they need to read the books.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|It seems like the main character is based on smart assed comments and that's it.  There's not much of a story and it seems forced just to release a book.  I expect more from ND
B000WGYMAQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! It's so thought provoking and genuine, and the music is awesome! One of my favs.
B005V4FJC4|3.0|I have quite a few holiday CDs that I've collected over the years. I bought this because I like Zooey Deschanel, and I'd heard about this duet. I listened to the samples and liked them, and the price was right so I bought it. It's good, but seems almost like Zooey sings almost every song in the same languid but lovely way. And the &#34;echo-y&#34; sound kinda accentuates the oh-too-adorkable quality. But I still like it, and it's nice to have playing in the background when eating or reading. I'd prolly buy a copy for my sis or niece who appreciate different kinds of music.
0345803485|5.0|And I loved them all. This is a grown woman's book. If you aren't an adult woman, you probably won't like it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was a fast read. It was pretty good but got boring towards the middle . I don't know if I'll read the other books, I felt like the storyline could have a bit more going for it. Entertaining though for a romance novel.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Not one of the better ones.  Sort of dragged, and a bit  predictable.  Rambled and seems like there was a whole lot of filler just to take up space.
B007W7P5L8|4.0|I loved the color and the stand comes in really handy.  Keeps the screen from getting scratched.  I gave this as a gift.
B00498XRPE|4.0|Downloading the film took much longer than I anticipated.  Once the film downloaded, though, it was great quality, no freezing, no continued loading.
030758836X|5.0|Ouutstanding read; set the stage, them drew me into their relationship.  More importantly, the tempo and excitement/engagement grew over \\"time\\". More than once I returned to earlier pages to replay the narrative.  Recommend with enthusiasm
B001AQT0RC|5.0|I watched this movie when it came out theaters back in 1997 and I loved it.  I watched again and I still think this is one of the best movie I've ever watched.
B004JHYRAE|5.0|I love this book. Anyone -  monogamus or poly - can benefit from the advice in this book about relationships, self esteem, and life in general. My wife and I have bought 3 copies of this book so far so that we can loan them out to others.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|I ordered my box set through the walmart website on release day, it arrived two days later. I opened it up and started inspecting the box and all of its contents for shipping damages or manufacturing defects. None to be found. So, I started opening the LP's one by one, looking them over carefully to find any potential problems. Found none. Before I played a single one, I got on here to see what others were saying about this collection. Needless to say, I became quite concerned upon reading all of these negative reviews. So, I started with the LP's that were getting the worst reviews first and started listening. With each album I became happier and happier. They all sounded so great. None of the varying problems that have been described and reported on here, time and time again, to be found in this set. Just great sounding Beatles music. It made me feel good to know that my set was one of the good ones, but it made me feel a little guilty that so many others were having such a terrible time with theirs...<br /><br />I would never assume that people who are claiming to have severe problems with their sets are lying or wrong about what they are talking about. Just as I feel that none of said people should claim that me or anyone else who have received a great sounding set are wrong. When something is mass produced, errors are made. Especially if quality control is lax. I don't know much about Rainbo. Honestly, I had never even heard of them prior to this set's release. I do know that not all of these box sets they've manufactured are bunk. I have proof of that sitting right on my coffee table, as well as other reviews from those who have had a similar experience to mine. Hopefully something is done to correct this issue soon. Thanks for reading! \m/<br /><br />Box = 5 Stars<br />LP's = 5 Stars<br />Book = 5 Stars<br />Shipping package = 5 Stars<br /><br />Mine was packaged securely inside of a heavy/thick cardboard box with die cut foam around the top and bottom of the box set, holding it firmly in place.

I have read it (all 3 books) thru twice in a month and on my 3rd...I bought the trilogy all at once..hearing from my co-workers how intense it was....I'm a mess now....need I need a fix!
B005OGYH90|5.0|Slash and Miles are a great pair to combine their magnificent skills and talent. They seem to have a natural chemistry and mutual respect for eachother. Went on a road trip and rocked the dual CD many times over and made some great memories. The only negative was that I expected the whole concert in Stoke not just a few songs. However, the interview with Slash is wonderful. Would love to see them stop by far Northern California. Awesome!!!

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|AMAZING THANK YOU! My husband is going to be surprised at christmas this will be the best Christmas ever thanks to Amazon!
030758836X|1.0|I got this book because it was so widely recommended. I wish I'd read Amazon's reviews first. I made it through the first 100 pages, barely, before giving up. These are the most revolting characters ever to make it to the printed page. Shallow, selfish, cruel and stupid. The writing is poor, the pace and plotting juvenile and the storyline ridiculous. What really concerns me, though, is the number of people who gave this thing five stars. I can't believe the American reading public could show such poor judgement.<br /><br />If you read a book like The Great Gatsby, which has some very selfish characters in it, you come away feeling that you've gained insight into what makes the tick. Girl Gone really does make you feel like you need a shower.<br /><br /> For fun, check out the reviews on amazon.com UK. The Brits weren't fooled!
0714864803|5.0|A beautiful and comprehensive look at Lebanese cuisine. The photographs in the cookbook are elegant and the recipes are easy to follow.
0425264351|3.0|This new trade paperback has an introduction which was very interesting. It gives background on how the author approached the task of writing novels, the thought process that you never know about. This was my 1st Lee Child book and to me he is just a fair writer and the story was just so-so. In the first place Reacher is a West Point graduate and a colonel. It doesn't make sense that a person with that background would be doing what he's doing. Second the way he acts in various situations is not the way a person of presumably high intelligence would behave. He starts a relationship with an attractive policewoman and is kissing her in the police station in front of others, that's inappropriate. He goes out to the prison nearby and gets the assistant warden to come out for a talk at which point he pulls a knife and starts cutting him trying to get information. Threatens his life. Do you think that a prison warden in Georgia would let a drifter do that and just let it stand ? Please. The murders made no sense either, why would would anyone do those things ? He said to \\"send a message\\". Doesn't plain everyday murder send a message ?
076115678X|5.0|For the first time in as long as I can remember I love my hair!  This book has great tips.  I have tried several of the home recipes, and have like every one so far.  If you have curly hair and have struggled with it for year, you really need to read this book.  I keep it handy all the time so I can refer back when needed.  I'm thinking about getting the kindle version too, just so I am never without it!!!
B005BZQVJ8|1.0|This is one of the dumbest Sci Fi comedies I've ever seen. I can laugh at slapstick and silly jokes but this wasn't even funny ever. This could have been a really great comedy but the jokes got old after about 4 minutes and seemed like they were the same jokes over and over and mostly vulgar. Can anybody make a comedy today without resorting to being vulgar? Seemed like this movie was just thrown together to capitalize on Pegg's recent popularity. Well not so popular anymore. If you watch the trailer then you'll see ALL the funny parts, seriously that is all there is. If you like really dumb, stupid and vulgar comedy then you will certainly enjoy this movie. If on the other hand you are looking for real comedy then skip this movie.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|My 16.5&#34; laptop didn't fit in any of my (many) other laptop bags, so this backpack solves the problem of having to cart my laptop AND a backpack at the same time. I love having so many compartments and zippered pouches. Highly recommend this product.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This is a really great love story from the science fiction book but really well done. All ages can watch this (PG13) and the special effects and the story implementation are really well done. If you are looking for a great science fiction love story then you will probably like this movie. If however, you are looking for an exact adaptation of the book then you should skip this movie. If you cannot tolerate deviation from the book and literary license then skip the movie. I thought the movie was great but I also can watch a movie that is based on a book and not expect that it will be identical. It is difficult to condense a book into a movie, especially this book so I only had the expectation that it would be based on the book and probably only similar. That will be the fundamental difference as to whether you might like this movie.
B009S8PEHY|2.0|Disappointed.  I was really looking forward to this Christmas CD but for the most part the songs are very<br />ho-hum, not much energy or sparkle.  Track 5, Merry Christmas Baby is enjoyable as is the last track,<br />Auld Lang Syne, but as for the rest, you might as well listen to Frank Sinatra, whom I never particularly enjoyed.  I asked a few friends who had listened to if they would like a copy and they all passed.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I know those words are very general but I just love this album. This isn't one of those CDs you buy just for those one or two songs. You listen to it through every time. I really enjoy that there are a few songs that they have not done YouTube videos to yet. I like to imagine what location they would shoot in for the type of song. There were only 2 or 3 repeat songs from their YouTube Vol. 1 album released before they signed with Sony so it was still worth the price!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got this plus the blu-ray by itself. the packiging is really cool. its not a cheep box like most.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I AM EDITING THIS REVIEW TO AMEND DATA THAT HAS CHANGED AND ALSO TO INCLUDE GAME TIPS TO GET YOU GOING AND HELP YOU OUT - I NOW PLAY THIS GAME DAILY AND LOVE IT.<br /><br />I find the time constraints frustrating.  Everything takes days and days.  It can be painfully slow that way.  THIS REMAINS SAME - EXPANSIONS AND THE LIKE BEYOND LEVEL 20 TAKE A LOT OF TIME.  BUT, IS OKAY AS ONE REALLY ONLY NEEDS MANAGE THIS GAME ONCE OR TWICE A DAY (RATHER THAN THE SEVERAL REQUIRED FOR BAKERY OR RESTAURANT, ETC.)<br /><br />An issue I find that is huge overall is that there is only the ability to have 30 habitats With the large number of dragons that are unique, 30 habitats is too limiting.  Due to the limit, it is also hard to do much as everything costs a lot to do.  EDITING - THIS HAS CHANGED AND NOW THERE ARE ADDITIONAL HABITATS AVAILABLE IN QUANTITY.<br /><br />ALSO ADDING THAT WITH EXPERIENCE, I REALIZE THAT THE FASTER ONE EVOLVES DRAGONS THE MORE THEY MAKE AND THUS INCOME GOES UP AND COST OF DOING THINGS IS LESS PROHIBITIVE.<br /><br />This game is definitely for those with patience and who are not easily frustrated by lengthy waits.  It is benefitial for those who have smaller amounts of time daily and fits nicely for those type between things or other games which require more management. Sp, there is a great market out there for customers - you just need decide if you are the customer for this game.  A person who wants to play or only has time to play sporadically daily, every couple days or weekly will find that this game is great fit for them.  Those who play daily and are hard core game players may wish to add this one - but find a filler with more activity to fill the need between the times of this one.<br /><br />Is really cute graphically though.  I find that younger kids will (likely) lose patience with all the time requirements and this game will not find as big a following as other games for children.<br /><br />GAME TIPS:<br /><br />You can only send 3 gifts daily.  Pick wisely.  It is not like other lava games where you can click on all the boxes of your neighbor list and they all get gold.  Nope.<br /><br />THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT...DO NOT SEND GIFTS THIS WAY (ticking off all boxes) - you will send Stormie gold daily (stormie is a lava add that is computer playing with you so you have a neighbor to visit for earning eggs from nest visits and filling requests ONLY).  Stormie does NOT send you gifts nor visit you ever.  Since is game itself - why give it gold to do what it does free anyway?  Keep your gold for your neighbors.  You can give 3 daily and you may gift same ones daily or rotate or send to those who send to you or send to random.  That is going to be personal choice.  JUST DO NOT PULL UP NEIGHBOR LIST AND TICK OFF ALL THE BOXES as only Stormie and the first two will ever get your gifts if done this way.<br /><br />You need neighbors in this game.  At least 20 as you can recieve 20 filled map requests daily.  You need to send requests in order to expand (after level 4 I think you need maps) and the only way to get the maps is via a neighbor filling request.  Since you can only get 20 a day you can limit your neighbors to 20 do you wish to.  Though - not all players are daily in this game as in others and you may find you want more.  I am up to needing 56 maps to expand per time - it can take days to amass the maps - thus neighbors are important in this game.  Visting neighbors gains you \\"eggs\\" toward your rank - the higher your rank the more easily you will attract neighbors.  Also - when you visit community members and neighbors - some will visit you (this is where rank is key with community visits - the higher your rank 1-4 - the higher your place in community visit board while you are online - thus more people see you and more potential visits) - which gives you \\"bonus\\" experience and coins.  So, this is not a single player game and those who do not prefer playing with groups of people should look for games geared toward their desires.<br /><br />WALLS:  you have a wall as do each of the islands you visit.  Post your ID on your wall if you wish visitors to add you.  You can post your visits/ID on walls of islands you visit.  This will often at least get you a return visit and maybe even a neighbor.  I always post my neighbor visits so that people know and can return favor if they feel like it.  Many do not often view NEWS feed - even though it pops up on game loading each time.<br /><br />NEWS FEED - check your news feed - many visitors do not post their visit on your wall(some use this as a way to test for new neighbors).  If you watch your news feed - you will find other people that just those who posted on your wall to visit and return favor.  This can (and often does) end up in an invite if you leave your ID or have it on your wall.  I like to see TY 3 B on my wall of a community island that I visited and did not post visit to.  That person is vigilant and likely a good candidtate for neighbor as they will watch for my requests and visits.<br /><br />GOALS - this game has goals just like other lava games.  Just check to see which is obtainable, reasonalbe within your money and ability at time they pop and go with what makes most sense.  Do not get caught in breeding for a special dragon over and over if you have very few habitats and no way to get more at the time.  This one is really about common sense and you will easily see which goals to do and in what order.  There are TIMED goals and you need decide which or even IF they are manageable for you at time they pop.  Don't worry if you cannot do some - this game (due to needing so much time for so many things) some timed goals are just going to be beyond ability - no matter how hard you try.<br /><br />This is just a start and should get you on your way.  If you have any questions - post in comments and I will respond with best possible answer I can give.<br /><br />Game Storm ID:  willfulone<br /><br />Christineeared toward their desires.<br /><br />WALLS:  you have a wall as do each of the islands you visit.

0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind, written by Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n is a fantastic novel that grabs the reader's attention so well it will become one of those books where you just can't stop reading. The New York Times Bestseller was published by Penguin Books in 2005.<br /> The storyline takes place in the beautiful yet mysterious streets of Barcelona, Spain. The main character Daniel Sempere is just a child who has lost his mother and helps his father in their family bookstore. The story begins when Daniel's father takes him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a large library unknown to the public which is in what appears to be a run down building from the outside. The Cemetery of Forgotten Books is meant to be a \\"resting ground\\" for unwanted books and is somewhat like a library. When each person first enters, they are allowed to choose their own book, which is meant to be special to them. When Daniel and his dad enter the Cemetery for the first time, this is how Daniel comes across a book with as much of a story behind it as it has written inside it. The book is called The Shadow of the Wind.<br /> Not only does Daniel love the book, but after reading it he discovers the author's name: Juli&aacute;n Carax. The odd thing is, neither Daniel nor his father recognize the author's name even though they've seen so many books and authors over the years in their shop. Daniel decides to ask around to find out who Carax is, but nobody can really answer. All he gets are stories, facts, and possibilities of who Carax is and why Daniel's book is so unheard of. And so, as the mysteries unravel, Daniel begins his search for Juli&aacute;n Carax and his story.<br /> Although the story was translated from Spanish to English and it's known that a good book can lose some of its qualities through translation, this is one of the most well written and captivating books I've read in my life. Zaf&oacute;n's use of analogies to depict a scene or characteristic could not have been written any better. \\"Glancing over Fumero's shoulder, I thought I saw the darkness stirring and a figure without a face, his eyes burning, gliding toward us in absolute silence, as if barely touching the floor.\\" In addition, not only is the book well written but the story it tells is one that was able to make me feel strong emotions. I've done this with several other incredible books I've read, where after reading the very last sentence I slowly close the book, lay it down, and I just sit there in silence, no longer reading, but thinking about the story as if it was real. It's hard to explain simply, but a truly good book such as this one should do that. It should make you feel as if the world inside the book is real and make you actually think about the story on your own, not just when reading.<br /> Something the book shows is the lifestyle of Barcelona and what the city looked like at the time. Throughout the book, several rich families are mentioned, ones that had built up an economic empire in Barcelona. It talks about what life was like for them in Spain and even goes as far as describing their luxurious mansions looming over fog filled streets. It also mentions the poor side of Barcelona, some homeless like Daniel's friend Fermin, or small communities like the one around the Sempere book store, going through hard times and trying to find light in the darkness of Barcelona.<br /> As for recommendations, I wouldn't just recommend this book to someone I know, I would insist that they read it. No matter what genre someone likes, they can still find reasons to love this book. Without a doubt, I am going to read Zaf&oacute;n's other novels because I'm sure they will be as good as The Shadow of The Wind, but maybe I should wait a bit longer. That is because I only wish I could have read this in Spanish so I could get a pure, unfiltered version of Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's remarkable writing. Either way, no matter what language it's in, The Shadow of The Wind is a true novel, and deserves every award it's been given.
B000OWAFPE|3.0|My daughter loves Happy Feet 2, and we think it is much better than the first one. Not worth the $10.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|It was an interesting movie. I think it delivered where you would expect it to. The performance was well done.
B008M34INW|3.0|I find this movie difficult to comment on since in my opinion the plot of the movie and the acting in it is very well executed. Especially the 12 yr. old boy playing the roll of the 10 yr. old that Mel Gibson, the Gringo in this Mexican prison, &#34;befriends&#34;, does<br />an excellent job ! This movie depicts the conditions in a Mexican prison and the Extra's of this movie explains the situations very well. So make sure you watch the extra's also. Since the dialogue is done in English and Spanish with your choice of subtitles, this movie is very difficult to follow if you are not fluent in both languages, the reason being that the subtitles are flashed on the screen and not left on there long enough to give you time to see what really is happening in the scene !  As I mentioned before, the acting in this movie is excellent and the the facial expressions of the actors during certain situations are worth paying attention to, but you are not given much of a chance to do this. To make the situation even worse, the white color of the letters<br />does not very well stand out against the mostly light sandy color of the surroundings that this movie is shot in; the desert surroundings. If you do not make your choice of what kind of audio programming you want, then you you get automatically very small lettered subtitles in English that are also done in white but are even harder to read because of their size !  I think the American film industry can learn something from the Europeans who are more experienced in subtitling their movies due to the fact that  they are more used to catering to audiences of different languages since their borders are so close.<br /><br />I saw from the beginning on that this movie would be interesting and watched it 3 times in a row (!!) experimenting with what subtitle choice would be the best and finally starting to get to enjoy the acting and scope of this movie to it's fullest. By that time I had less need to pay attention to the subtitlesand started to appreciate what was shown on the screen a lot better and I am tempted to raise my rating to 5 stars. I suppose that a person who is fluent in Spanish and English would have enjoyed this movie right from the start, but to release a movie in a country that is officially speaking one language, English, with such poor attention to subtitling is depriving the majority of audiences to the full enjoyment of it. At home you can watch this movie again and again, but a person does not have to do this to fully appreciate it. A good movie should be feeling right and be to the point right from the beginning !<br /><br />Another gripe I have with this movie is the fact that it does not clearly show from the start on what kind of choices one can make<br />pertaining to audio/video, subtitles,extra's and so on. Only by moving your cursor around do these choices light up !  It start showing immediately &#34;PLAY&#34; which gives you than the poor tiny subtitling in English. Futhermore, it takes for ever to get to  your chosen features;  the player needs a long time finding things, it has to search constantly  for what ever you have clicked on.<br />In case you might think my player needs downloading upgrades, it has the latest upgrades and it does not have this problem<br />of searching for your chosen features with other movies be it DVD or BLU RAY !!<br /><br />It is for all this poor attention paying to detail that I have to stay with my neutral 3 star rating for a movie that could easily be 5<br />stars, especially if you're fluent in Spanish and English and don't need any subtitles, but the lengthy searching for your chosen<br />features that sometimes don't even show up make this a VERY POOR BLU RAY  PRODUCTION.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I have only played this on the ipod it is fun, I just don't have it on the kindle yet
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|Very funny!  Seth Mcfarlane puts his creative talents to use once again.  Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are hilarious in this film.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The mission briefing and execution of one the most dynamic and dangerous raids in history really puts you in the mind set of the courageous men who carried out this act of valor.
B000002952|5.0|This is my second copy, this one for the car.  Yes this is not in English but we have never heard anything that would prompt us to taking this from the \\"after work, with a glass of wine\\" listening.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|A beautiful movie - filled with music, love and brilliant acting. Freddie Highmore is something special. This is a movie to treasure.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|I really enjoyed this series- all five seasons. I have no complaints. This is the season where Chuck and Sarah operate as a married spy couple and the writers handled it very well. Lots of action and comedy. The cast works well together.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun to play.  you miss out. on some things if you don't. share plus. they. try to get more money for things
0553386794|5.0|I'm still reading this and it is excellent so far. Well written, excellent character and plot development. Very reasonably priced.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Bought for my daughter's new iPhone 4s. Originally I thought the price was crazy, but when she came out of the bathroom and told me she dropped it in the toilet and then rinsed it off, I was really glad I spent a few extra bucks on this case. She told me several of her friends have ruined their phones by dumping them in the toilet. Overall, Saved me a ton of cash.
B000A1SZ2Y|4.0|This will make any lens you have a super macro. But be aware that it is extremely hard to keep focus and will take time to learn to get good pictures on a regular basis. You need a lot of light, patience, and steady hands and you can get great pictures from this. Quality is good and it has held up without issue for over a year.<br /><br />Overall a great deal and worth the effort if you are into macro pictures.

B009FZZFME|5.0|This season started out with a bang and has not let up much since. So much going on, it is keeping me on the edge of my seat every week. Can't wait till the new episodes start back up!
B000YMJA7I|5.0|Great Alblum at a great price.Also love the digital download and storage.They have alot off great songs on this Record.
B0085A9J18|5.0|absolutely stunning action movie.  i was completely blown away by the intensity of each scene, as well as the seemingly impossible choreography.  the raid: redemption is a relentless, adrenaline-filled joyride that beats most, if not all, martial arts movies to date.  highly recommended for kungfu movie fans.<br /><br />this movie is not for kids.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it and beginning the others immediately. And I would give a description but, it simply isn't needed. Enjoyed it to the end.<br />:)
0199535639|5.0|Part of the genre of Sensation Novels which emerged in the mid Victorian era, Wilkie Colins's work The Woman in White is a page-turner full of gothic elements mixed with Victorian Realism. The book is written in a way similar to the Epistolary style.  If you're looking for a read reminiscent of Radcliffe, or just a book to make you gasp aloud, this is a good choice.  The Villains are villainous, the heroes are heroic, the ladies in distress are distressed... While quite a little monster in the realm of page count (over 600), I had no problems with \\"slow spots\\" or dragging points in the story. If there isn't nail-biting \\"whodunnit\\", then there is intriguing interaction between characters which never seemed forced or fake. Definitely a good read.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The series is even better than the book - an epic story aet against a visual tapestry of color, fantasy and light. Griping action scenes and suspenseful moments. And intriguing characters of all types. I highly recommend it (except for small children, as it's rather sexually explicit at times).
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Just got my first Acer notebook and this is my first e-book.  Great book, easy and fast download.  Love it!!  Thanks Amazon
1455508977|3.0|I definitely enjoyed reading this book because I finished it in one sitting! The romance was not as intense as I would have liked it. The story was good, but fairly predictable. I pictured Thibault older even knowing that Zac Efron plays him in the movie. The grandmother is hilarious! Its been awhile since I've read a Nicholas Sparks book, but I found the ending kind of abrupt and I am not sure if that is a pattern with his books. I can't remember. But I do know this is one of the first of his novels that I didn't bawl my eyes out by the end...and that might be a bad thing. I wasn't as emotional connected to these characters.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Very good. It is a interesting story of life and how truly precious it is. And how easy it is to waste time without a second thought.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|It was a blast from the past and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  There are no other drummers who can equal John Bonham except for Jeff Martin.  Keep your eyes and ears peeled - you will here him soon and he sounds exactly like John Bonham!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is fun.  Can't really give it five stars because I don't &#34;love it&#34;.  I like to pick-up a game or two of Solitaire just to pass the time or while I'm watching tv!
B0053O89JM|5.0|I have been a fan of House since it first premiered back in 2004, and I have all of the first seven seasons on DVD.  The eighth season (while having been somewhat lackluster and missing some of its original cast members, particularly Lisa Edelstein and Jennifer Morrison!) brings the title character full circle with an unexpected and final walk into the sunset (with his best friend Wilson).  I highly recommend it to all fans of the series!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|could be better could be worse. great action sequences but not a very good story line so keep trying, please
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Now and then a movie comes along that works on nearly every level and bowls you over. For me, this was one of those movies.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Pat is bi-polar. He's just out of an institution, where he spent the better part of a year, after having beat up a guy he found in the shower with his wife. Now he's back with mom and dad and needs to put his life back together. He becomes acquainted with a local girl who has some serious baggage of her own. Together they work on getting back on track.<br /><br />This is a near perfect film. It's shot in a very un-Hollywood style. There's a lot of hand-held camera and natural light. You feel as though you occupy the same space as the characters. The dialogue is outstanding and the performances are equally as good. De Niro is always good but I've grown a bit tired of him over the years. That disappeared while watching this. Here's a father who couldn't understand his son's problems as a child, and now is feeling the guilt in how those problems have nearly ruined his son's life. He himself has issues with obsessive, compulsive disorder. That he's lost his job and is working as a bookie is adding to the household problems. Mom does what she can but has to struggle to get her voice heard.<br /><br />What really is happening here is the relationship between Pat and Tiffany. Brad Cooper as Pat and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany are great together. They dish out a lot of crap to each other, and there are a lot of fits and starts, but slowly they come to see something in each other. They take each other outside of their perspective comfort zones and that helps them move forward.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it gets very Hollywood at the end and the script goes from being very natural to very contrived. It's a shame because up to that point it's as good as any movie you are likely to see. But don't be put off. The high points far outweigh the shortcomings.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|well this app is pretty nice but there is too many ads and you can never apply music or different clocks because you need to buy the full version foe $1.99
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Read it in three days....every free moment I had I was captivated with the lifestyle of Christian Grey....<br />\\"Yes sir, please!\\"
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Very few funny moments. I guess I wanted more than just the same jokes on family guy. It ran a little long for what it was.
B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey<br />Fifty Shades Darker<br /><br />The first two books were exciting, stimulating, and wonderful.  I couldn't stop reading them.  I had to pull myself away.  I look forward to reading the third book
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It took me a few chapters to get into the first book. But I'm hooked now. Such a great story. Well written with fun twists.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|An entertaining film made even better with 3D. Hard core Sci-Fi fans need to chill; this movie isn't for them as there are some leaps of faith required. Avatar is visually engaging and makes you think twice about messing with Mother Nature. But those leaps of faith and 4th-grade character development temper ones enthusiasm.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Though many other people I've spoken to claimed that the movie didn't do the series justice, I felt really satisfied with the way the movie went.  If anything, it was action-packed and intense and I enjoyed the portrayal of Bane.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|this was added after my kindle was stolen.  i do not like to be surveyed on things i did not download.
0345803485|5.0|Unless you're dead, you'll enjoy this dirty sexy book. All women who read it , love it, and are so willing to try new things with me! Keep running out of ties! Thank god for Walmart and their cheap ties! :)
B005LAII12|3.0|Not a fan of MacFarlane or Family Guy in general, but I do occasionally find a bits and pieces of Family Guy entertaining. That being said, I watched this movie with an open-mind due to the great reviews. Pretty meh to say the  least. It has a few parts that I would consider funny, but overall got boring at times and predictable. Acting was decent, but the plot was pretty thin. I'd say the most impressive performances of the film was Kunis and Ribisi. If you expect Family Guy-level laughs though, this film fails to deliver overall.
0345803493|5.0|Good as the first book in trilogy. Unless you're dead, will really turn you on. My girlfriend is always ready for some &#34;fun&#34; after reading a chapter or two! Lots of ideas to be explored in book!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This, of course, is silly, but it's clever and well thought-out.  Just the idea of Abe swinging an axe at vampires . . . A lot of fun.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Great movie, will watch over and over all year long  and never get tired of it.  Love the story line.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Intense! Season 3 is the best. Too bad so many regulars die off. Great action/suspense. The best decapitations on network TV. I know who I would hang out with during the zombie apocalypse. Freakin love this show!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love loved this book! it was a very quick read and kept me entertained. Would suggest it to friends.
B000002AGN|5.0|I have loved classic jazz a lot more as I've gotten older. Now reaching 30 and having gone on to Mile Davis's \\"Kind of Blue\\" becoming among my favorites, I've hit myself over the head over not branching into the late Brubeck's music as of this writing. However I can say that I was long introduced to his music through his famous, and challenging \\"Take Five\\".<br /><br /> To conventional two-dimensional viewers, it may have sounded like very classic jazz, but to others though, Brubeck challenged the entire conventional 4/4 timing of most Western music and \\"Take Five\\" has a 5/4 timing which completely deviates from much, if not any else that came before it. It's remarkable as listening to this, and having taken jazz history classes, I've come to see \\"Take Five\\" as bridging the gap between regular 4/4 and the 'Free Jazz' era of the 1960s. For me, it is especially meaningful as my family came to know him and family members.<br /><br /> Not to overlook the rest of \\"Time Out\\" but to me, and countless others, \\"Take Five\\" is pure genius that few, if any musicians, of any genre have ever come close to rivalling. Yes, this album came out in 1959 and like much of the music of that era, should've been viewed and/or remembered as a 'relic' of the era but instead, has become a timeless work of art for many generations to come. I could listen to this and \\"Kind of Blue\\" on their 100th anniversary of release in 2059, which I'll be 77 and it would not sound the slightest bit out of date, even as something that came out in 2009, will wind up in the dustbin of oblivion.<br /><br /> Thank you for the marvelous works over the last 70 years Mr. Brubeck. Your and your family's work will be cherish by many. And I definately recommend this important album.
B0083Z614S|3.0|I saw the movie before reading the book. The book pretty much was like the movie. there was nothing majorly exiting.
0061906220|5.0|We love this book. Very fun.  Kids pick up on the words and &#34;read&#34; along.  I own a daycare and it is a favorite for all ages.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very well written and imaginative book.  Wool takes you to a place that seems almost familiar, prophetic yet sorta scary.
B009LRE040|5.0|Although not the biggest Bale as Batman fan, this one was awesome.  Tom Hardy as Bane was the best part of the movie.  I loved the ending as a set up for another movie, but didn't like the way Bane was done away with.  Still a must see for any Batman nut.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|Nice game, nice grafics. It is wierd to play a game were the character is always jumping but it cannot just be like another plataform game or you would start saying that it is a rip off of other famous games so I do appreciate that it is different. Works fine on my kindle.<br />It does have a racial connotation but I do not see any wrong in it. It is just a bean in a sombrero hat having fun jumping around.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This movie had me laughing so much I had to watch multiple times just to see the parts I missed. Marky Mark pulls off yet another awesome performance. A must see for anyone who needs a laugh.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Definitely buy this Moonrise Kingdom set above just the DVD, you get your monies worth here, for just a couple bucks more.
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|I think this movie was incredibly done.  Tom Hardy outshines Shia on this one.  Hardy is really making a name for himself.  This movie is a must see as it pulls you right in and never lets up till the end.
B00632HWOG|2.0|the permissions are not good. getting a thumbnail representation of tasks is not needed. all this will di is collect your info.
B00A7CI82I|2.0|I think the Bourne legacy is over. I think Jeremy Renner is a great actor. He was just put into a bad role. No fault of his, as he did his best. No one pulls off Bourne like Mr Damon.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|4 thumbs up!  The only movie I have purchased in the last 10 years.  This is one movie I could watch once or twice a year.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's books. This is one of the best.It coverwd both the past and present of the leadind character Mitch Rapp which I liked.

B007MJ9LA2|5.0|Husband loved it.  It was a great gift for the holidays. Packaged great and arrived with plenty of time to spare.
1582701709|5.0|This is a great book to keep handy and re-read every now and then.  It's the kind of book that helps inprove ones self.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I am so ready to read more books about Mac. She is an awesome character with LOTS of drama. I'm on to Fever Moon now!
B007N9FKCY|5.0|I bought this game on the Play Store a while back, and played through it from beginning to end.  It's a fun twist on the traditional platformer, where you're constantly jumping and your only controls are moving left or right.  It's surprisingly challenging on the later levels, but the true challenge comes from the collectible and maximum jump goals to reach on each level.  If you're an obsessive completionist, this game will keep you busy for a long time.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|When we watch the show, one liners come and go so fast that often they are missed. Love watching the show!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book. Very suspensful, suprising. You won't want to put it down. Download it so you don't have to wait!
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|&#34;Contact&#34; was a good Jodie Foster movie.  The unusual plot twist left what her character really experienced up to each member of the audience's interpretation based on their own personal belief system.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose to give diary of a wimpy kid the third wheel 5 stars because I laughed the whole time that I was reading it!
B00867GJYK|5.0|\\"Finding Nemo\\" is not only one of Pixar's biggest movie hits, it's also one of their best films. To quote Leonard Maltin describing \\"Peter Pan,\\" \\"it's a film in which everything clicks.\\" Visually, it is almost overwhelming -- on the big screen, recently in 3D, on DVD and now on Blu-ray, where every details sparkles.<br /><br />Much is said about the pros and cons of using \\"name\\" celebrities for voices. \\"Finding Nemo\\" stands as a great arguement for using them, if they are well cast. Few animated films of any kind boast such an on-target cast, from the stars to the always great character actors and voice actors who fill out the company.<br /><br />It's also one of those films that, once you get started watching it, you simply have to keep watching, no matter how many times you've seen it. The story is 99% fat free, every sequence moving logically from one to another. This is Pixar at its best, and also the master influence of Walt Disney and Hayao Miyazaki at work.<br /><br />So if you want to behold its majesty in Blu-ray, this new release is highly recommended. Even though there is a DVD in some sets, which you can use in the car or the computer, if you love bonus features and want to keep them equally accessible, than hang on to your 2-Disc Collectors Edition. The Blu-ray seems to have a few new features, but most of it was imported from the last edition and does not reappear on the new DVD.<br /><br />There was also a 168-minute \\"visual commentary\\" on the earlier edition that has been reconfigured on the Blu-ray into a \\"Cine-Explore\\" that now runs the 100-minute length of the film. I cannot itemize every element to assure that the edited material was placed elsewhere on the Blu-ray, so again I'm keeping my earlier edition.<br /><br />New option on Blu-ray and DVD:<br />English Descriptive Audio Service<br /><br />2012 Blu-ray Bonus Features<br />* Cine-explore (shortened visual commentary)<br />* Reinventing the Submarine Voyage<br />* Deleted Scene: Alt Opening<br />* A Lesson in Flashbacks<br />* Knick Knack Theatrical Short<br />* Aquarium<br />* Finding Nemo - A Filmmakers' Roundtable<br />* Selection of Virtual Aquariums<br />* Art Review<br />* Documentary: Making Nemo<br />* Exploring the Reef<br />* Studio Tour<br />* Old School<br />* Outtakes<br />* Deleted Scenes<br />* Publicity Pieces<br />* Mr Ray's Encyclopedia<br /><br />2012 DVD Bonus Features<br />* Knick Knack Theatrical Short<br />* Finding Nemo - A Filmmakers' Roundtable<br />* Aquarium<br /><br />2003 2-Disc DVD Collectors Edition<br />* Widescreen movie<br />* Documentary: Making Nemo<br />* Visual Commentary (with Deleted Scenes, 168 minutes)<br />* Design Galleries (Art Review; Characters; Environments, Color Script)<br />* Selection of Virtual Aquariums<br />* Introduction with filmmakers<br />* Full Frame movie<br />* Aquarium<br />* Exploring the Reef<br />* Knick Knack Theatrical Short<br />* Mr Ray's Encyclopedia<br />* Fishharades Game<br />* Storytime<br />* Behind the Scenes (Character Interviews, Studio Tour, Publicity)br />* A Lesson in Flashbacks<br />* Knick Knack Theatrical Short<br />* Aquarium<br />* Finding Nemo - A Filmmakers' Roundtable<br />* Selection of Virtual Aquariums<br />* Art Review<br />* Documentary: Making Nemo<br />* Exploring the Reef<br />* Studio Tour<br />* Old School<br />* Outtakes<br />* Deleted Scenes<br />* Publicity Pieces<br />* Mr Ray's Encyclopedia<br /><br />2012 DVD Bonus Features<br />* Knick Knack Theatrical Short<br />* Finding Nemo - A Filmmakers' Roundtable<br />* Aquarium<br /><br />2003 2-Disc DVD Collectors Edition<br />* Widescreen movie<br />* Documentary: Making Nemo<br />* Visual Commentary (with Deleted Scenes, 168 minutes)<br />* Design Galleries (Art Review; Characters; Environments, Color Script)<br />* Selection of Virtual Aquariums<br />* Introduction with filmmakers<br />* Full Frame movie<br />* Aquarium<br />* Exploring the Reef<br />* Knick Knack Theatrical Short<br />* Mr Ray's Encyclopedia<br />* Fishharades Game<br />* Storytime<br />* Behind the Scenes (Character Interviews, Studio Tour, Publicity)
B005S9EJ14|3.0|A feel good movie like a thousand others. Nothing very special here. The plot is straight forward and you'll have the whole movie figured out in the !st 15 min.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|What a boring book. The writing bordered on snobbery. Would not recommend. was painful to read. Not my style at all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Hello I'm Eric and I'm a Abbeyholic. Everyone say hello back now please. Look if you have never seen this series start with season 1 show 1 and then go from there. I would not have to sell you any of it because you too will be joining me in the aa rooms. Very well written show, deep characters and just plain ole life drama and politics going on.
B0077ZNCE2|3.0|Kind of what I predicted, standard fare for this series. Nothing earth shattering but still a fun ride. I am interested to see how part 2 turns out, so I guess they did at least hook me there.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|it was a good movie not the type of movie to own or watch again, I gave it a 5 rating because it was different.
B005DD7H50|4.0|This is worth watching for sure. I found myself wishing I had a few of those pills myself ! You will not regret renting or buying this one, had a few good twists that I didn't fully see coming.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|very good movie  I will probably watch it again I will recommend this movie if you like the others you will enjoy this one
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I'm not seeing the problem some other reviews state about not being able to see items &amp; no zoom capabilities, at least not on my Kindle Fire. Seems like a run-of-the-mill search game &amp; I'm enjoying it just fine.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So I may be a bit old, but I loved this boook.  I'm 32, and it is perfect for age 13 through 25!  But older can love too!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is one very powerful dvd on drug abuse. If you know of anyone that has a problem with drugs and if this person is ready to watch and see how drugs can ruin a life. I suggest any one to watch this one because I know of people that has been affected to these problems.
B001F12J48|2.0|well, i bought this movie thinking it was a blue ray 3-d movie, but I was wrong. the 2 stars is because you can stiil see the movie in 2-d and avoid the funny glasses they include and just do nothing for it. I believe people giving 5 stars to this movie are really reviewing a different format. don't buy it if you have a 3-d capable tv. you will be dissapointed....I'm giving this movie to someone doesn't expect to have the 3-d experience
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading this book I definately want more. If only we all had a little grey in our lives. Yummy
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book. Stayed up late to finish it. Well worth it! Grisham definitely keeps the reader interested. The character development is amazing.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|Did anyone stop to think what goes into the orchestration of the songs here? Sting's song writing and melodies are unparalleled and when reworked to blend with strings are absolutely beautiful. The orchestral arrangements add so much body to these songs. If you can't be moved by the music and lyrics in \\"Russians\\", there's a problem. I would put this concert right up there with The Police's \\"Certifiable\\" show. Two completely different styles but same genius musician. I read a quote the other day describing the great drummer Buddy Rich. It said, \\"Genius ignites its own fire\\". Right on, Sting.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|Hot Fuzz is a great movie and on Blue Ray it's even better.  Great sound and picture and comes with some really good extra features!
B008966SLM|5.0|Just awesome Blues as one always expects and gets from Robert Cray. His vocals are as smooth and sweet as they can be and His Guitar playing just seems to get better and better if that could even be possible.
B000068OSK|5.0|I loves this CD.  My favorite song is \\"Stop breaking down.\\"  The guitar playing is brave and raw and the vocals are outstanding.  The classic St. James Infirmary is on this CD and it is a magnificent rendition.<br /><br />Julie E.
1452111014|5.0|A beautiful art book for what I consider to be one of the best animated motion pictures to come out in recent years.
0525953728|4.0|I think it could have had a  better  ghost writer .Other than that I liked the book because of the topic.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Can't say enough about Supernatural...c'mon. Clever writing, great banter between the two brothers, and lots of action with Sam and Dean dispatching demons and evil spirits and 'saving the day' over and over and over again. Some of the banter is so funny, I've laughed until I've cried...start the series at the beginning. You'll be hooked in NO time!!
B00338QENI|4.0|I was skeptical about this book at first because it was a reading assignment for a class. It ended up being very interesting.  I really made me really wonder if that's how the medical world was back in the day.  Made me very thankful for the laws and regulations to protect us patients from medical research and malpractice.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in healthcare in anyway.  It is also a easy read for those not I healthcare. It explains medical terminology quite well.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I have already purchased the other two seasons because, hands down, this is one of the FUNNIEST sitcoms on television. My boyfriend and I, on more than one occasion, have had to pause the DVD because we are laughing so hard! The actors all have great comedic timing and the writing is extremely clever but often irreverent and slightly 'racy' (as my parents would say), but I really think it plays to a very wide audience. Part of the 'cast' includes a gay male couple who live together with their adopted child, so if you're extremely conservative this might not be for you...that said, get a sense of humor (hah) because some of the most hilarious scenes involve the gay couple! I have recommended this show to a lot of people and they all love it...but then, they all have my highly sophisticated sense of humor (&#60;--that was a joke...I really am very humble. Hah again.) Buy ALL of them. Laughing is good for you!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked the book. It was a little long and kind of jumped around a bit. I would recommend it
B008602KQI|4.0|This was a gift, so I can't review the disc--but I saw the film in theaters.  It was a pretty well-done adaptation, although the completely unnecessary shakey-cam in the opening minutes was frustrating and agonizing, and some of the backstory establishing Peeta's longstanding admiration of Katniss--in particular the time he wordlessly saved her family from starvation--wasn't as clear or powerful as I thought it should have been.  Some of the social satire comes out loud & clear, but some of it doesn't.  All in all, not a great film--but a decent one worth seeing if you've read the book, or just are interested in the premise.<br /><br />Parents, do keep the rating in mind.  This is a story about children being forced, but a totalitarian government, to murder each other for a decadent populace's amusement--it gets fairly brutal at times.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|An amazing release from one of the worlds greatest rock bands.  Exile On Main Street is jammed full of classic tracks and the bonus tracks are worth the asking price alone.  If you love Stones brand Rock N Roll and just plain great Rock N Roll in general than this album is a must.
B001RT89UG|5.0|I got to see MSG live at a small club in Dallas on this tour. We stood 10 feet away from Michael the whole time and he was basically at floor level.  It was like he was in your living room hunkered down on that V and tearing it up.  This captures the experience and is as good as it is going to get without having been there in person.  Makes me wish I could go back.  Those were indeed the days.

B007FDE4Y8|4.0|It is quite straight-forward to figure out how to use the devise, but I still prefer to have a handy manual. As there are many ways you can adjust the balance, it takes time and practice to find the best way for your camera - a user manual will help a lot here.
B0059XTU1S|3.0|The last time out Peter Jackson did everything right. First he started with a great book(s), and then he carefully crafted a screenplay which stayed remarkably true to the source. In New Zealand he found the perfect location which he capitalized on with stunning cinematography. Most significantly he used the technological wizardry of computer generated imagery to great advantage. No doubt about it, The Lord of The Rings trilogy could never have been brought to film without CGI, but in Jackson's deft hands the CGI was never the main attraction. The CGI was always used in service of the story, never the other way around. This time Jackson did all of the important stuff wrong. Admittedly with The Hobbit Jackson has started with a lesser book, but instead of using his vision to elevate the original, he has succumbed to greed and diluted it. There is no other justification for reinterpreting a relatively short novel as a trio of full length movies. In order to fill all of that extra screen time Jackson had to write lots of extra material, and so he has strayed from his greatest initial achievement. He has failed to stay true to the book. As with the previous trilogy, the cast of this new series is strong and the location is stunning, but unlike his Lord of The Rings trilogy this interpretation of The Hobbit is just a weak excuse for one special effect after another. This time the CGI does not serve the story, it is the story. In Jackson's hands Tolkien's Hobbit has been reimagined as a non-stop roller coaster ride of successively ridiculous action scenes. The only thing missing was Johnny Depp.

0571202284|5.0|I do not know what else to say but that this book is very insightful. Richard Williams talks about how he started out and what the professionals (lead animators from disney and warner bros) he trained under were like and how the business really was. He talks about other animated films besides his own such as bambi, jungle book, and the beatles yellow submarine featured film.<br /><br />Then he goes on to explain and illustrate the flow of all kinds of movements. This book is just really great.<br /><br />I highly suggest it.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Some love it, some hate it. This film is from director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner). It is truely a sci-fi movie. For those that like Alien and Bladerunner, You will enjoy this movie. At 2 hours long and the Acting is good, you can't beat buying and watch this one.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|How do you lose your virginity if you have been confined to an iron lung most of your life? A couple of years ago, I had some lively discussions on this topic with one of my JayFlix friends, a health-care professional who was attending a young quadriplegic. Now this film-festival favorite addresses the question, only this man isn't paralyzed with no physical sensations, instead he is a polio survivor confined to an iron lung since childhood. Furthermore, he is a witty, well-educated and frustrated adult.<br /><br />Based on the real-life story of Mark O'Brien (1949-1999), a Berkeley poet and journalist, he was the first severely disabled student to graduate from college, earning a bachelor's degree in 1982, and acceptance to a post graduate program. His inspiring story has been told once before in a documentary film, \\"Breathing Lessons,\\" directed by Jessica Yu. It won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short in 1997. This version is written and directed by the acclaimed Ben Lewin, himself a polio survivor who requires crutches.<br /><br />We watch:<br />  * John Hawkes (\\"Contagion\\") is brilliant as Mark O'Brien, who wryly tells his priest he wants to experience sex before his \\"Use-By date\\" expires. Hawkes is an amazing chameleon who transforms himself from film to film, each time I am stunned to discover who I have just watched. There is some well-deserved Oscar buzz about this film.<br />  * Helen Hunt (\\"As Good as it Gets\\") is Cheryl Cohen Greene, a professional therapist hired to provide basic instruction in human sexuality. Her therapy is bluntly anatomical and unembarrassed while at the same time, extremely sensitive and insightful. His responses are usually humorous and disarming. Hunt is fearless but convincing, and is beautifully naked a lot of the time.<br />  * William H. Macy (\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\") is Father Brendon, our hero's priest, who fears he might have unleashed some major sinning by counseling his parishioner to \\"Go for it!\\" This priest spent his childhood on a farm, so his observations are very forthright and practical.<br /><br />This film proves two points:<br /><br />  1) Our biggest sex organ is between our ears;<br />  2) One of the most seductive things about another person may be an ability to make us laugh. O'Brien, when asked if he is religious, replies, \\"Of course I am! I've gotta have someone to blame!\\"<br /><br />There are many happy spots in this inspiring piece and as we exited the theater, we were subdued but satisfied...smile....I'll be happy when Amazon notifies me of the DVD release.
0385333846|4.0|I recieved this book for a Christmas present .I haven't read it but know the person I got it for will enjoy it. I got it on time really before I exspected it .Good service .I think if you want something fast you should order from this company.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|They said this novel by David Mitchell could never be filmed, but the theme is simple: Everything is connected. Of course, these are the Wachowski siblings (The Matrix franchise) and this long-awaited film IS incredibly complicated... but simple: We follow a group of people whose reincarnated lives keep intersecting over the eons; in fact one observes \\"...when this Mortal Coil becomes a noose...\\"<br /><br />This R-rated Sci Fi/Thriller/Romance/Comedy/Drama/Mystery/Actioner takes place in six different time periods and runs for 172 minutes (yes, almost three hours, that's why this review is so long). Each time period is fully realized and the story which unfolds for each era is fully developed. You will never be bored, you will rarely be confused and you will always be impressed. The Wachowskis are capable, confident filmmakers and Tom Tykwer (\\"Run Lola Run\\") makes a third scriptwriter and director.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a tone poem composed by one man and claimed by another; we see them both. Once we understand that, we can relax and play a game to see who can recognize each actor first. The makeup is brilliant, as a result some actors are really hard to spot! My Academy Award money goes on this gang for Art Direction and Makeup.<br /><br />Here are some of the featured players:<br />  * Tom Hanks (\\"Larry Crowne\\") clearly relishes his chance to be a homicidal thug, an evil doctor, a gentle scientist, a book editor, a rough-hewn tattooed post-apocalyptic primitive, and a hotel clerk, even though it sometimes took a minute to realize that Mr. H was under that amazing makeup.<br />  * Halle Berry (\\"New Year's Eve\\") rarely masks her beauty. The camera loves her no matter which era she is in, with one major exception: her gnarly old Korean man had me completely fooled.<br />  * Jim Broadbent (\\"The Iron Lady\\") brings his comic chops to at least two of his roles: one is an arrogant composer and the other is a dishonest publisher. In four other eras, his makeup and acting were so good it took awhile to figure out who we were watching.<br />  * Hugo Weaving (\\"Captain America\\") seems to be drawn to dastardly roles. No matter in which time period we spot him, he's still someone to avoid...including his Nurse Ratched, at the old folks' home.<br />  * Jim Sturgess (\\"One Day\\") plays seven roles, not six. One of his characters provides the nicest romance....<br />  * Keith David (\\"Highway\\") brings gravitas and stature to all four of his roles.<br />  * David Gyasi (\\"Red Tails\\") plays only three characters, but they are pivotal. One in particular, while a rifle is aimed at him, is almost unbearable.<br />  * Hugh Grant (\\"About a Boy\\") romps through his six reincarnations with great zest. His spooky ghoul had me fooled; I didn't recognize him until he was (deservedly) getting his throat cut!<br />  * Doona Bae (\\"As One\\") brings her porcelain beauty to a key role: a reluctant voice for future generations. She disappears into her other five, playing other races and other ages.<br /><br />This is by no means all the important characters or actors. Suffice it to say, you have to pay attention, but you will be rewarded. To me, the fascinating episode with the cast of Asian look-alike women was the most chilling, although I was suitably incensed by the corporate skulduggery that we could tell had taken place in another one.<br /><br />Expect profanity (Tom Hank's thug!), nudity, blood, racism, gunfire, shocking violence, a wild Star Wars-type ride on a two-seat jet ski that zips through a futuristic sky, swords, knives, tension, some drug use, lots of comedy and a little romance. Whew! Amazon will notify me of the DVD release date.

0062183591|4.0|The (Honest) Truth about Dishonesty<br />By: Dan Ariely<br /><br />As a student in the Carlow University Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics on Forensic Research and Analysis ([...]); the assigned textbook was Dan Ariely's The (Honest) Truth about Dishonesty.  This book proved to pretty interesting, as the author related terminology, techniques, and concepts to true life occurrences.  As a result, it was easy to read and understand.  Additionally, how the book was written the concepts discussed were relatable.  From this book, I have new insights to easy it is for people to cheat and how we tend to rationalize it to fit our own purposes and how cost-benefit comes into play.  I particularly liked the discussion of the Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC), \\"as we all seek our own advantage as we make our way through the world\\" (p. 4), as this is a very true statement and really makes sense to me.<br /><br />Even though the book had much strength and was interesting; however, if I had to consider a weakness, it would be in the area of losing my attention due to redundancy.  Out of all of the topics Ariely presented, it appeared as though he kept mentioning the Fudge factor, which is important, but I found myself getting tired of reading about it.<br /><br />Regardless of the redundancy, this book has provided me with better knowledge base that I will be able to utilize as a professional in the fraud and forensics field.  I now have a much better understanding of how people cheat and how we all rationalize cheating, which will assist me in future investigations.  Overall, I really enjoyed this book and feel that it was a very beneficial read.

B000KC8O3S|5.0|This was the first time I had ever bought a soundtrack focused on the Doctor Who universe – granted there were not that many at the time of this particular release.  However, I was not disappointed.<br />The scores on this CD are marvelous and the use of orchestra was simply amazing.  Murray Gold has shown his brilliance as he composed some of the most electrifying, haunting and emotional music to accompany one of the best shows on television giving Doctor Who new life!<br />My favorite tracks are as follows:<br />3. The Doctor’s Theme<br />6. Father’s Day<br />7. Rose in Peril<br />14. Rose’s Theme<br />16. The Face of Boe<br />17. UNIT<br />18. Seeking The Doctor<br />19. Madame de Pompadour<br />20. Tooth and Claw<br />That is just a few.  I love the whole CD and I think you will too!
B005EHILV4|4.0|I bought the smaller Behringer 302usb mixer for a small home recording setup with a budget target of &#60;$125, but had to move up to this model for and additional cost of about $12 due to the fact that the 302usb doesn't provide adequate phantom power for a Condenser Microphone (not properly disclosed by the company). The simple setup I have also includes the Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Hosa XLR cable.<br /><br />I was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts, interviews, etc., over a simple USB headset, without &#34;breaking the bank&#34;. In addition to the positive reviews on Amazon about most of the Behringer equipment, my son, who has some experience with sound equipment said that Behringer makes solid items, but that I shouldn't expect much in the way of customer service. He's helped me work on tweaking my setup and he finds the items I bought to be quality as expected.<br /><br />I'm glad that I moved up to this board, even though it has a lot of features that I won't personally use. I'm glad that this has two microphone inputs, if I do decided to conduct in person interviews using the board. Besides the extra mic input, my son will likely put some of the additional features to use recording some music with his electric guitar and making some mixes using the features in GarageBand.<br /><br />I have found that my son's warning is somewhat correct, at least in regards to information provided for the customer by the company both in the paperwork included in the package and on the website. Since this is essentially entry level equipment, people like myself, who have little / no direct experience with sound equipment could use a little more guidance in using these projects, particularly in hooking things up to a computer, which is obviously an increasing application.<br /><br />I couldn't find any information on the Behringer website or in the paperwork which provided guidance for a Mac user, for instance. In addition, it would be nice if the manufacturer would give some basic information on such items as use of headphones for monitoring, etc. when using with a computer, but they don't. I've done a lot of experimentation in addition to Googling to figure out how to get things up and run.<br /><br />So far, I'm getting quality recording results from this board. I am currently using it with an RCA type cable with the input to my iMac's line-in. I might ultimately try another adapter for a USB connection or Firewire, but I haven't had the opportunity to research what is possible or which of the three options provide better sound. Whether I not I investigate will depend upon my needs in the future.<br /><br />I believe I got excellent value in the equipment quality. I would give 5 stars, but the manufacturer should provide more information.
B00004STPT|5.0|After watching the movie, I had to own a copy of the Gladiator Soundtrack.  The music on this CD is wonderful and awe inspiring.  Several tracks, “The Battle” and the “Barbarian Horde” are exhilarating and will pull you into the battles from the movie.  And then you move into the more beautiful, heart-rending music of “The Wheat” and “Elysium.”<br />Both Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard did an excellent job composing and arranging this CD.  If you enjoy soundtracks, heartfelt and epic music, then this is a CD for you!
B000J5XS3C|3.0|Behringer makes quality products - I purchased the excellent C-1 Condenser Microphone, and replaced the 302usb with the Xenyx 802 mixer board.<br /><br />When I researched items for a simple home recording setup, I saw all of the positive reviews for this smaller mixer, and read the item description here on Amazon and the Behringer website for the C-1 mic included what turned out to be a misleading statement about how it would work with any of the Behringer phantom-powered mixer boards.<br /><br />That was incorrect information - this board receives power only via USB and doesn't provide adequate phantom power for condenser mics (48v).<br /><br />When I setup the return of this board to Amazon, I informed of the error, and the appear to have acted very promptly on it, as the item description for the C-1 on both websites now includes an explicit statement about the need for 48 volts.<br /><br />Although this correction is good, it would be more helpful to customers if Behringer would also correct the description about this board associated with its wording about its phantom power capabilities to state what kinds of mics it will adequately power.<br /><br />I've noticed in other venues (i.e. musician and sound forums) Behringer gets a bad rap. I don't think its due to poor quality equipment, I think its due to frustration about a lack of information provided to customers both before and after the sale. Neither the Behringer website nor the included documentation with the items I bought is adequate for customers like myself who are not sound experts.
0385233132|5.0|I have been an avid fan of Asimov’s since I was a teenager.  I have read everything the man ever wrote, sometimes three or four times.  He has a way of creating such colorful and realistic characters, organizations, and even future technology.  Asimov had a talent for taking real world problems of the time and placing them on a grand scale thousands of years into the future.  What I loved about this book was getting to know more about the beloved character of Hari Seldon and his creation of Psychohistory.  I think anyone who enjoys Asimov or science fiction will enjoy this book!

B000EPR7NE|5.0|After watching the Da Vinci Code I knew I had to have the soundtrack!  The scores were wonderful, the choruses spine-tingling.  I don’t know how to put the emotions the tracks on the CD pulled from within me.  Sometimes I could feel the tug of tears, especially when listening to Chevaliers De Sangreal, and the heart rendering harps, cellos and violas that seemed to place me in a different time with grand open spaces and stirring mystical mysteries all around!  The soundtrack is just great and I wish I was better at explaining why!

B000009DUY|5.0|I have always enjoyed works done by John Williams and this CD was no exception.  Filled with the most peaceful scores ever produced by John Williams, I can find myself relaxing to this CD – if it doesn’t cause me to remember the scenes they are attached too in the movie.  To give you an example the main score of the soundtrack, &#34;Hymn to the Fallen&#34; starts with quiet drums of war in the background, before the choir joins the music, making it a track that takes you back to the beaches at Normandy, and all the men that fell taking those beaches.  Overall, this is a great soundtrack.
B000SW2F6M|4.0|Somewhat predictable and a touch corny, but I'm glad I didn't hate Orlando Bloom throughout this, lol.  Was hoping for more hand-to-hand action rather than siege combat, but this was a fine Crusade-era flick.  Riled up the Medieval in me. :-)

B003TSEEDY|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky touches on the awkwardness of starting a new year at high school while creating new experiences, friends, and lessons. The style that the book is written really grasped my attention. It is extremely unique as you follow the main character through his life while he writes to an anonymous person everyday through a letter. Although it may seem all cheerful and exciting, there is a rather dark side to the book which took me by suprise. The main character, Charlie, goes through a life changing experience as a young boy which does not allow him to be the normal teenage boy that he wants to be.  A wallflower is defined as someone \\"who see's things and understands\\". The story takes you through Charlie's life as a freshmen boy following the steps of his crazy senior friends. Things begin to unravel as he tries to spend his last moment with his senior friends before saying goodbye as they make their way to college. This is where I believe the book really came together. The images that are perceived in the novel really allowed me to connect with the characters.The Perks of Being a Wallflower takes you on an emotional ride with Charlie, making you to think deeper of the purpose of his letters, feelings, and choices throughout his first year of high school. I recommend this book to any spectrum of people because it touches on so many emotions. I guarantee this book will make you think deeper into the meaning of life, and somehow move you.

B005WUHAX8|3.0|I bought the pink Lifeproof Case for my wife's iPhone 4s.  Initially we were very happy with it.  Ruggedness and waterproof together in a slim design?  Great.  However, here are the issues that developed over time:<br /><br />1. Screen bubble.  As the case screen is not attached to the screen of the iPhone itself, air bubbles constantly formed beneath the screen.  When reading through user forums, it seems to be a common issue and I constantly reopened and resealed the case to make it go away.  But it always came back after a short time.<br /><br />2. The volume/mute switch.  This actually TORE OFF.  Keep in mind that we rarely took the phone off of mute because of a sleeping baby.  But this actually came off for some reason.<br /><br />3. The charging port.  Only the actual Apple power cord fits through the hole through the case.  Not TOO big of a deal since I have it ... but that means that none of my cheap generic cables will work.<br /><br />4. The cover over the charging port cracked for some unknown reason.  Perhaps my wife dropped it?  But I don't know how it would hit the cover, when it should only have hit the rubberized edges.  Cheap plastic probably.<br /><br />5. The headset jack cover is very easy to lose.<br /><br />For such an expensive case ($80-$90) when it first was released, I truly expected this case to last at least two years.  But it barely reached one and turned into junk.  Buyers be warned.  I could have just spend almost the same amount on AppleCare and bought a cheap case instead. =)
B009O07NDY|3.0|The music for \\"The Hobbit\\" is far from being \\"as spectacular and epic\\" as the one from the previous trilogy. How could it be? The adventures of this new trilogy precede the adventures of \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\". Everything that happens in this new film and the two sequels to follow is setting in place the final and conclusive events of the old trilogy. Therefore, the music cannot be as grandiloquent. It wouldn't make any sense, music-wise. Plus, in terms of originality, you will not necessarily be satisfied. Again, that is only logic. Tolkien put a lot of emphasis on the locations in which his characters were moving about. So is Peter Jackson. In the first trilogy, Howard Shore composed various and magnificent melodies for those locations. Since we are returning to those same locations (more or less), and since we are witnessing events that are shaping what's to come, it makes perfect sense to have variations in a less \\"epic\\" form of already known melodies. And some of the old characters are still there, in this new set of films, in their younger incarnation. Therefore, the music cannot be that different and certainly, it cannot be more \\"bombastic\\" for lack of a better adjective.  So you are left with a score that is, of course, beautiful and lyrical. But mostly, it is a variation of already known melodies in a lesser form. Less pompous. Less overblown. But it still offers a true identity that sets it apart. Especially in the form of \\"Misty Mountains\\", a mesmerizing piece of music that has that epic, yet retained or taciturn, quality. A perfect springboard to the main themes of \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\".

0062183591|4.0|I came to read this book as it was a requirement for a course I'm taking at Carlow University. I am enrolled in the Carlow University Master's of Fraud and Forensics course on Forensic Research and Analysis. The full program details can be found here:[...].<br />Funny enough, earlier courses I had touched on short sections of this book and I was intrigued to learn more about Ariely's studies on my own. Luckily it turned in to a requirement which was kind of an happy accident.<br />Ariely takes you on an enjoyable journey into the topic of \\"why we lie\\".  Ariely's writing, much like his TED talks or interviews, is very engaging. He has a way of capturing your attention, and before you realize it, you have learned some interesting things while also enjoying a good read.<br />This book will change how you view lying and cheating. It shows you that there is always a certain degree that all people are willing to cheat, but that there is some imaginary line that we will just not allow ourselves to cross. An interesting point found by Ariely is that all groups, across the world seem to cheat to the same degree. Each group thinks that they cheat more than others, but this is not so.<br />Another fun fact that Ariely points out is that our propensity to cheat does not rise with the potential gains. We actually seem to cheat less when the stakes are higher. This is explained as the result of fear in that as the amount we stand to gain increases so does the chance that your illicit activities will be noticed.<br />Ariely does an awesome job of connecting with the reader, but I do think that he can be a little long winded. He relied upon the findings of a few studies and kept referring back to them over and over again. I would have liked to have seen him parallel his findings with those of other social scientists. If he could have expanded and utilized larger samples, perhaps had several colleagues repeating his experiments at different colleges in order to compare the results to see how they matched up. To be able to prove some connection that could show that the findings were truly universal, that would have been very interesting.<br />I could see some aspects of Ariely's work making their way in to my professional skills. In fraud and forensics, you can often be just as hard pressed to prove the why behind the crime as the how. Sometimes you have billionaires being caught committing fraud to save or acquire a few hundred thousand dollars. What motivates them to risk their freedom, or their reputation to commit such acts?<br /><br />Mike Shobened up. To be able to prove some connection that could show that the findings were truly universal, that would have been very interesting.  I could see some aspects of Ariely's work making their way in to my professional skills. In fraud and forensics, you can often be just as hard pressed to prove the why behind the crime as the how. Sometimes you have billionaires being caught committing fraud to save or acquire a few hundred thousand dollars. What motivates them to risk their freedom, or their reputation to commit such acts?

1451626657|5.0|Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is a novel unlike any other. It makes the reader think, it makes the reader laugh, and when it is all said and done Catch-22 gives the reader a great World War II novel that is told through some of the most unlikely soldiers.<br /> One of the main attractions to the novel is its comical tone. Comedy is found all throughout the book ranging from Yossarian's unorthodox ways of getting himself out combat duty to Nately's struggles to make a prostitute love him. Also the story is told in a unique circular way which constantly parallels the overall theme of explaining the purpose of what \\"Catch-22\\" means.<br /> If there is a fault in the book it is the slow development of the story. The chapters only give the reader a small taste of what the overall story is about and the storyline doesn't start forming until about halfway through the book. While this might deter some readers it can also create an incentive for the others to continue on and finish the story. Heller in a way makes his novel a puzzle that doesn't become completed until the very last chapter. The chapters in his novel could probably be read in any order (with the exception of the last chapter) and still make as much sense as if it was read the way it is printed.<br /> Catch-22 is a truly unique novel that will appeal to any reader as well as those interested in World War II literature. While the slow and confusing development of the story is its only glaring let down is also has an appeal that almost forces the reader to continue on with the novel so that all the confusion and loose ends can be cleared away by the time the last chapter is finished. The comical scenes as well as the ingenious elaboration behind the meaning of \\"Catch-22\\" and how it applies throughout the novel will entertain readers for years and years. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 will remain on book shelves for years to come and is a literary work of art that shall never be overlooked.
0525953728|5.0|Easy reading and very  interesting.  Shows how the Navy Seals are dedicated, additionally the many hours of training and strenuous exercises are required to stay in top physical condition.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|Criterion doesn't just sell movies! They just add art in making a film DVD/Blu-ray. All their products are designed with extreme research and care. The extra dvd would have a hell-stuff for movie buffs!
B004XGN8W4|4.0|Does not fit older ps3 well without adding larger Velcro straps but still a good buy. Makes travel as a gamer so much easier especially if you staying In a hotel and don't want to bother to hook up to their cheap tv's.
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|I am just getting to know Bruno and I am pleasantly surprised with this album.  He has a very nice voice and the songs are well written. I look forward to his next effort as well as going back and checking out his earlier work.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is the bomb. It is so just awesome to read. People should read this book. Just read it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Once you play it you would never want to stop! I think it is the best app I ever gotten.
0525953728|5.0|Very happy with purchase
B007RQ6WCA|5.0|This app is so cool.  No more emailing your documents to another computer or need a flash drive.  This app makes everything so easy.  When you have multiple computers and tablets this is the app you will need.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book it's the first romance one I have read in a long time and I loved every page!! I give it a 5 star rating because one minute it had you in suspense and the next it was romantic!!! A must read for all who loves romance!!!
B00A77II0U|4.0|Overall a captivating game. Not as challenging as some and a little choppy and broken up going from one view to another. However, I enjoyed playing it. Nice story line...with a dark twist.
B008602KQI|5.0|Awesome movie!!!  I highly recommend it!!  I saw the movie in the theater and I've got the DVD.  Jennifer Lawrence kicks ASS!!
1419707671|4.0|The book set arrived in great shape, clear plastic wrap kept them together.  Great price for set of 3 hardback books!
B007SGM084|5.0|I heard all the rants and raves about this book and thought 'there's no way it could be that good', I was soo wrong! I admit, I didn't like Christian at first, but boy did that change! I couldn't get enough of this book!!!!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is a really good cd.  The songs take me to a wonderful place in my mind and make me feel reall great.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I watched the movie before reading the books. Several months after watching the movie I decided to read the books, and as always the books were far better than the movie! Loved it!
B007I2BZIE|2.0|What else can I say?  As a life long Rush fan, I have often bought their work without hearing a single song in advance.  I won't make that mistake again.
B00633W614|5.0|read the first in the series and had to get the 2nd one.  Can't wait for the 3rd to come ouw
B005PK553C|5.0|Excellent now for filler words that mean nothing and will not mean nothing and I am done w/ the fill.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Nice tie in to Alien, even with a couple of lost pieces of the puzzle. Lots of action sequences, aliens, and energy. Not recommended for young children.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I borrowed the book from my local library after hearing so many of my friends raving about how good the book was. I'm glad I didn't bother to purchase it. I've seen my 4th grader write better story lines than this book. Character development is nil, unless you count the \\"inner goddess.\\" I gave it 2 stars for a couple reasons. One, the concept is sound, but I sincerely wish the idea had come to a better author. Two, I have read worse, believe it or not. I believe that I only finished it because my brain was convinced that at SOME point, it would get better. It didn't. I seriously doubt that I'll be getting the second book, just because I'm believing the reviews that it isn't written any better.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|What I love about the Lee Child mysteries - every single one has been a great  trip into another world.  This book is no exception.  Child's attention to detail put me as a reader right into the action.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This was one of the first free games that my daughter got for her kindle fire and mom even enjoys it - easy and fun and addicting - can't put it down...
B002V9PEUE|5.0|If you want to see what Blu-Ray should look like on all films then watch this movie. The picture is incredible. The clarity & the color are just beautiful. There is hardly any grain. Inside the cave was not as good as the rest of the movie but we are only talking about a couple of minutes out of a two hour movie. I can live with that. Someone took the time to make this a really enjoyable movie to watch. Thank you for doing this in 2:40:1 aspect ratio & not that damn 1:85:1. You are able to see more of the film this way & the panoramic views are just gorgeous. It would have been a totally different film in 1:85:1 & not for the better. I can only say the sound in stereo is really good. I have no fancy audio capabilities, just an old fashioned stereo system. I can't believe this movie cost only $6.00. For those of you wanting to see what Blu-Ray should really look like, get this. Even if you don't like the movie or Sly, get it just to see the beautiful scenery. You feel as if you are right there. Can't say enough good about the transfer. This has some decent features too. What are you waiting for ??? Go get this !!!!
B005D63ICI|3.0|I'm a Dexteroni.  A big dexter fan but this season was weak.  It didn't evoke the emotions of Dexter's of the past and the Dexters of the future.  As usually Dexter has his moments but they seem to be in fewer and fewer episodes.
1780891261|5.0|I couldn't put the books down, finished all three within 2 weeks.  I have receommended the books to several friends.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I can't explain how good this show is.  The plot line is great and has room for all viewers to relate (except for kids).  Not a show for kids.  This is different than the scary prison show with kids.  Definitely not the same thing.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My kid loved the bag, he carries all of his Star Wars, as well as his Thomas the Train. A must have
B005DN7W4G|4.0|A story well done, with good special effects. Characters are believable and given enough depth to carry the plot through to the end.
B009O36EO0|5.0|this girl has an amazing voice...i first discovered her on youtube looking for some new music and a new artist that i haven't heard of before, and i found it in Loreen.  you NEED to purchase this incredible album, you won't regret it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I already own the blue-ray copy of it, but theirs nothing like 3d.  It gives you a different view of an excellent movie

B005CRQ3NY|5.0|As with the rest of the wimpy kid books, this one had me, my 8 year old son and nine year old daughter laughing all the way the last page. We have read through book 5 and it has become a nightly routine for us. It has given my children, especially my son, a newfound interest in reading and we all look forward to the next book.
B000267JQK|5.0|Awesome cd I really love Seether and this cd is a good one. Package came early and in good shape. Great price. Thanks again
B0067DBHBU|4.0|I can't really say I have disliked any of Daughtry's songs.  As with their last album, this one rocks!  Definitely recommended.

B000GCFO08|5.0|If you like freakie stuff and getting the something or another scared out of ya this one can do it. I am a Silent Hill fan For life. Dvd came early and at a great price. Thanks again
1451695195|4.0|A well written, matter of fact presentation of the author's experience of the afterlife and his own background as a family man and neurosurgeon who had pretty much dismissed the idea of heaven as simply a comforting idea we have. He says heaven is in fact far more real than the life we lead now.
B00009V7RF|4.0|This is one of my favorites from the Peas. CD came on time and in great shape as described. Really great price too!!  Thanks
B004CURZFC|5.0|My husband and I loved it. The artwork is beautiful. We had just rented it and decided that we will get the DVD in the future so we can watch it over and over.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|A classic heart warming story that never gets old or tired. Always a pleasure to read each Christmas season and to remind to help our fellow man.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|26 stars!<br /><br />Two Graves by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child (Pendergast #12)<br />5 stars<br /><br />I have yet to be disappointed in a Pendergast series novel. Every one is so exceptional, so incredible, so \\"beyond.\\" The most recent three (\\"Fever Dreams,\\" \\"Cold Vengeance,\\" now \\"Two Graves\\") are even above and beyond the peak reached, in my humble and outspoken opinion, in \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\" and \\"Still Life with Crows.\\"<br /><br />I hesitate to say too much about the plotlines, so I will just add that \\"Two Graves\\" marks the unfolding of the plots that thickened \\"Fever Dreams\\" and \\"Cold Vengeance\\": Pendergast's wife Helen Esterhazy Pendergast, and her untold secrets, Der Bund, and Pendergast's continuing entrapment with Helen's memory. Indeed, so much new and amazing occurs in this book that my jaw remained dropped pretty much the entire time.<br /><br />I continue to be utterly amazed, not just at the excellently written novels, but at the incredible imagination possessed by authors Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. As always, I hope and pray the series continues; I can't imagine a world without Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast.<br /><br />I'm reviewing a Library copy.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I got this collection for 20 bucks Black Friday. That is a deal that I could not pass up. Great deal.
030716327X|5.0|I bought this book for my future grandchild (due in May 2013) - as it is a &#34;must have&#34; for all babies!<br />My daughter and son-in-law are already reading it to the baby:)
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Very entertaining... reminds me of original Mario brothers. Challenging enough to be fun for adults. Would recommend especially while it's free
B005S0HNU2|4.0|This show is awesome! The DVD is great and is in really good condition. This definitely meets my expectations. I'm enjoying watching it! Such  great story lines and characters!
B004QX07G4|4.0|I love her she is brilliant. The biggest heart ever. She can make you laugh even though a book. You have to read.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Very funny video.  Even my husband enjoyed it.  We watched it twice the very first night and I am sure we will be sharing it with friends.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Some of the visuals were good but the story was lacking and the dwarves were unremarkable!  Kirsten Stewart spends the movie looking like she is going to vomit, like she does in all her movies.
0307887448|5.0|I hadn't really heard about this book before but bought it based on the good reviews.  I'm surprised it didn't get 5 stars.  I was very presently surprised that I found this gem.  If you are a sci-fi guy and are around 40 years old, this is really a must read.  It has so many references to a teenager's life in the 1980's as well as many other sci-fi and fantasy references.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Man, I loved this movie! Lincoln has never came across as a bad-a** before, and now I have a whole new respect for Honest Abe. Seriously, I am not a fan of fantasy, but I absolutely loved this movie. Get past your preconceived ideas of what the title may conjure in your mind and pop a bowl of popcorn and just disappear into another world. LOVED IT!
1603420398|5.0|I love this book and its so easy to read and the items are easy to make, have told others this is a must have book
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Her voice is haunting. Its dark and beautiful. Like a black iris. She is miles from the current pop mold. Lana is here to stay!
B000W9DSVW|5.0|I already own Ocean's 12 on DVD, but I wanted to get the set on Blu-ray and I scored a great price around Black Friday.  This movie is a must see for Brad Pitt / George Clooney fans.  The supporting cast is packed with faces/names you'll recognize.  Classic set!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was on the love side.  This book is on my top 10 list.  It was messy, emotional and loving.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Pixar has done it again.  Great price.  I bought this on the week of Black Friday.  Its a great movie about family (and not taking each other for granted).
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked this book, I read it after a couple of heavy books and enjoyed it.  It was different and better then expected.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Performs as expected, my previous platform was an Athlon 64x2 @2.6ghz and this was a nice and day difference.<br />Multitasking is great, you can turn off cores 2,4,6,8 in the bios if you want to run it as a quadcore to save power.<br />For the price you cannot get better than this, intel has better claimed performance but for daily activities you will be hard pressed to see any major difference. CPU fan makes some noise when it get pretty hot, so you might opt to buy an aftermarket cooler.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I enjoyed this book. Maybe not as gripping as some of Mr. Flynn's stories, but a good read nonetheless. However, this is the last time i will buy an electronic/Kindle edition of this author. I don't believe it is too much to ask for a book that doesn't have missing words or typos every few pages, after spending $15 on something with a high profit margin for the publisher. This particular e-book was great in that regard compared to the last two Flynn's publisher released - I actually called to complain and was hoping for an address so I could volunteer to proofread Mr. Flynn's e-books before release - they were RIFE with typos and errors - so whoever is supposed to be performing that particular function CAN'T READ! It's annoying as hell! Demille, Lehane, Clancy, Thor - they can all put stuff out virtually error-free (especially Demille who asks readers to notify him if they find a mistake) so what's up with Simon Schuster/Atria? I typically buy both a printed and e-copy of my favorite authors, but I will not continue buying an inferior product - it is like giving them permission to screw you. Reciprocity is the essence of respect and this publisher does not respect their customers.
1451629184|5.0|I just wish this book had not had to be written. Jaycee is an amazing person. I hope her story helps others, and am sure it will.
B003UESJHO|5.0|I had been attracted by an ad on the DVD cover that a critic praised it as \\"Rocky + The Blind Side\\". I think it's much better than that. First, the director had filmed it in a relatively realistic and daily life style. Second, the cast as a whole gave a far superb performance. The family members, the drug addict neighbours and simply everybody with more than 10 seconds of acting were so into it. Rather than a boxing movie that branched into family and love matters, it's a movie about family and relationships flavored by boxing and the true story it based on. I am obliged to praise that the director had done his job so well. Actually the boxing scenes were at most average. Yet, for those who enjoy a movie for what it is, highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|luv the game so much fun. it is sooooo addicting and i play it so much. best and most fun game i have
B005KELW26|2.0|I ordered the cover specific for my new Kindle fire but too small.  Amazon allowed me to keep even though it did not fit.  I just paid S&H.  Do not know what I am gonna use it for but have it.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|I did not use all of the features as they are somewhat complicated.  Instructions were printed in such a small font that I could not read them.  Unit worked OK.
B005LAII12|1.0|I love Seth's tv shows. I thought this movie would be pretty great considering the premise and Seth's involvement. His voice alone is hilarious. However this movie isn't very funny and if you're a young man thinking oo it's unrated nudity! no... not the case. It was very lacking. not worth the 3 dollars I spent renting it. I laughed a bit but overall I spent a lot of time trying to care about the characters which is not something I wanted to do. It was supposed to be stupid funny but they tried to make it stupid funny and also give it a good plot but... it just sucked.
0786955570|3.0|I have to say that I really didn't enjoy this game as much as I thought I would. My 21 year old daughter and I gave up just before the second adventure was completed. We found the rules, cards and counters too fiddly and the game play too complicated to run smoothly. We were constantly forgetting the order of play and losing track of all of the conditional rules on the cards, tokens and adventure scenarios. We'd realize too late that we had forgotten to play a certain card, move a counter or modify a die role and we ran into questions that the rules could not clarify. I agree with some reviewers who feel that the game punishes you for exploring and for staying in one place. Those encounter cards were more fearsome than the monsters! We eventually got weary of being beaten as we made our way through the castle which lacked the atmosphere of our beloved HeroQuest.<br /><br />In retrospect , I don't think the cooperative nature of the game really suits the dungeon crawl experience as you have to constantly alternate between your character and the evil things that attack it. I like the idea of cooperative games (Forbidden Island is a favorite), but a dungeon crawl typically has aspects of roleplaying where your character becomes your alter ego in the fantasy world. I found it hard to constantly switch gears and assume the role of a ghoul or a gargoyle who attacks my character or a fellow adventurer, even though the monster's tactics are clearly spelled out. I think these types of games work best with a GM, whether evil, benevolent or somewhere in between. This aspect of Ravenloft actually made it seem like the game was playing itself at times.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is a work of art to say the least. Heart wrenching, memorable. A story that will stay with me always..
0321885112|5.0|I've been following Mike's work online for several years and have been looking forward to his book. I'm so glad I opted for the print version over the ebook. This is one of the most beautiful books that I've every seen. There are full page illustrated spreads, hand drawn headlines, and I think he even went so far as to create his own fonts for the book. The attention to detail is impressive.<br /><br />Apart from the visual presentation the book does a great job of breaking down the note taking process and walking the reader through step by step. There are several artists/note takes featured in the book who also explain their style and take on sketchnotes. It was cool to see the different styles and approaches.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Nelson DeMille should be read every chance you get!  Well written with lots of twists in the plot.  Having lived on LI for 25 years, the places are real and the general geography correct.  Plum Island does exist and is in fact a government restricted area, so one really does wonder about what takes place on the island.  Demille's story consequently is very plausable. Put up your feet and enjoy this stunner!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow.  I had a hard time putting the dang book down!  I read mostly non-fiction, so this was fun for a change.
B008NW67E0|5.0|shipped very quickly, and it was part of my moms retirement gift... she was so surprised when she opened the package!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really liked the whole trilogy.  I have read other reviews about poor writing and too much sex.....but I liked the story line.  I was captivated by what made Christian tick.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|it's been a few months since i started using this and the 1st battery is doing great. i'm very satisfied with it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I liked the book.  Lost myself in it.  But I found myself wanting to know more about Christian's early beginnings instead another sex scene...lol
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was entertaining.<br />Quite interesting. There were parts that you have read in other books but little things here and there made it different
B0039TAHMA|5.0|I watched this movie in preparation for the Hobbit that is soon to release. It's still a good movie even though it has been a long time since I watched it. Great movie that last. I even saw some parts I didn't remember that made it feel kind of new.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I think that this was a fairly good movie. All othe the characters were entertaining and the plot was quick paced. I enjoyed watching the lead character develop.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|This movie takes a large amount of concentration to keep up. I like those kind of movies. I could kinda guess at a point when certain things were happening. Overall an eventful and entertaining movie.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|This is a fun bubble shooter type game. The graphics are good, and I like the added twist of having special items you can drop to help progress.<br /><br />There are a few drawbacks though that make it hard for me to love this game.  The biggest problem is that at the end of every game it automatically sends your high score to the global high score list.  This process takes a very long time - I timed it at 42 seconds once - and there doesn't seem to be any way to skip it and there is no option to shut this process off.  In fact, there are no options at all aside from a button to mute the sounds.  The other thing that I don't like is that every time I make a match the phone vibrates.  My phone happens to buzz when it vibrates, so even with the sound muted I still can't play the game silently.  I tend to play in 'quiet' places where I don't want to disturb others, and this makes that difficult. And again, no options to allow me to shut that off.<br /><br />Overall a good game, but not good enough for me to put up with the drawbacks.  I will probably uninstall.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I laughed hysterically during this movie. There are so many funny parts. There is a good message behind it too. Classic Pixar kind of movie.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I do not consider an item to be free when each replay requires maneuvering around someone's advertisement. Three more words.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book is very sad but I love it! Lemony Snickett is talented and the ending begs me to by the next book
B002VECM6S|3.0|I love the movie the first time I saw it ,  but the DVD was a little fuzzy but otherwise it was what I expected
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Yeah, this book is funny but it's much too short. I read it in less than 30 whole minutes. Really?
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I really enjoy playing these types of games & was pleased to see this as the FAOTD.<br />Although Magic Academy: Hidden Castle may not be the best HOG out there, it certainly isn't the worst, either.<br /><br />This game contains a little bit of everything from hidden objects to mini puzzles; all of which I didn't find any to be too difficult or even, too easy. The poor English can be a little distracting, but otherwise, I'm enjoying the beautiful graphics & fairly easy, relaxed game play on my Kindle HD 8.9\\" tablet.<br /><br />If you enjoy this type of game genre, Magic Academy will be worth today's FREE download for you. I'd be willing to pay .99¢&hellip;but not anything over a $1.99. Snag this one today!
B000FBFML6|5.0|I'm a huge Robin Hobb fan and if you've liked any of her work then this continues to carry on her legacy of amazing and masterfull work. Amazing details and plot lines, just a great overall book.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|So happy I finally got my copy of the Dark Knight Rises. Shipping was fast, no damage, perfect condition. What else do you need to think about?
B000T433CO|5.0|I have owned this movie for four years now.  I love a great love movie and this is not only that, but also a wonderful Christmas story.  It softens hearts and warms them at the same time.  I recommend it to everyone.  I watch it at least three to four times during Christmas time.
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|One star better than Sylvester Stallone and The Expendables, I'll say that.  But, it's close.  Seriously, just don't watch this movie.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This was fabulous... can't wait for the next season now!  Great value with the two seasons included with the same product.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|After viewing this video you will not only question the food going into your mouth but what are government isn't telling us and why.
141659521X|4.0|I have read every one of Vince Flynn's novels and have loved each one.  However, I was just a little disappointed in this last one, &#34;The Last Man&#34;.  Didn't live up to my expectations of Mr. Flynn this time.  Too much like the other novels and getting a little tired of the same thing. Lots of characters to keep up with and had to keep looking back to determine who was who.  However, don't get me wrong...I still enjoyed it immensely and would certainly recommend it.
034580404X|5.0|I jumped on the wagon And decided to see what the hype was all about. I am so glad I did!!! I couldn't put it down.
B0053O89JM|4.0|Purchased this as a gift.  I have watched all of the seasons of House M.D. so of course wanted to see the final season.  Hope my grandson will let me watch it too!!

1419707663|5.0|This was a birthday present for him, he is really enjoying the series and always eager to read new chapters
0307352145|4.0|This is a book to be read in solitude, thoughtfully. There are many good, useful ideas; there are references galore for further reading. I really like the way that the author highlights the strengths and weaknesses of both extroverts and introverts and shows how each personality style can complement the other. Introvers in particular will find strategies for successful working and living without having to be inauthentic.<br /><br />Perhaps the most concrete part of the book for those seeking advice was the last section on dealing with introverted children, both for parents and for teachers.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0307346617|4.0|This was actually a really cool read that I would recommend to any zombie genre enthusiast looking for some insightful information on how a zombie apocalypse could possibly wipe out the human population.  One of the biggest criticisms that the zombie genre comes into is that the United States military would easily be able to combat the zombie hordes, but this book gives some insight as to why that line of thinking is ridiculous.  One example is that one of the &#34;survivors&#34; is detailing an account of his first interaction fighting the zombies and how he had been trained since boot camp to aim center mass of the target and not right between the eyes.  This line of training made it difficult for the grunts to get accustomed to aiming for head shots.<br /><br />This book also really makes you think about other things such as how people have become so accustomed to modern day living that when the zombies attack and more or less send the Earth back into the Stone Age, many people simply are not ready for this type of living.  A really good example of this is from a Wisconsin family who didn't know how to survive in the wild and a Japanese twenty-something who had been accustomed to simply sitting in front of a computer for most of his life.<br /><br />Many of these stories will really have you on the edge of your seat turning page after page wondering what's going to happen next.  One of these stories is in the beginning of the book when a little girl and her family take refuge in a church and what happens when that church got overrun by zombies.  There are multiple stories in this book that take you all over the globe and seeing how different nationals of different countries handled the outbreak and how the different militaries responded to the outbreak.<br /><br />For the most part, I loved this book.  My only bone of contention with this book is the way it is written.  Some people may disagree with me on this and that's fine, but I was not crazy about the fact that the book jumps around the world talking to different survivors at different times.  In other words, the book is a collection of stories from around the world.  I think it would have been better written if it was a continuous story focusing on either one person or a small group of people so that the book's not jumping all over the place.  Then again, it probably was more of a diverse collection of tales by jumping all over the world telling the different stories.  Many of the stories do reference one another, though, which is pretty cool.  Also, this book does talk about where the outbreak started, but like most other movies or books in the zombie genre, this book does not point out exactly how the outbreak started.  It makes references to human rabies, but nothing is confirmed.<br /><br />In summary, this is a cool book with some insightful views into a zombie outbreak/apocalypse.  Most of the stories are typically no more than a dozen pages, so it makes for an easier read as you can pick up and leave off from a new story rather than leave off in the middle of a story (at least that was my case as I was only able to read at 30 minute clips on the train).  Rather you're simply a fan of the zombie genre or you believe something like this could actually happen, it's a pretty good book that will make you think about survival preparation in a new way.  I hope this helps!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I haven't watched the whole season but the first few episodes were wonderful! The acting was superb. It is very realistic.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I love this book. It is well written, and captured my attention immediately.  Dr. Alexander's experience was amazing, comforting, and brings to us a message of love and hope.  I respect his courage in coming forward with his journey.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|like most of the viewing public, I jumped on the George rr Martin bandwagon because of game of thrones which I fell in love with.  the style of writing, I found to be somewhat unorthodox seeing through the different characters eyes in way chapter but have accustomed myself to the style.  this particular style lends itself to higher book sales for the voracious readerr because it makes one want to read the stories continuously.  interestingly enough, I found them to be just ad entertaining when read out of sequence and doubled my pleasure by starting over from the first book ad I did the outlanderr series

B00AHSINKO|3.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones do the heavy lifting and make the movie entertaining. They are excellent actors! They promote a rather boring, uncomfortable story line to 3-stars for me. This has little excitement, not much drama and perhaps some can relate to the circumstances; but I don't. Many of the named supporting actors in the cast are also accomplished and skillful but the story is predictable and shallow. This is not the worst movie on the circuit, but is definitely one of the dullest for its way of handling of adult themes and a failed marriage!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is lighter than another bag that I have that is the same size.  I seems to be manufatured well.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|When I read about this book I just knew I had to have it, and it didn't disappoint! Don't care for Stephen King?? Don't worry, you'll still love it! I've always known Stephen King is a great author, I'm just not a big enough fan to pay for his books, but this one is well worth the money. Great for lovers of historical fiction, JFK assassination nuts, and fans time travel.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent story, one that is amazingly complex and intelligent yet written in a way that would appeal to every age
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not a fantasy/science fiction fan. In fact, I normally hate science fiction. But WOOL was different. Granted, Part One only left me confused. Part Two added meaning, and from there, there was no putting down the book.<br /><br />The setting is a surrealistic post-modern society living in underground silos. Each silo is separate and unknown to the other silos, except for the few privileged who know the truth of their existence. Anyone suspected of knowing or wanting to know is sent to \\"cleaning\\" the lenses outside the silo that project an image of the outside world onto a screen inside the silo. Cleaning is tantamount to a death penalty since the air outside is so polluted that an immediate death seizes those sent out.<br /><br />It is a story of survival and the struggle between good and bad, right and wrong. Who will survive and who will be destroyed? The suspense goes on till the very end.<br /><br />There were a few spots where the story dragged with too many details, and the fighting of the insurgents was boring to me, but all in all, this was a great read.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I am rating it this cause it is a good movie and I loved it I first saw it last summer at Virginia Beach
B007IXWKUK|4.0|A little too much sex but the plot thickens.  Some may look at this trilogy as pornography and it may go down as that.  I just hope it doesn't set the stage for a lot of deviant behavior.  Look beyond the sex and it's a good read.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I loved the game and I loved the movie as well Halo is my favorite video game of all time
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think all three books are well written as most of the content revolves around sex which I think would be very difficult to write about without making it a sickening porno book.  The author gets the point across how much these two people love each other, how much they want to please each other which brings the sex into the proper context.  I couldn't wait to read the third book to see how their lives turned out.  I was very happy with the ending.  Ummm, maybe a little too much sex?....
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It kept me rooting for the bad boy the whole time!! Couldn't put it down! Great love battle story! Very captivating!

B009GIPDQS|5.0|Extremely captivating......from beginning to end. The author keeps improving with every new book. Can't wait for his next masterpiece yet.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|I saw the first 4 episodes and can't wait to see the rest of the season and looking forward to buying the second and third...<br />Highly recommend!<br /><br />Side note:  I would give this show five stars but the only problem I have is that there is no way someone with bi-polar could ever be able to get a job in the CIA.  I have relatives with this disease and it's just not realistic.  It just would never happen.  But it's just a TV show and I am looking past that and enjoying the show and the actors.  I heard that her bi-polar disease is getting somewhat irritating in this past season.  SNL did a hilarious parody of the show.
386521584X|5.0|There are photo books that can be interesting to readers when browsing through them the first time, then set aside as a forgotten coffee table book, almost pristine after sitting there for years with only the occasional visitor thumbing through the pages. But there is the occasional photo book that stands above many others in the way that it changed the way that photographers looked through their own viewfinders, and the manner in which many Americans saw themselves.<br /><br />Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank's [[ASIN:386521584X The Americans]] is such a book, and one that offered a different look at America when it was first published in 1959. It was not a popular photo book when it was first released; in fact its reception was largely negative. Many rejected the book as being a pessimistic work, any yes, thumbing through this title for the first time, the reader will perhaps find the images portraying fear, aloneness, anger and despair to be quite a negative view of America and the people encountered by photographer Frank. But go a few more pages and it becomes a hard one to put down.<br /><br />Frank came to the U.S. from Switzerland in 1947, at age 22. Trained in photography, he sharpened his skills working as a commercial photographer, but disliked the work; it was a way to make a living. He spent his off time off wandering the streets of New York City and photographing what he encountered. His noncommercial work began to get noticed, and in 1954, he applied for a Guggenheim fellowship with such legendary photographers as Edward Steichen and Walker Evans writing references.<br /><br />Robert Frank got the grant. He bought a used Ford and headed out in June 1955 on his American road trip, with his 35mm Leica and other cameras in hand. His first stops were in Pennsylvania and Ohio, then Michigan, where he was permitted to photograph inside the Ford plant in Dearborn. This was just the first part of a car trip that took him about 10,000 miles, and during this photographic journey, Frank shot over 750 rolls of film, which resulted in about 27,000 images. These he edited that down to about 1,000 work prints, and of these he chose just 83 images. It's those photos that we find in this book.<br /><br />As you go through the pages of this book, you'll find greyscale images of factory workers in Detroit, black passengers on a segregated trolley in New Orleans and transvestites in NYC. You'll encounter a hard-eyed waitress, a Hollywood starlet striking a pose, and a hotel elevator attendant in a contemplative dream, while people in furs and suits blur past her. There are urban cowboys, politicians and socialites, teenagers, bikers, and ordinary people.<br /><br />On a personal note, my first copy of The Americans was picked up as the result of a college class in photography during the '70s, and it disappeared during some moves over the years. The next was purchased at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2009, and it's the 50th Anniversary Edition, picked up during that memorable exhibition. My copy lists Steidl as the publisher, and all of the images are as sharp and detailed as I remember in my first copy, and maybe even better.<br /><br />Robert Frank's [[ASIN:386521584X The Americans]] is like viewing a time capsule of the 1950s, and the introduction by the late poet Jack Kerouac adds to it. There is an element of sadness, even despair, in some of the images that you'll find as you go through the pages of this book, and there is joy as well. This title is highly recommended to urban historians and those who love the art of street photography alike.<br /><br />11/13/2012photographic journey, Frank shot over 750 rolls of film, which resulted in about 27,000 images.

B000001EGE|5.0|This was one of the first albums I got as a child. (The other was Alice Cooper's Billiion Dollar Babies).  Then I bought the cassette and I am finally getting around to buying the CD.  I love this album and I never get tired of the songs.  These songs are very eclectic.  Country, blues, a New Orleans sound and the classic Elton/Bernie Taupin sound.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Unlike many people, although I loved the original 1947 version I never cared much for the little girl in it.  She just seemed too spoiled and full of herself.  In this version, the little girl is absolutely adorable and lovable in a very unspoiled sort of way.  I like that the whole movie is updated,too.  I actually watch this version at Christmas now and usually skip the older one until I've exhausted the rest of my Christmas collection of movies!

B00005N6KG|1.0|I am writing a review on these, although I never write reviews (and I should, check my review history), because they are so bad.  I am not happy about this situation.  So unbelievably bad, it is utterly mind boggling that these POS's have 746 review's at 4/5 stars - I cant even begin to wrap my brain around that.  I have multiple degrees in engineering, dedicated my life to the application of modern science to such \\"problems\\".  And then I spend $8.51 for a pair of headphones that might as well have been given as a freebie in a happy meal.  These headphones are crappier than the ones you got with your off-brand walkman when you were 7.<br /><br />The worst part is that I would pay a King's ransom for a pair of headphones that actually works, but all I can get is POS's like this.  I've probably read at least a few million reviews on Amazon, and I feel like a shank because I never contribute.  When I see reviews like the one I am writing right now, I dismiss the writer as a cynic.  It is what it is, if this product blows your skirt up, then have at it.  If you buy the Craftsman instead of the Makita, these headphones are for you.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|After training for some time and getting minimal results, spending a small fortune on supplements books etc i was recommended this book by a friend who seemed to progress very quickly in both strength and size whilst not spending a great deal of time in the gym. Once opend i could not put this book down and finished it within a day. every page turned i felt like kicking myself as the book strips training and dieting back to basics outlining all the facts and myths of training and dieting along with the reasons behind them. Bigger Leaner Stronger is easy to read and understand which has made me realise where i have been going wrong for years, I am now looking forward to starting the workout and diet plans, many thanx to mike
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This is a great buy for anyone that's traveling and wants to continue playing as if they were lounging back at home. I'm currently deployed overseas right now and it's been 3 1/2 months into this 1 year deployment and so far I've got no complaints. The Gaems system breifcase was durable enough to survive the trek inside my deployment bag - i surrounded it with my cammies and warming layers for extra cushion just incase. We were throwing our bags everywhere - onto the decks, from the decks into the truck, from the truck into the plane, etc etc. The only gripes I would have to say is about the screen - it's a little on the small side and there's a lot of glare on it, but that's no problem when I'm balls deep into FarCry3. The audio is good, and the case is great - protecting it from the dust/dirt everywhere here. It even comes with lockable latches, there's always that possibility of thieves here.
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|I'm really surprised by all the 4-5 star reviews on this one. The story is boring, and a good hidden object game needs a good story otherwise it's just an I Spy book.  Also, the graphics are cheap! The images required to locate in each scene are just superimposed on the scene image, not truly integrated - they stand out so much that they might as well have giant arrows pointing at them.  It's the free app for today, so I gave it an extra star for not wasting my money.  On any other day I would've given it one star.  Terrible hidden object game.  There are plenty of h.o. games out there much better than this one.
1400164990|5.0|Fascinating, fascinating, fascinating.  Yes, let us be clear, Ferguson is a proponent of liberal empire.  It's counter to every reflex of an American, and there is a rightful rejection of all of the horrors associated with Imperialism.<br /><br />That being said, I do not read to agree with everything an author states, nor to disagree refexively with their views.  I read to stimulate thought, to introduce new facts and perspectives to my worldview, and to challenge myself intellectually.  On that measure, this is a five star book, easily.  Ferguson is an agile mind with great fluency in many matters.  He will challenge your preconceived notions, and he wil broaden your perspective.<br /><br />And even for his biases, I would give him credit for being remarkably fair.  I highly recommend this book.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|Too many characters, too many countries, too many stories and political happenings at one time.  It was difficult to care about any of the characters or keep them straight.
1419705849|2.0|My excitement for this book was uncanny, especially given that I am a 23 year old woman. I anticipated it being hilarious like the others in the series. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. There were a couple chuckle- worthy moments here and there, but overall this book was a bust. Better luck next time, Kinney.

0439023483|4.0|This was an exciting read, but I did have to wonder, am I not supposed to like Katniss? Apparently she's no fun to watch on TV, but I didn't think she was as bad as Haymitch made her out to be. I felt at times that the author was working really hard to convince me that Katniss wasn't good on camera, when she didn't seem that bad to me.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I recommended it for my book club and read it so quickly the first time that after our discussion I read it again, this time more slowly to savor it. Ms. Harkness creates a realistic alternate in her characters and events. I would suggest this book when you have time to savor it.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|There was absolutely no reason for a third (or dare I say second book).  The author made very short work of the story's remaining threads and devoted the other 75% of the book to repetitious sex scenes and food orgies.  Your size is showing Ms. James, you vixen!  My problem all along with the &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; line has been lack of daring, imagination and vocabulary.  How many words can you think of for female genitalia?  Countless, exactly!  Ms. James settles for one.  Not one per scene, or even one per book. Just one. And it's a verb. Let that sink in a minute.  And for the food scenes there was also a word, singular, and that word is &#34;replete&#34;.  Staggering to imagine discoursing on the topics of food and sex for hundreds of pages and arriving at only two words.  So why did I read the entire thing, you ask?  For the same reason I read the &#34;Twilight&#34; series.  I couldn't look away!  Now about those sex scenes, &#34;Don't stop there&#34;, woman!  C'mon E.L., you're almost there, don't shy away from it now; talk dirty like you want!  Guess I feel this book was written by a housewife who's finally daring to admit she wants hot sex, too.  And hey, that's okay, too.  The story was a romantic, get-away-from-reality read was fairly entertaining.  Let me know what you think about it.  You know you can't resist reading it!  ellynpeace@sbcglobal.net
0439023513|3.0|Without giving anything away, I just want to say that I was really unhappy with this book. The first one was exciting to read, but this one was a struggle to finish. Katniss got on my nerves, I didn't like the love triangle between Gale and Peeta and Katniss, and the epilogue sounded more like something the author had to write instead of something she wanted to write. I should have stopped after the first one.
B008NABUU8|4.0|This app could use some refinemint the members should snap together easier. it is hard to use with a finger without having to zoom in to the max. the different locations take a long time to load but it has not completly froze up when loading.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie has everything: action, humor, human moments. Joss Whedon is a great director and he really knows how to handle genuine interactions between people. He also has a unique brand of humor that's great fun to watch. All of the individual characters came together and meshed really well. Also, how can you not love Agent Coulson?
B008NR91DO|5.0|Gary doesn't just copy the famous licks and solos of Jimi.  He plays in the style of Jimi, and really lets it fly.  Plenty of camera zooms on his amazing fretwork, so it's almost an instructional DVD as well.  Gary can't sing very well, and isn't much to look at, but who cares?  He's burning up the fretboard like few othere can!
B005UPOAT2|5.0|Classic movie and a must-see romantic flick to watch with your significant other. Blue-ray picture was awesome as well. Love it!

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|What an amazing book! I read Larsson was going to write seven book and died after this was published. What a great trilogy! I would have loved to read were he would have taken the story!!!!!
B001NEK2GE|3.0|The thumb stick is just wrong, it is awkward to use and has a stange shape. there are dozens of post on how to correct this using parts from various controllers but I havent tried any.<br /><br />The learniing curve is horrendous, I have had it a few weeks and still cant quite master it. I play Guild wars 2 and trying to kite with it is very difficult at best.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|A wonderful voice for a wonderful song.  I just love Adele.  I hear the movie is pretty good also. Thank-you
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|he amount of money that it takes to take care of this creature is absurd!  My child unknowingly spent over $400 in coins, gems, etc. in a two week period!  Do not buy this!!!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My grandson has just turned five (going on 16 or 17).  Yes he is growing up very fast.  My purchase of The Jungle Book arrived in perfect condition and will fit in with my plan very nicely.  Here is the plan:<br />  1.  Some hot dogs.<br />  2. Some Lt. popcorn.<br />  3.  Watch, listen and sing along with The Jungle Book.<br />  4.  And most importantly, bring out &#34;The Child&#34; in the 5 year old and the 67 year old.<br /><br />  I thank you so very much for this beautiful gift.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this game on both a Kindle Fire and an Android phone. I really enjoy it! The only thing that is a bit annoying are the ad pop-ups between games, but they are easily dealt with. It's a fun game! I would certainly recommend it!

B009I0QTF8|5.0|Flying Lotus is the sound that you will hear throughout popularized music in the years to come. He's a forerunner. The following may be the ones to bring this sound to the mainstream but this is where the sound originates.
B005LAII62|5.0|Creative (not seen before) storytelling a a kid (Norman) who sees the spirits (ghosts) of the dead (any dead) and is ostracized by family, peers and townsfolk for it. Kid reluctantly goes on a quest to save the town from the undead spirits who themselves were victims or perpetrators of fear and misunderstanding many hundreds of years ago. Great stop frame animation with finely nuanced motion and appropriately askew naturalistic, yet haunting sets. Intelligent dialogue with spot on voicing.<br /><br />Only criticism is that the title is more juvenile than the story and doesn't do the movie justice.
0756407125|5.0|Don't bother yourself by reading these wanna be writer reviews - plain and simple it's an easy read that pulls you in, great story line and overall enjoyable. Can't wait for the 3rd to come out! (I hope it doesn't take 3 years :/)
B008RYN44U|3.0|After their last album, Rock Steady, I was super excited to hear this one, most of the songs are very basic, and similar to one another. I am disapointed in them, I hope they do a better job on their next album. My husband also has pretty good taste in music and he said this album sucked. Sorry No Doubt, I am not impressed.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|His voice is still going strong and lyrics are great. Hope he continues his good work. It's nice to have him around.

B009329Y30|2.0|My wife went with me to see 007 so I owed her one, but even my my wife hated it.  We were so bored we both almost gave up half way through, but we stuck it out just hoping it would get better.  It didn't.  This is one of the few movies we agreed on.  I wouldn't suggest anyone watch this movie.

1609611543|5.0|I already had this book and it benifited me greatly. I knew my sister in Georgia needed to read it and I ordered a used copy from Amazon to be sent to her. She received it shortly after I ordered it for her and she called to tell me the book she received was brand new. I told her it was a used copy. She was very happy it came in such perfect condition and looks forward to reading it.
B009A882D0|5.0|how can you go wrong with this cd? I bought as a christmas present for my husband, but couldn't wait to hear it! so I gave it early and we both enjoy!

B00004YRQA|5.0|This is the official Sony branded memory card, so it should work for your PS2. Though more MB would have been nice(and there are some third party memory cards that work with the PS2 with 2 or more times as many MB as this memory card) it gets the job done.
1451695195|3.0|3/4 way into the book couple of parts interesting. If you read Dr, Helen Walback she did a study way back when of DDE. many stories much more in-depth of the afterlife. Then if you want some real in depth stuff go way back during the second world war and various books by various mediums all of whom have substantiate evidence of life after death with validation of  the diseased like addresses personal info.<br />Anyway would not recommend it for actual validation , his account of his experiences are not uncommon. If he had commented on what people were doing at his bedside or in their homes that only those person would be privy to then that would validate his out of body experiences  along with the other narrated experience perhaps then.. weboflove.org/neardeathexperience<br />Because a Dr. wrote this does not lend much creditability. Mr hobo has an experience and no one pays any attention, yet his may have way more validation.<br />So people listen only to white shirt and tie and that is where the problem is people do not investigate for facts or verify .

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson Demille has always entertained me. With these two books, yes two books,  first the one where John Corey is out to whack an Al-Qaida creep and the other book ,John Corey's joke book. I don't know which one I like best , but together it is 5 STARS . My kind of humor. Thank you for taking your time in writing this. Well done.<br />I would ask Mr.Demille to autograph the book for me but that would impossible to do on my Kindle Fire.
1419701533|5.0|These books have made reading all the more fun for both of my sons. Easy reading and gives reader a sense of accomplishment.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I love the hack and slash I enjoy this type of game. I plan to keep playing it the graphics are great
B004DLPXAO|5.0|keeps you reading on the go... sometimes all you have with you is a phone and its more convenient to have one device that does it all..
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Can't share pics doesn't have the tab at all to share. This is a common issue and should be fixed with a update.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Reading the book before seeing the movie really helped me to understand what was going on! The jumping from one time period to another was somewhat confusing in the movie but the book explained events much better. Very interesting concept, though.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I was excited to read this because I had seen the movie previews and it looked good. I like the book but it was predictable.
B003XYERRM|5.0|This is one of the best renderings of this part of English History I have ever read.  It takes you right back in time and makes the characters spring to life, you could be in the room or on the battlefield with them.  Extremely well written, a real page turner could not put it down.  Great read for book clubs
B0074MZSWW|1.0|I should have listened to more of this before buying. Has one good tune - Hold On - the rest sounds like he is in the throes of intestinal dysentery, as recorded from a truck stop restroom.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|Portia..<br />I could not put your book down and read it straight through in one night's time.  You are remarkably brave and so beautiful.  It just shows everybody that \\"stars\\" aren't always what they seem and everybody has insecurities, in your case as amazing as your body is you didn't like it much.  It was a raw book..you told it exactly detail by detail and I heard even Ellen was quite surprised at the life you used to live.  Now you are vegan and healthy. I just adore you and recommend your brave book to everybody.  When we all see you, Portia, we see a gorgeous woman with an incredible body, but during much of your tortured life you couldn't see what was right before your eyes.  Please realize forever and always what a remarkable, beautiful woman you are inside and out. Thanks for sharing; I bought the cookbook from your personal chef, too, and use it.  YOU ROCK!
B00006LFGD|3.0|This was not the typical Barbra CD? It didn`t wow me like some of her non-duet CD`s usually do. It sounded like these songs were just thrown together for a quick sale. I played it through just one time, and probably won`t ever play it again. I purchased this production because of some of the good singers that she teamed up with. Sorry Barbra, do it alone the next time! I was expecting something similar to one of my favorites,&#34; A star is born &#34; with Chris Kristoferson... SUPER. Even Barbra can`t win them all.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|People said it was all about the sex, I disagree! It was a lot of sex, but a story of a man with a sad history. I loved the ending and the way the couple grew together and changed one another in more ays then one. I exspecially loved seeing her from his poit of view, I wish there was more of it. I can't wait till the movie, hopefully they pick the right actors though.
B004QPOVE6|4.0|I have watched this blu ray recently and it's an incredible performance by one of rocks best! However, I couldn't agree more with some of the reviews about the camera edits and moving overhead shots swooping around the audience. That's what I really want to watch when I go to AC/DC concert, Not Angus,Malcolm,not Brian, or Phil Rudd. insert sarcasm here.<br /><br />When people buy a concert DVD, their expectations are ruined when these \\"video jockey's\\" impress themselves with their computer skills. Yawn.  As a viewer, I'm the most important part of the editing exercise, not the person pressing the buttons at the editing bay.  Not all viewers have the attention span of a gnat. So the editors with digital gear, make the cuts because they can, not with the viewer in mind.  \\"Watch how fast I can cut this AC/DC concert into pieces!\\"  \\"Aren't I a genius?\\"  Yeah, watch how fast I can stop watching. \\"Look here comes Angus cranking a solo, cut to the audience, so the viewer can't see it!!!!\\" They forget who's trying to watch on the other end.<br /><br />Outside of the constant dizzying cuts, the sound is outstanding. Hard to tell if Brian over dubbed his vocals.<br />This is a very good AC/DC performance, just felt like this 4 star DVD was Shot Down in Flames by those who forgot that the stars were on the stage, not the editing bay.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|At first I was like, o-my, this guy is full of himself. Upon finishing the book, I could not wait to get to the next.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|I rented this film because of all the hype, and in the naive belief that something that featured so prominently at the oscars must at least be worth seeing. I was wrong. It is just pseudo-arty nonsense. The basic premise seems to be that masturbation is what turns a good dancer into a great one, and that paranoia about another dancer can make you so unhinged that you cannot distinguish reality from hallucination, even where what is (apparently) happening is as extreme as lesbian oral sex and stabbing yourself with a large piece of broken glass. The sexual content (which is extensive) is just awful and doesn't even have the redeeming feature of being in any way titillating. I watched this film with my wife and she walked out long before the end as a result of a mixture of repulsion, incomprehension, and boredom. The only good bit is the music, but then that was of course written by Tchaikovsky.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is the most complete set concerning Aliens that anyone could ask for. I enjoyed watching all the director's cuts. There is much more information included in the directors cuts. I also purchased Prometheus and watched them all in order, with Promethius first, of course. It really helped pull the entire set together. The set is very nicely packaged, and would have made someone a very nice gift...if you're looking. It was very enjoyable for a long, long, long day at home.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Amazing game.<br />Just finished it after clocking 100 hours.<br />I'm 33 and usually don't like to spend too many hours on a single player game but this one was def the exception.<br /><br />I'm new to the Persona serie so I didn't know about the different endings. I did the bad ending at first so I was disappointed , then I found out about the Normal ending and the True ending :).<br /><br />I'm so addicted to this game that I immediately restarted a new game this time to concentrate more on the S Links, trying to catch the Sea Guardian etc...<br />since some stuff carry over (money, skills like Diligence, Courage, Knowledge etc.., and registered Personas.)<br /><br />This game alone makes a PS Vita purchase worthwhile.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy it already!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Once again I must start by saying some of the reviews are longer then the movie was. Unless you are paid to review a movie, a three thousand word review is a bit excessive. Amazon suggests 75-300 words, not a book! Now with that out of the way, I don't get what the confusion about this movie is all about.<br />#1 Scientist find what they have been looking for concerning what they believe is the origin of life on Earth.<br />#2 Everyone flies off in search of, and locates planet.<br />#3 Things go very wrong, which results in much screaming and blood.<br />#4 People die<br />#5 Has interesting ending...after which you put in your copy of the 1979 Alien movie, and really enjoy it for the first time, since you now have a background for it.....<br />The special effects in this movie are killer. I really enjoyed it. I bought it with the new Alien 4 pack, complete with director cuts. Seriously, don't get all wrapped up in psychoanalyzing the thing...It's a movie for crying out loud...Just enjoy it!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Works great.  Must easier to use this app then opening a web page and going to amazon.com.  I would recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|As an avid Grisham reader, who read The Firm before it became a Best Seller, and has eagerly read every one of his books since, I was naturally looking forward to \\"The Racketeer.\\" I was most disappointed; it would have been a \\"just OK\\" read if it were by \\"just another author,\\" but we expect more from John Grisham.  Boring in places and a far-fetched storyline best sum up this book. Not up to his usual standards!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought a 6 ft amazon basics cable and it only lasted a few days!!  This one fit tightly!!!  works perfectly.  Don't waste your time with other cables!  I haven't tried transferring files.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|Great second album. It’s highly produceded but they do it well. The picking is and playing seems tighter and more technical but sounds great. It does get a little prechy, as a none christian don’t really like hearing about god all that much, but the music more then makes up for it.
0345803485|4.0|I thought Anastasia allowed too much in the first one, and I was so glad when she finally set boundaries, which took too long.
B009FKZ9AM|4.0|It's fun, and reminds of the headcoatees. Good punk/pop/indie mix. Light, up tempo short songs. Great driving or walking music.
1419705849|4.0|This is a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I'm sure she will enjoy it like all the other Diary of Wimpy kid series.  My only complaint is amazon packed it with tools that I ordered which ended up badly scuffing up the hardcover.
B009G8GRX6|2.0|I heard they let the bassist write a bunch of songs on it.  Knock it off, this is probably there weakest album to date.
1419705849|5.0|i kow my son is going to love this book he has all the diary of a wimpy kid books now it was at a great price too  im really happy with the product
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I had no idea tat a flashlight could be so powerful yet light weight.. I especially like being able to use it to look into<br />to my home's 12-foot Ceiling's vents. I can see straight into the duck work. Cool!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Hard to judge this by the franchise which was different is so many respects, other than the big picture background theme of behaviorally modified agents and the attempt to keep these operations a secret. Renner has done a fine job for himself. The movie is fast paced and I enjoyed it. Different flavor from the hard-hitting Bourne films earlier.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Great deal for the price,all the songs I love on the two cd's and the music video cd is just a great plus. Great buy! Been looking for my favorite Garth brooks songs since he is not on iTunes
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is another fun game that we loved it so much we got the game we can al play as a family and when friends come over, we love it
B000EUDAWG|5.0|I bought it for my grandson for christmas..I havent give it to him yet but I know he will love it.
1603425381|5.0|This book is exactly what I was looking for. It has very good instructions and is very illustrative. The book meets my expectations, because I am a beginner in crochet.
1609613937|5.0|This book is about reclaiming your health through nutrition. The author has investigated piles of scientific research and explains what it all means. Watching the sad decline of freinds and family has sent me on a path for facts. A lifetime of eating the standard American diet makes people sick.<br />I read a lot of books, scientific journals, and website pertaining to nutrition, exercises, and healthy life styles. How do people live to be 100, still can walk a mile, and take care of themselves? Eat mostly plants with mild exercise. This book explains it best. There are facts backed up by miles of research. Eat whole grains like bread, potatoes, rice, and corn (starches) with fruits and vegetables. The less meat, dairy, and fish the better.<br />This terrific read explains all the disinformation out there about the food industry, the false promises of the Atkins diet, and how the FDA has let us down. These facts are a must read for every human being.
B007NMN2US|5.0|My keys needed a little flair, and this a combo of 2 of my favorite things from when I was a kid! Great buy compared to the black and grey versions.
0547995660|5.0|I first read this book when I was in middle school and I absolutely loved it. It was nothing like any other book we had read. It was a book that made you think about society and conformity. I recommend this book to my friends and have book several copies to give to them as gifts. It was one of the few books that stood out from all the books I ever had to read in school, along with Fahrenheit 451. Please give the gift of The Giver.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I like the Corwell novels and this one is good too.  Maybe not the best that I have read, but still hard to put down.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|The beginning was a bit confusing but by chapter 3 you never to put the book down. Just hang in there you will enjoy it. This book really makes you think and guess.
1401937519|4.0|I was enthralled by Anita's story until the NDE account. After that, the book became repetitious. Ms. Moorjani's overuse of the term \\"magnificent\\" and \\"magnificent\\" to refer to our spiritual nature was tiresome and irritating.Anita referred to herself or us as \\"magnificent\\" one more time. I think the New Agey philosophy that fills the latter part of the book could have been expressed a lot more succinctly condensed.<br /><br />\\"Ki\\" \\"Chi\\" \\"Energy\\" \\"Jesus\\" all seem to be just part of Anita's and our resplendent magnificence. Her pantheistic vision of the universe was less appealing than that offered by Star Wars. At least, \\"the Force\\" has a dark side that must be valiantly battled against. I found Anita's Afterlife in which a Hitler and a Mother<br />would be in the same condition strangely flat. It's a vision that is not shared by many other NDE experiencers.<br />One part of the book that I wish had been fleshed out more was Anita's healing experience in India that seems to have resulted in an extraordinary remission of her cancer. However, later in the book when she describes her NDE-induced healing and recounts her struggle with cancer before that utterly life changing event, she hardly mentions her healing experience in India.<br /><br />The holistic ayurvedic approach she experienced in India is the one thing that seemed to work for her that people with terminal cancer might consider. Healing though a realization of one's divinity seems a bit more difficult to achieve, although Anita would probably disagree with me on this.<br /><br />The mantra \\"I'm OK, You're OK\\" is taken to a completely new level of \\"I'm magnificent; You're magnificent\\" based on Anita's personal experience. I don't dispute that she had the experience that she did or that her recovery seems truly miraculous. I just think that she didn't get the full picture that includes the selfishness, delusion and true Evil that exists in the universe. If Anita is correct, Jesus, the Buddha and most of thesaints and sages of the ages who have taught that \\"what you sow, you reap\\" in other words, karma --have got it all wrong. However, Anita's life story is a fascinating and inspiring one, and although I can't accept her metaphysics, I enjoyed most of the book and think many others would too.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I enjoyed the other Dark Knight movies but this one is just a bit long and disjointed, with some serious time, continuity and pacing issues.  I get the impression Nolan had a million things he wanted to do with the Bat, but couldn't quite figure out how to squeeze them all into one movie.  There are some great scenes but I found myself checking my watch quite a bit and I was glad when it was finally done.
B0073XORCY|3.0|What can I say? I'm an addict. Anything Ian puts out, I'm bound to gulp down, like any junkie, trying to re-create that first Tull high, with ever-decreasing satisfaction, but still: I'm buying.<br /><br />The good: here and there, bits of the old Tull passion and drama flicker. Familiar sounds from past albums (the original \\"Thick\\" and for some reason the melody line from \\"Heavy Horses\\"--the \\"hauling soft timber into the dusk\\" part) pop up, impressionistically. Otherwise, very similar to Ian's \\"Rupi's Dance\\" album in sound and tone. And melody. And composition. Which really was an outstanding Ian album.<br /><br />The bad: the poetry readings. Not even new poems, but lyrics of songs on the album. Makes the only cringe-worthy part of \\"A Passion Play\\"--that Hare and the Spectacles part--seem worthwhile by comparison. Makes Graham's stuff on those early Moody Blues albums seem inspired!<br /><br />The ugly: child molesting here and there, treated like a radioactive spider bite that created homeless Gerald. Funny, Aqualung used to be the pedophile. How times change. Anyhow, Ian does an extremely poor job juggling the molestation hot potato, ruining a couple songs that might have otherwise had some promise.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's not unexpected that Ian's too old to rock n roll (as TAAB2) proves, but who'd have thought that in his 60's he'd still be too young to die? Good health and even longer life to him, I say! If he can keep cranking out albums of at least this quality every couple of years, I'll consider myself blessed.<br /><br />But like any child of divorce, I still nurse secret dreams of Ian telling Martin, \\"I was wrong, my darling...I'll give up the cheap production and really dig down to the Benefit layers of my soul to come up with compelling tunes for you to rock out, and we'll bring back the old beloved members and go into an analog studio with a merciless taskmaster who will hone things sonically IF YOU WILL ONLY FORGIVE ME AND PUT TULL BACK TOGETHER AGAIN...\\"<br /><br />Maybes, who-knows, and wait-and-sees...<br /><br />UPDATE: Having listened to this album for a full month, I still stand by my 3 star rating.<br /><br />Back in the old LP days, there was a general rule that an album released in America needed 11 tracks. (Not a rule Tull often followed.) Despite the generous 17 tracks here, it's interesting (not really) to note that once you subtract the spoken word filler (Might-have-beens, Cosy Corner) and count as a single unit the songs that share the same melody with different words (What Ifs-Maybes-Might Have Beens/Banker Bets Banker Wins/ Wooton Bassett Town and Swing It Far/Upper Sixth Loan Shark/Confessional), you get a total of 11 songs.<br /><br />Somewhere, an old Elektra exec falls over dead.
1475143389|5.0|There are a lot of fad diets and workouts on the market that promise all sorts of incredible results. This book DOES NOT fit that category. BLS is broken down into easily manageable chunks of solid information about what you should eat and how you should work out. Matthews takes a no-BS approach attempting to reduce your time in the gym (using complex lifts) and simplifying ways to manage your calories (yeah, there's an app for that). For those people out there who already bench 500 pounds this book may be a little juvenile, but for the rest of us average guys it has a lot of solid, straightforward, and helpful information...and the guy even answered my email when I had a question.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is perfect for anyone that grew up in the '80's.  It's full of pop culture references, and feels like you're in a video game.  So much fun!
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|In 1992 Rage Against The Machine released their self-titled debut album which would go onto inspire and influence and entire generation of bands and people. Muse's guitar virtuoso Matt Bellamy has often said that seeing Rage Against The machine perform at the 1996 Reading Festival was the moment he knew he wanted to be in a band. It's an album full of powerful political themes provided by the rap vocals of Zack de la Rocha, incendiary riffs from the brilliant Tom Morello who makes the strangest sounds from his guitar, at times it can sound like a turntable as well as being backed by a powerful rhythm section of Bassist Tim Commerford and Drummer Brad Wilk. It is an album that has stood the test of time and was heavily influenced by the likes of Public Enemy, The Clash, the Beastie Boys as well as both Tom Morello and Tim Commerford having a love for Canadian Prog rockers Rush.<br /><br />Twenty years on and the album gets the real deluxe treatment available in a variety of formats from a basic re-mastered edition to an ultimate 5 disc edition. It probably depends on the level that Rage mean to you as to which edition you want. If you are a collector it's the deluxe box set edition you will want. It's packed to the brim including of course the original album re-mastered as well as the vinyl version of the original album. Out of all the ten tracks on the album there is no filer from the opening track \\"Bombtrack\\" to the explosive climax of \\"Freedom\\" and everything in between including guest spots from Tool's Maynard James Keenan and Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins on the excellent \\"Know Your Enemy\\".<br /><br />Also included are all the bands original demos that would go onto form the main album, as a Rage fan these are a vital inclusion and include tracks that could have easily gone onto make the album such as the brilliant \\"Darkness OF Greed\\" with its heavy powerful chorus and the Beastie Boys style track \\"Auto Logic\\". The second DVD in the set which includesthe band's first ever live performance from 1991 which is basically a one camera shot of the band performing, it finishes with \\"Freedom\\" and then wisely goes straight to a 1994 performance of the same song from the Pinkpop festival in front of 60,000 people as well including various live performances of songs from 1992 up to 1994, some of are of better quality than others. On the first DVD the band have included the Finsbury Park concert from 2010, which was a free show to reward the fans for helping get \\"Killing In The name\\" to the U.K number one spot at the expense of the X-Factor. It was seen as a victory for the people who had grown tired of reality TV dominating the charts. If you already own the DVD \\"Rage Against The Machine\\" then a lot of the content on the first DVD will be familiar to you as it includes all the live performances that were on that DVD which has the band playing at various festivals including Reading festival, Rock Am Ring and Pink Pop. It covers the band live from 1994 to 1997 including tracks from follow up album \\"Evil Empire\\". Also included are all the music videos that were also included on that DVD but includes six extra videos as the videos from third and fourth albums \\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" and covers album \\"Renegades\\" are included to bring it up to date.<br /><br />This is the most comprehensive Rage Against The Machine collection there is and whilst it might be a 20th anniversary edition of the first album it includes a lot more material that collectors will want to have. There's a booklet and poster included in the box set too. If you are an obsessive Rage against The Machine fan then you will want the Deluxe 5 disc edition, if you are not there is plenty of other versions here to choose from of one of the most important albums ever released.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|When I was 10 years my parents took me to see Star Wars.  WIthin the first 5 minutes I whisper &#34;This is my kind of movie!&#34;.  My brother drove me to Ridglea theater in Fort Worth several of the 7 times I saw that movie the summer of 1980.  The one and only movie I saw with my dad just the two of us was Return of the Jedi in 1983 (he wasn't sure who Dark Raider was).  Seeing a favorite movie again evokes memories not only of the movie itself but also of the experience of seeing the movie, where you saw it, who you saw it with... unfortunately these movies on blu-ray are not exactly those movies.  They are substantially the same, but each time one of the &#34;special edition&#34; add-ons shows up, it interrupts the memory of the original experience of these movies.  Hopefully Disney will do the right thing and release these movies back to their fully restored (not revised) original theatrical content.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|They have an amazing library of hits to draw from and they didn't spare too many good ones.Recommend for collectors or people not familiar with early Stone.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked this book, but I think it is a bit intense for anyone who is under the age of 16.  The adult themes brought up in the book are a little extreme, especially for someone in their pre-teens or early teens.  I realize kids are growing up faster these days, but these issues shouldn't be presented in a book for teens.  These are issues that need to be introduced by parents and teachers, not in the library.  If you let your pre-teen or teen read this book, read it with them, and discuss it with them.
0765316897|5.0|Everything comes together for a great ending.  We get to learn more about Spook, Sazed and the Kandra.  I was hooked until the end.  Can't wait for more books in this setting!

B009VL28W2|4.0|Only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that they failed to play &#34;wherever I may roam&#34;  what the hell?  One of my favorite songs left out in place of 3 cover songs? Overall though, I have seen these guys at least a dozen times and they rock the show!  Long live Metallica!!

B0055SWM08|5.0|Hope to see other products by the Falen Tree games.  Don't mind paying for a product this well designed.  Thanks
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Great album filled with many great songs - not just one or two.  I really like the unique sound of this group and think it is neat that they are family.  Arrived on-schedule and in good condition.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|If you find a puzzle or two that just doesn't make to and you ask for a hint, the first few hints (3) are free. The next few have a  cost to them.  I understand the business model, I just don't like it.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|some of the reviews are saying they cant zoom in~i do not have this problem just pinch...u can also skip the dialog....very nice graphics....glad I downloaded this faotd!!!
B001SF8G1Q|4.0|Not a classic, but worthwhile for several reasons, including George Harrison's (uncredited) lead guitar on &#34;Went To See The Gypsy.&#34;
B000002OX7|5.0|Who's Next is arguably The Who at their best. The different thing about it is that it doesn't have a concept like their last 2 \\"Who Sell Out\\" and \\"Tommy\\" or their follow-up \\"Quardophenia\\". That doesn't make the songwriting any worse though, they still put a lot of effort into the album. The production is more dynamic sounding than on their early stuff, Pete Townshend's guitar playing is great along with the synthesizer. Like someone said on their Listmainia, he was one of the first people to use the synthesizer as an instrument rather than a toy considering it was relatively new. It's easy to understand why it's considered one of the best albums of all time, the songs are very dynamic and energetic with a good amount of diversity. None of the songs sound too dated either for 1971, the album was ahead of time. My top tracks are: Going Mobile, My Wife, Bargain and Won't Get Fooled Again but they're all good.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I think it's her best concert you can get on DVD. She is really performing at her best. I watch it every day when I do my workout and never get bored of it. Britney is absolutely amazing! Very energizing. Every Britney's fan will love it.
B00138F0MQ|5.0|I bought the entire album specifically for Africa.<br />Big fan of Toto though I seem to have come to the party late.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|An amazingly well done series after Percy Jackson thank you so much this is awesome<br />Thank you Rick Riordan.<br />Neverendingpi
B007SGLZP8|4.0|An Interesting read with twists and turns.  A page turner hard to put down.  My wife and I both enjoyed it
0805092447|5.0|But, it is great for first graders that are just beginning to read, because they can memorize the words and thus learn what those words look like in print.
1401207529|5.0|The title might be a tad hyperbolic, but I do believe that this is one of the best origin story retells I've ever read.  It gives emphasis to everything that needs it, as well as fleshing things out to give it some depth.  Though not much was changed from the original beginnings of the dark knight, nothing truly needed changing to begin with.  There's no sense fooling with something that is already very good.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I'd change even a single panel, even if I could.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I downloaded this app for my daughter and she can't stop talking about it. Great app and I hope she gets something out of it.
B000ZK3YDK|5.0|I originally saw this on HBO years ago. I stumbled upon it here randomnly and I saw the price. Seriously, a new unopened DVD for under $3? What a steal!<br /><br />This was such an amazing concert. Justin and his band set Madison Square Garden on fire. Live singing, amazing audience interaction, great set, unbelievable band, and great direction. This is a must buy!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|just got the game and my little one loves it so far. cant wait to see what's coming up<br /> next.<br />good luck.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Ive been on Ebay for almost a year and a half now and I have the app on all my mobile devices! its a great place to find what you want for cheap money! the app always tells me exactly when something happens! absolutely 100% approved.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It's a really fun game and very cool for people who love the show like I do, but the reliance on gems for a lot of the characters and missions is disappointing. I love the show, but I don't want to shell out a ton of money just to complete missions and get my favorite characters. I just don't see the point.
B008I34ZG6|4.0|these a  remastered from the original analog master ( about time ) so the sound is excellent ! packaging could have been better.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This is a wonderful story that works to explain the questions of the more skeptical child such as how does Santa live so long and how does he get around the world so fast and deliver so many toys to so many children.  The level of detail and creativity in the story telling and animation is amazing.  Off to the side, there are several beautiful side stories about what it means to love Christmas (the secular aspects) as well as how a dysfunctional family can be brought together by Christmas.<br /><br />If you are looking for a more traditional telling of the Santa Claus story then I recommend Polar Express.  Believe it or not, this film holds Christmas in the same wonderfully high regard as Polar Express but offers its story with a more comedic telling.  As with all visually stunning films, I strongly recommend the Blu-Ray version if your TV accomodates it.  Merry Christmas!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. it keeps my daughter occupied for hours and its s good way to pass the time. just awesome.
0525953728|5.0|This book is an easy read.  As a Navy veteran, I have known a handful of SEALs and I have worked with them on shore duty.  Mark Owen's attitude towards his job and himself typifies the &#34;just doing my job same as you&#34; kind of attitude that is a trademark of U.S. Navy SEALs.  In my mind, the book does two things very well.<br /><br />1.  To my point earlier, it does a great job providing the public with what SEALs are like as people and in doing, prevents a large number of potentially unfavorable stereotypes that a less informed public could assign to them.  These men are not simply brave and they are not simply athletic and they are not simply intelligent.  They perform the missions that would make brave men cower and refuse to go forward.  They do not risk death but rather walk hand and hand with it as you would a future friend that you have not yet met.  They have the discipline and physical self-awareness to drive their bodies up to their breaking and beyond.  Many of these men have intelligence levels that border on genius.  When you hear about the passing of a SEAL or one of their affiliated special operators in the line of duty then know this:  America has lost one of its National Treasures.<br /><br />2.  This said, the book also does a wonderful job in terms of providing the details of the mission that took UBL out.  While I am sure that some details may differ from other members of the Team due to perspective and recollection issues, I am reasonably confident that it stands up as the public's source of truth on this historic event.<br /><br />If you are interested in the SEAL community or this mission then this book represents tremendous value for your reading dollar.  You will not be sorry.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I love this thing.  It's got an incredible amount of programmable keys, chances are more than you'll need, unless the game you're playing has a lot of controls.  I play Champions Online with it, and I have all my attacks, block, jump, buffs, and travel powers programmed into it.  It also has profiles, so you can set up each profile for a different game.  The board also has non-game functions, as the built in display can show the date and time and your computer's CPU usage.  If you play computer games, and want to give your regular keyboard a break, this is the way to go.
0691126887|5.0|It is an excellent book! Very good!<br />With wonderful illustrations and nice text!<br />I recommend to all those who admire birds!
B002T9H2LK|4.0|Inglourious Basterds was a good Tarantino film with good acting by the actors within the movie.  I still give it a 4 star rating because I took one star off because a few of the scenes I felt went on longer then they should have.  One main scene would have to be the bar scene when some of the characters were meeting up with the actress to discuss the distruction of the Germans. It ended up being one of his better films but I have to agree with other people about the movie being so long about 2 hours and 30 minutes total.  Though it being so long doesn't take away the fact I enjoy mutiple points in the movie, the accent of Brad Pitt in the movie, Mike Myers scene as a German officer and a few other scenes and one liners.  But if your a Tarantino fan and don't mind long movies then pick this movie up and see how much of it you end up enjoying and add it to your collection.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I read a lot of fantasy and rarely have I read anything that pulled me in as much as this series. The final book cannot come soon enough
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood Season one is an amazing TV show with an amazing plotline for this first season.  Threwout the season we find out about Sookie's family history, her meeting her first vampire Bill.  We also get background infomation on the other characters as the people start getting killed off and they try to figure out who the killer is.  We also find out as a vampire gets older the more powerful of a vampire they become with their powers.  As the season gets closer to the end we find out more about Sookie's power to see things before they happen, and what sam the owner of the bar is.  But for the ending you have to buy the first season I will not spoil the series for anyone.  The show itself is very powerful drama, mixed with lust, love, passion, anger, so forth all the elements I do will make the series a very powerful series for long time to come.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Is this the “Running Man”… is this, “Romeo and Juliet”, it this the “Gladiator”, is this &#34;Mad Max beyond Thunderdome&#34;...???  I lost track of how many movies, books and themes this show stole their story from.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Kill Bill Volume 1 a good Tarantino film with a great cast and some great action scenes main one being at the end between the protectors of the one she is trying to kill and the sword she is using to slice them up with.  But as for myself I felt like some people this first part had more plot instead of the action scenes that should have been in it.  But like any good drama action movie you have to have the background infomation to understand the whole movie in it's fullness.  The movie is still a good movie, and very entertaining to watch over and over again.  Though two bonus notes to be noted I enjoyed the animation scenes very nice touch, and second bonus note the music Tarantino uses in his movies are always good and entertaining.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|As a long-term fan of John Rebus and Siobhan Clarke, I'm excited to say they are as great as ever in Standing in Another Man's Grave.<br />Rebus is out of enforced retirement and working as a civilian in a cold case unit, with the hope returning to the force. He begins investigating a series of disappearances spanning a decade. Are they linked to the latest missing woman or unconnected? Rebus is seconded into CID, largely working the case his way, while the rank and file follow the official road. We see him back in action with Clarke and rubbing shoulders with old-timers on both sides of the law, as well as Fox in 'Complaints'.<br />This book is gritty, visual, gripping and well on par with Rebus and Rankin's best work. Highly recommend for existing fans and new readers who love a great crime novel.
0385536828|5.0|Intricate details, compelling narratives build the sense of being every bit a part of the scenes created.<br />Could not put it down.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I absolutely love Take Me Home! The songs are great, and it is a great thing to buy!! One Direction is amazing and you should seriously buy it!!!
B004R739LE|3.0|This isn't a bad camera bag for the money but I purchased it in a hurry for a trip overseas. Would have made more sense for a DSLR owner, but I needed a carry-on /backpack for my Long travel zoom camera and a couple of small point and shoots/ chargers/cables etc. And it was fine for that, but I also needed a little backpack functionality and it fails miserably in that aspect. Not enough small pockets for phone , keys, passport/travel docs etc. The side expandable pockets were way too short to keep water bottles from falling out, and it really needs a strap across the chest. Again, part of the problem is my own fault for not researching more, but for my intended purposes, it's was not adequate and I will try to find someone that it would be more appropriate for.
067144901X|4.0|cute book but really small, wish they would tell you the actual size. Hopefully the grandkids will enjoy it anyway.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This game is my favorite G5 game so far! I love a good ghost story. The gradual unfolding of the story is done in such a way that keeps you really motivated to play. The puzzles are fun & the seek/find ones are unique. LOL, if you decide you want to take a break, in the left botton corner of the game are 3 mahjong tiles. You can tap on them and you can play a pirate style game of tiles for awhile. (Just one example of some fun details throughtout the game).<br /><br />There is the perfect amount of dialogue when the characters in the game speak. Wonderful graphics! This is one of few games where I did not want to hit that \\"skip\\" option.  Lots of spooky ghosts to meet & personalities! I Play allot of games of this type and this is not one where you get that feeling you wasted your $. Also, there are a couple maps that you earn & a hint button & skip the puzzle option if needed.<br /><br />I can only think of good things to say about this game, it has been a real treat to play!
0671449028|5.0|I thought my daughter could get into the habit of reading a bedtime story to my grandson, so that bedtime would be more enjoyable..
0385536828|5.0|My subject line says it all, though the novel reveals this gradually, and in a most satisfactory way. I will only add to the above reviews that this tightly constructed novel uncoils deliciously toward the end, in what was, for me, a triumph of of the old maxim that \\"plot is character.\\" A wonderful book.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I order this so I could use it with my kindle, but it is not strong enough to keep it standing upright.  It is exactly as they described Lightweight....

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I like many people never saw John Carter in the theaters...I wish I would have now.  I saw it when it first came out on Starz and figured might as well watch it as I had nothing better to do.  Boy was I surprised!  This was a very well made film with a fun and exciting story!  The acting was great and the best part was that the whole concept was fresh and to my knowledge is different from anything else out there. Immediately after watching I went online to see if there was going to be a sequel and to purchase the movie on Bluray and was disappointed to hear that as of right now the plans for the sequel have been cancelled.  Hopefully this movie does extremely well in DVD/Bluray sales and Disney realizes the mistakes made by their horrible marketing campaign so we get to experience more of this great film.

B008S80OU2|5.0|If you're a fan of BOC, this set is a must buy!<br />The remastering is as good as it will ever be.<br />Throw in the rarities, B-sides, and plethora of live shows, and you have the ultimate BOC collection.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is with the packaging, but don't let that stop you.<br />It's the music that matters.

In-box won't load, and new messages are sitting in a waiting to send folder????<br />Update:<br />So I deleted Yahoo mail and reloaded the app and it works now. Don't like it any better though, no way to add color to the page, its just plain white.<br />Guess I'll wait till the mobile version is available in Amazon store and d/l that one.

B00A6PD9I4|3.0|After two sequels, I was very excited to hear that Pixar was producing a new original movie.  It had everything: and exotic culture, action, humor, and brilliant animation.  Sadly, it didn't pan out like I had hoped it would.  Maybe I've grown up too much, but I had always thought Pixar was brilliant at making movies that people of all ages could appreciate.  This movie felt like a waltz through a kindergartner's make-believe afternoon.  I never felt a real sense of urgency in the plot; it all seemed like the playful antics of a rebellious teen, and nobody was ever in any real danger.  By the time it ended, I was left thinking &#34;That's all?&#34;<br />Don't get me wrong, there are trademark Pixar aspects still in there.  The animation, the scenery, and the cinematography are beautiful throughout.  There are many characters to grow attached to, and the humor is tastefully written for everybody to enjoy.  But I expected this kind of story from Dreamworks; Pixar has a higher standard to live up to, and it fell short this time.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Everyone needs to treat themselves to this classic film!  After seeing this movie on TV I realized how much I wanted to own it.

B0044XUZ9K|3.0|The amazing story of Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson is about an adventurous<br />treasure hunt. A young boy named Jim, a doctor, and a squire, find a map to an island with<br />treasure. They gathered a crew and cast off and \\"the Hispaniola had begun her voyage to the Isle<br />of Treasure.\\" But the crew is not what it appears to be, and Jim, the doctor, the squire, and a few<br />close people must abandon ship and find the treasure alone.<br /><br />Treasure Island follows the journey of Jim. He is a curious young boy who is not afraid<br />of death. He is also very smart and comes up with amazing plans, but most often they almost get<br />him killed. Jim is the narrator of this book along with the doctor who does only a few chapters to<br />help explain the story.<br /><br />This story takes place in 18th century England and Treasure Island and is an adventure.<br />Due to the period it is set in, though, there is some historical fiction as well (the boats, guns, buildings,<br />ect.).<br /><br />Robert Louis Stevenson made Treasure Island easy to read. The book is not a hard read due to<br />this. He gives you the right amount of detail to get the picture he is trying to describe. You know<br />that the story is going to turn out right, but you get so lost in the book that you forget that. Many<br />a time I was doubtful of the outcome. One of my favorite books, the Hunger Games, is just like<br />this.<br /><br />Treasure Island is a good book. It sucked me into it and I had many late nights reading it,<br />but it has not grabbed me so much that I would call it great. The wording was simple therefore it did not<br />grab my attention for me to love it.<br /><br />Treasure Island is a good book to read. The old English dialog adds a nice challenge<br />for readers. Although it is not my favorite (or even a great book) I would still read it again and<br />would give it three and a half stars.

0486275590|4.0|\\"X\\" marks the spot, and if you are looking for a great adventure tale, look no further!<br /><br />In Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, we meet Jim Hawkins, a sheltered young man living in the<br />18th century in a small European town, whose life will be forever changed once an old, high-strong sea<br />captain stumbles into his family's inn one night. After staying in the inn for weeks, the sea captain dies in<br />the inn's tavern, and Jim discovers a treasure map hidden away in the captain's treasure chest. Looking<br />for an adventure, Jim decides to head out in search of the captain's fortune, assisted by Long John Silver<br />himself.<br /><br />As I read Treasure Island, I was captivated by the author's vivid descriptions of settings and characters.<br />Stevenson used the element of flashback to tell the story.  For example, the books opens with Jim<br />recalling, \\"Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of<br />dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange as our<br />actual adventures,\\" which definitely gave the narration a more prevalent voice. As with most other<br />adventure novels, exploration is definitely a strong theme throughout the plot, however, not only is<br />exploration of land important in Treasure Island, but also exploration of yourself and who you are.

1442474440|2.0|Treasure Island was written to take place in the eighteenth century. I mean come on, it's a pirate adventure! Know what the genre is? Adventure.<br /><br />  Jim Hawkins never knew what he was getting himself into when he met the captain. He didn't know this then, but Jim was destined for adventure.<br /><br />  The book starts off when Squire Trelawney, Doctor Livesey, and some other characters ask Jim to write down his adventures. So he starts at the beginning, at the Admiral Benbow inn. One day, a tall, sailor (captain) walks into the inn. He is singing: \\"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest - Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\\" He tells Jim's father, who owns the inn, that he is a captain, but he keeps the rest of his life a secret. Zipped lips.<br /><br />  The captain promises Jim some money to keep an eye out for the one-legged sailor. \\"His left leg was cut off close by the hip, and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall and strong, with a face as big as a ham-plain and pale, but intelligent and smiling.\\"<br /><br />  The captain tells terrible stories about the violent life on the high seas. This scared and excited all the neighborhood men.<br /><br />  Although the captain runs out of money, he continues to stay in the inn. Jim's father is too afraid to ask him to leave. In fact everyone is too afraid to ask the captain to leave.<br /><br />  Jim's father gets very sick and the doctor comes to help him. He keeps getting worse until in chapter three, Jim's father dies.<br /><br />  Also in chapter three, the captain lay sick in bed. He had a stroke. Too much rum. He had Jim become close. His last words were\\"...oh wait, you have to read it for yourself.\\"  Jim tells his mother about the captain's last words. They look for help. Nothing. Jim searches the captain's corpse for a key. Not in his pocket. It's around his neck! Seems legitimate. They open the chest.<br /><br />  The major conflict of this book is Jim, Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, Captain Smollett, and his crew as they search for a treasure that the captain has left buried after his death. They are challenged by Flint's former crew members, who have tricked Trelawney into hiring them to help sail to Treasure Island. In other words, who can get the treasure first?<br /><br />  I personally don't like pirate books. They feel repetitive to me. Out of five stars, I would give Treasure Island a two. I don't think this book is any different from any other pirate books or stories, but it does have good similes and metaphors throughout that paint pictures of each character and the scenes, and it does use good descriptive words. If you like pirate books and don't mind predicting the events, then this is the book for you. If not, I'd keep searching.

0486406482|5.0|Matchmaking. That was a special interest of Emma Woodhouse. \\"Emma Woodhouse,<br />handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of<br />the best blessings in existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to<br />distress or vex her.\\"<br /><br />Emma lives with her father in Highbury, England in the early 1800s. Her mother died when she<br />was little, and Emma's governess, Miss Taylor, married Mr. Weston. Emma is now all \\"alone\\" with her<br />father at Hartfield. She decides to excite her boring life by trying to find Harriet Smith a husband. Emma<br />decided never to marry, but she breaks that decision later on in the book. She tries to make Harriet the<br />perfect gentlewoman, who has a good taste in men. Harriet and Robert Martin, a young farmer who<br />likes her, are \\"in love\\" already when Emma decides to find Harriet a husband, and she convinces Harriet<br />to dump Robert. One problem is that Mr. Elton, who Emma tries to set Harriet up with, is in love with<br />Emma, or at least her money. Next Emma tries to set Harriet up with Frank Churchill, but only after<br />having a failing attempt to fall head-over-heels in love with him herself. Then Mr. Knightley comes into<br />the romantic picture, both Emma and Harriet fall in love with him. After all the attempts, both girls get<br />married, but I'm not going to tell you who marries who.<br /><br />Emma is a comedy of manners. Jane Austin wrote the book well by using intriguing words and<br />painting a picture of the village and the characters. I loved this book, and loved the love story in it...<br />what can I say I love romance novels.

B005Q6MJ8O|3.0|\\"It's*it's a magic wardrobe. There's a wood inside it, and it's snowing, and there's a Faun and a Witch and it's called Narnia; come and see!\\" Lucy and her three older siblings, Edmund, Susan and Peter, are living in a strange old house with a professor when Lucy (the youngest sibling)discovers a magical, wintry forest inside a wardrobe called Narnia, at first her older siblings don't believe her, but it doesn't take long before they all discover it too, and while they're there, they meet characters like the (evil) White Witch and Aslan the Great Lion, and participate in many adventures and battles along the way. Will they follow the mighty and wise Aslan or fall into temptation from the White Witch?<br /><br />The book is a fantasy/adventure, set in England around the 1950's. One thing the author did in this book that I liked was he used forshadowing toward the beginning which really maked the book  more interesting along the way. He also used outstanding detail to describe the look and feel of Narnia: so realistic that even though you know it's a fantasy, it feels real,  as if you're there with the kids.  He also uses a very 'real' tone, like the author is having a conversation with you about the story. This book is the second book of a seven book series.<br /><br />I particularly didn't enjoy the book, simply because it isn't \\"my type of book\\", but if you are someone who loves fantasy, adventure, suspense and some action, you'll be hooked! It makes a lot of Christian parallels also, which is very evident throughout the book. So, if you love traveling to new places  through an extremely vivid book, then you should read The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis!

1612680003|5.0|There are several variations of the old saying that the &#34;rich&#34; really are different.  My favorite is that most of us plan for Saturday night while the rich plan for generations.  It is more about attitude than the techniques of making and keeping wealth.  Robert wasn't born with the classic silver spoon, but he did have two examples to learn from and he applied what he learned and became the rich dad for the next generation,,,and for all of us who can read and apply.

B004LWZWGA|1.0|The movie is awesome! The entire trilogy is amazing, for that matter. Story, actors, visuals, themes - the whole thing is well done. What is not well done, however, is the Ultraviolet digital copy. There appears to actually own the digital copy. Rather, it is stored for you in \\"the cloud\\" by Flixster and the Ultraviolet people, which means that you can only stream the movies, rather than having it downloaded to your computer. And their customer service is awful. Don't buy the Ultraviolet copy. If you want digital, go to iTunes. If you want the Blu-Ray or DVD, get it without the Ultraviolet and save yourself some cash.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Courtney Milan is one of my favorite writers. Her stories are compelling, written with intelligence and wit, showcasing mesmerizing characters and intricate plot twists and turns. They are also wonderfully and beautifully romantic - filled to the brim with sexual tension. This book is simply a wonderful read and I truly hated to see it end.<br /><br />I loved the earlier Governess Affair which introduced us to Oliver and the Marshalls, so it was a pleasure to re-enter their world and see the story continue. Robert was one of the nicest heroes I've ever read about and I thoroughly enjoyed the multi-layered heroine Minerva. The chess device was brilliant and gave a perfect opportunity to highlight Minerva's genius for strategic thinking.<br /><br />The interactions between Robert and Minerva were fascinating, beginning with their totally unconventional meeting. How their relationship proceeded was fascinating to unfold, each page simply kept my attention riveted. What was not to love about Robert? The more I read, the harder I fell for him. It is a tribute to the talent of Ms. Milan that I so identified with him that I could actually feel his pain.<br /><br />The betrayals, note the plural, were heart-wrenching and if I hadn't known there HAD to be a happy ending, I would have been unable to continue to finish the book. I cared too much for the characters to see any of them seriously hurt.<br /><br />Still, the word pictures drawn by this author linger with me - the day Robert met the Marshalls, the train trip, the wording of the pamphlet, the primer, the honeymoon trip, the prison cell, Robert's anguish over the trial. Beautifully, the reintroduction of the primer is the scene I most treasure. A beautiful, beautiful love story.

0547884591|5.0|Just so everyone knows, I'm biased.  Tim's books have helped me to realize major success in all aspects of my life.  I'm only 25 and am flipping houses on my own, managing 4 million dollars of real estate, training and handling the agency side of biz for a professional athlete, and am starting a sports website which is my ticket to freedom.  Not to say I wasn't on to something before, but his books have put me on the fastest and best path.  If you haven't checked out his books, get on it and thank me later.<br /><br />As for the 4 Hour Chef, this book hit home for me.  I HATE cooking.  Having to think about eating 3 times a day for the rest of my life?...yuck (pardon the pun).  My hatred is so strong I even hired a full time assistant to live with me about 2 years ago to prepare all my meals.  This book, from someone who truly cares about time, affordability, and efficiency, helped me realize how quick and easy cooking can be.  The step-by-steps and explanations are easy to go off of, and I'm honestly motivated for the second time in my life to master the essential skill of cooking (first time was after a friend of mine prepared a meal for a group of us and the girls lit up like a Xmas tree).  Also, the artwork and look of the book reminds me of the $150 textbooks I used to buy at Cal Poly SLO.  The price is staying the same and the quality is on the rise, kudos to Amazon & Tim.<br /><br />Lastly, I love learning.  The section on meta-learning is helping me put a skeleton together for truly understanding the ins and outs of commercial real estate.  Learn a language quickly?  Yes please.  That will be extremely important for my trip overseas next year (thanks to 4 hour workweek).  All-in-all, I love you Tim.  If I were gay, you'd be my second pick (after Will Ferrell of course).  Thanks for helping me realign my priorities and giving me the push I needed to go all out.  In Tim we trust.<br /><br />Kyle

B009NQKPUW|1.0|Great trailer, but the insipid decisions by the characters in this movie simply don't make sense for \\"scientists\\", and ultimately it feels like a movie about a handful of 20 year old punks in space- but without the campy fun of a horror flick.  The plot makes no sense, the characters make no sensible decisions and (aside from noomi rapace) you don't end up like any of them or finding that their motives make any sense. Plus the movie is just full of bulls*** didacticism.

Here is an additional 1-star review to keep authors honest and warn shoppers on Amazon that not all reviews can be taken too seriously. Kumquat

159420411X|4.0|This is a very nice and highly readable book. It provides good examples of how data-based decision making is beating the gut-based decision making, in one field after another. In some sense, the title of the book is the message, .. focus on the hard signals, and strong patterns, and ignore the mushy noisy gut-feelings. Kahnemann and Tversky have been writing about this for a long time. I found the same kinda message from Ray Kurzweil's latest book on how to create a mind ...<br /><br />I was perhaps looking for something more insightful from Nate, ... someone who had the distinction of being able to predict the elections more correctly than anyone else. Hopefully his next book will be better.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|\\"Rise Of The Guardians\\" is a fantastic film based on the \\"Guardians Of Childhood\\" book series by Bill Joyce and it features top-notch animation, storytelling and voice acting. It has plenty of heart and a few mildly funny moments and quite a few tear-jerking moments as well. (You probably want to bring a box of tissues with you to the theater, just in case.) This movie is quite a departure for DreamWorks Animation due to the fact that there are no pop-culture references or crass potty humor whatsoever. This is a truly wonderful timeless film that will be enjoyed for many generations. Hopefully DreamWorks will make a sequel and a T.V. series like they've done with some of thier other franchises because these characters deserve to have more stories told about them on screen!
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Guitar World named Rush and Van Halen the top 2 albums of 2012, and it's well deserved. (as much as I hate lists, this one I agree)<br />This is pure Rush. It reminds me of classic Rush, it's like nothing has changed. It's a reminder of why we love Rush in the first place.<br /><br />Rush has continued to make great music after so many years with the same lineup, that's not easy for any band.<br />I won't go into why this album is great as so many other reviewers have mentioned already.<br />Just listen for yourself.
B008I34Z8E|2.0|I know I'll be burned by the Zappaphiles but I read too many positive reviews about this album in sources such as the Rolling Stone Record Guide and All Music Guide.  I do mostly like Zappa from this period, just after he dropped the Flo And Eddie phase, which was my personal least favorite 1970s phase.<br /><br />I'm not some huge Zappaphile with everything the guy did but I do own over 30 CDs and LPs of his.<br /><br />I will say that I do like fusion jazz to some extent, but only by the artists who brought it on, then dropped it after it got too self-indulgent and boring, and \\"everyone else was doing it\\" by then.  Frank Zappa was actually one of those who did it for awhile, then dropped it while the getting out was good.  This CD contains 2 overly-long fusion jazz songs (were they actually compositions?!).<br /><br />The sound quality of the 2012 Zappa family release is quite good.<br /><br />The first song \\"Big Swifty\\" is basically a 17 minute Miles Davis Bitches Brew-era fusion jam which is just simply too long to enjoy.  I got bored after awhile.<br /><br />The two songs in the middle are shorter; more like \\"normal\\" (!) Zappa songs but more mediocre than most Zappa I own.  They just arn't memorable.<br /><br />The last song \\"Waka/Jawaka\\" is actually my favorite song on the album but it too is too long and stretched out, losing me somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />OK, my opinion is just an opinion, but I can honestly say that of all of the 30+ CDs of FZ I own, this one is the worst one of the bunch and will likely gather dust.<br /><br />Casual fans and newbies should heed my warnings before jumping on this purchase.  All I can say is, you'd BETTER like fusion jazz which meanders on too long.
B005D1IFUS|5.0|The blues have been done over and over again. It's pretty hard these days to keep the blues fresh. We've heard our share of blues riffs. There's been a lot, and I mean A LOT of blues guitarist who each paid their dues. How do you keep it fresh? Well, Eric Sardinas did it for me with the release of \\"Treat Me Right.\\" Now once again, I'm thrilled to be grooving to the riffs of his electrifying dobro. Eric Sardinas' sound is the sound of traditional delta blues that's overloaded with intensity. His tone is both familiar and new, and makes you go \\"hell ya!\\"<br /><br />\\"Sticks and Stones\\" is raw and intense.<br />Highly recommended for any blues fan.

B005CM9DX6|1.0|I asked for this CD for my birthday. I was very excited when I finally got it. I purposely didn't listen to any of it's songs beforehand since I wanted it to all be new.<br /><br />Well I got it and after putting it in my CD player I found myself not listening to the music at all by the third song. It was so...blah. Very boring, low-key progressive rock that has been done a million times before.<br /><br />I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. When I received the CD I saw the sticker on the front that stated it was collaborated with Steve Wilson from Porcupine Tree. I never could stand their music and from what I remember about their bland music, this Heritage album is basically a Porcupine Tree title.<br /><br />The fact that I like every single Opeth release to date adds insult to injury. Everything from Morningrise to Damnation to Ghost Reveries is on my playlist. The Damnation gets the least amount play as I tend to like harder music. However, Damnation had heart and is quite good as a mellow album. I have nothing against it. So it's not just that this CD isn't heavy, it's that it's not anything. It inspires no emotion.<br /><br />Making this the first Opeth album that I've ever been unsatisfied with almost makes me angry at Porcupine Tree. It's like after years of having people tell me that I should like them (since I liked Opeth) they found a way to penetrate their way into my CD player and FORCE me to listen to them. All under the guise of being Opeth. It's like a horrible prank that I wouldn't want to pull on any death metal fan.<br /><br />I do take some blame. I should have listened to at least one song beforehand to make sure it was my cup tea. Any follower of Opeth knows they can be pretty dang random and one should expect the unexpected. After the ups and downs of Watershed I suppose this album was the natural progression. Or perhaps I should say degression.

One of the most original and inspiring television series' ever made. Action, interest, humor, and the growth of the small family of characters made this one of the best shows Fox ever aired. Naturally, they cancelled it before the first season had even been completely broadcast. It's sad that Joss Whedon was not approached by the Sci-Fi Channel to continue it. Where would we have been taken if the Browncoats had never been relegated to the land of mourning conventioneers? What worlds and new people would we have met? We can only wonder.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Whether a fan of the series &#34;Firefly&#34; or not, this film made strides for the realism of sci-fi for years to come. Whedon's farewell to the short-running series was as much a eulogy for what should have been a huge hit as it was a masterpiece of science fiction film. Exciting, mysterious, and containing action sequences that rival the &#34;video game&#34; movies that plague the screen today, without losing the familial chemistry of the cast nor the humor that was such a large part of the &#34;Firefly&#34; television series. Still a favorite after ten years.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I bought this on a whim; Amazon's suggestion and some decent reviews. And $.99.<br />Wow, I am so glad I did, this is perhaps one of the best I have read in a long time. The premise may have been done before, yet I can't say anyone has ever done it better. The MacGyver solutions to serious problems are actually real.<br />And I found it hilarious; so much so, I consistently laughed out loud enough that people would turn their heads.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|Season 3 has to be the best yet!  I would definitely start from Season 1, as it is a progressing story.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|Downloads YouTube vids to my kindle with no problem. I wanted to be able to download drawing lessons to my fire for review and this app does the trick.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Its been quite some time since I last did this workout...(I just repurchased because of how my first time using it went!) So let me give you a bit of background.  Please stay with me...the extra information is quite a bit, but I feel that it counts toward the review's final say! Hope it helps!<br /><br />(Back in 2008) My first time using it, I was about 25 pounds over my allowable weight.  I had a lot of \\"icky\\" stuff going on in my life and I was overeating...plus I was national guard working at the MEPS, an active duty location.  Weight was VERY important.  So I had to get it together! I purchased the book first and then read some reviews about this dvd so I purchased it.  IT WAS OUTSTANDING.  I am always up for a challenge, this was more or less my home workout gateway.<br /><br />It was short enough for me not to get bored...it was challenging to the point where I started competing against myself, but not overly so where one would become discouraged.  SO...I can say that there is a good balance when it comes to this dvd.  The recipes in the book and the written guidance helped me with my diet as well. I dropped that 25 pounds plus a few more and then I was motivated to start running.  I paired this dvd with my running and my body was nicely toned!(seriously...I looked better than I did in high school...and I had a 4 year old at the time!)  Eventually I graduated beyond this dvd and was able to take what I learned in the dvd and other things I picked up along the way regarding fitness to keep my body at my target weight.<br /><br />(In 2010) I was injured overseas in a rocket attack that among quite a few injuries took a large chunk of muscle out of my right thigh.  During the healing process I was only able to do Jillian's Yoga Meltdown dvd which was another great buy...(I recommend that!) It was the start for me to get back on my feet I was back to running about 7-8 months after my injury.  After that I was able to go back to my fitness knowledge to maintain my body.  (are you seeing a pattern yet?!)<br /><br />(In 2011-2012)  During my recent pregnancy I was unable to work out because of the physical pain I was in due to my previous trauma injuries.  Now I am recovering from a hernia repair....I will be cleared to exercise in 2 more weeks.<br /><br />(In...NOW) SO...here I am today about 5 months postpartum and 2 weeks away from medical release (to exercise) and I purchased her dvd yet again. (I loaned it to a friend when I \\"graduated\\" to other fitness options and never got it back OR I would TOTALLY still have it.  I won't be loaning this baby out again!!!!-lesson learned)<br /><br />I SAID ALL THAT TO SAY:  Jillian's workout methods WORK.  As long as you remain determined, push through, do it those 5-6 times a week(basically remain consistent), and make some changes to your diet...the weight can be lost! I like her because she promotes not accepting excuses.  The exercises target the key areas and ramp up your heart rate when you really put your ALL into it.  A person only gets out what they put in!<br /><br />This is a great starter dvd for someone looking to get their body on point.  It's not intimidating or boring.  I have done P90X and during my deployment I did some of the Insanity workout(before I got hurt) and those workouts ARE GREAT AS WELL...BUT may be intimidating or scary to someone that is just starting, trying to ease back into working out, or have injuries that prohibit them from doing the exercises fully even WITH the modifications.  Even though Jillian Michaels has a lot of Plyo(jump training) in her workouts...there is a way to modify if necessary and still reap the benefits especially if coupled with other methods of fitness.<br /><br />This dvd is one that should remain in your collection.  It has been a doorway for me when most needed while providing me with basic knowledge of what makes noticeable change in my body. Don't compare it to Insanity or P90X...those workouts are in their own separate category.  I mean beachbody alone (the company those fall under) are in a category of their own...so just give Jillian her credit where it is do!<br /><br />SOOOOO  I believe you should just press the button.  You know which button Im talking about right?  The buy/purchase button.  PUT IT IN YOUR CART!!! I'm serious!!! Just do it...give it a go.  NOW GO GET FIT!!!! :-)tegory.

B005CGI4EG|5.0|Liked this so much I bought a second one for my mom. The only two downsides are the packaging and the listing of episiodes. The dvds are seperated into two stacks so if you want a certain one you have to sort through about 16 and I like to keep mine in order. The only list of episodes is on the back of a stick on flyer it would have been much nicer to have it permentaly printed on the box somewhere, but compaired to the price of other collections of the full series it is still very much worthwhile.
B005ETA5K2|3.0|This is not the card you want if your going to be doing any type of monitoring .  Go with the H not the NHR
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I have never been discreet when telling people who some of my idols are and I always mention Doana Ross as one of the five most influential people of my entire life. As a small kid I recall watching her on TV for the first time when I saw \\"Mahogany\\" and loved her acting, her voice and most of all her presence. Years went by and I only grew to love Diana even more as 1980 was a banner year for Diana with \\"I'm Coming Out\\" and \\"Upside Down\\" topping the charts worldwide.<br /><br /> On July 20th, 1983 the small coal-mining town I was living in (and still reside) finally got cable television meaning no longer were we only able to view two channels, but 20! On a small Alberta independent TV station the next day I watched Diana Ross live in New York's Central Park. This was the first time I had ever seen her perform and was not disappointed.<br /><br /> As most know the concert was dealt a severe rain storm and that image of Diana being pelted by the rain and breeze while belting out song after song (especially her \\"Endless Love\\") will remain vivid in my memory forever. The concert was cancelled, but not before Diana told the crowd she would return the next day and perform again. She kept her word.<br /><br /> Now finally after 29 years this concert (one of the best in my opinion) is out on DVD for people to enjoy for years of posterity.<br /><br /> I have watched this concert multiple times and I never tire of it and you won't either as you watch a professional show what it is to be a singer, but more than that, a superstar of the highest order.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read this year. This literally ranks right up there with 'The Hunger Games'.

B0073O8BOS|2.0|All the songs are slow, and kind of dreary.  I own the first Band of Skulls album and it has 3 or 4 songs that are pretty good.  I did not find any songs on Sweet Sour to say that about.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read this year. This literally ranks right up there with 'The Hunger Games'.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I read the 1st and 2nd books and I just kept thinking about what else I could be reading.  I found it to be very dry, and the books just didn't hold my attention.  I don't know if I will ever fifnish the series.
B004TSXUWY|3.0|When reviewing a book that others have been raving about, as with Before I Go to Sleep by SJ Watson, it's hard not to let the hype spoil the read. The theme dealing with amnesia isn't that original, but having the protagonist also having to cope with short term memory loss gives it a new twist.<br /><br />Christine wakes each morning knowing who she is, but not realising she is at least 25 years older than she believed (apparently, sometimes she thinks she is a child on waking, but that isn't shown in the book, we are only told about it). Each day her husband has to explain what happened to cause her loss of memory and bring her up to date.<br /><br />So far so intriguing - but then Christine receives a phone call from a doctor who tells her she has been keeping a journal and that she should read it. From this point onwards we follow Christine's life through what she writes each night before going to sleep, gradually realising that all is far from well within her marriage.<br /><br />The journal entries are long and incredibly detailed when one considers she writes them while her husband is in the house. I found this slightly irritating because she seems to be able to spend hours writing and yet her husband never asks what she is doing or why she goes upstairs for hours at a stretch.<br /><br />Later, when she has found out that she shouldn't believe everything she is told about her former life and has met up with a friend she has known since they met at university, the journal entries reflect her concerns and mounting confusion.<br /><br />For me, the beginning is the best part of the book. The ending, although shocking, was a touch predictable. The middle got a bit tedious and it was confusing at times trying to work out when the various events had taken place - was she reading about them, or had they happened that day?<br /><br />Having said all the above, it is a powerful debut and I would certainly read another by the author.
B009B50QOU|3.0|I'm not a huge Greenday fan, I feel like most of their albums are filled with 1 or 2 really good songs and then a bunch of meh.  I bought this album for &#34;Oh Love&#34;, figuring the rest of the album would be the same.  There are actually 3 really good tracks and then a bunch of meh.

B008SOS63S|5.0|This might be the best live album I ever heard by the greatest guitar player I've ever heard and his vocal skills grow with every release.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This movie has everything you need: humor, action, Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, aliens, and a little bit of tender moments.  The movie is worthy of being part of the MIB trilogy.
1449410243|5.0|I got this book on a whim while looking for cat-related gag gifts for my fellow cat-lover friend for Christmas. This book is definitely for adults, but with its crude humor (poop jokes, curse words, cat-caused maiming and blood/gore, etc), it may not appeal to everyone. But I'm absolutely going to have to get another one for myself. This is a solid, great comic-book style piece with many comic pages of kitty hilarity, nearly 3/4 of an inch thick. As a paperback, the weight and gloss of the pages in the book are very high quality and the colors are bright and crisp. I was already a huge fan of The Oatmeal, so it was a thrill to see the &#34;new content&#34; that's included in the book as a bonus. It was all I could do not to rip out the poster that's included in the back inside cover of the book and keep it for myself. Definitely a great gift for anyone who loves cats and has a sense of humor.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Totally love this movie.  I thought it was the perfect ending to this trilogy, but they did leave it open for more.  Great acting and great sets.  Love the view of the blu-ray!

B004YM6JI2|4.0|So, Supernatural had some growing pains after Eric Kripke didn't have as much to say about the show.  This season is not as great as the earlier seasons, but it certainly has some exciting moments.  The extras are good and I am glad to own all the seasons.
B003INBOE2|4.0|Great action movie if you are into martial arts.  The disc ran smoothly and no problems whatsoever.  The first version is better than the second part (Ip Man 2).
B007HPO3CC|5.0|Best way to watch TV - no ads! Sean Bean is well suited to the role and is an actor that has stood the test of time, great in the Sharpe series and has come a long way since his role in the James Bond flick from the 80's
0439023521|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, could not put it down. Was obsessed. Haven't seen the movie yet bc the book was SO good I don't want to ruin it.
B0054R6BFM|2.0|After reading the glowing reviews for this book, I had high hopes.  But in the end, I was left feeling unmoved, unaffected, and basically uninterested in the characters.  I didn't feel much connection to Hannah at all, and while the basic message - that even things that seem tiny, that aren't meant maliciously, can seriously hurt a person - was clear enough, I felt like I was being TOLD and not SHOWN.  Hannah talks about her reputation, about how it affected her life, and I just didn't really feel it, and didn't end up sympathizing with her much at all.<br /><br />Clay was the more sympathetic of the two central characters, and wasn't written badly, but in the end I wasn't deeply invested enough with either of them emotionally for the book to have the impact it seems intended to have.<br /><br />The format is interesting, switching between two first-person narrators, and aside from getting confusing in a few parts (I remember one part where Hannah-on-the-tape is addressing someone as \\"you,\\" and Clay is addressing Hannah as \\"you\\" and it became hard to keep track of which \\"you\\" and which \\"I\\" were referring to which characters), it's basically done well.<br /><br />The bottom line, though, is that I was expecting to be moved, and I really wasn't.  The characters and situations felt shallow.  I know that, when you are in high school, things that will seem like nothing to adults can completely destroy your world.  But the author told me these things without making me feel them.<br /><br />Check it out from a library if you're interested in the subject matter or the dual-narrator format, but it was not, in my opinion, worth the rather high-for-an-ebook price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in a day. Amazing story and very well-written. The premise of the story might be too violent for some but there's so much more to it than just that!

B007HGPBRC|5.0|Hitchens last book is without question outstanding and one of his best works. Unfortunately the circumstances that motivated this book deprived us of the this very talented writer.<br /><br />Whether you agree with his personal philosophy or not you have to agree that he was extremely talented and one of the best contemporary writers around.

B008NW67E0|5.0|this cd is awesome. This is now my favorite band. If your tiered of all the same repetitive music and mock groups you hear on the radio, I would give this group a listen to. The use of thier lyrics is fresh, and the music will wake up your soul.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I bought an LCD flat screen recently and had a hard time hearing the programs I was watching.  I wanted to use earphones but this model TV does not have analog audio RCA output (only a &#34;digital audio&#34; jack)so with a little research online I found this unit.  With wireless earphones I can now enjoy programs and especially movies without annoying everyone else in the room.

B009KS4XRO|2.0|The game is fun, but after you use up your free turns you have to pay for the rest.  Not worth the money.  Play Scramble with Friends, it's more fun and you get free coins.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I was thrilled to hear that an animated version of this story was coming out and this production was terrific.  It had its own small variations while staying faithful to the Frank Miller miniseries.  If I didn't already own a copy of the graphic novel I'd buy it all over again.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|If you're an old-fashioned Beach Boys fan, you'll love this, it will take you back to their beginnings and probably your youth and you can't beat that !!

Take it to work, sit back in your baggies, with a drink with an umbrella & Enjoy !!
B009JBZH54|4.0|The trilogy has come to an end. Sadly no more movies will Christopher Nolan make in this awesome, sinister, and heroic trilogy of three of some of the best films in cinematic history. What, with all the gadgets like the tumbler or batman's awesome ability to adapt to darkness and scare the friggin daylights out of his criminal escapies. The best villian in the trilogy in my opinion was definitely Heath Ledger's Joker. He was like a wild, rabid, animal let out of its cage. His mastermind plans are what sets the movie in its place. I love Bane in the Dark Knight Rises, but, nobody beats the joker(Though I still admire Tom Hardy's portrayal of the intimidating, Scary, facemasked, and frightening Bane). The movie with the best storyline in my opinion is Batman Begins. The rough journey of Bruce Wayne after his parents were shot and killed right in front of him was intriguing. He works hard to become part of the league of shadows to help carry out Ra's al ghul's destiny.(Ra's al ghul is an essiental villian throughout the trilogy even though he is only there in person in Batman Begins). He betrays the league of shadows and becomes The Dark Knight. This blu ray release was only given 4 stars because though it is very durable with nice and easy packaging, it lacks in essential Bonus Material that I would have liked to have been included in this set. An example is behind the scenes interviews and bonus material with Heath Ledger on the set of The Dark Knight. I don't think this is included with the other version of the trilogy coming out in 2013. Anyway, Nolan fans, batman fans, dc fans, and fans in general, I hope you pick this up because this set should be essential to a part of the shelf in your collection. Oh and Happy Holidays to all of you out there reading this review. I hope your spirit shines bright this holiday season. Bye people.

B009P5S11G|1.0|i gotta give Rihanna  credit  because i never thought i would  say  that a modern day artist would  be one of the 10 worst  acts ever that i have ever heard, but  i have to congradulate her on that honor, because that voice which sounds like a Squirrel being being ran over by a  mack truck still hurts my ears and her stuff has gotten worser over time.  her plus side is that she has some catchy ring tone type of  tracks which are cool in 20 second bursts. however when she starts singing  Oh Double  LAWD!!!!!!!!!  and that duet with Chris  Brown is  wick wack. dude needs to leave trying to emulate Michael  Jackson alone because it ain't good on the ear. Brown  can  dance and  his twitter humor  game is off the door knob,but his singing?  NAW!! she  could  use  a dictionary  and  come up  with  a  few  more  words  besides  the  negative ones.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|What a great backpack I love it!  There are so many pockets for storage and even the zipper handles are padded.  I purchased this pack along with the Canon Rebel T4i 16 piece bundle which came with a 70-300mm zoom lens plus 2 other lens's and more.  I also have a tulip lens cover wrist grip and extra cleaning supplies all of which fits in the pack with ease.  I even left the styrofoam shipping end pieces on the 70-300mm lens for extra protection and all that and camera pack neatly away.  With the pack stuffed it feels good on my back with lots of padding on the shoulder straps and the waist strap and chest strap keep the straps right where they should be.  I haven't been on a long outing yet but from what I have experienced I anticipate no problems packing this all day.  The bag that came with the camera was small so there was no way to take all this equiptment with me for a pictorial adventure.  If you are tired of slinging a bag with all your equiptment around and having it under arm or sliding off of your shoulder get this pack!  You'll be glad you did.  I know I am!

B005QI4TP8|5.0|Before we begin this review, I should mention this is my first time reviewing, so be warned.<br /><br />there is no perfect words to describe Florence and the Machine, but this will be my attempt to give you a look into the art they have graciously given to us.<br /><br />This album is undoubtedly darker then Lungs (which is the reason I like it better, as a matter of fact), with Florence's magnificent vocals, wonderfully placed vocal harmonies, simply breath-taking lyrics, a bit of our talented harpist, huge, pounding drums, and to top it off, a haunting release date. Mix it up and what do you get? The beautiful, bittersweet, emotional album we call Ceremonials. Here's a look into this by a track by track review:<br /><br />Only if For A Night- a fantastic beginning track, full with harmony and talent. It's lyrics (lyrics are the first thing I judge a song by, by the way) arent't the absolute best on the record. I will rate it 8.5/10 becuse though it's not up thre with my favorites, it is one of the first tracks i truly appreciated.<br /><br />Shake it Out- Yes, yes, it is one of her most famous tracks though not her best, I do love it. The lyrics are fairly unique (minus the chorus) and I especially like the bridge with the whole \\"Looking for heaven found the devil in me\\" and \\"Its a shot in the dark, aimed right at my throat\\" 8.5/10<br /><br />What the Water Gave Me- Definitely one of the first i loved, but I can't say I love it as much as before, because it's light was slightly dimmed by the song after it (hint, hint). It is stunning and I absolutely love the bridge, where her voice and the music surrounding it seem to explode in power. I especially like the 2nd verse and bridge's lyrics, such as, \\"Oh poor Atlas, the world's a beast of burden. Rating- 8.6/10<br /><br />Never Let Me Go- Oh, Never Let Me Go, how I love you endlessly. Yes, it is a bit slower, but this right here is a demonstration of Flo's true lyrical abilities. The verses in particular are gems oftheir own lyric-wise. Also towards the end you hear another vocal-explosion. Note- the music video really sold it for me, but watch it a few times along with how it was made. Rating- 10/10<br /><br />Breaking Down- A nice track, a bit boring at some points, but I love the dreaminess and the bridge (I'm a bridge type girl). The \\"I can see it coming from the edge of the room\\" part before the chorus is nice, too. Rating- 8/10<br /><br />Lover to Lover- very diverse when compared to the rest of the album. Lyrics weren't amazing but her voice is truly sparking in this one. Nice message too. Rating- 7.5/10<br /><br />No Light No Light- I HEREBY NAME THIS TRACK THE BEST FLO HAS EVER RECORDED! My obsession for it kicked off strong and is just as tremendous as I sit here today, months later. Flo's vocals soar beyond limits, including a pulse-pounding beat and overall mood. You can really feel Flo just boiling under the skin in this one. Also the lyrics were impressive. BTW- the video is mind blowing. It really added an electrifying sensation to the whole song. Rating- 100000/10<br /><br />Seven Devils- Dark, haunting and purely powerful. With some of the best lyrics on the album (opening with \\"Holy water cannot help me now, thousand armies couldn't keep me out\\")it is one awesome track. Love it. Rating- 9/10<br /><br />Heartlines- Pretty song with a catchy beat, reminds me of the Hunger Games. Lyrics not fantastic, but Flo's voice sounds fresh and shines bright. One of those songs that'll stick in your head like glue. Rating- 8.5/10<br /><br />Spectrum- probably the most upbeat on the album, with an interesting theme of colors. I like the lyrics on the verses. Standout part- the bridge. Love how her voice just builds up until that part and hits you like a tsunami right there on the bridge. Rating- 8.6/10<br /><br />All This And Heaven Too- Another fast-paced song, with a nice use of vocal harmonies. I like the references to language and words. Fun song with plenty of times Flo's vocal abilities shine through. Rating- 8.5/10<br /><br />Leave My Body- not one of the best. Like the creepy ending. Rating- 7.5/10<br /><br />Remain Nameless- Creepy, futuristic sounding song with Flo's voice echoing hauntingly and chilling effects with the background music. Flo's voice really takes the lead in this one. lyrics not horribly broad. Rating- 8.3/10<br /><br />Strangeness and Charm- a cool, fun song with an also fairly futuristic sound to it. Up there with my favorites. I particularly like the lyrics, they're very scientific. 9.5/10<br /><br />Bedroom Hymns- A definite standout track. references to Jesus and sacrifices, defining it as a more religious song. I love the catchy beat and creative use of vocal harmonies. Also shows off Flo's spectacular vocal range. Love the mood of the track overall. Rating 10/10<br /><br />(I'll skip What The Water Gave Me Demo because I truthfully don't feel the need to)<br /><br />all in all, this record is much better than Lungs (in my opinion)and is one that I'd pay almost any amount for, have no doubts if you're considering buying this, you won't regret it. It will leave you changed for days on end.<br /><br />keep up the good work Flo!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This was such an amazing story. We have all heard about the holocaust, however I never realized what the French had done during this this horrendous event in history.  My heart broke for Sarah and all the pain she endured. I loved the story being told from present time through Julia and then back to 1942 and Sarah. I found myself tearing up in certain parts of the story and in disbelief of what so many people experienced, specifically the CHILDREN.  A story that will stay with me forever.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|This is a short read that is immediately implementable and something you'll take with you for the rest of your life. Very cool.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Fit the device perfectly. Looks nice. Sits securely when standing up to view videos or whatever, and can be adjusted at different angles easily. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for an affordable, nice looking, and sturdy protective case for your Kindle Fire HD.
B008S80OU2|5.0|outstanding collection, love the rarities, a must have for all BOC fans and those who want to be and should be BOC fans. The 4 downloadable concerts are very good quality, love hearing, &#34;Wings of Mercury&#34;. BOC, on the road forever. keep it going guys
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book reads just like an action/adventure film, and I didn't want to put it down. Baldacci introduces us to a new character, Will Robie, who is an assassin whose hit goes awry.  From there, the author takes us on a fast-paced ride that keeps the reader wanting more.  A must read.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|Love their new songs they are a unique band I recommend this album and the first one EP. I can't wait to look forward to their next album :)
1419705849|5.0|The was a hit at my house with my 2 daughters.  Once again, they loved this new book in the &#34;Wimpy Kid&#34; series.  Great job!
1451695195|5.0|I had the privilege of listening to the audiobook and the material could not have been more relevant.  So much more than NDE is discussed here and the awareness that is shed on many painful topics like adoption, the stages of coping with critical illness, parenting, and to some degree alcoholism allows for the reader to connect and heal in a gentle way if s/he has experienced these challenges.  The wholistic approach to the life events makes this more than just a recounting of NDE by someone who has credibility in the field.
0394826817|5.0|Any Richard Scarry book I ever bought was a favorite of my childrens, but I especially loved this book, and hope my grandson will learn the lessons his father learned from this book.
B005LCECU6|5.0|Awesome sound quality for a 1974 show.  Great purchase.  Would recommend for any Rush fan.  Nice jam on Working Man.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|I am impressed. I know the i7 is out but I had to keep my new custom built PC under a $500 budget. Purchasing an i7 would have put me at $700. I'm comming off a 2006 Dell with a AMD processor. This i3 is running circles around my old AMD with out breaking a sweat. I am amazed at how it is handling all that I am throwing at it. I will upgrade to an i7 later when the price comes down, but for now i am well pleased with this i3-2120. As well as this processor is doing I'm starting to thing the i7 might be able to predict the future.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I don't know where to even start with this train wreck. I bought it due to all the good reviews (at the time). I never bought into the suspicion that friends and family went and boosted book ratings with false reviews, but this book was truly something only a mother could love. The plot was about as thick as a piece of tissue, and the cliched plot devices were just beyond what I could accept. Reality has to be suspended somewhat to read fantasy, however it's like this author didn't even TRY to convince us that this was a real and logical world.<br /><br />Then there is the grammar, oh god, the grammar. I forgave the first word mix up - because the book was relatively cheap and self published. When every other page seemed to hold mistakes such as: Waist instead of waste, through/threw, to/two, flour/flower, and so on...and on, and on. I know second graders who know their homonyms better than this \\"author\\".<br /><br />You don't need to be a grammar expert to be a great writer - but you do need to get an EDITOR. If that was the only problem with the book, I guess I could say it was just laziness. Unfortunately, the author is simply not capable of putting together a believable and enjoyable story. I hate to simply write off an author after one book, however there were absolutely no redeeming qualities about this book. This, paired with what seems like a bunch of fake reviews, makes me feel like I have to be pretty harsh.<br /><br />Seriously. Do not believe these 4 or 5 star (actually, even the 3 star) reviews. This book is unreadable.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Purchased after seeing them in concert in Atlanta this September.  Songs are fun - great music.  Definitely worth the purchase.
1616614609|5.0|I was quite a fan of the original Netrunner but this review isn't based on nostalgia for the old game. If that were the case I'd stick to using the old cards and playing with the same people I did before. This is a great homage to the original and surpasses it in many ways.<br /><br />Android: Netrunner, simply put, is the best two player game experience you can have right now. The only reason I would suggest someone pass on this one is if you really don't like complex card games or building decks or if you would rather play games with more than two players.<br /><br />For the time investment you can't beat the game play of this one and that's why I rate it higher than any other game I own. I absolutely love it.
B001U7B4T8|2.0|How could you market this DVD and not include the beat song and performance of the night.  I haven't bought this, but have to say-  without Young, Petty, Dylan, Clapton, McGuinn and Harrison doing my favorite Dylan song &#34;My Back Pages&#34;. I won't be buying !!!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|It's music that speaks to the soul. I can honestly sit for hours and listen to this collection. The same songs we love but being placed with amazing classical music. Truly something special.<br />I really love Arwen’s vigil and Cello wars the most.<br /><br />Can’t wait for their next release and make sure you add them on facebook and youtube so you wont miss out!
B000HL09SA|5.0|We owned 2 Jack Russell Terriers when this movie was first relased (one has since passed on).  That fact alone was enough to make one fall in love with this charming and tender story.  The storyline and the acting performances, including the dog(s) make it irresistable.  I owned this on VHS and just purchased on DVD.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Is there anything more to say.  She is more than an entertainer, she is a phenomena.  I love her creativity.

B005LF9OCE|5.0|I love this show and can't seem to get enough.  It didn't always play well, though I'm not sure that was because of the product or if it was my internet (more likely it was my internet)
B007W8S2MG|5.0|The Short of It Review:<br />If you enjoyed it the first time for it's strong character driven story than you will not go wrong buying this version which improves on this front greatly.<br /><br />If you enjoyed it the first time for it's combat then this has had elements to improve it (Rise's new abilities to aid the party during combat being a shining point) but the difficulty has been eased quiet a bit so be aware.<br /><br />If you missed out on this gem of a JRPG the first time you owe it to yourself to get this, it is THE definitive Persona 4 experience with the only downfall being the amount of time you will lose to playing (just finished my first playthrough clocking 100 hours and have already jumped into a second go to try out different options.)<br /><br />If you don't much care for JRPGs well, this is very much one with character driven story, turn based combat, and monster collection/fusing... so unless any of those appeal to you than pass on this (though it does all three of those excellently)
B00006I53S|5.0|este lente canon es perfecto, se ajusta perfecto para fotografias macro y con zoom, permite un amplio espectro, ademas tiene buena luminosidad, perfect for me

B00AGOGOLE|1.0|does it work on the 1st kindle fire? do not want to buy it if it does not work. seems nothing works on the kindle fire.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Really enjoyable movie. Something between the walking dead and Sherlock Holmes. Fast action and not a lot of blood-overall it is a nice option for cold winter evenings
B006A9XRWI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite jazz albums. When I play it at home for guests they all enjoy it, even those who don't listen to this style of music.<br /><br />A must for your vinyl record collection.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Nice story line, loved Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Doolittle as he planned the raid.  Also, Ben Afleck was good.  Some of the historic props may not have been accurate, but overall, a good flick.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This movie is sexy, scary, sad and mysterious; in a word brilliant.  Haunting and highly entertaining.  Resonates for days!!  You'll want to see it again and again.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I read the book - which of course has more character development - but overall, I was happily impressed with the film.  Well acted, with tons of great cgi effects, it's a fast-paced, exciting movie that mixes history and fantasy.  While it had a certain amount of gore (it has vampires - what'd you expect?), to me, it wasn't over the top.  I'd watch it again!
B00712Y28Q|5.0|It's Figma.  They make great stuff.  Wish the overall figure was slightly larger though.  The pictures are kinda misleading because the figure looks larger than actual size.  The quality and attention to detail is there, it's just too small to appreciate from a distance.<br /><br />The Figma Link figure is another great product!
B005DVJQHY|5.0|Excellent book for every human beings who love to know about the truth of themselves. i recommend this book to every entrepreneur
B0091REZMW|1.0|Terrible!  Did not work at all.  Got through the living room and then the whole thing froze.  Tried to restart several times, but the same thing happened each time.  Dumped it from phone immediately.
B0007PLLQ0|4.0|Although I had already seen this movie, I got it to add to my collect. Although I like it, I was surprised that this is not the theatre version. It does have an alternative ending and the sound track is not the original one. Nevertheless, if you've never seen it, its worth watching with your kids and you would notice the difference in the sound track. I prefer the original sound track though, there was some good tunes on it, that's why I can't give it a 5 star.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|it is good I love it. my little sister loves it. and it does not mess up your kindle. it is great.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I liked the pacing and outcome.  Lots of questions still to be answered about Panem.  Good book for young adults.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This is a continuation of Ken Follett's famous story \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" about the 12th century community of Kingsbridge, England. It takes place 200 years after the time frame of the first book. Much has remained the same. The Kingsbridge Cathedral still exists, political struggles for positions of power still go on among the royalty, in business, and even in the Church, with the most ambitious and unscrupulous usually winning. The rich and powerful still oppress the poor;  love relationships - often triangular or unrequited - abound.<br /><br />The characters, of course, are different after 200 years, but are related, and it is interesting that certain traits were passed along genetically. Again we see a genius young architect descended from Jack Builder - this time he builds a beautiful bridge, and upgrades Jack Builder's Cathedral with the highest spire in England. As his love interest, Caris, we see a brilliant beautiful, but very independent woman descended from a similar person in the previous story. Their off and on again love affair proceeds throughout the book. Other love stories, rapes, and quick encounters crisscrossed through the story to the point where eventually it was hard to remember the parent combinations of any particular child.<br /><br />Besides ongoing struggles between the Church, the city, and the royalty, another strong story element was a plague that nearly wiped out the town of Kingsbridge, and would have done so twice, if not for fast thinking by Caris in establishing a system of quarantine. Medicine in those days was practiced by the monks, who used 300 year old methods, such as bleeding, and who knew nothing of how disease was spread. Caris learned medical secrets from a wise woman, who some thought to be a witch. Caris herself consequently was declared a witch and only escaped death by becoming a nun.<br /><br />Ken Follett is a great story teller who understands human nature (which remains pretty much the same over the centuries), and who also does his research.  As he narrates, he also teaches us. I learned a lot about 14th Century living - food and drink, farming, rules of the feudal system, business practices, medicine, and especially architecture. Follett also knows how to make us care about his characters, and how to keep things exciting. This story is a rollercoaster ride. Just as the characters we care about have finally climbed out of their difficulties and are at a high point, the bottom falls out and they are again in deep trouble. This happens over and over again with every likeable character in the book. However, it is not a dark book; right does finally prevail providing a very happy ending. I would rank it equal to Pillars of the Earth. It is a long, but very enjoyable and worthwhile read., and who also does his research.  As he narrates, he also teaches us.

031612057X|5.0|This was recommended to me by a cousin. I trust her recommendations and was not disappointed.Its amazing how the author got into the head of a 5-year old child. The story develops a bit slowly but it is well worth it. I passed it on to my friend and daughter who both like different genre books and they both loved it. Will look for more books by this author.
B00A0A6F7C|3.0|It's very nice but for some reason I was a bit disappointed. Sometimes I don't like her high notes. However, she still has a beautiful voice (I still see Simon Cowell's face when he first heard her on American Idol, hilarius.)

Imangi studios HAS to something.about it cause this is getting ridiculous!!!!!!!! The same thing also happened yesterday I'm getting sick and tired of this!!!!!!!
0817439390|5.0|Talked with several Photographers about gift ideas, and had a couple recommendations about this book specifically. There are several websites run by professional photographers that cite this book as a perfect gift as well.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This is a classic book! Literally. An excellent story, well written and it provides a wonderful example that even some of the most cold and tight-pocketed people can be changed. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, especially right around Christmas time. Really helps put you in the right spirit of the season! I recommend everyone should read this book, and since it's free what do you have to lose? Merry Christmas to all! And \\"God bless us, every one!\\"I
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I enjoyed this game.  It's a nice hidden object game with a nice variety of puzzles and storyline. It could benefit from zoom, but on a Fire 8.9 it's not bad.  I would have rated it five stars except for the incessant requests for a review, which I am leaving now.  Hopefully this will stop the nagging.
B0072X2NUS|3.0|With these two legends doing this record together,I expected far better!prehaps being all dance music with no vocals this may have given me the impression thats &#34;its no Good&#34;.Their is some melody floating around in the tunes but it did nothing for me,I Dont think we will see a record from these two guys again, simply this project did not work in my view.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|works great and organizes my photos. saves your photos in the cloud or will diplay them from your internal storage.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|As an avid reader, these books were mildly pleasing.  Its an easy quick read but in my opinion the story line kinda sucks.  If you want to read kinky tho, this is the book for you.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Impressive graphics on a mobile platform. Perfect hack and slash fun. I can already tell I will be playing this one through more than once.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The book follows three different ppl at the same time.  But the ending was great!  You can see how three very different ppl can have something in common that in the end saves their lives.
B0016YBFZ8|2.0|The language was terrible, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have had the language been less vulgar.
B009SJ46EA|5.0|This is clearly one of my guiltless shows this season.<br />It's wicked, crisply shot, well written & acted. Yet AHS is almost campy at times then suddenly truly spooky, addictive<br />and engaging. It's a fun ride...
B009NPA3MS|5.0|helped Phillip to win the idol contest because of his music, so I was a fan , his music is relaxing while driving in heavy traffic and quite different from most of the other music played on the radio
B00A993UWM|5.0|Buy the deluxe version. It's only a little more money and a lot more awesomeness! Gold Trans Am might be the best song on the entire album. No disappointement here. Buy it and buy it now!
B000068QKT|5.0|A movie filled with coincidences and love.  I felt that the movie was pure excapism. The color of the film even added to the fantasy state.  The characters were beautiful and the landscape was great.  I do not speak French, so I highly relied on the subtitles.  Now with all translation, I except that there's some loss of beauty to the language. But I was still very impressed with the story and language in subtitle.<br /><br />It's been over a decade since this movie was released and I still enjoy this movie.  So I disagree that this movie was overrated.  This movie isn't staying on the shelf collecting dust, unlike other movies that are overrated or forgetable.  And owning this special editing is worth every penny.<br /><br />Andr&eacute; Dussollier was perfectly fitted as the narrator.  His voice helped give it that fantasy air.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou was great in this movie.  Am&eacute;lie Poulai is quite the character.  She reminds me a little of Jane Austen's \\"Emma.\\"  Audrey was both sweet and tom-boy cute.  I like this actress and have watched others that she's been in.  Audrey is a good actress.<br /><br />Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix was perfect.  I really liked this actor.  He's both gorgeous and shy.  I really believed in his character.<br /><br />I have and will continue to recommend this to friends.
B002NANLCE|5.0|This was a great story and I enjoyed it immensely. Kind of makes me wish the TV show would come back and improve so that I can continue to explore this world.
B00005JKOI|5.0|Oh the era of the Brat-Pack.  I loved these movies in the 80's.  I'm quite happy that these movies are considered great classics in the 21st century.  I'm glad teenagers today can relate to these movies still.<br /><br />Pretty in Pink is my favorite Molly Ringwald romance movie.  Molly's acting is really good.  She played really well as the middle class teenage girl - Andie.<br /><br />Jon Cryer will always be \\"Ducky\\" to me.  I like this actor a lot.  I think that it was his acting in \\"Two and a Half Men\\" that has kept the show going.<br /><br />Andrew McCarthy portrayed the perfect rich boy heartthrob. The chemistry between Molly and Andrew was believable.
B006T5GTK0|4.0|I enjoyed the DVD based on the movie and the bonus section was informative. But, i thought I was buying the mini-series, when I went back to buy the mini-series DVD it was listed as unavailable. I found it for sale by other vendors, but I prefer the security and customer service of Amazon.  I hope you obtain the mini-series DVD because I will buy it from you.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This would be a five star family movie if it weren't for one scene where a dog is hurt.  Otherwise it is funny and heartwarming.  Truly enjoyable story.
B00AJER3SE|4.0|Video:<br />The new transfer looks great. It's sharp and grain is intact. However, it should be noted that the color-timing is not what you'd be used to for this film. It takes a tealish look, especially in certain scenes. The look works for the film, but it's certainly not what we have seen over the years on TV, VHS, DVD, screenshots, etc. It's a whole-new look for the film. Whether or not it was the intended look from the start, or whether James Cameron had a hand in making it look this way has yet to be seen. But over-all it is a superior transfer, and it makes owning this disc worth it.<br /><br />Sound:<br />Fairly active and robust surround sound here, but sadly it is the remix sound. The original mono with the original sound effects is missing once again, so expect a few moments of \\"Wow, the sound effects there were horrid.\\"<br /><br />Extras:<br />A couple of featurettes, nothing terribly formidable. Also, the deleted scenes in SD. All of the extras here can be found on the Special Edition DVD, and missing is the hour-long 'Other Voices' documentary and extensive Easter eggs also found on that release. This would have been the perfect time to deliver a feature-packed Blu-ray with all-new features, but alas...MGM/Fox has decided to cheap out this time. Maybe we'll get a 30th Anniversary Edition in 2014.

B0002DSUEI|5.0|It sounds amazing! One of the best CDs I have in terms of audio quality. Besides, the songs are fantastic. Highly recommended.
B005ETANC2|5.0|Back in the day, as we would say, this is a movie that still holds up.  Looking at the effects, you can see they really used a really spider that has been placed over the scene.  But the details are there, the spider knocks down a pole in one scene that is almost out of frame.  Great attention to detail!  Story is the same as the others, but still pretty good.  Worth a look if you like these types of movies!!

B0059XTU22|4.0|\\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is the first film in a new trilogy that takes place before \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" films. Peter Jackson returns to direct and a few familiar faces also make the journey back to Middle-earth not only in \\"An Unexpected Journey,\\" but will be popping up throughout the three new films. Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Andy Serkis revisit the beloved Tolkien characters in this film alone and special effects are again handled by Weta Workshop and Weta Digital. \\"An Unexpected Journey\\" is set 60 years before \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and follows a young Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) as he's recruited by Gandalf (McKellen) to be a burglar of sorts and assist Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) and 12 of his dwarf brethren as they set out on an adventure to the Lonely Mountain and retrieve it from the dragon Smaug so Thorin can finally become king.<br /><br />Seeing this in 3D and in 48 frames per second is incredibly different from the typical movie going experience. 48 frames per second takes some getting used to. Character movements and action sequences look sped up; almost like someone pressed fast forward on a VCR and forgot to press play. But then somebody starts talking and you realize that that is part of how it was filmed. Everything is just as rich in detail as you'd come to expect from these films, but it seems slightly enhanced compared to 9-11 years ago. It's not just because digital technology has improved since then either. Scenery looks like finely crafted paintings and simple things like the line of every stone, every strand of hair, and every thread of fabric is brought to life. These entities and these motions move and come to life in ways you never imagined.<br /><br />This may be the most efficient use of the 3D effect all year. Spit, broken teeth, and arrows all fly into your face as flaming pine cones are practically thrown into your lap. The feathers of the wings of giant birds seem to brush against your cheek. The special effects are outstanding and are as crisp and smooth as the most impressive video game cut scenes. Weta has always been a few steps ahead of the average special effects company with Industrial Light & Magic being a very close second, but Weta seems to have outdone themselves yet again. Animated characters are even smoother than they were in \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" they're more fluid, and textures are more detailed. Everything is just more polished overall.<br /><br />The new technology mostly works to the prequel's benefit, but there are a few setbacks. \\"An Unexpected Journey\\" is incredibly slow for the first 45 minutes or so, especially when you have to sit through the dwarves eating all of Bilbo's food, throwing plates around, belching, smoking, and singing. There's little to settle into at first other than Ian McKellen slipping back into the Gandalf role with ease as his body language and a slight curl of his upper lip say more about the character than the things that came out of his mouth half of the time. Meanwhile, Martin Freeman brings a little lighthearted humor to the Bilbo role. Even with him being so humble, modest, soft-spoken, and completely gutless, he's still quite humorous as are his interactions with just about everyone. With the slow pace in the first quarter of the film though, the 48 frames per second doesn't really work all that well. Things not only look weird at first, but the intricate details seem to reveal too much. Most of the set pieces and costume designs are revealed in this light that has the film come off as a glorified version of \\"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\\" or \\"Xena: Warrior Princess;\\" that is until you get used to it and the film picks up.<br /><br />The epic fantasy adventure doesn't really pick up until Dwalin (Ken Stott) tells the story of the pale orc. Shortly after, the trolls are introduced who have this \\"Three Stooges\\" mentality to them, are simpletons, andargue about how to cook everything. The troll interactions with the dwarves and Bilbo is not only exciting, but fairly amusing as well. From there, they travel to Rivendell where you see some more familiar faces, get caught in the middle of a stone giant battle that is quite the spectacle, and are eventually lead underground and have some really impressive sequences with goblins. Bilbo gets separated from the group and interacts with Gollum. Andy Serkis is really at the top of his game because Gollum's facial expressions alone are extraordinary and the entire game of riddles sequence is really entertaining.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is a lot like that beat up car you have sitting in the driveway. It doesn't always accelerate when it should, but once it gets going it's more reliable than anything. It's as if you have to let it roll downhill before starting the engine, as well. In other words, it may be a bit slow at first but be patient. The action is like a shy teenager at his first high school dance that has to warm up to everybody before finally loosening up. 48 frames per second is the same way as you eventually get used to it.<br /><br />\\"An Unexpected Journey\\" is so similar to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" though. Maybe that's one of the reasons it felt so rough to get through large chunks of it. The next two films will apparently venture in different directions from the original trilogy (this is coming from someone who hasn't read the books), so it seems like the best is yet to come. \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is definitely worth going all out for. See it in 3D and see it in 48 frames per second if you can just for the experience. The special effects are unbelievable and there are some extraordinary chase and battle sequences buried deep within some thick doses of tediousness, but \\"An Unexpected Journey\\" has this veil of monotony draped over it that it's never really able to shake. It's gorgeous in theaters, but it makes you wonder how it's going to translate to DVD and Blu-ray and its slow pace makes you wonder if repeat viewings might become somewhat of a burden.argue about how to cook everything.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|gets the job done. love that you can see the keys and math signs well. I use all the time wish they also made the app for a regular computer. hate the one that comes with windows cant see math signs.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is major in all of the Kindle Fire games in fact I think it's far better than Blood And Glory great job Gameloft!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Fast moving novel with strong characters.  I good quick read that keeps you anticipating next move by the bad guys.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|This movie isn't one to challenge your mind, but it's a sure hit for a light hearted good time.  One to watch when you want to escape for a bit.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Could not put this book down....I kept thinking about the characters and the story, wondering what would happen next. The story changed back and forth, giving the reader a clear picture without stealing the suspense.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I saw this in the theater. I loved it there and could not wait for it to come out on Blu Ray. When I had the 3 hours to just sit and enjoy it, I did. This movie really takes you on a ride. There are a few slow periods in the beginning, a few questionable situations, like Bruce recovering from a broken back, but, if you just want to be entertained and not think too hard about the reality in your entertainment, this is a great movie.<br /><br />One thing, I have to go back and look, but, I thought I noticed in a shot of the lower peninsula of &#34;Gotham&#34;, I could swear I saw the twin towers of the World Trade Center. I'm not positive, and have to go back to look, but if so, it is a nice little gift.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The author grabs you right from the beginning all the way to the last page. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a small, lightweight, and very effective blade sharpener.  I love the grooves on each side for your finger and thumb to get a good hold on the tool.  I used this on a blade made of very poor steel and it turned it razor sharp.  I also like the lanyard hole should I need that.  It is very lightweight and also has a sharpener for serrated knives, which I have not used yet.
0061537969|5.0|A life affirming, heartwarming story appropriate for all ages from teenagers up.  If you love dogs, that will make it even better for you!  I not only loved this book, I have given it as a gift to several people and they all loved it too.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|Had no idea what to expect other than action. When I finished watching,\\"What was that?\\" I mean a great big nothing. True story? Supposedly based on one but so what if thats 2 hours for 5 minutes of action, story?? Total waste of my time watching this. Not recommended for any one.
075669812X|5.0|My eight yr old grandson opened it at his party. Did not want to put it down. So glad i bought this.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I have not even finished this but I love it. Plenty of great action, well paced (fast), plenty of mystery. The best Bourne yet. Highly recommended.
B008ROH07W|5.0|There is something about Alison's playing. The way she tongues each note, it is very very clean, with out the typical rasp a trumpet creates when it's tongued. It was rather refreshing to listen to her play. Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne (Eternal Source of Light Divine)HWV 74 just has me in awe each time I listen to it. The way the cantor sings and then the trumpet comes in from behind and lifts up the sounds is just something! Her sound is just so pure, I really don't know how else to describe it. My next CD is going to be Alison Balsom Italian Concertos [Compilation], can't wait to get it!
B000GGSMB2|5.0|Arrived on time. My boyfriend loves this movie so he was very happy to have gotten this as a gift.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|yes i enjoyed this dvd very much i have watched all dvd so farand iam looking forward to episode 3 due out jan  2013<br />what i liked about it  is  the way of life and story line and how they dressed in that time era i also think many years have gone past  and time hasnt changed for the rich and  poor  well time matchers on
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Every song is great. One of those albums you listen straight through every time. Good variety of songs, but flows well.
B00979CS50|5.0|This went right to the top of my playlist.  Nobody puts out a 35 minute song anymore, except for neil.<br />It sounds new and classic at the same time.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I ordered this for the holiday toy drive at work. I know some reviewers said this was a collectible but it looks fine to me. Her bow is little but I had Barbie accessories just as fragile as a kid and got on fine. I love that she's edgy and tough and I think some little girl will be happy this Christmas.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I have enjoyed the game so far. I would remains the game to others to play. Interesting game,fun to play
B00AHXIC50|2.0|When Peter Gene Hernández, known by the stage name of Bruno Mars, came out with his first album `Doo-Wops & Hooligans' he became a singer whose persona was that of a crooner with a voice that was good at singing charming, edgeless, hip-hop-flavored ballads and would have possible be compared to Russ Colombo, Jack Johnson, Fabian, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Tony Bennett, Nat King Cole, Dick Powell, Barry Manilow, Michael Bublé, Engelbert Humperdinck, Julio Iglesias, Luis Miguel, Cristian Castro, Alejandro Fernández, Charlie Zaa,  or Johnny Mathis just to name a few comparable.<br />Fast forward a couple of years and arriving to the release of his third and most recent album `Unorthodox Jukebox', I guess Mr. Mars was looking for a sound comparable to that of Amy Winehouse's and be approved in not only a rhythmic station but also a pop music station. Well I'm happy to report that after listening to this album in its entirety, I believe that Bruno missed the spot by a long-shot! Let's start off with the song Gorilla, Mars should have just sang a cover of The Bloodhound Gang's The Bad Touch and it would have probably have the same impact as the song on the record! The song Locked Out of Heaven would have been better if it was sang by Sting or maybe it just sounds like it should have been written for Sting? Moonshine sounded as if Mars wanted to gain the Michael Jackson fan following, while the other songs cover the genres of being a bad boyfriend/lover, tramps, strippers, and thieves with the choice language being seasoned throughout some of the songs. The faithful followers would purchase this album even if it had sounds of flatulence of deferent levels and qualities, The people that love music would probably just borrow the album from a friend and just copy it, and then there are those that will acquire the album as a proof of the demise of a dream or of someone that had a good thing going and just didn't know what to do with it.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Great buy! My ps3 makes this thing look amazing, can't wait to give it to the wife for Cmas! boooooya cashaaa!!!
B005OC5CLQ|4.0|This is a good first album.  I was not a Scotty fan, but this was the 2nd album I've purchased as a Christmas gift for my mother.  (I think she would have adopted Scotty if he'd been up for adoption, but she voted for him numerous times.)  I like this album, and he seems to have matured quickly into what sounds like a seasoned artist.  My  favorite tracks are: Water Tower Town, You Make That Look Good, and Dirty Dishes, but all the songs are good.  If you are a fan of Scotty, I'm sure you will not regret buying this one.
B009KY5OGC|3.0|Good read, but very long chapters.  Wish it was broken up more.  Each chapters starts out with quick history that occured.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|This was a great album.  I really like all of the original versions of the songs sung by the cast.  I was expecting to have some of the songs sung by known artists on the album.  That was a disappointment.
1455502758|5.0|Christopher Hitchens has been a hero of mine for many years.  Even though he was a polemicist, he made many good points regarding organized religion and faith in general.  Some may not agree with him but he is a wonderful writer.
B009YX02T8|5.0|I have enjoyed each of the Twilight albums.  This album is great with each of the featured songs.  I really enjoyed the instrumental piece at the end of the soundtrack.
1439152802|5.0|This was a great book which I thoroughly enjoyed, definitely a page turner. The plot was pretty unpredictable and it contained rich characters.
B000005RUV|5.0|Who didn't enjoyed Wake Me Up Before You Go Go in High School dancing with pony tails and skirts with neon colors or heard the 1st sqweaking of a mattress listening to careless whispers with the voice of George Michael in the 80's? I was a little kid but I loved the music wanting to do the same as them but I was forbidden for being too young
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This is another enjoyable listen from Mumford & Sons. Another in a sting of good entertainment. I highly recommend it.
B000TJQ75O|5.0|This CD is good to listen and use the sense of relaxation remembering parts of the 90's good music to re-enjoy your past times with your friends in a High School reunion
1250027624|3.0|Not as interesting as the first one, but still a pleasent diversion. This handbook for the upcoming series will appreciated by Downton followers everywhere.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing! This book was by far the best! Can't wait to see the movie! So glad peeta didn't die! :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Amazon keeps updating app to help the reading experience become even better. I prefer to purchase books, mags, etc off of this app over any other out there.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So so so much better than the movie! I haven't read a story this good sine I put down the last Harry potter book.
B00866JL96|4.0|I read the book, thought I'd see how it came out on the big screen. Good movie to watch. Would definitely recommend it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love to play this.  I finished the first 5 levels in about 2 days but those Zombie keep comming.  Level 6, then 7  and now onto 8.  Can't put it down...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good read. Couldn't put it down. I can't wait to see it turns out as a movie. I love Nicholas Sparks books.
B002UF95XG|5.0|While this isn't absolutely top-drawer Hitchcock I sure enjoyed it.The way this DVD is presented adds a lot. Leonard Maltin's 29-minute discussion extra is informative and gives good context of the movie to we viewers. Three different endings to Topaz were filmed and this offering contains all three plus Maltin's clip detailing the story behind the multiple endings.<br /><br />Also, I have a certain affinity for this film after seeing it at the theater as a kid. I suspect virtually everyone reading this can strongly relate to this tendency to perhaps perceive a movie as somewhat better than it probably is, viewing it now on DVD many years later.<br /><br />I should rate Topaz a four-star entertainment but Amazon invites you to rate this &#34;product&#34; and Its clean print, nice packaging, and a half dozen extras add up to a tip-top &#34;evening at the movies&#34;.
B0098HGNGG|2.0|I was a happy owner of the Sekonic L-358 Flash meter right up until the day that I dropped it. As I am not a photographer who wishes to rely on my camera for light readings, I knew that I was going to buy a replacement meter. For my needs, I looked between a straight-up replacement of the L-358 and the L-478D. I decided to go for the newer L478D as the newer features struck me as something that I could grow into.<br /><br />My problem with this device is not how well it works but it's design. Quite frankly, I find the touch screen design to be awkward to easily control/use. Versus pressing the buttons and spinning the scroll wheel of the older L-358, the touch screen buttons are small and very easy to mis-touch. It can be frustrating because my thumb all too often covers the reading display while I am trying to get a reading because the display is placed in the center of the scroll arrows.<br /><br />It's not that I am opposed to touch screen control, but this is a device that small enough that it 100% touch screen control is impractical. In my opinion, it is an item/device that could have been better served with a combination of touch screen features while keeping some mechanical features like a manual scroll wheel on the side of the device.<br /><br />My other problem with this device is that I really feel as though I was getting less product for more money. My first reason for this is that a Reflected Light Attachment was not included as part of this product's overall package. While I never used the Reflected Light Attachment frequently when I had it with the L-358, I did use it and it seemed to be an appropriate part of the overall meter package. Now it seems that the company is just trying to up-sell a 5 degree spot viewfinder for an additional $100 (approx).<br /><br />My second reason is because the device uses AAA batteries versus the CR123A Lithium Battery for the the L-358 and the battery drain on this device is substantial.<br /><br />It's tough to writethis because I like Sekonic products and I don't want to give the impression that I think that it's a bad product as I am using it and have been happy with the results I am getting in my photographs. That said, it's just a bit too much tech in its interface design and, given a chance to do it all over again, I would have stayed with the L-358.
B00122MBY8|5.0|I looked everwhere for this album, rated by Rolling Stone as one of the very best of all time. Found it here, and yes, this album lives up to the raves. I enjoy listening to Astral Weeks quite often.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|Enjoyed this story, but was left hanging at the end which I know was intentional. For anyone who have ever participated in endurance sports, there are sections in the story you&#34;ll relate too!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I liked it so much that I bought the paid version. You can only play up to one level and then you have to paid for the full version so that you can add stuff to the fish tank.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Maggie Smith has all the BEST lines and offers comic relief when needed.  Love the series, the story line and wonderful acting. How refreshing to find such great entertainment that can be watched over and over with new eyes.  Can't wait for Season 3 to begin and see where it will take all our favorite characters.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Loved the app. works great on the kindle since its bigger than the phone. Only thing is if you lose, you start alllll the way at the beginning level.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|My husband and I just finished viewing the entire first season - needless to say we watched &#34;with our mouths opened&#34; on the edge of our seats.  What a great series.  We cannot wait for I believe, the season finally this Sunday.
006097625X|4.0|I think writer can explain how to write a comic in graphic is an easy-to-read style. I like it. So I have realized that when writing a comic, what factors that I should concern.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|A lot of people seem to think it's a dumb movie but I liked it. It had a few cute references to the original. The graphics are pretty impressive and the cast is brilliant.
1591841666|5.0|I bought this book for my teens to read.  Its required at our house.  Its great for understanding our own human nature when taking on a new project or goal.  I also love the business application, its a very fast read and highly recommended.
0399213015|3.0|Good story, wish it was a bit cheaper than what I ended up paying for it. The flip pages are a little difficult the first few readings but it worked out in the end
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|My satisfying first purchase, delivered on-time, great packaging that ensuring the goods arrived undamaged, and a great movie! One of my favorites actually. I loved Focus Features films because of their simplicity and mostly low budgeted movies, which often accompanied by a great storytelling and a good directing. Sometimes I have to get out of those Hollywood big budgeted films, to understand more about films.<br /><br />This one is a very comforting film, beautifully directed by Joe Wright, the sceneries and settings will soothe your mind and refresh your soul. Dario Marianelli is one of my favorite composer, and he's attached a more playful tone in this one rather than a much more 'serious' and 'deep' Atonement score. All in all, I'm satisfied in making this purchase.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|Very cute movie, my son has us watch it daily. Has a lot of laughs for kids and adults alike.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|The game has a vibrate option that you cannot turn off. I've checked every setting even in the 'back button' menu. The other glitch is if you release a ball at the very end of the level it does not count toward your total on the next level. This can get annoying if you wait and get a + 20 at the end
0545265355|4.0|I got this as a Christmas gift for someone since they love the series. The editions are solid and the casing is sturdy and should last a long time. A lot of sets like this come with flimsy packaging but this seems well made.
0345803485|5.0|The book captures the reader from the very  beginning. it is hard to put down. it  leaves you wanting to know more or what is going to happen next. i would  definitely recommend to others.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Love this show! Humor, drama and wonderful writing. Deff one to come back to again and again. Packaging is well done as well, not a lot of show's that are put to DVD have durable packaging.
B00571F26Y|5.0|It's a fascinating book that has made me change the way I look at food and will change my diet completely.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I just finished SLAMMED by Colleen Hoover for the fisrt time. I forgot it was on my to read list. Well I must say Patty stop crying already dang it. I loved the book and what life can throw at you at anytime. Thanks Colleen for a great read!
0307341550|5.0|Sharp Objects is a murder mystery that will keep you guessing until the VERY end.  I can't even imagine what it must take to weave a story together like this.<br />Camille Preaker is a newspaper reporter who is assigned to cover a child's murder in her hometown.  As the story progresses, we see that Camille has a connection to these murders.  The subject matter is very disturbing, to say the least.  There are some descriptions of the victims that were hard for me to read.<br />The resolution to this story is VERY surprising.  I had to reread a couple of pages because I didn't think I haread correctly.  It was a little \\"out there.\\"  But it had all the things I look for in a novel:  it held my attention (and then some), surprised me, made me think, and had a character that I rooted for.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|What choice would you make for the one you love? Chris chose to make Emily happy. The emotions and choices made by these teens are something most of us never experience. This is definitely a must read.
0316056863|5.0|What a hilarious memoir.  Simply put, if you are a fan of Tina, you will love this book.  She writes it the same way she talks.  I was literally laughing out loud through the whole thing and quoting her at work.  I love how self-deprecating and \\"real\\" she seems.  She is not afraid to show embarrassing pictures of herself as an adolescent or talk about those awkward moments we all have in life (i.e. first trip to the gynecologist).  So light and fun, easy and fast to get through.  Loved it!
B008OOYALE|3.0|I love love looooove mystical creatures, dragons especially... I JUST got this app and it's enjoyable but if you like fast paced games I wouldn't recommend this! Also, the entire screen randomly turned blue... I understand the game can't be perfect considering the fact that it's free but come on...
B006QS0PF0|5.0|This is such an honest, moving account of De Rossi's struggles with an eating disorder and coming to terms and being open about her homosexuality.  I have a family member who suffered from anorexia, and De Rossi depicts it so truthfully.  It is a devastating disease, and we see the painful pictures, but rarely do we get such an honest look at the disease.  I have so much respect for her, after reading this book.  When I first saw her in Ally McBeal (at the height of her illness), I (and I think everyone at the time) thought what a beautiful woman this is.  Gradually I think bits and pieces of what she was going through became apparent, at least through pictures.  But I don't think you can prepare yourself for what was going on behind closed doors until you read this book.  It is so exceptional and rare that a celebrity shares the most difficult parts of their lives with you; in this case, it was something that really came close to ending her life.  I applaud her for her strength to come through strong, happy, and confident.  She is a success story, and I feel she could give hope to others who are suffering through something similar.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Purchased for my husband who enjoys watching this over and over.<br />Nice packaging.  Would definitely recommend.<br />Great gift purchase for anyone.
030758836X|4.0|Wow!  I loved this book and have fallen in love with Gillian Flynn's style of writing.<br />This is a book of a marriage gone horribly wrong.  When his wife disappears on their fifth anniversary, Nick finds himself as the prime suspect in her murder.  As the novel goes on and switches points of view and throws in his wife's (Amy) journal entries from years ago, you start to learn that NOTHING is as it seems.  This book is addictive; I found myself reading it very quickly but trying to stretch it out so it wasn't over so fast!<br />A couple of negatives:  The ending is...disappointing.  However, it didn't make the book \\"bad\\" in my eyes; not all books should be happily ever after.  Also, there is quite a bit of foul language, if that bothers you.  And, while there were times when I identified and rooted for both Nick and Amy, by the end I hated them both.<br />I think Flynn's brilliant writing and surprising plot twists made up for the negatives.
B000002TYX|5.0|Ordered these for my husband as a Christmas Gift.<br />He was very pleased with this product.<br />Definitely recommend.<br />I purchased all three
0307341577|5.0|So I have read all three of Gillian Flynn's books (this, Sharp Objects, and Gone Girl- as far as I know those are her only books).  And this one is my favorite.<br />Libby Day was 7 when her mother and two sisters were killed in the middle of the night.  Her testimony put her older brother behind bars for their murders.<br />Fast forward to 25 years later, and a man from a \\"Kill Club\\" contacts her and makes her rethink everything.  Maybe her \\"memories\\" of that night aren't so reliable.<br />It is a horrible thing to imagine what losing your whole family (her father isn't in the picture) is like, and I've seen criticisms that Libby is unlikable.  Libby really isn't an upstanding citizen with a lot of good qualties, so I can see that point.  But I kept putting myself in her shoes and imagining what kind of person I would turn into if something that horrendous had happened to me at that age (or any age), and I felt Libby was redeemable.  It would be unrealistic to have Libby be this doctor or lawyer or PTO mom after all she'd been through, so I just thought it made her seem \\"real\\" to have flaws. Also, by the end we could see signs of her slowly changing and becoming a better person.<br />It is a very dark story, as are all Flynn books, and if you are faint of heart it may be hard to get through.  I can't wait for her to write more books!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Did not want it to end.  It was heart warming, tender and I felt like part of the family.<br />Strongly recommend it.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|But i wished it came in its original case instead of the generic. However great movie always enjoy it. it is definitly worth the purchase
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I had no idea that waking to soft music could be so calming, but I am loving this feature and the way it increases in volume insures that I do hear it.  Better than some obtrusive noise!
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|A silly movie. The plot is quite predictable right from the beginning. Overly bad acting. Turned it off 3/4 way through.<br /><br />I can't believe Oliver Stone put his name on this movie. What happened to him, where's the superb job he did in 'Platoon' and 'The Doors'.
B001O9CR3O|3.0|First, as others have said, the performance is not lacking in any way.  Great set list, band is on spot, band and crowd energy is through the roof.  My issues are with the DVD itself.<br /><br />My case arrived with a broken hinge - not the end of the world, but frustrating.  The video editing isn't the best either.  There are very few good shots of the rest of the band, and when there are, they last for no more than a second or 2 (no exaggeration)!<br /><br />And now the real issue - the region code.  The Amazon listing labels the region as \\"All\\", and the back of the case even says 100% playability. This is not true - this disc does not play in American DVD players.  Fortunately, I was able to change some settings to get one of my computer's media players to play the disc.  If it wasn't for that, I'd be making a return.

B001QXCYZY|2.0|I've read couple of articles saying that this mic is a really good USB mic. And that's why I bought it. While C-1 works great via mixer, C-1U doesn't work as expected via USB because it doesn't seem to get enough power through USB port. Behringer doesn't mention that at all, nor provides solution for modern OS.<br />In other words, I found only 1 workaround to get clear and strong input signal from this mic on Windows 7. And that method only works if you need to do voice acting or record a podcast. If you need to simultaneously record a video and audio, you are out of luck because you will not hear a thing in that video.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I received this watch for Christmas this year. I think it's a fantastic time piece. Granted I don't know much about the specifics of a fine watch, but as I've been wearing them for a long time I think this is the nicest watch I've owned ever. I'm not the sort to wear really flashy items, and usually my accessories need to fit a practical use. That being said, I don't feel comfortable wearing this to my very hands on, physical job- but as soon as I get home I throw it on, and it looks and feels very nice.
