1451695195|5.0|His story is fascinating ....the details of his illness show how incredible it is for him to just be alive today much less functioning full again.  An amazing story of nothing short of a miracle...I know there are skeptics out there who don't believe his story or in miracles...I'm so glad I'm not one of you.
B0045XICB2|5.0|Was not disappointed.  Really looking forward to seeing the next movie now.  Such a great story line, would highly recommend.
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|Superb!<br />Clapton is the best at taking you in to feel the blues inside him.<br />His technique, as always, is beautiful.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have to say that this is one of those amazing ideas which is well crafted down to the finest detail. PERSONALLY, I thought the end was disappointing...but maybe I'm too orthodox for Gillian Flynn :). Either way, she deserves props for a very well thought out plot...most of the time :)
B00005JLIU|5.0|Came on time and was a great movie. My son was in this show for middle school and this worked great to help us with the songs and lines.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Beautifully written, artfully crafted.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern is one of 'those' writers. It boggles my mind that she was able to put such and intricate and wonderful story together using the same 26 letters I use everyday :). BUY THE BOOK!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I cant beat level 23 in ground hog day need help good game its awome I beat when pigs fly in one day it deleted my data to so I best when pigs fly 2 times need help on ground hog day level 23
B003UYUP58|3.0|Maybe I am insufficiently intellectual for this particular work. I find it interesting in patches (most of those patches are at the beginning and included in the sample) but after a while it gets increasingly dry and boring. Again, it could be me...but it starts to feel like the science class you take after lunch with a tired teacher. This book makes me itch to go do something else....which is why I 've been about half way through for months!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|love the fun of this app!  Dying for the Hoth update!!! It keeps me entertained! Definitely worth downloading! Do it now!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this will not download onto my device.<br />just be aware that if you try to download it it may crash or freeze your device i still give it five stars because my friend showed me and it looks cool.
0425263916|4.0|The second book of the &#34;Bared to You&#34; novel was everything and more. Gideon and Eva are both damaged from early abuse, but are trying to find a way to love. Many are trying to sabotage their relationship. Sylvia Day has created a group of fascinating characters and a pair of lovers to cheer for. I can't wait for book #3. love can heal old wounds.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Enjoyed this, little too much sex! Good continuation of story line... would recommend to friends, but not my mother or father.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|This is one of the best comics to movie adaptions I've seen yet.  I can't help but love Tony Stark and his personality.  He seems like he would be so annoying in real life though.  This is a great setup for the Avengers (which is also an awesome movie)
B007HGPBRC|3.0|While Christopher Hitchens' passing is a loss for his followers; he was one writer who always fascinates, I found his last work tedious. I always found his use of big words, when little words suffice, to be his Achilles. 'Mortality' was no exception.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best romantic movies I have ever seen. It's clean, it's funny, and it's heartfelt. The acting is wonderful, the costuming and music is excellent, and the morals are great. If you haven't seen it, I weep for you.
B00124BNF4|4.0|It's a greatest hit's album and it was on sale.  If you don't know what the Talking Heads sound like, by all means, purchase this album.  If you know what they sound like - either buy it or don't (I'd wait until it goes  back on sale).
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My 2 grandchildren (girls 3 and almost 6) really loved this.  It changed their Halloween plans from princesses to Tinkerbell and Periwinkle!  They identified with the &#34;sister theme&#34; of the movie.
B005LAIGNC|2.0|I,m sorry to inform you that the blu-ray version has not been able to run,as you have sent the wrong area.You sent the same version that will only run on &#34;A&#34; REGION Blu-ray players.

B002NZTZ8S|4.0|Good modern Christmas movie especially if your kids are into trains like mine!  Good messages and situations portrayed that get kids to think.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Mr. Tough has done an excellent job summarizing key ways children succeed. He provides well-researched guidance regarding how parents, educators and others can improve outcomes for all children.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is another of Connelly's Lincoln Lawyer series.  All top notch tales of a smart, aggressive attorney.  The victim is a bank executive who was murdered in the bank's parking structure.  The suspect, a local mother who has been very vocal in her fight to keep the bank from foreclosing on her home.  The evidence against her piles up alarmingly giving the lawyer a momentous challenge.  The courtroom drama is thick as the lawyer begins to weave a story linking organized crime families in an attempt to provide an alternate theory.  The courtroom skirmishes between the prosecution and defense are powerfully presented.  This is no surprise as powerful writing is what Michael Connelly does and The Fifth Witness is no exception.  A little twist near the end is of much interest.
B004V5A7K8|1.0|Have tried several times to install or re-install and all I get is an error.  It is too bad because I was looking forward to playing it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham just doesn't write any bad books.  Superbly spun tale as only Grisham can do.  His words flow like water taking you easily and gladly through his story.  In this delightfully intriguing tale Grisham invents a jailhouse lawyer who puts together an insanely wonderful and complicated strategy in order to bring justice to a murderer, freedom to the wrongly accused, and liberation with money for himself.  All of this by tying the U.S. Justice Dept. in legal knots.  A brilliantly fun read.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Not the usual high stakes court room drama he is famous for, but a fun read about the possible &#34;End Run&#34; around a misguided system of justice with just enough facts to keep it compelling and believable.  Fun read from a master story teller.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|While it does show notifications and browsing between menus is easy, the main newsfeed only loads a few posts.  If you scroll to the bottom of the page, it seems as if it will continue to load past posts. I have experimented with it, thinking that I was too impatient, and it just needed some more time.  I left it as it was, and after returning five minutes later, the screen is still the same, and you can go no further.  Fairly disappointing.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|i liked this book a great deal. however i did not care for the ending. the ending was to contrived, and too many<br />plots going on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This has got to be one of the best books I've ever read!! I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the next one!
B005OGYHB8|5.0|Bought this after seeing them perform on AXS channel.  I was never really a big Guns 'n Roses fan but I've really enjoyed the music on this CD!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|We have tried other app versions of the Bible but they never really worked the way we expected.  Initially it was a little confusing to get the account set up but once we did it was smooth sailing.  One of the things we really like is having so many different translations and the ease with which you can change from one to another.  We have WiFi at our church but sometimes we are places where WiFi isn't available but we would still like to read the Bible or look something up.  So, having many offiline choices makes YouVersion an even better fit for our family.

0547884591|5.0|Tim has done it once again with the 4 Hour Chef. As someone who read both versions of the 4 Hour Workweek and the 4 Hour Body multiple times I had very high expectations for this book especially after hearing him write about it on his blog and be interviewed on numerous podcasts. Well, this book exceeded all of the expectations. As both someone who does enjoy cooking and learning new schools both parts of this book are of interest to me. I could do without some of the survival parts with cricket recipes (especially being a vegetarian) but who knows. I strongly recommend this book for both cooks and those looking in general to learn how to gain new schools. Tim is very honest in the book on how cooking kicked his ass which is why he used that as his skill to learn. I know it is a book I will pick up and read parts for some time to come.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I first heard Of Monsters And Men on the radio with their song \\"Little Talks.\\" From there, I picked up their EP INTO THE WOODS, which only included four songs. Then this album came out and I snapped it up at once and it was just as great as I hope it would be. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Simply amazing! I am sure t be reading the rest of the series with no shortage. I love Katniss a whole lot
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|We lost this movie when we moved across the country. My kids loved this so much, and so did I, that I didn't mind buying it again.
0385535147|5.0|You have to pay attention to the timeline in this book. It isn't easy to sort out the bad guys and the good guys.  By the time you get to the end it all makes sense. I hope John Grisham lives to write a hundred more books.
B005LLSNNE|3.0|Like any series, it starts to get old and some of the content is repetious.  I really liked it when it first came out but it is like anything else, all good things seem to come to an end.
B009P5S11G|1.0|After listening to this album, all I can say is \\"What happened Rihanna?\\" Being a big fan of \\"Talk That Talk\\" and finding it to be a big improvement over the half-filler album \\"Loud,\\" I was looking foward to where she'd go next. And man, did \\"Diamonds\\" show promise!<br /><br />Let's face it, Rihanna has always been someone with a dark tone in her music on \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" and \\"Rated R,\\" two down-right amazing albums. \\"Music of The Sun\\" and \\"A Girl Like Me\\" even had their edge and relaxed mood.<br />Except for \\"Diamonds,\\" this is completely gone and replaced with \\"I am from the hood\\" nonsense. What is she talking about? Exactly how long ago was that, and is it even true? \\"Presh Off The Runway\\" is good in a humorous way, but this is about it. All this is being \\"hood\\" without any purpose. It doesn't work at all.<br /><br />It is hard to take any of this album seriously save from \\"Diamonds\\" and Track 11, the \\"Love Without Tragedy/Mary Mary\\" song which was very interesting.<br /><br />This is something Rihanna should \\"apologize\\" for, as it seems she is just churning out album after album and we have to hope it turns out ok, which was the case with \\"Talk That Talk\\" and the just ok \\"Loud.\\" \\"Unapologetic\\" is just plain bad, and should be purchased by no one.<br /><br />Rihanna, we love you, but this isn't you! We can't stand under your umbrella forever, and keep routing you on and buying your albums if your heart and soul doesn't return to the music.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Dumbest movie i have ever seen; not even the barely  clad bodies are worth the money.  All I can say is purchase at your own risk.

B009A87X80|5.0|This is a great CD full of beautiful music and a nice mix....For those that are new to her, Adele sounds a lot like her to me.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|She's known for changing it up with every record musically and look wise, she did it again. It's a solid pop record full of messages. As she calls herself \\"a message girl\\". I liked how cohesive the album is. It's has a lot of up-tempos as well as mid-tempos and a few ballads, which are always the best of Xtina's albums.<br />I absolutely love the album. I consider myself a hardcore Xtina fan and I'm very picky with her so, she delivered this time.
B000S5BXAS|3.0|love Mark Lanegan, but not this album. Sound is thin. Blues Funeral is much better. So are his Screaming trees albums.

B000HKYBXA|4.0|It was a very long movie, so be prepared. This helped in following along in the written play that was a requirement for class. It was a word for word from the book to the movie. Need to a Shakespeare person to love it, but it was good.
0307001369|5.0|My grandson is 16 months old. He is interested in learning the names of things. He points, I name it. This book is great because it names common everyday items we all use (along with some funny ones, such as a pickle car!) I've always loved Richard Scarry's books. The artwork and humor is very appealing to children. Since these books have been around for quite awhile, there are some items (just a few) such as an eggbeater and stove coffeepot that most people don't use regularly anymore, but they are good for explaining how things used to be when Grandma was a kid. It's one of his favorite books.
0547884591|5.0|I love Tim Ferriss's style. In 4 Hour Chef he breaks down cooking, flavors, and entertaining into basic scientific rules. I've been looking forward to this for a long time, and read through the massive kindle book in a long evening.<br /><br />The photos are beautiful, as well. At some point I'll have to buy the print edition just to have it around-it's color coded and looks great.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I think the star wars angry birds is the best one of them all. The artists did a great job with the story pictures as well.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|What this movie is like:  A taut drama with more emotion underneath than any movie you have ever seen.  If you like a movie that will put you on the edge of your seat because of your mind rather than sheer bloodlust, or due to sheer bloodlust for that matter, this is for you.  The violence is considerable, but not gratuitous.  That will be the reason why it disturbs most sensitive viewers.  But it is one of those film experiences that you will remember in a deep and lasting way.  Ryan Gosling's performance is nothing short of excellent.  He is the second coming of Brando without the personality defects.    For comparisons with other films, I would describe it thus:  Collateral without the running and with more heart.    For an extended review, go see [...]

B00007AJF8|4.0|Being John Malkovich(released Oct/99)stars John Cusack as Craig Schwartz,Cameron Diaz plays Lotte Schwartz, Catherine Keener plays Maxine Lund,Orson Bean plays Dr. Lester,and of course John Malkovich as himself.Shot in the late 90s when Malkovich's career was quite hot,I found this strange and off the wall film is SO strange,it was good.This was director Spike Jonze's directorial,feature film,debut.Jonze has done for film,thematically at least,what Spike Jones did for music.<br />The story here starts with the life of a struggling artist/puppeteer,Craig.He is married to Lotte who owns a menagerie of animals,not the least of which is a chimp who has \\"issues\\".Out of work,Craig finally applies for a real job,which takes him to the 7 and 1/2 floor of an old office building in NYC.The boss there is one Dr Lester,a kind old man,whose secretary has a doctorate in speech impedimentology(?),but has trouble understanding the simplest of phrases.<br />Craig meets and falls hard for a woman who works on the that floor,Maxine.His feelings are unrequited,and he has to work through them through his puppets at night.One day he drops a file behind a cabinet.He pulls it out only to discover a trapped door.Behind that is a tunnel/portal which he soon discovers leads directly into the mind of John Malkovich.After about 15 minutes in his mind,one is deposited beside the busy New Jersey Turnpike.He tells his wife,who takes the \\"plunge\\"also.She will repeat the process and come to think she should really be a woman.That is because Maxine,who Craig has told also,has actually gone through the portal and gone out with John in person.However Lotte was in John's mind at that time and she has fallen hard for Maxine,and Maxine has developed affections for Lotte also.<br />Craig and Maxine have,in the interim,set up a business on the side of allowing people to enter the portal for $200 a pop.Craig gets jealous of the time Maxine and his wife spend together and he locks his wife up temporarily in the chimp cage.Craig has newly discovered that he can now control the amount of time he spends in J.M.'s body,and Maxine and he become an item.Lotte escapes her imprisonment and heads for Dr Lester's home.On a previous visit she had noticed a room full of pictures of Malkovich.She now asks him what his interest in him is.He explains that he has been going from one body to the next for over a hundred years now and that he,and others that he has chosen,will transfer inside J.M's mind on the day of his 44th birthday.Lester invites her to accompany them.<br />Craig/Malkovich and Maxine eventually marry and have a child.Craig has removed Malkovich from his acting to career to pursue an overly successful career in puppeteering.On his 44th birthday he receives a call from Lester demanding he get out of Malkovich's mind or else Maxine will die.It is a bluff,but in the end it works.Lester and his friends enter J.M's mind on schedule.The film ends as we see the couple Maxine and Lotte on a beach with Maxine's daughter.From inside the girl's mind we hear Craig longing for the affections of Maxine.<br />What a plot,eh? It sounds so bizarre retelling it,but you really have to see it to believe it.There are so many neat touches such as Malkovich's close friend Charlie Sheen,popping in and out of the film from time to time.And watch for the pre-911 NYC skyline with the twin towers in evidence.Director Jonze does a nice job of layering the film.He slowly introduces us to his main characters and their quirks,allowing time for us to believe what we see,then builds upon the foundation,ending at the most quirkiest and dizziest heights I have ever seen.Also there is a point in the film where Malkovich actually enters his own mind,and what a hoot that turns out to be.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is quite clear.Extras abound here and include several featurettes,along with the trailer and commentary.<br />All in all a nice but bizarre film that will certainly have you scratching your head at times.I found the plot so out there,so off the wall and different that I liked it.Recommended.rtainly have you scratching your head at times.I found the plot so out there,so off the wall and different that I liked it.Recommended.
B009MF56GC|5.0|These are Real He Men at their best!  You won't find rubber suites or CGI's in this movie.  Stallone and the gang are back with a bigger and better action movie.  The drama and light humor mix well together and the result is a wonderfully entertaining movie.  Can't wait for &#34;The Expendables 3&#34;! ;-)

B0070Y46UY|5.0|But a great read for teens and adults.  A few parts were a bit to graphic.  Over all an excellent read.<br />Looking foreward to the movie.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is SO hard and SO rewarding. I have found earlier strategies that don't work in later levels, but I am slowly getting in the swing of things. I can't wait until I have a larger screen to play on.<br /><br />If you're bored with crosswords or Sudoku puzzles but want something puzzle-like to challenge your brain, this is DEFINITELY worth it. I have never been so frustrated or proud of myself over a puzzle before. When I play I can smell the steam coming from my brain!
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I'll try to remain spoiler free.  The beginning was fun - the self-aware redshirt concept is a good time.  Unfortunately, the novel degenerates into a sort of meta vanity project in the second half.  The Codas are just an explanation of motivations that seemed completely unnecessary.  I didn't bother finishing them.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because I did read the novel portion in two sittings, and thoroughly enjoyed the first sitting. A novel deserves an &#34;okay&#34; rating if it at least gives you that much.
B00448VST6|5.0|This movie was amazing! Hilarious and interesting. Almost like Spy Kids 3, only done right.<br />I would recommend this movie to all of my friends, and I will watch it over and over again.<br />I will also knit the Scott Pilgrim hat from the movie:)
B001FB4W0W|2.0|The discs are in pretty good condition I'm sure they will all work fine BUT the original case it came in is all beat to hell and is covered in this sticky, crusty stuff that looks like snot or syrup and in sharpie on the box and every disc is the girls name who previously owned them. I'm throwing out the terrible disgusting box, but I'm keeping the DVDs. Unfortunately now I have to buy them a different case.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I watched this movie because I heard so good things about it and also I have a young son that I figured would like it. I thought it was a very cute movie. Of course for an adult it was pretty predictable what was going to happen. Then main plot of the story is for a \\"old\\" criminal to reinvent himself with a new crime that was so big to prove that he wasn't out of the game. A new and young criminal tries to compete with him through out the movie. In the end it shows Gru growing as a person and showing a much better side of him. I really like that it shows a different side of a bad guy. Of course the little yellow men where so cute. There were tons of them.<br /><br />We loved this movie so much that we bought the DVD to watch over an over again. I would recommend to anyone with small children, although adults will love this film as well.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|got this for our 5 year granddaughter to watch while she was with us overnight.  She asked to see it again the morning.
B002SYXCVK|1.0|Tried to purchase this with an Amazon free link but was charged for it anyway  then it wouldn't import to my itunes.<br />I will not purchase anymore music through Amazon for the very reason that it will not import to iTunes but wants only to play in the Amazon Cloud which I do not choose to utilize.<br /><br />I tried to locate any way to contact Amazon about all of the above but could not do so.  I have taken the Cloud off my computer and therefore also wasted the money for the CD.
B006P0FIGU|1.0|This movie is just...oh it's so bad I can't even find the words. I decided to watch this because I am a big fan of The Three Musketeers and have seen every version since those from the '70s. I didn't expect much from this but I at least assumed it would be watchable.<br /><br />I was terribly mistaken. And I thought the '93 version with Charlie Sheen was bad! Little did I know.<br /><br />With this you get a lot of bad acting, corny special effects and pathetic dialogue. The only thing good about this movie is the setting and costumes which are breathtakingly beautiful. Other than that...this movie is a dog. Oh wait, excuse me I'm wrong. Actually this movie is more like what the dog leaves behind on the carpet.<br /><br />It's 2012 and Hollywood has access to super technology that could've really made this film a masterpiece for the new generation. Instead we get an MTV version of The Three Musketeers and Orlando Bloom with a pompadour.<br /><br />No thank you.

B0091LS07E|4.0|\\"Girl On Fire\\" is Alicia Keys' fifth studio album and her first since getting married and becoming a mother. Opening the album is the beautiful piano intro \\"De Novo Adagio\\" on which she displays her classical training. \\"It's been a while, I'm not who I was before\\" she declares on \\"Brand New Me\\", a tender piano ballad co-penned with Emile Sand&eacute; that reaches a delightful crescendo with a full band sound.<br /><br />Upping the tempo is \\"When It's All Over\\" co-penned with John Legend and co-produced by Jamie Smith (from The XX) and which sounds like House music shorn of thumping bass and beats, replaced with loose clattering beats and a Jazzy sound with ghostly electronic flourishes. Her son Egypt makes a cute cameo at the end of the song. \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" is co-penned again with Legend, and co-produced by Rodney \\"Darkchild\\" Jerkins and is a beautiful midtempo Neo Soul groove sprinkled with Jazzy piano and haunting synth strings. \\"New Day\\" sets thundering martial beats to a euphoric feel-good song with production by Dr. Dre and hubby Swizz Beatz.<br /><br />\\"Girl On Fire\\" is cut from a similar musical fabric as \\"No One\\" or \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\": a spare sound with insistent beats sprinkled with piano and tribal chants. It features a very fitting rap by Nicki Minaj and is co-penned and produced with salaam Remi. Taking the tempo down and singing about another type of flame is the sultry ballad \\"Fire We Make\\", a duet with Maxwell which features muted horns and an incendiary guitar solo by Gary Clark Jr. The retro Soul ballad \\"Tears Always Win\\" is co-written and produced by Bruno Mars and The Smeezingtons and has a light Gospel fervor.<br /><br />\\"Not Even The King\\" is a spare piano ballad that is just Alicia and her keys, co-penned with Emile Sand&eacute; again on which she sings \\"Some people so poor all they got is money, Oh in darkness, Some peoṗle wait till they count all their assets, I don't care what they bring, They can have everything, They can't afford what we got, Not even the king\\" in soft breathy tones. \\"That's When I Knew\\" is a lovely acoustic ballad co-penned with Babyface and recalling Stevie Wonder. \\"Limitedless\\" is Reggae/Dancehall, while the trippy ballad \\"One Thing\\" is a Frank Ocean co-write. Closing is yet another Emile Sand&eacute; co-write; \\"101\\", a lovely melancholic piano ballad with echoing vocals, followed by a hidden 2 minute joyous chant of \\"Hallelujah\\" showcasing a fervent raspy Keys, I wish it was a full song.<br /><br />This is definitely her most consistent album since \\"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\\" which is my favourite of her albums. Not all quite the \\"brand new me\\" she sings about, but just enough experimentation and stretching to show her newfound growth.fford what we got, Not even the king\\" in soft breathy tones. \\"That's When I Knew\\" is a lovely acoustic ballad co-penned with Babyface and recalling Stevie Wonder. \\"Limitedless\\" is Reggae/Dancehall, while the trippy ballad \\"One Thing\\" is a Frank Ocean co-write.

B005IU1OMA|4.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my brother, who is a helicopter pilot. The snowboarding runs are amazing, as always, but some of the stuff the helicopter pilots pull off is just as incredible. Travis Rice et al do a great job, and I'm glad they brought in Jeremy Jones for some runs.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy this  application my kids don't know how to play but I enjoy playing one in a while is fun
0307346617|4.0|If you are looking for an action packed Zombie thriller full of drama this book isn't for you. World War Z is an oral report of the world wide zombie epidemic by the people who lived it. The book is told in a unique way, it is told by the people who lived through their accounts through the epidemic interviewed by an agent 10 years later. The agent talks in first person and it's like he is talking to the reader. I give World War Z 4.5 out of 5 due to its uniqueness in the drama and all the different sorties or \\"accounts\\" you get.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This application is great for finding videos and cartoons for kids you can look all most anything I like to look for kids playing videos
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I saw the Broadway version of Rock of Ages. I was excited to find that it was going to be made into a movie. Unfortunately, the movie was not what I expected. I was hoping for something closer to the musical. Overall, I found the movie to be somewhat boring.

B0049U4INC|4.0|This book was referenced from another book I read (Happier at Home by Gretchen Rubin).  I loved that book and wanted to read anything she mentioned.  And I am glad I did.  I'm not going to start a business but still felt this was full of information that is applicable to everyone.  Not my usual reading material but wholeheartedly enjoyed it and would recommend it to everyone.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|This are great games and I think that this generation of kids should be playing are the best games for kids

B003H8WSM0|5.0|Great follow-up album to Antidotes. Everything about antidotes musically was so robotical with the tightness of the recording, but on Total Life Forever you get all of the syncopated danciness with this great atmosphere to breath in that was missing for me on Antidotes. Great album.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is one of manny great disney movies ever I like how they used Alissa Milano for Ariel face it is great
B000RA28FI|5.0|I always dug Talking Heads but had the case of being born too late to really see them come into fruition. In my life I'd heard a bunch of singles and none of the other songs on the albums. I decided to go back through starting with this album, since it was the first, and hearing singles like psycho killer on here was really cool but mainly hearing the songs I'd never heard.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a new game and its different but fun my kids are still train to learn but is fun and we enjoy it
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I bought this case about 10 months ago and I'm okay with it. Its does everything the company claims but there some drawbacks. I don't really use it under water a lot , but I like to use it in the shower or using it near wet areas. Useful while its raining and those times when your drink spills on to it.  Its waterproof, but to keep it waterproof is high maintenance. You must follow the cleaning regime set by the company and must check the O-rings frequently. You must inspect the case often too, especailly around the charger port cover, if you notice ANY cracks your case is useless. Most problems comes from around the charger port cover, as it easily cracks just from regular use. I highly recommend getting the free extended warranty since they will help you in getting some replacement parts for almost free.<br /><br />There are some minor issues that may cause some annoyance for some folks. The headphone jack access port only works with apple OEM headphones, all other jacks will need the adapter. The cap seal for the head phone jacks is my greatest annoyance. You have to physically screw the cap on and off to use the port and the caps can be easily lost too. The charger port is another problem. Only the apple OEM charger is the only one that will fit, any third-party charger needs an adapter (sold separately). I know that  these issues actually help the case be waterproof, but it gets annoying.<br /><br />Overall I think the case is worth it for people that are a little clumsy like me, however, this is not a replacement for a insurance plan for your phone. The company will NOT replace your phone even if it failed due to defect. They can only replace your case. This case only helps you not going through the cost and process of going through the insurance process too often.
034580404X|5.0|I love this trilogy and very good offer too. I liked it because it comes with its box where you could keep your books in a nice presentable and safe way.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Although this book was geared toward teenagers, I still enjoyed it and will likely read the rest of the books in the trilogy.
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|I purchased this book while I was preparing for a job interview. I had to do a presentation on &#34;any topic I choose&#34;, 10 minutes and I had no idea what to do. I knew I had to make it fun, interactive, get buy in and interest and make it memorable. I have done hundreds of presentations in my career and this was the toughest. This book did not hand me a topic idea, however what it did do was lead me to build what I would call the best presentation I have ever created. The tips are bang on and work!
B0098460O4|5.0|This album by these amazing young artists demonstrates the passion and power attainable by even teenagers!  The talent and ability shown by Jonathan and Charlotte results in almost breathtaking, very stirring music. Simon was wrong, these two are a wonderful blending of voices.  I listen to it over and over. I highly recommend this to anyone that appreciates beautiful music of a more classical flavor !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so good, as soon as I finished I had to get the other two.  A must read!
B005PTQPU0|2.0|I am a big fan of Kate's and was really surprised when this came out.  On top of it, I love snow!  But this album just really didn't click for me. I was disappointed with the overall flow and tone.  I still try and listen to it, and hope it will grow on me, but so far no songs stand out.
1608871452|5.0|The price was a little steep on the publisher's website, but Amazon had the price adjusted really nicely, so I didn't feel as guilty. I'm a sucker for books like this, and I'm a huge Supernatural fan, so it was a must-own! The little pull outs are really awesome, and the photos are gorgeous. Just a really great book.
1455502758|5.0|This very small volume of notes-to-self mixed in with a few Hitchens-quality Big Thoughts exists because C.H., hard-drinking, self-serving, grandiosely opiniated contrarian that he was, profited mightily from a wife we mortals could only wish for. Carol Blue decided, bravely, to publish snippets of her late husband's last notes. Hitchens devotees will marvel at his strength of conviction, even when delirious from necessary medication. Those who despise Hitchens, and there are many, will hold \\"Mortality\\" up as proof that they were and are right. Those who don't know his writing should probably avoid this and start with something more accessible, like his collection of essays \\"Love, Poverty & War\\". He left us with his middle finger defiantly erect.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I love this film, a great first in the Sherlock Holmes series starring two very wonderful actors! I completely recommend this movie to anyone who loves the books!
B00976N384|4.0|I really like listening to this album, but it doesn't feel like a Killers album to me; it feels like a Brandon Flowers album. Which is great -- his solo album is one of the five most played in my library, and I'm not disappointed. The songs here, like on Flamingo, are more story driven, not the quirky, interpret-how-you-will lyrics and edgier beats I associate with the Killers. But they can make pretty much anything and I'll listen, over and over again.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I am such a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes and Robert Downey Jr. This movie is the best! Love it!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|There is nothing wrong with my account or one click settings but the buy button doesn't work. :-( needs work!
1609611543|5.0|Extremely informative and very relative to my situation.  Absolutely love it.  So glad my physician recommended I read this book.
075669812X|4.0|The Ninjago fans in our house love the book.  It's full of colorful photos.  I don't care for the book being twice as thick as it should be, because half of the book is an empty shell for the Ninjago figure that comes with it, but whatever.  The 6yo & 9yo kids love the photos and story history, so they are eager to do their daily reading.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Adorable! I'd recommend it for the whole family! It reminded me of the wonderful Disney films when I was a child.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I love this CD! Christina Aguilera is back!! BUT my opinion is biased and really, she can do no wrong in my book. I currently own every CD she's ever made (including the all Spanish ones) and this CD is better than Bionic and on a level of Back to Basics, though it has a different feel to it. I love almost everyone song on here but Circles is really awesome! Too bad there's cuss words in it and they probably won't play it on the radio. AWESOME CD!! BUY IT! SUPPORT YOUR ARTISTS!
B00881VLCE|4.0|absolutly love this app! me and my children have soo much fun putting these puzzles together!  needs some more free puzzlee though.

B00846REIS|5.0|After finishing the 50 Shades series, I was left wanting more. This book (series) is just as good, if not better. Still waiting for the third to come out- but it will be worth the wait!! I highly recommend it.

B0087YYHZU|5.0|What can you say, SITR is the simply the best Golden Age Of Movies Musical ever made.  Period.  And what they've accomplished with this Blu-Ray restoration is remarkable.  I'm not going to belabor this ... If you have a Blu-Ray player and an HD TV -- GET IT!  Even if you have a previous version.  Give that one to a friend.  You won't be sorry (and neither will they).
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Well my friend got it and her other friend where it with her and then my friend emery told it to me

0547884591|5.0|The new book will not disappoint the legions of Tim's fans. It reads like a dude's guide to cooking, learning, and guns/survival. I found it fascinating and a great read. The recipes are very well described and broken down into easy to follow directions unlike any cookbook I've read. If you hate Tim like my wife and I'm guessing 80% of women you will probably not like this book.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Hey, for love? I would say the same thing, bend your mind. Excellent work by Denzel, I missed its theatrical release and am glad I bought and watched, howsoever late.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I just want to start by saying that I love this movie. When Amazon had this on sale for $15 I was excited, I must have this even though I do not have a 3D Television. Great buy...except for one thing. The Blu-ray Case was smashed beyond repair upon delivery. It looks like it had been stepped on or crushed and even though there is no damage to the disks I am now spending time looking for a new case for my 4 Disk set.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Good story but would have benefited from a slightly longer script. But it is a good story one that you can follow and identify with characters
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Of the negative reviews, I didn't find any to be true.  The acting was decent to strong. The picture and storyline were pretty good.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I was watching season 4 episode 4 of misfits and there it was opening sequence, black and white, lady dancing in a pub and Blue Jeans playing elevating an otherwise anemic season. I just had to find out who this artist was and support her. Love the album.
B0098460O4|5.0|Enjoyed this CD very much.  They sing beautiful togeter.  I still get chills when I listen to them sing on the talent show, but this CD is so much more.

B009DCOU9S|5.0|I very rarely give five stars but this game deserves it! Storyline is entertaining annd engaging and the graphics are spectacular. Very long play time with a wide variety of diffrrent mini gsmes. Very much worth the cost. a must have for casual game lovers!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Every year; I purchase a Season and present it as a Gift to my SweetHeart.  (He LOVES the show.)  He does not open the package. He keeps all of them Factory Sealed.... as he wants to keep this in His collection.  The shipper was very Quick; but I was disappointed in their packaging. (Could have protected the DVD better.)
0500289077|5.0|I was thinking to buy this book from the date it appeared on the market. Rather big one, great paper and typography, colors as I look on the original photos, b&w photos are deep and also great. One book contains almost all greates street photographer all over the world with their main photos, bio and quotes.<br /><br />Everybody who like street photography should have this book!!!
B000IHY146|4.0|Some great music snuck through the singer-songwriter major label wasteland of the 1970's and this is one those rare damaged jewels which defy categorization and transcends time.  Not for everyone, but if you get it, you got it.
1451695187|5.0|Mr. Alexander's experience only reinforced in me feelings that I think most of us have already: That there is something else after this life, more to come if you will. His story has been told before by others who have had similar experiences. As a neurosurgeon, a man of science he had his skepticism about the spiritual. No more. I feel much more at peace with this crazy world after reading his book.
B008D490F6|5.0|Me and my 7 year old son watch this movie. I saw this movie when I was a kid and I still love this movie. I'm glad my son and I had a good time watching this movie.
0547884591|5.0|I was wowed by Tim's latest take on the Ferris Approach.  Tim has discovered an approach to take the simple and the complex and break either down into manageable components.  There is something so soothing about the way Tim approaches intimidating tasks and breaks them down in such way as to make mastery possible all the while entertaining you along the way.  This book is a huge winner for both the novice and the foodie to be enjoyed by either! It is readable as a cookbook and not just a depository for fantastic recipes - it is a resource book accompanied by interesting stories, details and facts making the journey more than just getting the food to the plate.  I loved it so much I have already begun purchasing additional copies to give out for the holidays!
B009CG1YZ8|5.0|What can I say about this classic other than Klatu, barata, nik....cough, cough!!! Love this movie. Watch it, trust me you'll thank me later.

B004UJAOLM|4.0|I am trying to read classics that were mandatory in high school. Thought it would be fun to read some without any assignments. Chose this one because i remembered it to be a love story and i had enjoyed Pride and Prejudice.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Where was all the media for this movie? Was it a direct to video release? I totally missed this at the box office and was pleasantly surprised when I watched it. It's an original plot that is intriguing and believable. Bradley Cooper was outstanding. He deserved a People's Choice Award nomination at the very least. Robert DeNiro is still GREAT and was a joy to watch in this movie. This movie has the makings of a sleeper hit. I'd like to see the earnings for this movie a year from now. My wife had seen the movie some time ago on Amazon and said she enjoyed it even better the second time through. I will definitely watch this movie again. If you enjoy a creative and unique storyline, action, suspense and thrills, this movie is for you!
145162607X|4.0|One of Gregory's best assets is her ability to bring history to life. She makes history accessible to her readers and tells a good story to boot. Anne Neville is certainly an interesting subject. She was born to a powerful man whose goal in life is to be a Kingmaker. After he is thwarted several times, he decides one of his daughters, Anne or Isabel, will be Queen of England with him the power of the throne. Nothing, and I mean nothing, stands in his way.<br /><br />  Anne almost makes that come true in her first marriage and succeeds in her second one to Richard III. Richard is a divisive character in history. He was quite maligned by Shakespeare.  No one knows what happened to his two nephews, the princes, imprisioned in the Tower under his orders. No mention of Richard supposedly being hunchbacked and short. In fact, Anne often describes him as handsome. Richards seems to be enjoying a resurgence of popularity. I just read Alison Weir's \\"A Dangerous Inheritance\\" about him and the disappearance of the princes. My bookclub at Goodreads just read Josephine Tey's \\"The Daughter of Time\\" also about him. It says something that hundreds of years later people are still interested in his story.<br /><br />  This book is about Anne, though, and her struggle as a pawn in powerful men's chess games. It must have been awful to have no say in your life. She was raised to be a helpmate and a person who must put her father's and husband's wishes above her own. Her child was taken to be raised by others with her getting short visits. The book tells her story well.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|This is a good movie. It is one of the more original plots to come out of Hollywood for this genre in a really long time. Liam Neeson does his usual excellent job and as weak an actress as I think January Jones is, she might actually improve if she played a few more roles like this. She showed promise that if she tries, she might be a bit more than just a pretty face. I thought this as the end of the movie approached and the suspense built and she swung into action. Bruno Ganz was excellent, Frank Langella always plays a good creep and Diane Kruger was everything a leading lady needs to be in a thriller: hot, sexy, likable and convincing in her role. The action moves quickly and it's a fun ride.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|For those that don't rate this at 5 stars either were not around for the 80's or don't have an audio system capable of vibrating you out of your seat. This is a re-mix that will work all of your speakers, from your tweeters to your sub. This isn't a CD to rip and playback on your iPod while going for a run. This is a CD you play to annoy your neighbor who drives a Caprice with 26\\" rims...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|although it is soft porn for the most part, it is an interesting story and keeps you interested from cover to end
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Overall it was a good movie.  My daughter really liked it and at 2 that's saying a lot.  I would rent this movie again.

0547884591|5.0|Tim rocked every page of this mammoth offering. Read it over the Thanksgiving Holiday and made three dishes from the DOM section. Killer actionable content wrapped of fun stories about life. I love real people and Tim seems as real as they get.<br /><br />I liked it so much I bought three additional copies to give away over the coming holiday -<br /><br />#gameon to Tim F.<br /><br />Buy this book but more important don't just read it - USE it.<br /><br />M
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Everything about this series is superb--they just don't get any better!  Writing, casting, sets, you name it.  It has us so enthralled that we hate it when each episode ends!
1455522597|5.0|Bought this for my mother in law, and though I have not yet read it, she claims it is great.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book will delight and challenge you.  Even putting aside the lead story, the medical narrative is as suspenseful as any thriller.  The detail of Alexander's journey to heaven is astounding and hope-giving.  I will say that the ending doesn't hold up to the rest of the book.  It just kind of ends...like the plug was pulled or something.  Even so, this is one of the best reads in a long time.  Read it!
098555780X|3.0|I found the book to be a little difficult to understand with some of the ties but there are many different interestiing ties

B00881PPTO|5.0|This app combines several functions and services that would otherwise take several apps. Good deals, accurate information,  excellent interface, and quickly delivered.  For complaints about the lack of Southwest and other airlines, those airlines are not on most travel sites because they want you to go to thier site... they don't others to book, so they can drive traffic to their own system.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book, I loved it!! Easy Read and the Author did a great job writing this book.  Can't wait to read more from E L James!! I loved all the Fifty Shades Books!!! I read it 5x and can read it 100x again!

I have read all of Tim's other works and was very impressed by how he was able to deconstruct challenges and overcome them in short periods of time. The 4 Hour Chef sheds light on this information which i think is a must have for anyone!!

B0083P1QUM|5.0|Thank you, Patricia Cornwell, for keeping this series going!  I've read them all and always look forward to the next!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The third book is good but I got a little impatient with this book. I thought the book would be different but it was still a good read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thought I was being silly reading this trilogy; that it was not for my age group but I was pleasantly surprised!  I was a great read, maybe one book too long but still lots of fun!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Bought this set used and it is great.  The case is in great shape which I think is rare and none of the discs have any problems.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Repetitive with the lip biting and hair touching but its addicting. Never liked romance novels but this one is worth the read
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Great price for the combo pack.  The extras were actually reallly interesting and my daughter even likes to watch them.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I began playing this on my iphone and really enjoyed it. When I discovered it was available for the Fire I had to get it. This game runs smoothly on this platform and with the bigger screen it looks great. Breeding dragons takes strategy and luck.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Great movie to begin with and great price for the blu ray.  Plays great and have had no problems with the case or disc.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is an amazing movie. I use amazon all then time for movies. Almost all my movies are from amazon.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|It was a good price for what I received.  The packing could have been much better so that the case arrived in better condition.  The case is crushed and not reshapable so we put it in another dvd case.  The disc was fine fortunately.
0525478817|5.0|A few weeks ago my friend and her daughter were visiting.  We wanted to watch a movie, and as we were scrolling through the pages of options her daughter said \\"My Girl, let's watch that.\\"  I said \\"Isn't that sad?\\"  and in unison without hesitation they both said \\"No.\\"  An hour and ten minutes later, through my snotty sobs, I cursed them both.  I don't \\"do\\" deliberately sad.  I REALLY don't do deliberately sad with kids.  I've never seen Bambi.<br /><br />The only reason I read this book is because John Green wrote it, and I love John Green.  He did a really good thing with this book.  He reminded people that sick kids are still kids.  He did it with humor, and with a very good understanding of \\"kids today.\\"  It was gut-wrenchingly sad.  More sad than it needed to be frankly, and the kids were a tinge over-precocious, even for kids who had to grow up really fast, but it's still an outstanding book.<br /><br />I'm totally going to buy a copy of this book for my friends.  In the inscrption I'm going to write \\"It's not sad.\\"  Suckas.
0345803485|5.0|Bought this used and it came in brand new condition.  Great book as well as great series.  Recommended for anyone needing a good series.
1439153663|5.0|The book is set in the late 1700's at a Virginia plantation, and focuses on the divisions between slave, servant, and master, as well as the racial divide. Lavinia, a young Irish girl, is brought to the plantation as an indentured servant, by the owner, Captain Pyke, with both parents dead, and separated from her brother. She is given to the care of Belle, a mulatto, who is actually the Captain's daughter, although this is not widely known. As Lavinia grows older, we see the differences between her and Belle. Family tragedies and abuse shape the family in the big house and we see the contrast between the family bonds in the kitchen house as opposed to the big house. As Lavinia is sent to live up north as a companion, she struggles to fit in. Several fateful misunderstandings lead to terrible consequences as the novel comes to a close. The novel alternates between points of view and is a carefully researched and heart rending tale.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|If you are a sci-fi buff and enjoy intricate plots, you will like this.  Season 6 is the most enjoyable season up to then, in my opinion, with cool aliens, and a storyline I never would have expected.  It is great fun.
B008M34INW|2.0|I think Mel Gibson tried to recreate his movie Payback, but this movie was definately lacking something in the entertainment value.  I walked out of the room about 20 minutes into it and hubby turned it off about half way through.  We just couldn't get into it.

B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Our family was blown away - a beautiful, thoughtful, intense film - which we were lucky to see in the theater. Will get DVD for sure so we can share as much as possible!
B000ICXQGK|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was an in-flight experience while traveling to the Canary Islands on my Honeymoon.  The love affair it portrays absolutely struck a chord with me as I was beginning married life and it gave new meaning to &#34;until death do you part.&#34;<br /><br />For me, the Heaven scenes were believable, welcoming, calming, reassuring. I always was a believer and still am. (In God, Heaven and Hell)<br /><br />It gave me hope when dealing with the loss of loved ones and I recommend it highly to all of my friends who mourn.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Amazing casting. Having read the series, I expected to be disappointed.  This is one of the best mini series ever. Sean Bean is so convincing as Eddard Stark that he makes the story come alive.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is definitely a collector's item for all those movie buffs out there. Fell in love with the movie the minute I watched. And its from my favourite director!!<br />And this extended collector's edition in the Blue-ray HD quality is an icing on the cake.<br />A total must-buy!!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I am withholding my opinion on this cable since the original cable frayed so quickly and easily that I had to order a new one.  That was a disappointment since the Kindle works so well itself.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|If you liked the movie, this package of blu-ray/3D blu-ray/DVD/digital copy is fantastic!  I purchased this during the first few days after it came out and Amazon had a great price on it.

B00005LOUP|5.0|I found this movie for a good price. It came with in two days of me ordering it, which was nice.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I purchased both seasons of Downton Abbey and have been enjoying watching them.  If this series was a book I would label it a real &#34;page turner.&#34;  I find myself having to discipline myself to watch just one episode a day so the pleasure will last longer.  I can't wait for Season 3 !!
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Although it is a bit scary the authors lay out clear data to back up their claims.  I think this issue will become a dominant political issue sooner than any of us think.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm currently on my second read of this book. I have never read any books twice. I would recommend the entire trilogy to anyone.
B000ICXQF6|5.0|Best Bruce Willis movie ever.  Great acting, great twists, great ending.  Probably one of my very favorite films.  Check it out.

B000NY12LO|5.0|Sadly, this is an all too common event in this country. This story let you inside the mind of the shooter and reminded me how hard it is for some kids who have to put up with bullies every day. Not an excuse for murder, but makes you see how someone could get to that point.
0525953728|5.0|Great story that needed to be told. To bad more people did not read it before November 6th. I sure hope more adults read this in the next few months.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Though Steven Spielberg directed it, A.I. Artifical Intelligence is Stanley Kubricks film, through and through.<br />The film bears the unmistakeable marks of Kubricks dark, visually rich, and detailed style, which blends (not entirely seamlessly) with Spielbergs warm optimism, sentimentality, and typically strong child and female characters.<br /><br />In fact the film seems like a strange mix.<br /><br />A.I. is sad, a dark film, really. The light of day is hardly seen excluding a few scenes the beginning of the movie. A film about heartbreak and loss, about identity and love.<br />It's long, clocking in at 155 minutes (2 h, 25 m), longer, in fact, than it should have been.<br />It's intense, with absolutely no humor or comic relief, and the emotional payoff at the end is bittersweet and perhaps slightly unrewarding.<br /><br />But A.I. is a film that's legacy has deepened with time.<br /><br />A.I. showcases the master laying aside his usual popcorn-worthy, entertaining, rewatchable, style, and taking up a more serious, mature one.<br />It's Steven Spielberg's most emotionally complex film, short of Schindler's List.<br /><br />Haley Joel Osment delivers the most heartfelt and mesmerizing child performance in recent years, and Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, and William Hurt rounding the excellent cast.<br /><br />The visuals are top notch, and the story is well-written, sad, and beautifully moving.<br /><br />A.I. is a film that I will never watch again - it is too dark and sad, but I am glad that I watched it the first time.<br /><br />Strong recommendation!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I'm probably way late to discover The Lumineers, bought this album because I wanted one track. But all the songs are great. Such a good album, especially for the price. A must buy!
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I had the interesting experience of watching Captain America: The First Avenger, and then watching Christopher Nolan's [[ASIN:B001OGWY1W The Dark Knight]].<br />How different those films are!<br /><br />The Dark Knight is NOT a popcorn film. It's a thriller, and an action movie. It's a dark, unforgettable, violent, gripping, intense, suspenseful, sometimes disturbing, but always brilliant film.<br /><br />On the other hand, Captain America is pure FUN. It's escapism, blockbuster entertainment. A film filled with humor, improbable but exciting set pieces, dastardly villains (Nazis!), memorable characters, one-liners, heart (lots of it), and wonderful acting!<br />Shall I run through the cast for you? Here goes (*deep breath*): Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Tommy Lee Jones, Toby Jones, Stanley Tucci, Dominic Cooper, Richard Armitage, and Samuel L. Jackson!<br /><br />And Captain America has one more thing to reccomend itself to you...a memorable Stan Lee cameo!<br /><br />In conclusion, Captain America: The First Avenger is a wonderfully entertaining, action-packed, well-acted, stylish, incredibly humorous, retro throwback to blockbusters of old such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br /><br />Strongest Recommendation!!!
B000M5NRLC|5.0|Must loved the team of Jim Carey and Ron Howard. While I adore the original this is a great take on the Grinch and what made him how he is. The nice thing is that this has become a holiday tradition to watch this movie and say the words along with the movie. Yes, we watch it that much!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is the best....its very addictive and u will soon catch urself playing it for hours at a time
B0049VZ222|5.0|I got the instant video to try it out and now I am a huge fan! The video is ready in a flash and it plays seemlessly. This far exceeded my expectations! Talk about instant gratification. Only problem is that it is so easy to do I have to control myself to keep from buying too much!
0062059882|5.0|I loved this book in the first place so I was excited to see that an anniversary edition was on the way. This book was well worth the wait- the story remains the same with a few extra bits from the author that really flesh out the story. A great read that incorporates American and European myths that keep the reader thinking.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is great!!! Fun way to share ideas and tips with friends for FREE! Everyone should use pinterest. You can make a wish list on it also ;)
B0084BMUFA|5.0|For years I've watched A Muppets Christmas Carol, and this year I finally picked up the actual book and read A Christmas Carol. And I loved it!
B004OBQDHK|5.0|I purchased this for my husband as he had never seen the movie (imagine that!).  He loved it and the ocean backdrop is stunning!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Read it on my Kindle the first day it came out.  Also bought a hard copy a few days later so I guess you could say I'm a huge Vince Flynn fan.  Keep the books coming Vince and I'll keeping reading them!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is great. The movie does an incredible job bringing together a team of heroes that are dissimilar and had only been seen in their own worlds in the movies.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Just like all the other Harry Potter movies this ones is great, cannot wait to give it to my son!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|lovely bought the game and installation fails every time. waste of $$ for me I guess. wtg roxio and amazon
0439334632|2.0|I was disappointed because it came with a folded back cover, and a small rip on the front, which upset me, because it is a gift for my little brother. It also has small amounts of residue on the back, a pencil mark on the front, and a stain in the bottom of the crease, that you can see on every page. It is much thinner than I expected, it's maybe 1/4 of an inch give or take a little, But that isn't a big issue. I would recommend buying it new, or hardcover.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Interesting book far outside the sci/fi I normally read. Overall an excellent read with a few quirky moments and lots of drama. All the gushing Ana does about loving him and his looks can be a bit much. The BDSM elements add a touch of spice.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|omg I love this game so much I don't get any work done because this game is so adicting I digest you buy this game
0061474355|5.0|Sabriel is one of my favorite books. Both story, memorable characters and details of the magical world of The Old Kingdom are carefully crafted and highly entertaining. I think for anyone wanting to delve into the fantasy genre but aren't sure they are ready should start with this novel as it has an anchor in the real world. You explore the Old Kingdom and all it's fantastical aspects with one of it's long lost daughters. A truly marvelous read.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Quick shipper and in great shape when they arrived.  Secret Santa person is going to love them to death!!!!! thanks
B000HF0ISC|5.0|\\"Justice in the courtroom is blind. Out on the street, the bitch has eyes.\\"<br /><br />I love love love this movie. Friendship and loyalty go a long way.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read. Very informative. Was just enough information to let you form a picture in your mind on what was happening but not enough to violate OPSEC. Everyone needs to read this!!
1619695006|2.0|I pre-ordered the book on audio CD's to listen to in the car.  A fan of Rowling's work, I greatly anticipated \\"reading\\" it.  But the only redeeming feature of this book was the narrator, who did a brilliant job. The book is told over a set of 15 CD's and I loaded them into my vehicle's CD player five at a time.  At the end of the fifth CD I contemplated tossing the whole thing in the garbage, but my desire to find out what happens to Krystal and Robbie Weedon forced me to soldier on.<br /><br />The problem is, this book is seriously depressing. Every character is mean spirited and quite frankly, just awful!  Those who should know better, who are well off financially and better educated, seem to just enjoy being self indulgent and nasty, and characters like Krystal and her mother Terri, who live in abject poverty, are kept down by one disappointment after another.  Regardless, they are all such horrible people as to be completely unsympathetic.<br /><br />Rowling's use of the English language is at times pretentious, she uses words that one would rarely find in everyday conversation, much less among a small English villages' students and small business owners. Rather than finding the language eloquent I found it pompous.  But what I found most disappointing was the ending, which completely fell apart.  It was abrupt and to a certain extent unbelievable.<br /><br />Dark, depressing, self-absorbed.  Take your clue from the large black \\"X\\" on the cover and don't open this book.  Not worth the price, either!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. It's so much fun it is so worth the 7 bucks and it has a nether reactor.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The author has presented a collection of personalities among which not one has a single redeeming feature.  Actually, I take that back --- the twins' mother seems a good sort, but she dies early on.  Although how she ended up married to the nasty man who fathered her children is a mystery.  It was well written and cleverly presented, leaving you guessing what's going on for the first half of the book, but after I finished it I wondered why I read it at all!<br /><br />The two main characters --- a married couple --- are completely unsympathetic.  The wife is clearly a sociopath and the husband is a cheating, lying SOB who gets off on his wife's insanity.  The whole thing fell apart for me when the wife gets robbed while hiding out in a mountain cabin resort.  Really?  This woman was way too smart to let that happen. Considering how she had planned every step of the charade of her abduction/murder down to the last minutiae there is no way that she did not have a viable back up plan. Everything about her interactions with the two people who stole her getaway funds was completely unbelievable based on what we came to know about this character.  She was too well educated and too manipulative to have let any of that happen.  And nobody who was that self-centered would be planning on committing suicide, especially not after the husband was already convicted of murdering her.  That simply did not ring true.<br /><br />Ultimately, this book was too dark and overly self-indulgent for my tastes.  The characters were too one dimensional and one would have to work hard to find somebody to like.  Made me wonder about the people who wrote the Sally, Dick and Jane books my generation was raised on --- putting Amazing Amy behind me!
B00005JO9J|5.0|I have just started to view Greys Anatomy and wanted to see it from the start to see how it all began.<br /><br />Many thanks
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This season is getting off to a very, very slow start, but I trust that it will deliver the kind of drama it has in the past.<br />More Matt Czurchy and much more Dylan Baker, please.<br />My connection is not always great, but I attribute that to holiday shopping.<br />Christine Baranski (sp?) is the best-dressed woman on tv, and the epitome of a cool businesswoman: tough but vulnerable.<br />I'd nominate her and adorable Archie Punjabi for every award around. Have watched all four seasons (what there is of the fourth so far).
B008RYN44U|5.0|Most albums I've listened to recently only have 2 or 3 songs I like. I like almost every song on this one. I can't remember the last time that happened. This is probably No Doubt's best album and one of the best this year.
B00973DDN2|5.0|Let me start off by saying this is the first Killers album I have purchased, so I came into this fairly blind in terms of what to expect.  Sure, I've heard their songs that got a lot of radio play like Mr. Brightside, but for whatever reason I wasn't pursuaded to buy any of their albums.  The turning point was when I saw them on the Colbert Report recently and they were amazing! The music sounds a little retro to me, but I love it.  I am completely satisfied with the purchase and there are probably 8 songs on the album that I could listen to over and over again.

B0071T5PN0|5.0|With the exception of no Michael Anthony, this album absolutely kills it. Reminds me of the 1st four studio albums. Very little keyboard/overmixing the music and the sonic onslaught of eddie's guitar in the raw make this easily the best VH album in 15 years min! Alex continues to destroy the drums and pounds out the best rhythms in a decade. To me the biggest surprise on this record is dave's \\"back in the game\\" top shelf lyrics. For $2.99 on MP3, you'd be a fool to not purchase the whole album. Now if we can only get anthony back in the band... his incredible, soaring background vocals are missed. Keep killin' it boys!

B0002KVUKM|3.0|Although writer/director Stephen Sommers had an unexpected hit with 1999's \\"[[ASIN:B000IEVW6E The Mummy (1999)]],\\" he went overKILL with the 2001 sequel \\"[[ASIN:B000I9TY7S The Mummy Returns]],\\" a classic case of modern blockbuster dreck that's full of explosions and \\"exciting\\" things going on, but somehow strangely boring. That's the problem with 2004's \\"Van Helsing,\\" although not as bad.<br /><br />THE PLOT: In 1887 Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) teams up with Anna (Kate Beckinsale) to fight Dracula, his three brides, the Frankenstein monster, werewolves, Mr. Hyde, etc.<br /><br />It won't take long for the viewer to perceive that \\"Van Helsing\\" shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a partial parody/homage of the classic [[ASIN:0783242379 Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection (Dracula / Frankenstein / The Mummy / The Invisible Man / The Bride of Frankenstein / The Wolf Man / Phantom of the Opera / Creature from the Black Lagoon)]] movies and part serious, just barely. Imagine \\"[[ASIN:0800177177 Bram Stoker's Dracula]]\\" with a goofy [[ASIN:B00003CXC5 The Adventures of Indiana Jones (Raiders of the Lost Ark / The Temple of Doom / The Last Crusade)]] flair and you'd have a good approximation.<br /><br />The film looks good, but there's too much CGI and some of the monsters look really cartoony, like Mr. Hyde and the werewolves, while some look quite good, like the flying vampires and Frankenstein's monster. As was the case with \\"The Mummy Returns\\" the film is strangely tedious despite all the many explosions and \\"exciting\\" things going on, not to mention you'll barely care about the protagonists. Thankfully, there are hints of depth, e.g. the Frankenstein monster and Anna, but just hints.<br /><br />Speaking of Anna, Kate Beckinsale is definitely one of the highlights here as she looks stunning throughout in an amazing form-fitting costume and thigh-high boots seemingly appropriate for the late 1800s (and I'm not even a Beckinsale fan). Josie Maran also stands out as one of Dracula's wives, a strikingly beautiful woman despite her ee-vil vampire antics in the role. On the other side of the spectrum, Jackman is a great, masculine leading man, perfect for the role.<br /><br />But, at the end of the day, \\"Van Helsing\\" never rises above the limitations of what it is - a big, dumb modern blockbuster with all its over-the-top trappings. Despite all the millions of dollars thrown into it, it's only mildly entertaining. It's also over-long at 2 hours and 11 minutes.<br /><br />But, still, it's better than \\"The Mummy Returns\\" and there's enough here to make it worthwhile, if you're in the mood for this type of fare.<br /><br />GRADE: C+as one of Dracula's wives, a strikingly beautiful woman despite her ee-vil vampire antics in the role.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is the first time I played a game like this on a taet. Bought it for Kindle Fire HD and it worked brilliantly! Game took me about 6-8 hours of on and off play over the course of a week. Very good story line with enough of a challenge to keep it fun without being too hard. Great story line and good ending. I reccomend this game to anyone who has never played this type of game before.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I was going to use this app to write my care plans within a table.  This app supports tables within a word document which other apps do not. However, I need to be able to highlight text within the table.  Each time I selected text to highlight, the selected text deleted.  I tried this numerous times on different documents even documents that were not in a table format.  Huge thumbs down for me.  I can't have parts of my document disappear when I need to highlight them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Hours of fun.. It's free.. Challenging at higher levels which makes it even better :)  Love it !!!! Give it a try...
B0098VXBIA|3.0|A light movie, for when you don't want anything serious or thought provoking.  It won't win any awards though, and that's perfectly fine.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is super fun, but the controls are really hard and don't work. but the app itself is fun and a great way to pass time!

B00328R21C|5.0|Its LEGOs. Its Star Wars. You can't go wrong. Who cares if George Lucas and weaseled his merchandising cancer into LEGOs? Sure Star Wars Angry Birds takes it too far but LEGO's Star Wars keeps it just amount of greed and entertainment in balance... just like Anakin Skywalker brought balance to the Force.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great book.  The book was entertaining, good read, and I would certainly buy some more of this writer's books!
030759565X|5.0|This book was thicker and more content heavy than I expected. That is not always true about blogger-turned-cookbook authors.  I love the fact that she shows her tiny kitchen and keeps it real about what she cooks.  The photography is just the right amount.<br />I appreciate there is someone out there who obsesses over recipes so I don't have to.  I can't wait to try some of these amazing recipes.

1451695195|4.0|Admittedly, I am biased toward the spritual world and the existance of the afterlife.  But biased or not, the author tells a very convincing story about his experience and how it was not conjured from memory or fantasy in another part of his brain.<br /><br />I became somewhat bogged down in his technical explanations related to his expertise in neurology.<br /><br />MSC, Dana Point, CA
B004T2QZL8|3.0|its a decent game however i would enjoy it more if it were more like doodle farm in that the outline of the elements would be solid or dashed or colored it would make the game a little easier and less random to try to make matches.

B000LP6KSU|4.0|I absolutely love My Chemical Romance, but sometimes they just have too much foul language in their songs for my liking. I bought the amended album hoping it would provide me with completely clean versions of all the songs I love so much from the Black Parade. However, the only thing that was edited out of the songs was the F bomb. All the S words and wierd noises were still there, so I still don't have a version of &#34;Teenagers&#34; I can listen to in front of my mom. Maybe I'm just being stupid and the editing out of only F-bombs versus all foul language IS the exact difference between &#34;amended&#34; and &#34;clean&#34;. Anyway, I was still very happy with the product: it came in great condition quickly after I ordered it, and I love every single song.
B0072IVGZG|5.0|The style does somewhat follow \\"Born Into This\\", however, the compositions are quite superior to the previous album (which, by the way, as not a bad effort). Ian and Duffy have produced numerous excellent songs here, from the more R&R intense ones (Honey From a Knife, The Wolf) to the epic songs(Life Death, Wilderness Now -my personal favorite). I do hope they obtain success from this cd, they well deserve it. Other reviewers have written more extensive texts, all I can say is that if your an admirer of Ian and Duffy's work I highly recommend this cd.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|constant action and twists and humor through out the entire film. Some of my favorite actors featured as well. This movie will keep you on your toes and make you want to watch it again
B002LL13AM|5.0|Listening to Pollini playing Praeludium I - BWV 846 is enough to give this cd 10 stars. Pollini and J.S.Bach can only spell bliss. Heaven exists...
0802136834|5.0|This wonderfully researched book gave me lots of new insight into the six wives of Henry VIII, my favorite historical era.  For instance Jane Seymour was apparently not always the prim, proper, and demure character she is often made out to be and the information was quite revealing.  Alison Weir writes in an easy to understand well crafted format and I could hardly put the book down, The intrigue and day to day activities of the Tudor Court are fascinating.  A great read for history buffs without being just an academic history lesson.  I thoroughly recommend it.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Obviously it is setting us up for another prequel; it presents more questions than it answers.  I went into this movie with a good attitude so it would not have been hard to make me really like it.  This movie badly needed a Ripley.  With the possible exception of the Engineer, there was not a single character of which I regretted their demise.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|You need A LOT of coins in order to play this game, but they don't get handed out too often. There's a buying option, but if you're a free player (like me), the high cost of things will frustrate you quickly.<br /><br />Other than that, though, it's actually a really fun, casual game.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is a great recording.  I love Susan Boyle and she gives one of her best recordings to date.  Well worth the purchase.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I love Rod  Stewart from the frist time I listen to him sing there is not a song he sings that will not be a hit Merry Christmas Baby I  think is just so great He has done it again
0375507256|4.0|I am truly enjoying this novel.  I decided to purchase it after seeing the movie (don't judge me) and it's amazing.  David Mitchell spins this wonderful web of lives that spans generations and weaves the imperfections of humanity into every page.  I can see how this novel (just like the movie) is not for everyone.  It takes its time to create some of its most vivid points, but it's worth it.
0425263916|5.0|OMG - I could NOT put this book down! It was so intense with each and every page I turned. I even caught myself holding my breath at some moments. I was sooo sad when I came to the final page and I already pre-ordered her next book continuing this electric love story.<br /><br />Thank you Sylvia Day for writing this beautiful story as these characters come to life for me in your pages. I look very forward to May and will just re-read the first two all over again!!! Do you think there might be a book#4? I will be the first in line to pre-order!<br /><br />Shelli K.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I was pleased with the accuracy of the movie to the real story of the men of Easy Company of the 101st airborne in the latter part of 1944-1945 in Europe.
0802473156|3.0|The information in this book/ the concept is awesome the only two negative things I have to say are 1) the book could have been summed up in fewer pages ( quite a bit of unnecessary dialogue) and 2) it seems the book was written more for men at some parts the author could have been more general (especially since he already has another book designed specifically for men). but again i reiterate i love the concept of 5 different languages and partners speaking a different one.I think this is a perfect gift for newlyweds.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Hunger Games Catching Fire.<br />I really enjoyed this trilogy and the last story left me with no questions unanswered! It was very easy to read and I loved it for something different.
B00A4GXJD0|4.0|If you liked Born Free, you probably will like this album.  He continues with his new country-tinged rock & roll, and the tunes are catchy and mostly upbeat.  I like this sound, but I miss the \\"Fist Of Rage\\", \\"Somebody's Got To Feel This\\" sound.  If that's Kid Rock to you, you probably won't like this album.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I bought this because I was hoping to find them cheaper than they were in the stores.  This was just as good as ordering from the company!  I would recommend them to anyone.
B0073COMKW|5.0|I've purchased several LEDs as experiments and all of them failed on some important issue of price, light color, or delayed operation etc.<br /><br />This bulb came on instantly and since it is the 810lm, the color temperature is perfect. The light is very bright compared to the incandescent it replaced, and the price is now at a point where for me it makes sense. My plan therefore is to buy one of the per month as long as the price and quality stay the same or get better.
B0052GACNM|4.0|I bought this because I was hoping to find them cheaper than they were in the stores.  This was just as good as ordering from the company!  I would recommend them to anyone.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED CHER GROWING UP AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE THING THAT MADE MY DAY. GREAT MOVIE. WOTH WATCHING.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I bought this because I was hoping to find them cheaper than they were in the stores.  This was just as good as ordering from the company!  I would recommend them to anyone.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Truth is real and this book understands what is truth and what is real. Finally what mary baker eddy said in her book science and health is understood. She discovered this and now Eben gets it also.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great way to get your brain working. good way to exercise problem solving adult and child alike. glad I downloaded it
B009329Y30|3.0|Definitely something to watch with your girl.  Nothing much to comment on other than the great posture Zac has throughout the movie.
B002ZG997C|5.0|The Book of Eli in my opinion is a classic.  It has a great story line, and some amazing fight sequences.  The cinematography in this movie draws you in at the very beginning.  This is only the start of what makes this a great movie though.  The ending totally makes this movie.  All good movies must have an amazing ending.  This one pulls it off with style.  And besides, how can you say no to a movie with Denzel Washington in it?
B003JJA59K|3.0|The film disappointed because the ending didn't feel like one.  It was more like the end of an episode with another expected to follow. Nothing resolved; nothing to hope for.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|This is the best flight simulator I found for smart phones; never freezes or clitchy. I recommended it for anyone who likes flight simulators.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I absoulutely love this cd! Amazing songs on it!! My favorite cd I have ever boughten!! I deffantley think you should buy it!!
0061474355|5.0|I was first introduced to Garth Nix by picking up his 7th Tower series at random. I loved them so much I eventually picked up Sabriel as well, but I never expected The Abhorsen trilogy to become THE teenage favorite of mine. I've kept these books growing up, even went to my only author signing when Nix was in NY. I've recommended his books to family and friends, and I know sooner or later, even though I'm no longer his aimed audience, I will go back and enjoy these books again. Kudos Nix, you've become a classic in my mind.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The best way to stay up on whats going on with your family and friends! The birthday reminders are a real plus!
B00448SE4S|3.0|Love these actors and they obviously had fun making this movie. It was solid entertainment but not side splitting or life altering
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book has an amazing story to it. If you have read other Diary of a Wimpy books you MUST READ THIS!!!  Non stop comedy packs this book with buckets of excitement!!
B009LH1Y1W|3.0|Supernatural in its 8th season has become to feel drug out. my girlfriend and i have been avid watchers since early in season 1, and have come to love the show and its always kept us coming back to it. but in season 8, i feel as though i've seen it all before, same plot, same actors going through the motions.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I just loved this book. What a fun ride it was!  And it also kept me laughing, which I love. If you love Sci Fi Adventure, this is it. Robinson Crusoe on Mars is one of my favorite movies, and this book reminds me a bit of that. So do not hesitate to drop that big 99 cents, you will not be sorry.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app!  Easy to connect to and I have the current weather, a 36 hour or 10 day outlook.<br />I use it all the time.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is one of the best films I have seen in recent years. It is imaginative, creative and simply beautiful. The film was very highly recommended by both our (adult) daughters, and  I agree!!!!!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Very poyatny interface. Good time at the picnic on the road. You can play the whole family. Choices made in the game.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|If your bored and need a bit of action have at it!  Or need an excuse for popcorn! It was just ok!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Loved the game to children. Good time at the picnic on the road. You can play the whole family. Large selection of options in the game.
B0013O123Q|1.0|Worst movie I've ever seen.  Only watched it because it was free rental for Amazon Prime members.  The movie was listed with one underrated warning, which was definitely not enough... when I read the warning, I figured, no big deal, I can fast forward through that one scene.  However, there were a couple different horrific scenes where you needed to fast forward through a total of at least 20-30 minutes of film.<br />For example, if you think that watching 15 minutes of a violent rape up a girl's butt while she screams, followed by her head getting smashed in, is entertainment, then you need your head checked.  Trash like this gives crazy people ideas.  It also desensitizes viewers to extreme violence.  The writers/directors should be investigated.  This movie makes a very strong case for censorship.  Maybe this movie is acceptable in its native France, but this is America, and filthy crap like this doesn't belong on free Amazon access.  Amazon needs to review their criteria for allowing screening of this movie.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|It was a very nice movie.  Good story line.  Some of it was not too original and yet it was entertaining.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|This is by far my favorite compilation of music interpretation that David Garrett has released. From classical to pop choices this is great music for all!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I and my grandsons (5) of them just LOVE Comic book Hero Movies, especially when they are Good.  This Avengers movie does not disappoint, it starts right from the beginning and all the way to the end.  The Actors and Actresses are absolutely suited to bring their characters to life, I wanted to jump in the screen and join them.<br /><br />My entire Family loves this movie and we cannot wait for the next one.  The thing about Amazon is if you don't want to buy the DVD, they have awesome rental prices, check it out for yourself.<br /><br />JUSTMESD
B007THA4FI|1.0|Really? I don't care who the writer is, when every other word is the f-bomb and we turn horrid sexual encounters of rape and incest almost to the point of erotic, someone has a sick mind.  And a resolution ends with a drug overdose of a 16 year old after her 3 year old brother drowns because the teen sister was shagging in the bushes and left him unattended??!!!?????  Every sick and twisted event that parents dread their teens might get involved in is in this story so parent beware! Your teens that grew up reading Harry are going to want to read this. Don't go there.  She should have used a pen name, but then the book would have never sold
B006X96PF6|5.0|This is another item that I could find ONLY on Amazon.com! My order was placed and was received quickly without any problems.  A close friend had been looking for this item for a long time - we were both very pleased!
0452289963|5.0|Great book!! I would recommend it to everyone! Awesome message that is definitely worth reading further into. Get this book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Of the John Gresham books, conclusion was too easy. Still enjoyed reading book. If you like Gresham, read this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you can make eney thing you wont and no rules i love it i have pc and i play x box at my frends houes
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|the game was great until you do all of the missions. if they can make new missions it would get me a 5 star.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As with all of the other Mitch Rap books, this one is fast moving and has many dimensions. Sometimes the story slides into the unbelievable, but you almost expect that in this series.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting it down, and of course can't wait until the next one in the series
B00005MP58|5.0|If you've got 5 hours to kill, this is quite possibly the best way to do so!<br /><br />The acting is superb and the storyline follows that of the book quite closely (as most BBC productions do).
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love the show... and then I saw my friend playing this game on her iphone and I was like, &quot;omigod I want that!!&quot; and its pretty amazing
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Loved this trilogy, but a bit disappointed the final book was so short. I'd wait for the 3rd book to go on sale before you pay full price. Only 134 pages long, not worth the same price as the first two books. But glad I finished through with the trilogy.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I love both the old and new footloose movies.  I was at first upset they were making a new version, however I was pleasantly surprised how they kept the integrity of the movie.  It is almost a replica with a slight modern twist.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'm no movie critic there aren't too many movies I absolutely dislike, movies are for entertainment and this one is definitely entertaining.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|For the most part, I love all the characters..especially Sheldons' mother! I also like the fact that the elevator has yet to be repaired after 5 seasons.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game rocks! It is so fun to play on both Survival and Creative modes, but Mojang really needs to fix the update problem. My two bros. have v0.5.0 and when i tap UPDATE, it says there was an error downloading. What the HECK!?
0802473156|5.0|This book had filled many gaps in our marriage.  It's nice to understand how the other person in the relationship is feeling.
B007M45PMU|5.0|If you like the Avett Brothers, Mumford and Sons, or any other bands that are kind to the ears, you will love this. Nuff said.
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|This movie has the interesting effect of what might happen when good<br />intentions, might have some very serious and unforeseen consequences,<br />on some people, not privileged to be with the initial planning group.<br />This movie has relatively good special effects for the time it was created.
0345803485|1.0|I was curious to see what all the fuss was about, I read Harry Potter and Twilight and Hunger Games and enjoyed them.  So, I heard about this thinking it'd be just as good but on its own terms. It's absolute crap, the writing sounds like a 12 year old who's just begun a school project. I can't get into it at all because the whole time I'm thinking, how the hell am I supposed to take this seriously when it's so bad I want to laugh? So.. don't bother!
B005MM6ICK|5.0|The initial concept presented in this movie might be possible in the near future.<br />The final concept takes a real leap of faith as to how far can one expand.<br />I recommend this movie to all analytical types of people, who love to seek out<br />alternate possibilities.
0061715050|5.0|Ordered this via Amazon prime, and it came within 2 business days. Beautiful reproduction of the 1st edition, nice page weight and smooth printing. High-quality satin coated dust jacket and fabric embossed cover with gold detailing on the binding. I liked the original color art reproduction on the inside page too.
B0041T4ML4|5.0|I enjoyed this book mainly because it is set in a dystopian (the opposite of utopian) future in which seeds and calories are are valuable a commodity as oil today. This problem is very believable because of famines caused by over-reliance on a few species and the resulting crop weaknesses to pests and disease. This new world contains the super-rich, the starving poor, and few in between. More specifically, it is set in exotic Thailand, which adds some surprising cultural elements to the story.<br /><br />The female protagonist is an outcast and persecuted for what she is. Various men use her and protect her in turn, but she manages to survive. This is a book for adults and may be triggering for victims of abuse, but it can serve to show the horrific effects of abuse.
B0006AQLWU|5.0|I didn't realize there were full-page color pictures peppered throughout the book! the artwork is absolutely stunning, and captures the characters in all the youth and beauty that Jane Austen probably intended them to have. Mr. Wickham is absolutely dashing!! I can't believe I got a 1940s edition in such good condition and for such a great deal.
0062213423|4.0|My niece loved it. Great glossy  pictures and a quick read full of all the details any teenage girl needs
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great Movie if you are into superhero movies or used to read comic books.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book gets my highest rating. I read all the time and the plot twists and turns weren't always predictable.Suggested Read!
B006VRDZ44|5.0|I am in the process of watching Boardwalk Empire and I like what I see so far.  Steve Buscemi's character is dense and he shows that he can really shine in a leading man role.  I like the fact that there are so many subplots going on here also.  Costumes, haircuts, and scenery are absolutely stunning.  Top quality.
B007SGM084|1.0|I am so sorry I picked up this trilogy. It did not make my life better and the time it took to read it will never be recovered.  I read a little bit of everything but this was deleted from my Kindle.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|As I said in the title, it's Nora Jones! That about says it all! Another great album! She just keeps getting better, can't wait for her next one!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a awesome game!  I would play it all day long!  You can earn so many points and keep getting more games.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My sister has it on her Ipad.  Plays well, no issues. Glad it was available for the Fire. Would recommend.
0060558121|5.0|item arrived when expected (actually sooner), slightly used description as described - happy with my purchase.  good communication from vendor.
B00846F1YW|3.0|The average rating of four stars is too high for a game of touch & read.  Not at all challenging.  Three stars at best--average
B0042QNP2S|5.0|My son has always wanted a Bruder, after shopping around this was a great price.  Shipping happened as expected, easy purchase.  Will buy again!
030726999X|5.0|if your looking for any audio book, i employ you to try this trilogy.  the girl with the dragon tattoo trilogy is an awesome read, evident by it's TWO SETS of trilogy movies made in 5 years.... must read////  listen...
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you like Grisham, you'll love The Racketeer! It's a page turner that keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen next.
0780772318|5.0|Sabriel is quite simply on of my all time favorite books. I often re-read books, but this book is different I just couldn't forget it. I read the hard bound copy in high school about 13 years ago for the first time. I have always remembered it and it's author Garth Nix all these years. I have wanted to re-read it but was unable find a large print version since I became legally blind shortly after reading it. I recently got a kindle so Sabriel (and the rest of the series) is some of the few books I have chosen to purchase. When I re-read it I was thrilled to see that the book was BETTER than I remembered. Garth Nix's writting is creative, imaginative, and enthralling. The names are unique and memorable. These are like nothing I had ever read. I always go into a different world when I read a good book but this was a world unlike any I had ever been to. This is a would I would love to explore even more. I plan to return over and over.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|great game I got hooked up from the begging. I really recommend it. I play everyday its really fun. bingo. blitz is awesome.
B008KE3960|5.0|It has been a long time since I played tower defends games.  I decided to give Air Patriots a go and brother I have had a hart time putting it down.  It is a new twist to tower defends and a challenging one to boot.  My only complaint is minor...requiring takers to purchase houses vice earn them is the new norm...but not one I like.  Thumbs up to Amazon Studios for this one
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this story line and all the wool books are awesome! I will definitely keep buying the books in this series!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Another good story by this gifted author. Miss Flynn gives her main character a gifted sense of wit, a sharp tongue, and a quick mind. This particular novel ends with a twist that i(one who prides themself) on anticipating endings) didn't even see coming.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|I liked all the cameo appearances and the story was as expected for a shoot em up, but who doesn't appreciate a little blood?
B008XG1X18|5.0|At first I did not feel this would be of any benefit to me, but boy was I wrong.  Now when I come across an idea for decorating my home, a recipe that really sounds yummy, clothes for my hubby, electronics for me, or a book I just have to read, I can pin it using Pinterest and I will never forget what I found.  Thanks, great app!
B009CPJHY4|3.0|It took a while to get started, but one did get much background information in the beginning. Last half turned into a very heartwarming story.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|Shazam is now more likely to provide quick and accurate results than SoundHound. This wasn't always the case. I've had this app since it was available free in March 2011. Initially, I preferred SoundHound because the earlier versions of Shazam performed as inconsistently as SoundHound does now. With SoundHound recently, I've had far too many occasions where after several tries, the song was over... I've even compared the results of two identical Gingerbread devices with Shazam on one and SoundHound on the other. I was perplexed as to why SoundHound has gotten worse while Shazam has improved. The bottom line is, if you want to be sure that you'll be able to identify the song before it's over, use Shazam first. I've recommended Shazam to many others on the few occasions that it's marked down and I recommend it highly on the basis of improvement with age.
B008Y1YFOE|5.0|I love this CD. I got this for my boyfriend and I know he is going to love this CD! I'm uber excited!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|the post wall doest go all the way. stop to up 10 posts then thats it... not same as my phone or laptop.
B00992CF6W|5.0|A good inrerpretation of the real game, although you still haven't really tried minecraft until you've tried the Pc or maglc version. Don't think its worth five dollars until it gets to 1.3.2, but still a good app.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this is amazing it lets you download straight to you gallery. I think that if they keep this in the app store millions of people will want this app trust me jlove
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book so interesting and never wanted to put it down can't wait to read the next books to see what happens
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|It moves along at a good pace. I like the authenticity efforts they make in sets & clothing. Good action & the ending is surprising and well done leading up to it.
B0086213XW|4.0|This is definitely a Michelle Williams movie, not a typical Seth Rogen movie. It's nice to see Seth playing more serious role, he does it well. Michelle tends to take roles that involve a character who's not sure if she's happy or unhappy in her marriage, and this is no exception. She does it well, though. They do a good job of developing the characters and giving you a feel of who they truly are. The overall cinematography is well executed and keeps a fresh perspective. Don't come into this movie expecting a lot of laughs, it's definitely more of a \\"chick flick.\\"
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Great in the theater. I buy very few DVDs but decided to get this one for my mom. The sets and scenery held up well in the transition to small screen.
B00979CS50|5.0|A great Master Piece from the Master! A must for any Neil Young fan and for those who enjoy good music.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|My Husband gave this book this rating,because he does not like that the storyline diviates to much to the caracters private thoughts and lifes
B007SGM084|5.0|I had to see what all the fuss was about, and though I'd never thought this would be to my liking, it was clearly to my needing.  Ummm, may I also say, this was a sure fire cure to diminished hormones of menopause.....
B005I6EU7U|5.0|love the cover a lot.my kindel fire looks like a book.keeps my kindel safe on travels since it is leather it is very durable
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was compelled to turn each page.  The characters, I will miss.  The sentiment will live on through each flower I ever give.
B001XUPF2O|4.0|good acting, lots of action in this move but I preferred the first few movies over this one. It may be true to the comic book but diverges from the Adam West TV series.
B005LAII08|1.0|Beware! It's not a Disney movie!<br />It's not a Pixar movie!<br />After the first 15 mn I really felt uncomfortable and God knows<br />how much I usually love Pixar and Disney.<br />Finally I hated it.<br />It only takes one person to have a bad marriage.<br />Brave is a result of this marriage.<br />Unfortunately some beautiful images didn't fool me.<br />Lack of everything and no substance.<br />What a shame!<br />My wish upon a star: I hope BRAVE will push Pixar and Disney to divorce...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Addictive, thrilling, exasperating, all in all a great show! Can't wait for the next episode on Sunday... to bad I have to wait!
B0001I561E|5.0|BEST movie in the world! DVD came without any scratches, original packaging... I will def purchase from this vendor again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is as good as the games in the arcade.<br /><br />i would say it is almost better then the arcade game.
B0098VXN2Y|4.0|Any new or expecting mom must see this. Will make you laugh and you will definaly relate to all thats happening..lol
B00A7ZWUJC|2.0|This album is not what i expected from her. Her latest album was done very lazy, and the constant f words what kind of songwriting is that! She has done so much better than this. Hopefully her next album will be better.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Cute show...funny and full of fun action and funny happenings.  I Wouldnt call it a show stopper , just average.
B000002KXV|5.0|This album has always been a top 3 favorite of all time for me. I'm just replacing an older CD for the third or fourth time. This does not include the vinyl or cassette. It doesn't get much better than this.
B008CPBB0I|5.0|We sat doen for family movie night. This was a great story, well acted and very touching. Would highly recommend it
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I love the fact that Donald Fagen doesn't stop putting out the music. He did a GREAT job with this album teaming up with Michael Leonhart. It's got a raw sound with brilliant vocals coloring up the fabulous chord changes Fagen always writes.
B0090EKRKU|1.0|Did not keep interest. Was just OK...cute story, just did not hold our attention. Daughter liked it but wasnt thrilled
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you haven't read the Hunger Games trilogy yet, just do it now. I read a lot of books with dystopian societies, and this series is the best.
B008CLI3TE|3.0|I don't know whats up with these discs.... I ordered it and it takes them a long long long time to play. I tested them on other players and its not just my player.. Returned and asked for new discs and they have the same problems.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|If you loved the books, you'll appreciate the movie. If you didn't read the books, you'll probably still enjoy the movie. It seems fairly hit or miss, but as someone that read the books, I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it captured the key moments of the story. My fiance watched the movie with him, and having never read the books, still thought the movie was entertaining and easy to follow. He's looking forward to the next movie coming out.
1451648537|5.0|Describes every moment of Steve jobs. really interesting. great book. every one should read it. It's worth knowing steve. I recommend this product.
B007THA4FI|3.0|As an avid Harry Potter reader, as most of the people that rushed to read this book are, I had high expectations. I felt extremely let down, though.  Rowling seems to forget that she only has one book to introduce characters, not 7.  The amount of people and their stories gets confusing, especially in the first third of the book. It takes a long time to keep track of who's who, and by the time I figured it out, I think I had lost some of the plot.  The storyline is so-so, but the last 30 pages or so were probably the only really good part of the book. Don't read it just because you're a fan of Rowling. You might find yourself very disappointed.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a fellow service member I really appreciated getting the inside look at not only how Bin Laden was finally taken down, but everything that lead up to it in the personal stories presented in this book.  Incredible read!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you haven't read the Hunger Games trilogy yet, just do it now. I read a lot of books with dystopian societies, and this series is the best.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|If you are serious about making a big difference in your health and long-term welfare read this book and then do what it says.  I made the suggested change in diet because after reading the science behind the reasons to change our diet it just made sense.  Since making that change I have had increased energy, lost many inches off my waste and just felt better in general.  Be prepared though, this is not a diet for a while then go back to what you normally do.  This book suggests a total change and permanent change in what you eat and what we have been told is healthy for us.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|The most interesting part of this book is you could replace the zombie apocalypse with almost any disaster on a worldwide scale and it seems fairly accurate on how people and governments would respond.  Very entertaining and a very scary realization of how bad things can get!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is incredible. You pick up little details along the way, laugh and cry a little, suspend disbelief a few times, and then it ends. You're left scratching your head, and turning back to page one to start that all over again. If you haven't read this book yet, do it now, especially before you go see the movie!
B007EPESOS|5.0|Fascinating insight into a great modern myth from the great scalpel of reason that is the Hitch! Even if you disagree with the premise of the book, his use of prose alone is worth the price of admission!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A fun game that doesn't require you to think too hard, or set too much time aside.  Played it a lot waiting for and flying in planes.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Well written and was easy to relate to the characters situations. Retirement isn't easy for the majority of people who are not retired and this movie showed one of the options people may take and the positive that can come out of any situation.<br /><br />A wonderful story with very fine actors that made the movie a joy to watch.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I little bit exaggerated in the blood and killing, but a lot of suspense and surprises. New scenarios. Very good!
B0092YO8C6|5.0|Bought this to use with my younger dance classes (kindergarten to preteen).  They love it and were singing along with most of the songs.  Clean, good beat, and &#34;hip&#34; with the younger crowd.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|This was a great follow-up to the Rebus novels showing the difference between the 'old school' methodical police work, and the digital age, with the monitoring of networking sites. Malcolm also making brief appearances, but not stealing any of Rebus's thunder. An excellent crime story being spread to not only Edinburgh, but also to the Highlands!
B009OA57MI|4.0|I purchased this game because I downloaded and enjoyed the Carrier Landing game when it was the FAOTD.  This game allows you to not only take-off and land, but perform missions.  You can attack ground targets like SAM sites, AA guns, oil tanks and ships.  One downside is the only air targets you can take down are helicopters - and they are particularly tough to shoot down in some missions.  One big upside to the game is the option to create your own maps and missions, as well as download other people's creations.  I just wish they would add more aircraft to fly, and more targets to destroy!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I picked this rating because it is just a book of words and defanitions. I  think people who like to learn words should read this.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|Completely worthless. The motor played records unevenly, and the catridge was so poor that there was no depth to the music, like listening through a 1965 transistor radio. Threw it into the thrash after trying two different vinyl records in decent shape. The records were not the problem. Transfer to MP3 did not make the sound any better. Buyer beware.
B008K5T5AI|3.0|I've always enjoyed the Culture series of books and instantly bought this when I saw it was available.  The opening started out obscurely intriguing, which was promising.  But it quickly became very clear that the supposed dreadful information that could prevent the subliming of the Gzilt was not actually going to prevent anything.  Thereafter it became a game of explore odd worlds whilst searching for clues.  Any suspense was lost.  Just another book to add to the shelf that you'll not bother to pull out again.  After the excitement of 'Surface Detail' and the rollicking adventure of 'Matter', this is a great disappointment.  Certainly there are interesting things to see and experience that'll add to your knowledge of the Culture, but without anything at stake for the parties involved this story just lacked heart.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I wasn't planning on sharing my thoughts, but after seeing \\"Prometheus\\" twice now, and having thought it over and reading over Mr. Wallace's review herein - as well as Mr. Bullock's - I realized I couldn't keep silent.  Firstly, I REALLLY wanted to love this film!  My favorite film of all time is still, after 30 years, \\"Blade Runner\\", so its not too difficult to figure out that Ridley Scott is one of my absolute favorite directors.  I have enormous respect for his visual acumen and storytelling panache.  I also have great love for the \\"Alien\\" series (as well as the combo-pack fun of the AVP stories), so when it became clear to me that \\"Prometheus\\" was a prequel to this series - and basically the founding of the mythos behind it - I was very excited to see it.<br /><br />Alas, I have to say I was disappointed in many respects.  Visually, Mr. Scott does not disappoint.  The imagery and the characters - both humanesque and nothing-like-human - are exquisitely realized.  We find ourselves in a believable universe where this could take place.  We even get a visual primer, which stems from our much improved understanding of how DNA and Evolution work, as to how the animal life on Earth - and elsewhere - could have come about with such diversity and flourishment (aside from the more likely causes scientific research has given us).  \\"Spock\\" says it in \\"Star Trek II\\":  any previously existing life would be \\"destroyed in favor of its new matrix.\\"  The Engineers in \\"Prometheus\\" appear willing even to sacrifice themselves to foster this new matrix.  That done, in what follows, we're unfortunately subjected to much visual richness and beauty while having to endure stupid humans who are supposed to be the smartest 'guys' in the room.  Not folks you normally find swilling entire bottles of champagne by themselves just because their goal wasn't reached on the first DAY of exploration!?!  What scientist does that?  They usually work for years and years before seeing results!  Things go south from there.<br /><br />Unfortunately, aside from his dissertative review of the multiple discs for this blu-ray, Mr. Wallace's assessment of the film itself is far from accurate - in fact, it's hooey.  This film IS a horror flick, just like its antecedents; and its meant to be.  It's got the haunted hallways aspect, and a number of well-done gross-out moments; as well as the freaky-monsters-who eat-you aspect.  So all the bases are covered.  The problem with any good \\"ghost\\" story (scary story) is that you have to find a way to get your characters to be there for the climax - the \\"money shot\\" as it were.  When you're doing \\"Friday the 13th\\" or \\"Halloween\\", you're dealing with ordinary or even sub-ordinary folk - people stupid enough to see a dark hallway with blackened rooms on a lightning-filled, 'dark and stormy night' and still make the decision to walk up the stairs (or down) to investigate; of course, to their own gruesome demise!  That's what we've paid for and that's what we get.<br /><br />With Science Fiction, that particular challenge tends to be brought into specific relief because anything having to do with science requires that the characters dealing with that science must necessarily be experts in their fields.  If they're experts in their fields, they've had to have gone to college - a lot!  In order to be at the top of your field enough to be invited as one of only 17 people to travel through interstellar space to investigate the possible origins of life on Earth, you've got to be extremely focused, dedicated to your field, driven, and clear-headed; in short, the smartest guys in the room.  In order to face the unknown, people of that level of intelligence will have taken every precaution to keep their interference with or contamination of their work to as close to absolute zero as possible.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say these Promethean \\"scientists\\" are some of the sorriest, most screwed up (I almost used the 'f' word) bunch of misfits everto sully the silver screen (well maybe not as bad as those in \\"Meteor\\" or \\"Armageddon;\\" I'd forgotten about those flicks momentarily).  The great thing about the first two \\"Alien\\" movies was that the people involved were just ordinary folk - the \\"Nostromo\\"'s crew were basically glorified tugboat drivers and truckers, and the \\"Sulaco\\"'s crew and company - aside from the fully educated and savvy Ellen Ripley - were a bunch of Marines and a doomed pencil-pusher; no need for high intelligence here.  So because they were normal, ordinary folk like you and me, we were along for the ride with them - knowing that what little more we knew than they would do little to make us think less of them for getting stuck in the path of a voracious species of killing machines.  Not so here:  we expect - nay, we crave - that these experts who've been well-groomed in the ways of the Scientific Method, would follow those sacred protocols and avoid the deep dark tunnels and slimey oil-goo on the floor and the walls.  But NO!<br /><br />Now in its defense, if our intrepid scientists WERE smart enough to steer clear, it would've been MUCH more difficult to put a two-hour movie together, and that's my point. The fault falls much more on the writers and producers than anyone else.  The writers needed to spend another six months or even year on this script to try and find ways to give us the goods without giving us idiotic brainiacs who blithely give themselves to the devil before our eyes.  And I think that's what Mr. Bullock's review is getting at as well.  He is, sadly, too too correct in his great little quiz - we the viewers are apparently much smarter than the PhDs running around on LV223 getting themselves munched and transformed in the process.  That's where the believability aspect falls apart.  I can't believe that a truck driver - let alone an expert scientist - would walk up to a living organism its never seen before - something looking like a king cobra without eyes, and start cooing to it and want to stick his finger in its mouth!  Who the 'ef' does that?  Seriously.<br /><br />It's too bad, because I wanted so much to give this ride the full five stars, but I just can't.  i give it 3 so that I can say \\"See It\\" and enjoy the horror/haunted house story for what its worth.  But don't go looking for intelligent scientists who know what they're doing, cause these losers would be kicked out of the corps if they ever made it back home after this.  It is clear that at least one, if not two, more film(s) will carry us to the point where they end and the very first \\"Alien\\" begins.  I only hope that someone stops long enough to write some intellect into the characters as we move forward.  We're rooting for you, scriptwriters - try not to let us down, okay?!<br /><br />3 STARSto sully the silver screen (well maybe not as bad as those in \\"Meteor\\" or \\"Armageddon;\\" I'd forgotten about those flicks momentarily).

B009RI4FRU|5.0|Watched it with my 11 year old son, who also was enchanted by it. Interesting bridge between Anderson's more adult and more child-centric films.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|the baby loves this. the monkey makes it more easy to keep track of and also helps somewhat with keeping her from spitting it out.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|I have to admit that I am more a Donald Fagen fan than I am a Steely Dan fan (although I sure love than band too). It took Fagen 24 years to complete the trio of The Nightfly (1982), Kamakiriad (1994) and Morph the Cat (2006), boxed as \\"The Nightfly Trilogy\\" in 2007. It wasn't clear then whether Fagen would continue solo after the 2006 album, but that has now been answered. After a 'mere' 6 years, here comes Fagen's 4th solo album.<br /><br />\\"Sunken Condos\\" (9 tracks; 44 min.) starts off with a subtly seducing \\"Slinky Thing\\". It is followed by an even better \\"I'm Not the Same Without You\\", the most uptempo tune on here (and where Fagen croons \\"Since you've been gone/An awesome change has come about/My life is different now/I'm not the same without you\\", talk about a kiss-off!). \\"Memorabilia\\" and \\"Weather In My Head\\" continue the jazzy funk vibes. The most surprising tune on the album is Fagen's cover of Isaac Hayes' \\"Out of the Ghetto\\", which I read Fagen (who is Jewish) feels transposed well into the feelings of the Jewish ghettos of WWII, what a great track. But wait there is more! Track 8, \\"Good Stuff\\" is another can't-miss highlight jazzy funk song. The closer \\"Planet d'Rhonda\\" is the perfect way to wrap things up.<br /><br />In all, this is nothing short of another pristine solo album from Donald Fagen, and for me a logical continuation of his previous three solo albums. I've seen Steely Dan in concert live a number of times over the years, but never had the good fortune of seeing Fagen perform his solo material. One of the things on my concert \\"bucket\\" list. Meanwhile, if you love Fagen's previous solo output, you cannot go wrong with \\"Sunken Condos\\". HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I decided I'd check this out.  I love archery, it looked cute, the main character is cute, the voice actors are great.<br /><br />If you have kids that HAVEN'T already seen this, rent/buy it!!!!
0062124293|1.0|Thought this might be a fun read but didn't live up to some of the hype.  Mostly boring, some high spots of humorous moments in this woman's life as a child.  Tends toward tirades in an unfunny tone.  Recommend against buying this...not interesting in terms of feminism, not funny except in limited segments, tirades are emotional rather than intellectual, offers advice that doesn't appear helpful to others but rather a justification of the author's limitations as a woman.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|I pre-ordered a copy of this book for the Amazon Kindle, which I read on my ipad.<br /><br />Tim Ferriss' The 4-Hour Chef tries too hard. I believe the author wanted to cover a lot, and he does, but as a result the book often loses sight of its topic. The parts of the book about cooking are good, and there is some unique content throughout.<br />The main problem with the book is there is too many things unrelated to cooking, and this costs this review two stars. For example, he includes about three chapters about learning languages, complete with the top 100 most frequent words in the English language. I don't think this was necessary. It isn't interesting or new content either.<br />He also includes long boring lists with little relevance to the topic. The essential cooking equipment he recommends you have is forgivable. But he also has a few pages devoted solely on what accessories he bought for his gun, or how to make a lean-to debris shelter. For a book about cooking, I didn't think I would read about which pair of binoculars I should buy.<br /><br />The cooking sections are solid though. It follows roughly a skill progression layout. So the first recipe is the easiest and you are introduced to new skills and recipes as it goes on (skipping over the irrelevant content of course). And there are a few interesting pages in the book too, for example, how he caught pigeons with his bare hands.<br /><br />This is the first \\"How to Cook\\" book I've read, and its okay. I feel that there are much better tutorials out there though.
B008OOYALE|2.0|This is a fun but there is no way to get gold and you have to pay for it. The good dragons coasts like 235 pieces of gold. For 1.99 you get 30 pieces of gold. So more ways to get gold
0451196716|4.0|It is with some amount of hesitation that I review and, yes, even recommend \\"The Long Walk\\" by Stephen King, written under his psuedonym of Richard Bachman.  While I greatly admire King's writing style, I am not a horror fan, and read his works solely because he is so good at what he does that it makes me willing to venture into a genre I normally wouldn't touch.  \\"The Long Walk\\" is one of his lesser-known pieces, and while not perfect, is a shining example of how even his early work is above and beyond that of most horror writers.<br /><br />Reader discretion is strongly advised regarding this book -- King, while an excellent writer who's clearly a master of his craft, has a rather twisted imagination, and when he wrote as Richard Bachman he was even more sick and brutal in his stories. \\"The Long Walk,\\" which some reviewers have compared to \\"Battle Royale\\" or an adult version of \\"The Hunger Games,\\" is no exception.<br /><br />This book is set in a dystopian future where the USA has fallen under a military dictatorship, and focuses on an event that can only be called a bloodsport -- the titular Long Walk. One hundred volunteers, all teenage boys, participate in the Walk, which goes by the following rules:<br /><br />1. You cannot stop for any reason. If you stop, fall, or drop under 4 MPH, you get a warning.<br />2. After three warnings, you get your \\"ticket\\"... a bullet.<br />3. The last surviving walker wins.<br /><br />This book is dark and brutal, and most definitley not for all tastes. But it's fantastically written, maintaining an edge of suspense throughout. King's gift for words shines through as he describes the small towns and backwoods of Maine, and his characters all feel and sound real, which makes the knowledge that only one among them will survive all the more awful. And the characters' discussions among themselves as they walk -- their various motives for participating, not to mention their gradually decaying mental states as the Walk takes its toll -- are morbid yet fascinating in their own right.<br /><br />If you're squeamish, I would avoid this book.  If you're looking for a pat, happy ending (or heck, even an understandable one -- this one ends in something of a mindscrew), I would avoid this book.  But if you're interested in a look at King's early work, and at a raw, often disturbing but always sympathetic psychological study and suspense read, I would give this a look.-- are morbid yet fascinating in their own right.<br /><br />If you're squeamish, I would avoid this book.

B009PF93LS|5.0|With guests including but not limited to the Puppini Sisters (Jingle bells, Frosty the snowman), Shania Twain (White Christmas) and Thalia (Mis Deseos / Feliz Navidad), this album is the kind of album we have come to expect from Michael Bubl&eacute;. There is one original song here, co-written by Michael with Alan Chang and Bob Rock, that being Cold December night. You might have heard every other song here before, but Michael and his supporting team bring their own distinctive touch to each of them, sometimes staying with an easy listening sound, but veering towards jazz at other times, especially when joined by the Puppini sisters.<br /><br />The real surprise to me was the inclusion of Santa baby, originally made famous by Eartha Kitt and recorded by many female singers in the years since. Even Madonna recorded it (for the first [[ASIN:B00000ASL4 A Very Special Christmas]]), but I don't ever remember hearing a male version before. Then again, male versions exist of Stand by your man {the three that I know about are by David Allan Coe, Lyle Lovett and Elton John), so I shouldn't be surprised really. Michael wisely changes the lyrics to sing Santa buddy, and it works well with that modification.<br /><br />On the ever-popular Silent night, Michael is superbly backed by a children`s choir. I understand that this is the most-recorded Christmas song in the world and it's hard for anybody ro do a really distinctive version while maintaining the feel of the song, but Michael and the children did well. Michael put in another fine performance on Blue Christmas, recapturing the spirit of Elvis in his own way, by jazzing it up.<br /><br />Apart from the tracks already mentioned, I particularly like those that I hear less frequently (relatively speaking; they are all very familiar to me), such as It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, A holly jolly Christmas, All I want from Christmas is you (originally written and made famous by Mariah Carey) and Christmas (baby please come home), the classic Phil Spector original.<br /><br />I've mentioned most of the tracks here, just leaving I'll be home for Christmas, Ave Maria (with an adult choir),  The Christmas song (chestnuts roasting on an open fire), Winter wonderland and Silver bells, all of which Michael performs superbly without doing anything radically different with them.<br /><br />This is an excellent Christmas album, with plenty of familiar songs but enough variation to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Tracks<br /><br />1.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|this book was amazing. it had me feeling sick due to parts where i wanted to know what would happen next.. makes you feel the emotion of the characters. i just loved that i got so emotional and such over Gideon and Eva. Wow. just amazing....
B005GVA2L0|5.0|This is my favorite Evenescence album so far. I saw them play most of these songs live this past September, and Amy and the band were fantastic. I've never seen anyone put more energy and enthusiasm into a performance. The bonus tracks are a good addition and the interviews and &#34;making of&#34; stuff on the DVD are fun.
B007V65R54|4.0|This is not a textbook but rather a narrative with some simple math and statistics illustrations.<br /><br />Nate gives a clear description of bad vs. good analysis. It is clear that political pundits who know how to use good analysis have an advantage.<br /><br />This is essentially how Nate predicted the 2012 national election with such high accuracy. He has been tracking the opinions, based on polls, and determining which are the most predictive. He uses a broad range of polls and weights them based on their past history of accuracy in past elections.<br /><br />The book is intended for the lay person to understand that there is wide variation in the performance in the work of analysts. Part of the key differentiation between analysts that rely on discredited frequentist statistical methods, which are still being taught at our universities, and those that embrace Bayesian statistical methods, which are being used by actuaries, gamblers and anyone who has an an informed opinion potential future events.<br /><br />The frequentists are discredited because their methods do not predict events well, and are also discredited because much research that draws incorrect conclusions are based on these methods. The bayesian approach is becoming the preferred approach for predictive model building because it uses all informed opinions about the future and tests them. The models built in this manner improve over time as opinions that are proven right take on more weight in predictions, and opinions that prove incorrect are diminished and removed from the analysis.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I love this album. I can not wait to see them open up for DMB in December in Philly! They are a refreshing band these days.
B009IF7V2S|3.0|This is a funny movie, but it is not worth sitting still. Plan to do a lot of multi tasking while you watch.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Because this is on my smart phone, it is very small. You usually cannot get the entire game tiles display on the screen all at the same time, so I had to move the screen up and down and side to side to see what all the tile designs were and then select one. It started out very hard to make the tiles select (or light) when I touched them. Sometimes I had to touch on them over and over to get one to select that tile. You can make it bigger, which makes it easier to select the tiles, but then you have to move the screen back and forth even more to see all the tile choices. There is some advertising along the top of the screen which makes it an even smaller usable screen to play on. It is fun to play if you like Mahjong, just a little difficult. I will probably mostly stick to Mahjong on my computer instead of my smart phone.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I really liked tis book and the one before it Something Borrowed.  Wish they would make this one into a movie too.
1600242197|5.0|I LOVED this book. After I read it my husband read it and he is not much of a reader. He loved it too. We ended up loaning it out to several people to read and no one said they did not like it.<br />There is some strong language in it so if that bothers you don't read it. I don't care for the cussing, but given that it was a true story and they told it how it was, I took it all in stride.<br />We even bought this on CD after reading the book. That means We both really liked it A LOT. I have never before bought something twice on purpose.<br />It will tear your heart out in places, and give you new respect for the Navy Seals and all the &#34;special forces&#34; for that matter. It covers some of what they go through it their training, and just how determined and tough someone has to be to complete the course. It is hard to imagine what all Marcus went through and still managed to survive and make it back home. I am in awe of him and all Navy Seals. Like I said &#34;new respect&#34; that's what I have for them.<br />For my husband and I, this was an Excellent book!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Love the TV Show - LOVE this series of books even more! After I'm done with this series, I may just go back and read the Storm series.
B005HSL626|4.0|I got this game on the kindle because I loved the I-pad version so much and its really fun but after I got it, I quickly earned all the blades and backrounds there was nothing really else to do. I gave It  4 stars because it also kept freezing on the loading leaving the screen blank white and other times when I would just have earned a new blade or backeround you could see the outline of the &quot;new&quot;  blinking, but there was obliously a glitch . I wont sit there being grumpy and giving everyone you personel opinion about what you think of all the glitches and  bad things about the game ( Honestly, no offense.) because it is a good game and im really glad that its free but do be beware that it may come with a few mistakes. so dont say I didnt tell you so....
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The 3D in this movie is amazing, i really like it. If you already have your 3D tv, this is one of the MUST movies you need.<br />The only thing i found negative, is that, if you'll use the subs, they put them flying on the image instead of in the back and that makes a little awkward.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|Was rather nervous when I ordered this as there were a few negative reviews but I am delighted, it is just what I want for my kindle, fits perfectly and is very lightweight. Also the price of just over $10 plus a $3 rebate makes it irresistible!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|What a thrill and trying to figure out who is helping Gerard. Awesome acting and actors.<br />Don't hestitate purchasing it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A no-nonsense narrative of events leading to the end of one of the most infamous figures in modern history.  I like that the book is refreshingly straightforward and does not delve into the politics of foreign policy.  A pleasant surprise is the firsthand account of how the meeting went after with President Obama and VP Biden; with one of the SEALs thinking how Biden acted out like 'a drunk uncle at a party'.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Well worth the purchase and time (short because it's almost unputdownable) spent on it.  Five stars.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|My wife is a childbirth educator, so when she saw this movie listed as we were browsing, I knew we wouldn't be watching an action movie that night.<br />Even though there's not a lot of stuff blowing up, it's still a pretty good movie, and worth the rental for sure.  The variety of characters is sure to provide someone you can relate to, and in the end, I felt like I was really rooting for everyone to have a happily ever after conclusion.<br />One of the rare movies that we both really enjoyed together.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Great way to stay and get connected with all your business contacts!  I enjoy the discussions brought up within the many different groups.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I always remembered watching this movie as a kid and loving it, so I picked it up to see if it was all just nostalgia. Good news, it wasn't!
B0050PYNO4|1.0|Simon and Pegg's take on zombies was fresh and funny.  This is neither.  If you enjoy a retread of the most banal \\"humor\\" summer teen movies have done much better, and you love to bash on entire groups of people--Southerners and Christians, in this case--in a hate-filled, demeaning manner, this may seem like entertainment to you.<br /><br />I attended the movie with people who are not Southerners, and they felt uncomfortable at the sweeping and continual condemnation of those who are different from themselves.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|With sequels and follows on a dime a dozen these days, it's a rare thing to find a sequel that lives up to its' predecessor. This film does that and more, with a good storyline and building on great characters.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|I enjoyed this tale of gods brought to America by the multitude of immigrants and slaves that built this country.  I suppose if I read better I could explain the sacrifice, the storm, the journey to the afterlife and all the other plot twists in this very long book.  Did it have to be this long?<br /><br />The best parts of the book describe the foreign gods- the journey to the new world, the natives, the slave's gods. The worst part of this book was Shadow. He was a cold, oaf of a man. I was apathetic to most of the characters and gods.<br /><br />Some of my highlights from the book:<br /><br />\\"Gods die. And when they truly die they are unmourned and unremembered. Ideas are more difficult to kill than people, but they can be killed, in the end.\\"<br /><br />\\"Liberty is a bitch who must be bedded on a mattress of corpses.\\"<br /><br />\\"Even King David knew that there is one easy prescription to get warm blood flowing through an old frame: take one virgin, call me in the morning.\\"<br /><br />\\"The house smelled musty and damp, and a little sweet, as if it were haunted by the ghosts of long-dead cookies.\\"
B003VANOFY|5.0|I got this product to replace another Logitech wireless headset which had lasted me several years before the connector broke on the charging point. This headset is of the same great construction and includes a lot of new useful features including programmable macro buttons on the side. Comfortable even when worn for a while.

1451688091|4.0|This is an excellent lincoln political bio. however i would not recommend to a novice reader. this bio is well researched and professionally written. the first third of the history is somewhat difficult to follow, and you may get adrift in the text....and give up..but if you continue. (and it might be hard for some) you will be rewarded with a truly enjoyable historical reading bout one of the greatest human beings whoever lived. My admiration increased 10 fold....was that possible...<br />YES!!!
1419705849|5.0|I was so happy and surprise when I got this book as a gift to my brother. I was satisfied to see how great the condition of the used book was.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This is an intriguing plot, but the villain was disappointing.  Scarpetta seemed way anxious and seriously paranoid.  Still a good read, though.
B0013TPVGK|5.0|If you are a rhythm section player, this book is an excellent way to challenge your thinking, both while practicing and on the bandstand.
0385535147|5.0|great book, Grisham really rocked it on this one.  The ending was not exactly what I predicted which makes it a great story
B009YX02T8|5.0|This album is better than Breaking Dawn Part 1. The last one doesn't really fit with the whole group, but this one goes back to the same \\"moody\\" feel the first three had.

B00ADII8YE|5.0|I've been dropping 2 bucks an episode to keep up with season 3 here on Amazon, and I have NOT been disappointed...Small price to pay to get my weekly fix. If you've watched since the very first episode like me, there is no going back: you're going to find a way to get your Walking Dead!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|So much pony hopefully they change it so you don't have to pay real money to finish the game, but you get what you pay for from the start.
B002RKSZKI|3.0|I gave this book a 3 out of 5 because, I am not into these kind of books. I kind of liked it and I kind of didn't like it.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie is a wonderful adaption of Jane Austen's classic novel. The characters are played flawlessly. The time perioud is captured so perfectly. All the costumes and scenery is so beautiful. The BBC produced this film and it shows. The movie is a mirror of the classic book. Such a romantic story told oh so well.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|High on freedom after the denouement of season 2, Dexter's third season begins with a dentist's appointment. Dexter informs his physician of his holiday exploits, including a \\"prize\\" he won at a carnival. The action and story are a rip-roaring roller coaster of suspense and out-of-the-woodwork surprises, including an impulsive (yet inadvertent) act by our eponymous antihero in the very first episode.<br /><br />New characters are introduced, including Miguel Prado, the Miami ADA and Joseph Quinn, a homicide detective who is under investigation by Internal Affairs. Deb is still gunning to be a detective, Batista's exploits are recognised by LaGuerta, and Masuka is as foul-mouthed and dirty-minded as ever. Rita and Dexter entwine their relationship even further following a revelation at the first episode's climax.<br /><br />While the focus is still primarily on Dexter, he mulls over the idea of friendship and trust, and whether, as a self-confessed monster, he can let others glimpse a corner of his shadowy Dark Passenger. Harry manifests more visibly in Dexter's thoughts and deeds. There is a conflict between the ideals of LaGuerta, Prado and Ellen Wolfe, a fiery criminal defense attorney.<br /><br />IMO, this is the strongest of the initial three seasons, and should not be missed.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This is such a wonderful adaptation of the classic John Steinbeck novel. The Joad family is so rich in love and hope against poverty. The story takes place against the backdrop of the Great Depression and the natural disaster of the Great Dust Bowl of the1930's  The family loses their farm in Oklahoma. They have heard from others that their is work in California as migrant workers.  So they pack up what they can carry on their dilapidated  truck and head west. They face trials and tribulations on the road as they come upon encampmentso<br />of other travelers that are just as hungry and poor as they are. Some are starving.<br /><br />The book and the movie are slightly different. Of course, the book which won a Pulitzer Prize for Steinbeck is wonderful, the movie is very well written and not to far of track. Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad and does a wonderful job.<br /><br />It's a very good story of hope over adversity and is timeless. I hope people enjoy it as much as I do.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 improved on Persona 3 in almost every way - more varied music, less repetition, gaudier dungeons, more freedom outside story scenes, more varied social links, a more enjoyable combat system (with direct control), and a murder mystery that avoids the maudlin and excessively overt attempts at heartstring-tugging.<br /><br />What more could one ask? Well, more time to maximise social links, more cutscenes, characters and anime scenes, of course. Atlus delivers this in spades, and this will doubtlessly take up countless hours and encourage many sleepless nights. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the Puritanical M rating in the US, though. There is hardly anything inappropriate for 14 or 15-year olds. Heck, even Australia rated the original PS2 game as suitable for teenagers. Grab this game before it goes out of print. You won't regret it!
B0027MJU00|3.0|I found it hard to like or sympathize with the main character of this book. Not only was she described as being unattractive, but her actions make her disagreable as well. I kept thinking I would come to like her at some point throughout the book, but I was wrong. She never really redeemed herself in my opinion. Everything else about the story was kind of depressing: murder, financial struggles, loneliness, prison, selfishness, greed, dead-beat dad issues, and self-pity. I was interested in following the story to find out what happens and who did it, but I wish I could have enjoyed it a little more along the way.
B00785P2QC|4.0|i love this app it is amazing but the prices for investing are way to high lots of break down with your trucks and more challenges you get you need more room and the prices get higher as you buy more room but this is an app i play every day and it entertains me when im bored
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read this book after reading and enjoying Gone Girl. I didn't necessarily like the main character, but I did feel sorry for her struggles. The author does a good job describing all the different people that make up this small town, so you are able to visualize it. The author seems to have a knack for creating characters with all sorts of psychological issues, wihich I find interesting. The ending had a twist that I didn't see coming. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read Gone Girl and is looking for another good read.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|the game is great. You just want to keep on playing nonstop. really additive, but love it so much now
B009S8PEHY|4.0|Nice set by a reliable Legend of Rock who has broadened into standards and classics. This Christmas songbook is more evidence of Rod Stewarts' talent.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Not too hard, but still challenging. Fun diversion. I like it better than angry birds, because it's not as frustrating.
0817439390|5.0|Bryan's book on Understanding Exposure is a good read.  This is his latest book on exposure. I have not finished reading it yet, but so far I've learned a few tricks.
B003ZJ70W4|1.0|Sex and the City 2 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I have the entire series on DVD, and I can happily watch episode after episode, but I had to take several breaks from this movie to make it all the way through.  It's nearly 2.5 hours of torture.<br /><br />If you, too, enjoyed the series and feel like you should watch SATC2 just so that you've seen it...don't!  You will be missing NOTHING!  I wasn't a fan of the first film, but at least it had a few redeeming moments.  SATC2 has absolutely nothing worthwhile.  I would prefer to pretend it never existed.<br /><br />Can women in their 40s and 50s still be sexy and fashionable and fabulous?  Absolutely!  Are the ladies any of these things in this movie?  Not for a moment!  They look like old, old women (much older than they really are) trying to pretend they are in their early 20s.  Their makeup is clown-like and their clothes consistently unflattering.<br /><br />In the original series, I could relate to some aspect of each of the women's characters.  That's a large part of what made the show appealing to me.  But in this movie, there is absolutely nothing about any of them that I relate to.<br /><br />Charlotte going crazy because her kids are too much for her?  Sure, I have kids and I get that.  But she has a nanny and doesn't work.  When she needs a break from the kids, what's stopping her?  And she's worried about the nanny bouncing around in skimpy, see-through tops in front of her husband?  Why wouldn't Charlotte request that she dress a little more conservatively for her KIDS?<br /><br />Samantha is having a hard time with menopause, so she's taking desperate measures to keep herself young?  Um, haven't we already been there with Samantha?  And didn't she already get past that?  And did the writers really INTEND to imply that menopausal women will turn into vulgar, foul-mouthed, desperate wretches if left unmedicated? Because that certainly seems to be the takeaway message.  Samantha was always over-the-top, but in SATC2 she's positively repulsive.<br /><br />Miranda can't figure out how to balance home and work?  Um, again, haven't we already covered that?  And with her patient, successful husband and wonderful nanny, was it really that hard for her to figure out that she could just switch jobs?<br /><br />Carrie resents Big because he's gotten boring and wants to lie on the couch in the evening and watch TV?  Yet again, this is a topic already covered.  Remember the episode where Carrie wanted to go out and Aidan just wanted to sit at home and eat fried chicken in bed?  Now she has a doting husband and a wonderful life with plenty of exciting things going on.  Is it really so bad that Big wants to veg out and watch the Discovery Channel a couple of nights a week?  Are we really supposed to feel sorry for her?<br /><br />All the big \\"problems\\" in the movie are hardly vexing, and certainly won't induce any soul searching.  But for 2.5 hours you will have to sit there and be aghast at how very awful this movie is.  When it is over, you will think, \\"There's 2.5 hours of my life I'll never get back.\\"  Don't say I didn't warn you.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|During and after reading this book you realize how important are your small actions and decisions you make. That dramatically changes the way you think about them and as a result you start to choose something else then you used to. Even after few days you start to see results of those decision, with time results are bigger. Except new results, finishing things you somehow couldn't before, start new things you also feel relaxed. This relaxed state of mind comes from understanding that whatever you want to achieve, have, change you can start now and results starts now. As long as you more or less keep being on that road you are practically guaranteed to reach your goal. That is only a matter of time. And all this comes from understanding that small easy changes in your actions that you keep doing every day matters greatly. In long time they create your life, your life quality or lack of it. Small things are underestimated but make big difference. Great  book.

0525478817|5.0|Before this book, I'd read another John Green book, Looking for Alaska, that everyone seemed to adore but left me feeling cold. So when I started seeing stellar reviews for this book, I was a bit skeptical that it would entrance me as much as everyone else. Still, way too many bloggers that I trusted absolutely raved about how amazing and uplifting and funny and sad this book was that I felt I had to give it a chance. So I did. (And I stayed up way too late last night finishing it.) As I wiped away my tears and hit the sack, it occurred to me that the perfect way to review this book would be to capture my feelings about it as the five stages of grief. (Very apropos given that the subject of the book is teenagers with cancer.) So before I forget this brilliant, middle of the night inspiration, I'm writing my review the day after finishing the book (which is pretty much unprecedented for me as I still have reviews to write for books I read in APRIL!!!)<br /><br />Stage 1: Denial (before starting the book): This book can't possibly be as good as everyone says it is. How can a book about teens with cancer be funny and uplifting yet also heart-breaking? And a YA book that really moves me? Bah humbug. I'm too old for these YA books. They disappoint me more often than not.<br /><br />Stage 2: Anger (within the first five chapters): Damn it! This book is brilliant! I'm loving Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters and their witty repartee and view of life. Why did I wait so long to read this? Why did I delay? Why didn't I listen? What if I'd decided to chump out and not read this and MISSED IT? Arggghhh...you stupid fool!<br /><br />Stage 3: Bargaining (about the middle of the book): I don't want this book to end. I want to stay with these characters longer. If I slow down my reading pace, I can spread the delight of this book out over a few days. Maybe if I start another book, this book will never end and I'll get to read it for days and days.<br /><br />Stage 4: Depression (at about the three-quarter mark until the end): I can barely read through my tears and my smiles. I'm having my heart broken by this author over and over. Such emotion and pain and laughter and feelings of truth and beauty. Each page takes me closer to the end of this amazing gem of a book and I don't want that to happen.<br /><br />Stage 5: Acceptance (now): Everyone was right. The Fault In Our Stars is a truly special book that transcends the YA genre and speaks to the human heart. It is fierce and funny and unapologetic and realistic and it broke my heart in the best of ways. A true five-star read and one I'm grateful to have read. Thank you, John Green. I bow before you in your brilliance. You're no Peter Van Houten!bout the three-quarter mark until the end): I can barely read through my tears and my smiles.

B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This is worthless it worked well as a free app but I downloaded the paid app.  It will not let me set the city.  I have tried several times with no avail.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|I am very disappointed that \\"When Love is Gone\\" was cut from The Muppet Christmas Carol. This is one of the movies I grew up with, and I feel it expresses the importance of paying attention to your loved ones before you lose them to time (IE, he postpones the wedding to keep advancing his career). I've always liked Jim Hensen movies, and I'm fond of a lot of Disney movies as well, but the decision to cut a song about a break up as \\"too sad\\" seems a bit harsh, considering the fact that they put songs about murder and other cold themes in their villain songs (which are always very catchy - \\"Be Prepared\\" in The Lion King).<br /><br />I believe that the UNcut version of this movie is 5 of 5 stars. I'll locate an edition with the song in it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a throwback set of mini games that does a great job occupying your time. especially on long car rides or between classes. If you are at all competitive like me you will want to complete every game. Unfortunately the points that are required to open new games can be a little excessive so you may have to play a few more than once. Over all pretty fun and doesn't require a lot of brain power.<br />Only worth it because ot is free.
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|I read about 1/3 into this book.  A lot of stuff happened, and a lot of characters got introduced.  And I kind of know what happened so far in this book with them.<br /><br />But I have no idea what happened so far.  There was a battle.  There was magic.  There was demonic possession.  And all of these things just happened randomly, with no explanation, to characters that sometimes I had just met and knew nothing about.  There were some Serious Conversations about how horrible X Character's behavior was, but still...<br /><br />Maybe it gets better.  But I'm done reading it, and I like having some idea of what's going on.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Calculator Plus Free does simple calculations that are easier to do here than by pen and paper or in my head.  It didn't help much junior and senior high school math that I needed to help the nieces and nephews with.....but we can go to google for that.
B00009R86L|4.0|This pad alleviates the discomfort of the Domke shoulder strap digging into your skin over extended periods of time. I'm a little surprised Domke doesn't just include this shoulder pad with all of their bags and slightly increase the upfront cost. Who doesn't like comfort? This pad is easy to attach & remove...should be capable of attaching to non-Domke equipment just as easily.<br /><br />Recommended for those of you taking your Domke bags out for long hikes and walkaround shoots.

B009A3NGF4|4.0|I enjoyed Babel just as much as I enjoyed Sigh No More.  Unfortunately it's more of the same, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I often lose track of which song the album might be on.  The album definitely has some 'stand out' songs, but like I mentioned before they are over quickly and then you've got just... more of the same.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Sigh No More, you'll definitely enjoy Babel, but I wouldn't expect anything radically different out of this album.
0064471837|5.0|I first picked up Sabriel from the library over a decade ago (based on the gorgeous cover!) and have never regretted doing so. This story about a girl with unique powers, who must use them to help her father and the world around her, left such a deep impression that I recommend it to everyone who asks me for a good novel of any genre. Garth Nix's writing is convincing and flows wonderfully, making the reader turn pages without noticing as they immerse themselves in the mysterious worlds of Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom.<br /><br />What makes this book stand out from so many others of similar subject is the nature of its protagonist, Sabriel. It is not often that a heroine is given such autonomy and powerful characterisation that she is able to hold the reader's attention strongly as she advances. Sabriel is smart, kind, determined and brave - an admirable role model for any young person, but especially girls. Nix has written her with such compassion and understanding of her role, you cannot help identifying with her. Most impressively, she manages to grow as a character, becoming ever more complex and perhaps even more realistic as her quest becomes more fantastical; her fears and uncertainties speak to those deep within us as she faces apparently insurmountable challenges and does what she must, no matter the cost to herself. The surrounding cast of characters and mysterious beings complement her wonderfully, and are in their own right complex and memorable.<br /><br />Packed with action, wit, and humanity, Sabriel remains one of my favourite books, and has become a favourite of many friends who have read it upon recommendation. A great story for anyone of any age looking for adventure and a protagonist they cannot help but respect.
B007Y1AVV6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the latest Keane album.  It's a bit more 'old school' than Perfect Symmetry with less electronic-y bits.  If you enjoyed Keane's first album, Hopes and Fears, you'll likely enjoy this album as well.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Good story and kept the kids interest throughout. Pixar and Disney have been a wonderful match. It is nice to see a heroine role model in movies.
044024367X|2.0|This book could have been a typical Reacher novel; but it wasn't.  It seemed flail and by that I mean that it seemed like Lee was trying to use hot topics, some from current events, to spin a yarn that would ensnare us.  But unlike his previous 11 titles, which ebbed and flowed nicely, which kept us hooked and not wanting to put them down I, like most of the reviews, could not wait to finish it.  Most of it was an unbelievable anti-war diatribe.  But the most troubling was when he suspected that Thurman had TNT and elements to construct a dirty bomb.  It was inconceivable to me that he would not call the FBI immediately.  Hello?  9-11 all over again!  Did we not recognize that the major lesson learned, post 9-11, was the lack of openness, transparency, and communication between the FBI and law enforcement?<br />Vaughan:  \\"...you should call the State Police.  Or the FBI.\\"<br />Reacher:  \\"I would have to give my name. I don't like to do that.\\"<br />F***ing excuse me?  That was a major character flaw in a former Soldier who at one time swore an oath to \\"defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  To bare true faith and allegiance to the same.\\"  Even if he mustered out with a bad attitude I think this was a huge mistake by Lee to have Reacher stand in such poor faith.  Heck, Vaughan had more spine!<br />I just retired after 32 years in the Air Force and National Guard, 3 combat tours in Iraq as a JTAC and ALO, and I can fully understand the feelings of the writer regarding deserters but to have the main character fail to respond to an imminent threat is unconscionable.  As we say here in NY, \\"if you see something, say something.\\"<br />I don't know who your military advisors are but, maybe you should hire some new ones.<br />R
B008P1EWIM|4.0|It's helpful and I love the background it displays while you're in the app! You can also have different locations saved so it doesn't matter where you are!
B009EAO38C|5.0|These guys are really amazing. You can see some of their videos on YouTube. My favorite track is Peponi (Paradise).
B009DP9D6A|4.0|It's good to hear some new stuff from this artist. Thankfully this doesn't sound like a repeat or a bunch of resampling of the same ol' same ol'. If you like Deadmou5, you'll like this. I enjoy it as ambient music when working since there is a lack of words in most of his music.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|Quality acting, directing, production, etc typical Denzel stuff.  It's great entertainment for a movie night in the crib.  grab some popcorn and enjoy.  The storyline was somewhat believable and action well suited for DW.  I saw it at the theater and picked up the DVD.  Nuff Said.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Yay! Vince and Rapp are back. Kill Shot got 3 stars from me and it is the only Flynn book I wont reread. The Last Man is a very good effort by Vince, and I have to assume he is feeling better.<br /><br />For anyone who has had to sit through an unnecessary staff meeting, the chapter about Rapp in the meeting is classic. I only wish I could have been him in some of the meetings I had to endure.<br /><br />There are no surprises in the book, but it is familiar and comfortable. It didn't take me very long to finish it, and I'm anxious to read Flynn's joint effort that was promoted at the end.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Wasn't quite sure if I would like the movie (girlfriend picked it out) but ended up enjoying it for what it was; entertainment.  The movie has some interesting takes on relationships, drugs, drug use, law enforcement, etc.  Keep a open mind, eat your popcorn and enjoy the movie.  Interesting plot as well.
0525952926|5.0|Very riveting WWII novel. Ken Follett is a master historian brilliant novelist. I  am looking forward to the 3rd in the series.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This product is an incredible deal. Blu rays go from anywhere between $19-35 usually. They remastered this and they quality is incredible, even the first movie that was made in 1979 is blu ray quality! For $20 you get all four original alien movies in blu ray quality. With over 60 hours of bonus footage, and a cool book- like case with pictures in it to house the Blu rays, it doesn't he much better than this. The Blu rays are located in this hardcover book thing inside the box, and they slip in their little pockets. Which are very secure, and you don't have to pop them out of that little plastic piece you push down on to release your disks, which is nice, since they can be scratched by those things.<br /><br />This is a must have for any Alien fan. Or even for that someone you know who loved the movie Prometheous, and has never seen the Alien movies, would like this. And even if you have seen them, if you he ths set along with Prometheous you will pick up a lot of similarities , and continuations between the movies! You'll enjoy these movies all over again with the added benefit of blu ray! Enjoy!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Very well written and riveting. I was pretty much glued to it. It does take a while to get used to each chapter/character/time switch and the colloquial the characters use, but each chapter ends up pulling you in anyway and comes back around to sew up the loose ends.

B005V4FJC4|4.0|If you like Zooey Dechanel's voice, you will certainly want to include this album in your Christmas mix.<br />I like Zooey and M. Ward's rendition of &#34;Baby it's cold outside&#34;. It reminds me of the clip of her and Will Ferrel singing in the bathroom on &#34;Elf&#34;.
0385751532|3.0|No you will not find neither a tortoise nor a hare, but an unrealistic and fictional story told from a young German boy living near something horrendous.  I will not spoil the plot as some of you may be able to partake in the naive view while you find out the truth of the situation.  Some call this piece of work kitsch,  which is completely understandable and in my opinion true, but you must read for yourself.  This is an easy and interesting read; for fast readers may only require a day or two to finish.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Amazing and chilling movie. This film increases the stereotype that the best horror films are found overseas.
1416549447|5.0|I'm a recycled runner, (late 40's) and ran in my 20's. Let's just say, older bodies need more care when getting into various physical activities. I was looking for a good source for info on running without injury.... so far so good! I started a C25K program which is working great.<br /><br />This book covers posture, breathing, pacing, foot strike, core strength, and mental attitude. All topics I can benefit from. I got this book from the library, watched all the vids on youtube, and have signed up for a 1/2 day ChiRunning workshop. The book will be a great reference. I now can say, I love running!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book has more twists and turns than an alpine hiway. Just about when you think you have the &#34;next move&#34; figured it out you get a huge surprise. I felt bad I read it in such a short time but this is one book I honestly had a tough time putting down....
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I love these kind of stories ! This story has you cheering for the marine and the little guy Ben !
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I took my wife to see this at the theater when it was first released and later bought copies of the DVD for ourselves and to give away. This is an excellent film about the most important Christian statesman in history, William Wilberforce. \\"Amazing Grace,\\" was named after the hymn written by the former slave ship captain, John Newton, who was Wilberforce's spiritual mentor. The film chronicles his tireless fight against slavery which lasted almost until the day he died, forever attributing to him the title of the greatest social reformer who ever lived. The beautiful cinematography and excellent acting immediately impressed me, especially being an independent Christian film. My only disappointment with the movie is that I would have liked it to have explored his conversion a little more, which lead him to question his career and consider the church pulpit. It also would have been nice to explore the spiritual roots of his mindset being against slavery. Before his conversion, he had already been influenced greatly by John Newton and other Christians.<br /><br />If there is any reason to doubt the connection between legislation and morality, his illustrative life should once and for all reveal the relationship as inseparable. I've also read Eric Metaxas' interesting biographical account, that the movie was based on. Wilberforce has permanently affixed upon the Christian conscience the moral obligation for political action. The idea that one cannot \\"legislate morality\\" should be forever banned as meaningless nonsense.<br /><br />  \\"Is it not the great end of religion, and, in particular, the glory of Christianity, to extinguish the malignant passions; to curb the violence, to control the appetites, and to smooth the asperities of man; to make us compassionate and kind, and forgiving one to another; to make us good husbands, good fathers, good friends; and to render us active and useful in the discharge of the relative social and civil duties? \\"<br /><br />― William Wilberforce<br /><br />Wilberforce also highly esteemed William Carey who worked as a missionary to India, together they pressured the government to outlaw such practices as infanticide and suttee (in which Hindu widows immolated themselves on their husbands' funeral pyres). Who knows, maybe a William Carey film will be next. I remember hearing talk of John Newton, but haven't seen anything yet. We'll watch and wait.

0316228532|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book as I devoured her prior writings with glee. However, this book was depressing, violent, sad, disgusting, with no redeeming qualities. I love to read and Hated reading this book. I just don't get it. Rowling is a great writer. Why this? Why in this manner?
B000RZGFYS|3.0|I don't like this like seasons, seasons is real good and I'm stuck on that now but I'll listen more later and see what's up with reign in blood then I'll get back bye
B0098VXBIA|4.0|The movie was enjoyable.  I had never used my Kindle to watch movies.  It was a good thing and I will do it more often.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I'm a fan of the Angry Birds games and Rio is a great addition to the series. Several weeks after purchasing and playing on my Kindle Fire, Angry Birds Rio stopped operating correctly on my device. I had played almost exclusively without a WiFi connection but after the initial few weeks the game alerts me that it won't run without a connection. I've since read reviews that this is a bug with the game and it's no longer supported by the Kindle Fire. A big bummer for those like me who've paid for the game.
B007WOFXB8|5.0|The album had all the songs I wanted and some I never heard before.  Very good price.  Nothing more to say.
0547884591|5.0|Tim has done it again:  created a dense yet accessible book to help the Everyman become an expert in the kitchen and beyond.  So good!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Although I truly enjoyed this book about one mans life, I am left feeling as if I do not know him. I feel far too much focus was placed on the \\"killing\\" with very little attention turned toward the man. I would liked to have gotten to know Mr. Kyle as more than a killer. I wouldn't mind an extension to, or another book entirely, focusing on The Man behind the trigger.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|All be it a factual book, it reads like a action thriller. Good to have the story forst hand. Well enjoyed.
0061733199|5.0|I got this book in great condition and so much info of what to eat in the wilderness and what to stay away from. and how to make weapons if you dont have any on yourself. so if your going camping or stuck in the woods or anything this book is what youd wish to have in your pack.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I came of age with Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums.  Now, 15 years later, I feel like Wes has almost become a parody of himself.  There's just not much evolution in his work.  Everything is so precious, the kids are precocious, and a whole cast of extremely talented adult actors are underutilized.  If you are expecting Rushmore caliber Bill Murray, look elsewhere.  More broadly, I think my issue was a lack of a engaging story.  Off to catch the bus...in slow motion...set to a 60's era punk song.
0061906220|5.0|Excellent hardbound book for my 3 year old grandson.  It provides good illustrations of colors for educational learning and has big pictures for little ones to understand.  The book arrived ahead of schedule and was exactly as described.  Will definitely do more business with this seller.
B009G78EE2|5.0|...my neighbor recommended this one day and I haven't not been dissapointed.  Great production, solid lyircs and some social consciousness to boot.  Buy it.

B0015HOFZI|4.0|I bought this unit to convert old LP's to digital formats. I have found the unit to be easy to use and the sound quality has been completely satisfactory to my ears. It was easy to set up and I particularly liked the fact that it has both USB and RCA jack interfaces. I have not used the Sony conversion software, because I was pleased with what I was using already and the Sony stuff seemed to complicated by comparison.

B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this puzzle app,  but there are problems with it. I have collected many of the picture packages that they offer on the site that goes with the app. I somehow lost all of the packages that I had collected. Amizon refunded the money to me and I would love to rebuy them but they are no longer on the site. The only ones that are left are ugly and would not want them even for free. I did give the app a 5 and that's just because the app itself runs good and I do love doing the puzzles.
0811870413|5.0|A great bread cook book! As a long time home bread baker, I like most bread books, this one however is very well written.
B005LAII0I|5.0|We had rented this from Red Box just to see if we would like it.  My family liked it so much that we ordered it online right away.  This is a great family movie that even my husband enjoyed.  The DVD was packaged very well and came quickly.  Everything was as promised from the seller.
B008M87GJK|4.0|The BBC has world coverage capability. If keeping informed of world events is important to you, then this app is a must own.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Saw this in the theater when it was broadcast from London in October 2011, had to get the disc when it came out.  The Blu-Ray is crystal clear...every bit as good as it was in the theater.  The little &#34;behind-the-scenes&#34; clip was cool as well.  A must for any Phantom fan!
0618001905|5.0|Horrific story of the subjugation of Africa by Europeans, the Belgian Congo in particular.  My thoughts on finishing had more to do with concepts of power and corruption.  In this case, the power of technology - weapons - inevitably corrupting those who could wield them against those who could not retaliate in kind.  Essential reading for those following the current Congo conflict.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Love the Birds being dressed up as Star Wars characters.  My favorite may be the piggy Darth Vadar that mocks you if you lose a level.  And as I got the app when it was offered for $0.00, I can't complain about anything!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I fell in love with this series from the beginning. I believe this series is a must read for all ages.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Got hooked on Downton Abbey in Season 1, was glad to get Season 2 both as a DVD and Amazon Streaming Video.  Will probably do the same thing for Season 3.  Good show, intriguing plot lines, and lots of great, dry British humor.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great read.  Very funny and entertaining.  John has done a great job with this book.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys a little sci-fi.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I mean, I wasn't expecting great literature, it was put out in association with a TV station. But it is, nonetheless, a great weekend read.  I read it in about two days and was entertained.  ABC had a great idea for cross-over merchandising.  It really does read like a good episode of Castle. I especially liked how it was all done in character with some reality thrown in.  All of the main actors are thanked by first name in the Acknowledgments as though they helped the 'author'.  I thought that was clever. If you're looking for something light that's a good page turner without being overly challenging, I say read this.  I think you'll be entertained.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Already have this in DVD but wanted the blu-ray version for our plasma TV. The movies look amazing (each with their own disc) and there's a fourth disc full of 'extras'.
B008EQIA7W|2.0|I thought paying extra for HD would be worth it, but it was not. The show was so pixelated it was awful to watch. Netflix shows better, without HD or the extra cost.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|Own it both on DVD and now on blu-ray. The details are amazing when we watch on our plasma TV!
B000YMM3CC|4.0|My Girlfriend and I watched in Hotel and she loves it. I thought it was a really good movie.  Great story and ending!
B000MNP2K8|1.0|They simply wrecked the Bond personality when they chose Craig to play the part. Craig tries to play the tough guy and it is just pathetic. Bond should have the personality of the previous actors that have played him such as class and that hint of humour. This movie has no gadgets in it at all and the storyline is pretty much always in the casino. It got so boring that I actually fell asleep when watching it.
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints with an exciting, on the edge of your seat read. I couldn't put the book down and zipped through it waiting for the conclusion. Loved every moment of it.
0547884591|5.0|It is a cool book with a lot of different interesting things in it. The most valuable thing I took out of this book was how to brake down any skill to the basics to learn it well and fast.  I would recommend it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Truly, everyone should read this book.  It is a heartwarming story of a young boy, with a facial deformity at birth.  It follows his young life through the trials and tribulations of going to school for the first time and learning that he can feel &#34;normal&#34;.  At times it is difficult to read because it is so well written that you just want to cry for the boy, but read on - it will restore your faith in human-kind.  It will help you the next time you see a person who isn't as &#34;normal&#34; as you are.<br />I have recommended this book to every teacher in my school and I have also recommended it to my students.  I teach fourth grade.  Wonder is probably better for 5th and 6th graders, but some 4th graders can handle it.  It could also be a read-aloud to fourth graders, but I wouldn't go lower than that.<br />I continue to recommend this book and will for a long time, I'm sure.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|If you are looking for a good quality read, this isn't it. This book is better than the first with a little more intrigue outside of the sex.  The endless email chains make up the majority of the pages. I found myself skipping many pages. I am debating finishing the trilogy. There was enough of a cliff hanger to draw my curiosity. Hey, but the sex was good. Almost needed a smoke after reading through some of the chapters.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Makes you have to think at times. Not too easy, just challenging enough to make you want to play again.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey strikes again and mark one up for the Good Guys!  The Panther is a quick, fun read that really did make me laugh out loud.  Despite the fast-paced story line, DeMille manages to build in some real historic and cultural perspective.  I say &#34;Sit back and enjoy the read; you may just learn something in the process.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Well I gotta say, this one was a doozy. The main plot didn't hold my interest very well but that's just my opinion. Still a very good show though and I'm looking forward to owning the next season as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Couldn't put this down once I got started. After finishing the easiest one, I jumped right to the hardest ones. They're pretty challenging! Great fun!
B005CAATXG|5.0|I had the privilage of working security for one of their concerts at our church and these guys are amazing!!! They are very devoted and active with their fans and they put on a great show. Settle for the cd and go see them in person when they come to your town!

1442344288|5.0|Stephen King's hero, Jake Epping, aka George Amberson, takes a trip \\"down the rabbit hole\\" to 1958 as a favor to his dying friend Al Templeton to change history by preventing the assassination of President John F Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald. He starts in 1958 because that is where the \\"rabbit hole\\" in the pantry of Al's diner takes him. Each time he returns to the present, he believes, is a \\"total reset\\" to the last outcome he created. Each time he goes, no matter how long he is gone, only two minutes have passed when he returns. These little details and King's wonderfully descriptive turns of a phrase bond the reader/listener to the story as Jake stays in the past in a count down to 11/22/63, the day Kennedy was shot. As he waits he meets the woman who will become the love of his life. Will she come back with him into the future? Will he succeed in stopping the assassination and create other changes he believes will improve the lives of others? Or is the quest he promised Al he would make more than he bargained for? Either way, you will be gripped by the journey!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book, tons of twists and turns.  The story was well thought out and exciting.  What a twisted mind to come up with this plot :)
0060730552|5.0|This is one of the most epic stories of survival EVER.  I saw the movie before reading the book and the movie was incredible.  The book, though, is better by far! Amazing story, great buy!

B00AA7O22U|3.0|I was expecting more from the huge starcast of the movie. I felt, Rocky was a better director for the expendables franchisee.
B005T87QCI|4.0|Downloaded this app for my son after we saw the movie.  He loved playing it for awhile, but eventually, like all of the games he downloads, it just takes up space now.
0439023491|3.0|What is the best way to get past your fear (and your readers' fears) about making a sequel to Hunger Games that might live up to the first novel? I guess the answer is to just write the same book over again...<br /><br />And for good measure, jack up the volume on the female protagonist's sighing over her two loves. The author knows how to write a page turner, but the first book was full of original ideas and this one just piggybacks.<br /><br />Here's the thing, I enjoyed reading this book... but that's because I also enjoyed the first one. There just isn't enough change to make this a great series with growth and dynamic. Collins wrote a safe book that was written in a template she knew would work...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just what I needed to get access to my books on my tablet and phone.  Now I can read while waiting in line to pas the time.

B003KJF2WE|3.0|Love anything with Ed Norton.  I liked most of the movie but felt it went over the top at the end.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series so much. Its so much better then any of the fifty shades. Both people have problems. And its a good story line. Even though at times its slow its still a great read.
0547884591|5.0|I pre-ordered this book 6 months ago. I have to say that the wait was worth it.<br /><br />In reading The 4-Hour Chef, I was reminded of why I like Tim's books so much. He is the well rounded type of individual that doesn't simply give one narrow aspect of a topic that he writes on. He provides a veritable smorgasbord of information that will sate even the most gluttonous of appetites for information and knowledge on the subject. The broken down method to make learning any skill or subject a breeze was worth the cost of the book, to me, ten or even a hundred times over. (I know that I have spent literally thousands of dollars on learning how to learn...so this was solid gold) He then goes into the basics of flavors and herbs and spices. Then cooking skills and simple yet intense recipes. I loved it when he took the entire project outdoors and showed the \\"tree rat\\" and the deer. After that adventure and the pictures and how-to information, I loved it even more!<br /><br />I heartily encourage EVERYONE that has ever wanted to learn to cook or to cook better to grab a copy! I will be buying more copies for my friends for Christmas, something I normally don't do, yet this is THAT GOOD!!! (And Tim's idea for getting friends together to \\"taste\\" herbs and spices gave me a great idea for a group date with some ladies!!!)<br /><br />Thanks again Tim for the book and for Amazon for allowing me to pre-order so easily!<br /><br />Cheers and bon app&eacute;tit,<br /><br />Matt
B000ZM1MGE|4.0|This movie is great.  The acting is good, the plot is intense, and the directing is well-done.  In fact, I would have given it a five- star rating, had I not read the book.<br /><br />I did this backwards.  I first read Midnight Returns (reviewed on 11-14-12, which is the follow-up book to Midnight Express, which is the story of a man who escapes from the brutality of a Turkish prison.  Having been sufficiently impressed, I bought the original book, and once again I was so moved I purchased the movie.<br /><br />Unlike the book, the movie is unclear in a lot of places, but most of that is irrelevant, since the basic idea is there-- there is no such thing as human rights and justice in that foreign prison, and every man is at the mercy of the whims of his jailer.  So in that regard, it was engrossing, and  it was nominated for six Academy Awards in 1978, and won for Best Adapted Screenplay.  And that's baffling to me, because it's that very thing that disappointed me.<br /><br />I understand that movies based on true stories often change some details to make for a smoother presentation, but this one went too far.  My basic gripe was with the ending.  Spoiler Alert:  I'm going to compare the two endings, so further reading of this will ruin any suspense as to the final outcome.  On the other hand,  most readers probably already know that in the end, Billy triumphs and escapes.  That's what made this movie such an inspirational hit several decades ago.  But it's the details of that escape that diverged so far from the truth , it ruined the very heart of the story.<br /><br />In the movie, there is an accident of Fate, and Billy takes advantage of the situation and waltzes out of the prison in broad daylight.  What a lucky break!  The truth is completely different.  Billy carefully plots, studying various avenues of escape, inspecting places to hide, observing the prison routine, and working his body to build up stamina for the Big Day.  After several years, he then makes his move, hiding in a large container, then swimming quietly to a small dinghy, rowing that boat in terrifying seas, nearly succumbing to total exhaustion.  He finally makes landfall, then moves surreptitiously toward the Greek border, all the while looking frantically over his shoulder, knowing there is an APB on him.  The first part of the book is frightening in that it shows the futility of his situation, but the last few chapters are an edge-of-your-seat thriller  because, in contrast, it offers  that  wonderful thing called Hope.  You know the odds of success are not good, and you know the consequences are horrific if he fails.  Billy does a great job of conveying this terror in his narrative, and I found myself drawn in, hardly daring to breathe, lest his enemies hear me.  What a shame to eliminate this rich and gripping ordeal from the movie.<br /><br />This change from fact to fantasy  not only robs us, the viewer, but it cheats Billy as well.  His escape was not a stroke of luck;  it was a testament to the courage, patience, endurance and single-minded focus of this heroic man.  In the end, it was  guts and perseverance that set Billy free.<br /><br />Having said all that, I would still recommend the movie.  It's a good story -but the book is better.
0439023483|5.0|So much in this book was left out of the movie!  Must read if you  saw the movie and then read the other two books. It explained a lot!
B000T433CO|5.0|This is a great movie I watch all year. I love it so much I bought two, just incase I can't find it later.
0060734191|5.0|This series, hands-down, has got to be one of my favorites. Garth Nix not only creates well-rounded and intricate characters, but also manages to Paint this fictional world in such vibrant colors that when you turn the last page, coming back to reality is a startling jolt.  It's definitely well written, and the effort put into this series is blatantly obvious by the depth and little details. I don't want to give any spoilers away, but if you love fantasy that walks along a slightly darker path than most, and love being lost in another world with its own creatures and own set of rules, the old kingdom series is what you're after!!!<br /><br />PS.  I'm quite fond of mogget, and would love to maybe see his own story someday. He seems like a complicated character, and let's face it, he's highly amusing.
B009YU62H2|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because there COULD have been more hardcore parts to keep it moving a little more. Over all it is kind of on the slow side of things but nonetheless has that classic 90's abstract but meaningful sound. I like Bones of Birds and a few others very well. After 15 years of no Soundgarden, my hat goes off to you for the good album guys.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is an awesome show, and Amazon made it easy and quick for me to buy and watch through Amazon Prime streaming.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Kids downloaded to their phone and kindle they enjoy playing it.  They love games where riding and driving are involved.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|These guys are amazing! I've loved them since I saw them on tv, but I really like their original songs on this album.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I love Arthur Christmas. It is everything a Christmas show should be-family friendly, great storyline & graphics, reminds us how important family is, as well as the importance of each and every person. I always get a little teary-eyed at the end.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Im a bid Nora Roberts fan.  This is one of my favorites,  I have read this book a couple of times already.. Loved the theme and the story is very well written.  Well worth the read...
034580404X|5.0|One of my favorite books.  I have read this book 3 times already. Every time i do I fall in love with it all over again.  I can't wait for the movie to come out, but I am afraid it won't do justice to the books.  Every woman should read these books.  I am definately an EL James fan and can't wait for her to write another one.  Although im not into the sub/dom crowd, it was well written and a must for every book collection....  Laters Baby....
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have played it nonstop since I started. It's very addicting, fun, quirky, and cute. A personal goal of mine is to high five all of it's game developers! Thank you!
B007SGM084|5.0|I would totally recommend this trilogy.  Now I know why so many women are talking about it.  If you love romance and erotic readings, this is for you.  I've read the trilogy in less than a week and now I can't wait until they do the movie, which I think needs to be rated x if it is going to mirror the book.  I especially love the ending where E L James gave the readers an insight of Christian Grey's character via narration of his childhood and when he met Ana.  There were some comical parts to the story too which I think no one really mentions since its mostly sex throughout the 3 books.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It was nice reading and using I hope it will be beneficial for every one so u can use it all
B008J34466|5.0|I love this album.  I turn it way up while driving down the road.  So out of the norm for me.  I will get another Pink album soon.
B009FZFONO|5.0|My daughter and I looked every where to find season 3 episode 1 of The Walking Dead...because we missed it on TV..but could not find it anywhere. Thank You amazon for making it as easy as one click and we were watching!

B0087ITC56|3.0|Many films suffer from under-exposure. People don't hear about or have the opportunity to see a great film filled with great performances because the film is produced and released by a small company and it never reaches movie theaters in the suburbs. When it reaches DVD and Streaming, people have another opportunity, but a theatrical release is the main driving force behind a DVD release, so it may be ignored here as well.<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis' new film \\"Flight\\" suffers from just the opposite. From the moment people started to see it, at festivals and screenings, praise and hype has been heaped on the film and Denzel Washington's performance. All of this praise has amped up our expectations to a place it would be difficult to meet. And it didn't meet my expectations.<br /><br />Zemckis has spent the last few years making motion-capture computer animated films. He uses this technology to film actors wearing specially designed suits as they act out their roles. Then, his technicians add a layer of computer animation to place these characters in rich and impressive landscapes. This technology allows Zemeckis to put his characters in created landscapes it would be too costly and prohibitive to make otherwise.<br /><br />The experiment has yielded very good (\\"A Christmas Carol\\"), good (\\"Monster House\\"), strange (\\"The Polar Express\\") and abysmal results (\\"Beowulf\\"). But the experiment seems strangest of all because Zemeckis, a director made famous by his fantasy and action films, films memorable because of the humanity of the actors, became so enthralled with technology that ultimately takes away that layer of humanity.<br /><br />In \\"Flight\\", Zemeckis returns to a story very much grounded (har har!) in reality. This may be one of the reasons the film is receiving so much praise; people are happy to see humans in a Zemeckis' film again. No more soulless, blank-eyed zombies trying to entice children onto a train destined for a far away land.<br /><br />The other reason \\"Flight\\" is receiving so much praise is Washington's performance. It is pretty remarkable and unlike anything he has done before. Raw, vulnerable, emotional, very conflicted. On the outside, he appears to be every bit the archetype Washington hero. But as we watch the performance unfold, Washington brings so many new layers to the role, giving us a three-dimensional portrait of Whip Whitaker, a very troubled pilot working for a small airline.<br /><br />From the opening frames, you realize Washington is going for something different, very different from what we have seen before. The actor has stated in interviews that he avoids scenes of intimacy because he doesn't want to make his wife uncomfortable. Because of this, we rarely if ever see him kiss his on-screen love interest. In \\"Flight\\", all of these notions are thrown out the window.<br /><br />Whip Whitaker is an addict. He shows up hung over for his quick flight from Orlando to Atlanta. After checking the exterior, in torrential rain, he boards and gets every one ready for take-off. The flight immediately runs into very bad turbulence, but he and his co-pilot lead the plane out of the bad weather. About a half hour later, the plane experiences more trouble.<br /><br />As soon as Whip realizes the plane is in trouble, his senses and faculties kick into razor-sharp focus. All of the previous alcohol and drug-use seem to completely dissipate. He guides the plane to safety, saving most of the passengers and crew from a more fatal crash landing.<br /><br />All of this happens in the first act. And it is compelling and insanely watchable. Every so often, a film depicts an event so well, your mind remembers it every time the subject is broached. In \\"Flight\\", the turbulent landing of the jet is such an event. You won't find this film playing on any commercial flight. Nor should you watch it while flying on a plane. No good will come from such an act. \\"The Gray\\" was the last film I saw with such an intense, realistically depicted plane crash. \\"The Impossible\\", out in December, features a harrowing depiction of the tsunami that hit Thailand a few years ago.<br /><br />But once act 2 begins, \\"Flight\\" veers off course. It really starts to do this much earlier. As we watch Whip starting his day, the narrative suddenly, inexplicably shifts to follow Nicole (Kelly Reilly, Mary Watson in \\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\\") as she tries to score. Ultimately, Nicole's life intercepts with Whips, but these initial moments are jarring because they pull us out of and distract us from Whip's more interesting story. Worse, Nicole's story has been done and seen millions of times. And many of these have been much more convincing. Just about every time Nicole enters the story, the film loses focus.<br /><br />As Whip recovers in the hospital, people begin to show up. Everyone is ready to acknowledge he is a hero, but there is also an undercurrent of sentiment leading people to begin questioning his sobriety. Enter Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood), the Pilot's Union President, and Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle), the lawyer they hire to represent Whip. The entire second act is about Whip trying to fight his addiction; he retreats to his childhood home and camps out, trying to evade reporters. He tries valiantly to stay sober, but the urge proves too great.<br /><br />Ultimately the film mars Washington's performance by becoming too preachy. He seems to be doing well; he throws all the alcohol away, he attends AA, he meets various survivors and their families, all-eager to heap gratitude on Whip. But all of this only serves to drive Whip closer and closer to the bottle of the drugs as he falls back on his old, self-destructive habits.<br /><br />Washington's performance is very good and very realistic. He is clearly going to some dark places to reveal parts of Whip's character. But the story doesn't show us anything new or take Whip to anyplace we haven't seen before. Charlie and Hugh, both charged with helping Whip avoid any criminal charges, pop up every few minutes to explain the situation and warn Whip about the consequences of his behavior. Ultimately, they are warning us, preaching to us about the consequences. It makes the progression of Whip's problems seem a little too 'movie-of-the-week'. At one point, Whip attends an AA meeting, but leaves early because it isn't for him, he doesn't need it, and he can handle his addiction. Really? We have seen this so many times before, in television shows, television movies, feature films, etc. I understand that most addicts will probably go through this type of experience, but it doesn't mean we have to watch every addict on screen go through the same thing. Unless they experience something new related to it.<br /><br />John Goodman appears as Harling Mays, Whip's dealer. His performance is another scene-stealer and worthy of praise.<br /><br />Melissa Leo pops up in the final moments as a NTSB Investigator. Her role is too brief and one-note to add anything special.<br /><br />Written By John Gatins (\\"Real Steel\\", \\"Coach Carter\\"), the story was inspired by his own travels through addiction. But he doesn't really offer anything new because we've seen these highs and lows before. And his background writing Hollywood-style inspirational movies lead us to a similar extremely conventional, and predictable, Hollywood-like ending in \\"Flight\\" that just seems false.<br /><br />Zemeckis has assembled all of the elements of a fantastic, intense nail-biter. But he wimps out; he doesn't seem to have the conviction to show us a true depiction of a man's harrowing journey through addiction. He seems to shy away from painting a truly dark, uncompromising vision, something that would be truly memorable.ally depicted plane crash. \\"The Impossible\\", out in December, features a harrowing depiction of the tsunami that hit Thailand a few years ago.<br /><br />But once act 2 begins, \\"Flight\\" veers off course.

0142419400|5.0|This was one of the best books I read in 2011. So sweet, so funny, and just perfect. Definitely recommend this to fans of contemporary YA!
B009AMAM9S|4.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\", the new film from directors Lana and Andy Wachowski (the siblings behind \\"The Matrix\\" films) and Ton Tykwer (the German sensation \\"Run, Lola, Run\\"), is not the best or most mind-blowing film you will ever see. But it deserves kudos for sheer scope of storytelling.<br /><br />Six different storylines, most in different centuries, depict the intertwined stories of how people's actions affect others in the past, present and future. That is, more or less, the official synopsis of the film. I'm not sure it works as the filmmakers envision, but the directors, each responsible for specific segments, make it work.<br /><br />The actors also seem to enjoy playing multiple roles, dressing up in costumes and heavy make-up to pop up in each segment as a different character. Each segment has a different central character and the actors responsible for these roles pop up in the other stories in supporting roles, sometime as a simple blink-and-you-miss-it cameo.<br /><br />Tom Hanks anchors two stories, both with Halle Berry. In one of these, set in San Francisco in the early 70s, Berry plays a journalist trying to uncover the mystery behind a local nuclear power plant. Hanks plays the scientist who may have the secret she needs. Flash forward a few centuries and Hanks plays a goat herder in a post apocalyptic society. He reluctantly agrees to help Berry, a futuristic visitor, complete a quest that could help mankind. Of the two, I found the post-Apocalyptic segment to be less successful. More on that later. The San Francisco segment is more watchable because it is a more conventional action tale.<br /><br />Jim Broadbent plays a book publisher in modern-day London who inadvertently checks himself into an old-folks home. This segment is one of the best because it contains a lot of dry British humor.<br /><br />In Neo Seoul, Jim Sturgess plays a man infatuated with Sonmi, a futuristic waitress played by Doona Bae. He helps Sonmi break free and they try to elude the authorities and life a free life. Combining familiar elements from other sci-fi films, the story feels recycled. Interesting to watch, but recycled.<br /><br />In 1936, Ben Whishaw plays Robert Frobisher, a struggling composer who goes to work for an aging great (Broadbent again). While working with the older composer, Frobisher writes the Cloud Atlas Sextet. This is actually my favorite segment because the story seems the most well-rounded. It is also the most classical and romantic, giving us something that Merchant-Ivory might have done.<br /><br />In the 19th Century, Sturgess plays the lawyer for a slave trading company who is being poisoned by a doctor (Hanks again) trying to steal the young barrister's gold.<br /><br />These stories don't have a lot of direct connections, but a couple of characters overlap, giving them a more tenuous connection. So why these stories? How do they connect? The connections the filmmakers try to establish seem to be more tenuous and really shouldn't work. But they do. Just.<br /><br />Despite the mixed success of the characters, the actors playing multiple roles help to tie the stories together. They don't appear to be playing descendants of one another, or even characters who are connected. But watching Hanks, Berry, Hugh Grant, Sturgess, Broadbent and the others pop up in each story gives the illusion they are connected. Most of the time, it is easy to spot the actors, despite heavy make-up, but a couple of the briefest cameos slip by. And a couple of the characters elicit laughter; in modern day London, Hanks plays a Cockney gangster who has just published his memoir. When he first pops up and begins speaking, people in the audience laugh, a response that feels unanticipated and unwanted. But this moment happens early in the lengthy film, before you get used to the idea of the actors popping up in unlikely places. Or maybe you simply become resigned to the idea.<br /><br />Hugh Grant pops up in most of the stories, playing everything from a slave trading reverend to a post-apocalyptic cannibal. His largest contribution is to the 1970s San Francisco segment. He plays a shifty administrator at the power plant, a part that seems the most his stereotypical on-screen persona.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving appears in every segment as a villain, adding an air of menace and even humor as only he can.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon and Keith David also play various roles throughout, adding a rich texture to the stories.<br /><br />For a \\"sci-fi\\" film directed by the people behind \\"The Matrix\\", there is very little use of special effects to evoke a sci-fi universe. There are two sequences set in the future, but the post-apocalyptic sequence could just as easily be a western. That leaves the Neo Seoul sequence, which is fun to watch, but doesn't really push the boundaries at all - we've seen everything they show in this segment before.<br /><br />Two of the segments, the 1936 segment featuring Ben Whishaw and the 19th century tale featuring Jim Sturgess, both feature voice over from the main characters, narrating the story. I understand why this choice was made, but it seems odd and jarring to have only these two segments feature this device. When the narrative begins whipping back and forth between the various timelines, it draws you out of the story to suddenly feel confronted by voice over.<br /><br />The post-Apocalyptic sequence is the most difficult to get into because the characters speak in a patois that takes some getting used to. It also provides the prologue and the epilogue for the film, making for a problematic beginning. But once the film gets going and the narrative begins whipping back and forth between the stories, you get carried along by the storytelling, eager to see each new twist and turn.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a strange, sprawling film trying to depict something grand and meaningful.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I thought this movie was a riot despite all the plot holes. It was fun to watch. I would recommend this movie for the home 3D viewer. It was a good choice for exercising a newly purchased 3D, big screen setup. As usual, Amazon fulfilled my order in a timely fashion.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|This was unexpectedly good.  It had a great combo of raw violence, a bit of humor, and a really good plot.
B004UID2LC|5.0|My son loves to watch videos on the computer, and now with this, we can download and watch on the Kindle as well, and save his favorites so that he can watch them when we're not hooked up to the WiFi!
B003V1WTMM|2.0|This book bothered me. Not sure why, but I found it disturbing about halfway through, so I quit. I guess the themes are all pretty sad overall.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is like temple run when you have to collect the coins also I like when you bop the inspector
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The game is challenging, frustrating, and rewarding all at once. The environment is very nice to look at and i find te background music to be very soothing. Very good job.
B004TTHLBE|3.0|While the writing style is engaging, and the story line is interesting enough, I kept wondering who all of the gods were.  There were different names for gods (the character with the nickname &#34;low key&#34; is really the god Loki, for example), and I had the feeling that I was supposed to know who these gods are.  The personalities, the skills, the frame of reference for the gods - these all played into the plot, but I don't know who the gods are.  I would have appreciated a reference section that listed the gods and gave some background on them, or footnotes when a new god was introduced.<br /><br />Lacking that, the gods angle of the story was confusing for me.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This book was mesmerizing and hypnotic.  I felt drawn to the story and intrigued by why the main character, Shadow, seemed unfazed by events happening around him.  After figuring out his parentage, I understand.  I have read reviews that state that americans are pigeon holed by the descriptions in this book, but when I read it, I guess I was more interested in the story and driving motivations of its characters.  Mr. Wednesday is quite intriguing and seems to match many descriptions of who he really is.  As a follower of the northern traditions I can definitely state that some familiarity with the Norse/Germanic pantheon is helpful background when reading this book. Overall, I quite enjoyed it, and like \\"neverwhere\\" I was unable to put it down.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Such a great show, sweet and funny .....All the actors do such a great job.  It is one of my favorites of all time
B0055SWM08|5.0|This has been the best game the I have purchased so far. The music is calming and I don't get frustrated trying to solve the puzzles because of the music.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice. desk caclulator. does what I need it to do.<br />(which really isn't much besides add subtract divide and multiply)
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like the options of types of deals.  You can chose &quot;winnable&quot; deal, which is great when I don't feel like straining my brain!  Great game for free!
B004G25V9S|2.0|Although it was written that this is a new product The CD was not sealed by plastic cover!! I dont know if this is common&#62;
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it ! Fun for all ages and great if you like puzzles and or other logic games asome and addictive game
B006TGWY3K|4.0|This is a very respectable offering from Lacuna Coil. The male/female vocal combinations and complementing melodies are definitely the strongest point of the band, along with crunching guitars and an appropriate rhythm section. Cristina's vocals on &#34;Intoxicated&#34; are amazing, and they performed a very interesting cover of &#34;Losing my Religion&#34;.
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver breaks down the very complicated business of making accurate predictions in terms everyone can understand using examples as varied as baseball, financial ratings, poker, and earthquakes. Highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the rational and meaning behind the numbers that are reported on TV every day.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It adds some protection to the Kindle and it looks pretty cool too. It seems like it will last a pretty long time. I think it is a good value for $30.
B008MM9630|5.0|farms and fairies. oh my. cute game and it keeps me entertained while in the hospital.  I would recommend it.
1476719071|3.0|I love the story. It's one of my favorites this year. I was, however, extremely disappointed with this special, signed hardcover book. The \\"signed\\" part is simply a scribbled initials on a blank page. The very next page is the \\"to my beloved readers\\" page - would it have been so hard to at least scribble your initials on that? Very disappointed.

B00181JGI2|5.0|If you haven't seen this film do yourself a favor. It will take a little pre movie night prep. You will need, ice, milk, vodka, and some sort of coffee liqueur. Make yourself a white russian, turn on the flick, and get ready to enjoy the ride.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show ! it's so intense I'm normally not into zombie movies but this show is really good.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|After seeing Homeland literally sweep away the competition at the 2012 Emmy awards, my interest was peaked and I had to see what this show was all about. Suffice to say, I watched the first season in two days (would have been less if I didn't have to work!) and am so very addicted to this series.<br /><br />Enough can not be said about the two leads of the show, Claire Danes and Damian Lewis. The former plays a neurotic and off-the-rails intelligence analyst for the CIA, while Lewis, the focal point of the series, plays a U.S. Marine who returns home after being a POW for eight years. Both actors play their part with ferocious intensity and are more than deserving of the Emmy awards they took home. The show also boasts a very strong supporting cast, including Mandy Patinkin as Danes' boss and Morena Baccarin as Lewis' wife.<br /><br />In addition to great actors giving powerful performances, Homeland will keep you guessing all the way up until the season finale. It's very tense and there were multiple times I found myself on the edge of my couch. The show is so great because it works beyond being a tense thriller, and is a great narrative of how difficult it is for soldiers to return home. There is a great family dynamic that unfolds through the first season, and I hope to see it develop more in future episodes.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I can't say enough good things about Homeland. It's truly one of the best shows on television.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I have never been a HUGE Deftones fan - more of a casual fan who has all their albums, but wouldn't classify them as one of my favorite bands.  This record changed me to a HUGE fan - it's that good.  This record has been playing on my phone repeatedly for almost 3 weeks now - it's been a long time since I could say that about an album.  Also, if you like the softer side of Chino, make sure to check out his side project \\"Crosses\\".

B007URVZJ6|5.0|When it comes to self publishing the only thing that stands as a constant obstacle anymore is not knowing exactly how to format your product.  For those interested in publishing for the Kindle, this book takes that obstacle out of the way.  It explains everything you need to know in plain english.  If you can use Microsoft word, you can get published.  Follow the simple instructions contained in this book and you will soon be among the ranks of all the great writers out there.

I was excited to see the mobile app version of their software.<br /><br />Overall, I'm extremely happy with the many features; in particular the security. Being able to track, sound an alarm, wipe the phone, and tampering with the SIM card are features that attracted me.<br /><br />Installation was a bit lengthy, but understandably necessary for all the functionality.<br /><br />Great product. I highly recommend for anyone worried about recovering their phone if it gets lost/stolen.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|Why dislike?  There was too much mindless fill to go with what clearly would have been a good plot.<br /><br />Recommend?  Not to anyone who has read several of the original Grisham works.<br /><br />Specific?  For two thirds of the book, the author moved into development of a ruse that would be used to even the score with a previous wrong against the main character.  There was simply way too much time and meaningless verbiage given to this.

B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is an amazing , nail biter, my husband and I love he characters, we ave watched the first three and someone times have to restrain ourselves from watching more then one a night. We very highly recommend this series, for adults due to violence  and sexually explicit scene. You will find your selfs getting into the life's of each character.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|To say this book is horrific is an understatement. I have learned so much about the human spirit and the strength we can find within ourselves despite traumatic times. To read what Jaycee went through is traumatizing, but I have never read a more well-written and truly inspiring memoir. I will be honest and say I do not recommend this to everyone. It should be read by those who are prepared to have a new outlook on life in a negative and positive way.
B001BZE82E|3.0|It is a nice product I bought it as a gift and it is nice on hand<br />BUT<br />*Front glasses is scratched which make a not good point for the store.<br />*It is too small on the hand , with plastic back front for the watch which gives a cheap point to the product.<br /><br />Like for the price and the shape and the other parts of it,
0345803485|1.0|Even if I have bought the trilogy I couldn't make it to the third book. I still don't believe why is this a best seller. Poorly written, repetitive and unbelievable boring. Any time I tried to pick up the third book (just because I already own this book) something in me refuses to do it. It's not because of the so call \\"porno\\" because I have enjoyed other books like the \\"Story of O\\", and books by Henry Miller and Anais Nin on this subject but this lady don't know how to write.

B007JMW46U|4.0|I liked the different mysteries within this book, and I was amused as some of the original illustrations.  It was fun to see the original concepts of what Sherlock Holmes might have looked like.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|the movie is a hit.my son loves it. showed up on time.with no complaines.will buy again from this company. this is a great kid movie
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Although I had head about this story all of my life, and had seen the movie decades ago, I had forgotten most of it.  WHat I liked is that in reading the book, it was all new.  It was great.  It had the right amount of character development and didn't bog the story down.  And speculation continued throughout most of the book, as to whom the host(s) was, and who the murder might be.  I was not disappointed at the end.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Jack Reacher novels are great.  Entertaining but require you to accept some pretty unbelievable plot twists.  Believing that Jack can find someone who is trying to hide out by merely deducing what city/state and hotel they would be staying in under with an assumed name is pretty fantastic.<br /><br />I found the psychotic villains in this novel to be a little under done.  It would have been more interesting to have more interaction with them before they were dispatched.  Also, it is odd that Jack does not even suspect there is an issue when the bad guys are showing up at locations before he does.  Hello..... if they are showing up they have inside information!  Everyone who is reading the book knows this!<br /><br />Still lots of fun.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|This is one of those more famous Agatha Christie stories.  And after reading it, I understand why.  The book had perfect flow with the right amount of character development.  I never felt bogged down during the reading of this story.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the writing! Sometimes writers feel the need to be creative and when they do I find myself just skipping over entire sentences just because they don't make any sense. Well, that's not the case with this book! It extremely well written and very smart...the story is very interesting and a little crazy, so if you like a little crazy this is good, it's not just mystery and murder, but also on the verge of psychopath. Many people didn't like the ending, but I didn't mind it. I thought it was an interesting end to an interesting story. And a lot of people can definitely relate to the relationship between Nick and Amy. The way their marriage is described throughout the book is a very realistic portrayal of marriage which many people (even those in serious relationships) can identify with.

B006O6F932|4.0|Dolls are not included and thus the Monster High School play set is not ready to be played with right out of the box, unless some are acquired separately.  Once they are available, the doll house has many features to play with: a classroom w/ desks, blackboard, and a cart w/ accessories; lockers w/ locks; a court with a ball & hoop; cafeteria & DJ booth; and 3-side access to and opportunities to engage in the school that can accommodate additional characters and toys already in the possession.  They create an enormous number of possible scenarios of arrangements and activities that may keep imaginative children occupied almost forever.  The toy is made of durable plastic easy to clean and to keep sanitized. Though intended for ages 6 and up, it is simple and durable enough that even younger children should be able to play with older ones as well.  However, many small accessories may be easily swallowed.  The relatively wide bases provide good stability.  The toy is well designed, and seems classic and quite unique.
0316069884|4.0|Eating Animals is an important and compelling book, written and organized in an tremendously skillful way.  I can even honestly say that I enjoyed it.  Despite the fact that I cried half a dozen times and once actually threw up.  (No pork for me, thanks.)  I am grateful for what I learned.  It was worth it.<br /><br />Safran Foer's approach to the subject seems to me the ideal one.  Eating Animals is not a diatribe, a rant or a polemic.  His approach is mild-mannered and matter-of-fact.  Many viewpoints are shared, including that of the factory farmer, in a way that is respectful and does justice to each.  Safran Foer, at the start of the book, is an omnivore expecting his first child, contemplating what is right to eat and feed his child, wondering why we eat some animals and pamper others.  By the end of the book, he's come to some conclusions, but there's plenty of space and information available for the reader to make different conclusions and choices.<br /><br />When it comes to factory farming, a polemic is wholly unnecessary.  You needn't have a jot of sympathy with animal rights activists like PETA - though he does a particularly good job of explaining why their gross-out tactics can be effective.  The relentless brutality and unmitigated suffering of factory farming is enough to shock and repulse  anyone - which is why it is virtually impossible, nowadays, to see where our meat comes from without breaking and entering.<br /><br />Even if morality, decency and humanity aren't interests of yours, Safran Foer makes it unnervingly clear how dangerous our food supply is, consisting as it does of drugged bioengineered animals living hellishly in their own excrement.  Turns out that you can hate animals and still oppose factory farming - all you need to know is the history of influenza.<br /><br />We are part of a system which creates a vast, vicious, and unnecessary mass of brutality and harm.  Most of us, in the back of our minds, already know that.  For reasons of ecology, morality and epidemiology, it's time we faced the effects of our own choices and actions.of ecology, morality and epidemiology, it's time we faced the effects of our own choices and actions.
0316010669|4.0|With this book, Gladwell is out to do three things:  (1) demonstrate that decisions made quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately, (2) show when we should trust our instincts and when we should be wary of them, and  (3) tell us how our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.  To carry out these tasks, he uses examples that grab your attention.  He tells about a psychologist who worked out a method of accurately predicting whether a marriage will last by watching a couple converse for fifteen minutes.  It is done through the recognition of patterns.  Another example is how an employer could tell whether to hire a potential employee by examining his/her bedroom.  He tells how a doctor need not fear malpractice suits if he/she does two things:  spends more time with patients and treats them with respect.  He looks at speed dating and notes that people tend to make better decisions about potential dates when they don't analyze why they like or don't like someone and just go with their instincts.  He tells about how more women and people of color have been hired for professional orchestras when the auditioners are behind a screen.  Gladwell's book is fascinating reading and will cause you to rethink the way you understand the decisions you make
B0091REZMW|3.0|its a decent game, kind of slow but decent pass time game would of liked to see more graphics and the objects are kind of predictable after searching the same room more than a few times.
0452289963|5.0|Building on his previous books, The Power of Now, and Stillness Speaks, Tolle expands our thinking to the transformation of the world.  He begins with a discussion of consciousness, then does a brilliant explanation of ego, going on to explain how to break free of the ego and find yourself rooted in Being rather than lost in your mind.  Then he discusses the inner purpose (which we all share), which is to awaken, and outer purpose (which can change over time and varies from person to person),  which always needs to align with our inner purpose.<br /><br />I found Tolle's detailed descriptions of the mind's shenanigans very useful in learning to be onto oneself.  An example is complaining, which he sees as \\"one of the ego's favorite strategies for  strengthening itself.\\"  By \\"complaining\\" he doesn't mean informing someone of something which needs to be put right.  For instance, it is appropriate to say to the waiter,  \\"This soup is cold and needs to be heated.\\"  Complaint is in the direction of \\"this should not be happening,\\" or \\"I don't want to be here,\\" or \\"I'm being treated unfairly.\\"  He tells a number of ways we complain without realizing we are complaining, often not out loud but only in thought.  In reading the book I became more aware that my habit of focusing on what is \\"wrong\\" is a form of complaint about life. Becoming aware of this habitual \\"complaining\\" is allowing me to be less identified with it.  Such awareness prevents our being disempowered and living from the stance of a victim of life, and creates a shift from being lost in the mind to the presence of Being.  Reading Tolle brings about such major shifts.

0061474347|5.0|Lirael, Daugher of the Clayr follows Sabriel by Garth Nix again into the world beyond the Wall. The book, while considerably longer than its precursor, reads just as quickly and follows the same easy yet suspenseful narrative style. Lirael introduces a new yet familiar cast of characters, highlighting two previously unexplored lines of Charter Blood--Clayr and Wallmaker. The storytelling toggles back and forth between Lirael, a young and very believably but endearingly flawed Clayr and the Prince Sameth, the crafty but sometimes ornery youngest child of King Touchstone and the Abhorsen Sabriel.<br /><br />The book is only the first part of a full story, completed in Abhorsen, but it has all the elements of a fantastic adventure. This includes, of course, unwilling turned unlikely heros, plenty of physical conflict, travel, adventure, and the necessary sassy presence of the Free Magic Cat Mogget and Lirael's friend, the Disreputable Dog.<br /><br />Lirael stands as one of the most impressive sequels I have ever read--Nix has perfectly balanced the old familiar elements of Sabriel's world with the ever-expanding potential for interest and adventure through a new cast of characters. The whole series is a must read!<br /><br />\\"It's always better to be doing.\\"<br />― Garth Nix, Lirael
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I have always loved Daft Punk and was introduced to this movie by a friend.  It is basically a musical with animated characters acting out a story while the different Daft Punk originals play.  It's entertaining and highly recommended for any fans of Daft Punk.  I'm not a fan of animation usually, but I made an exception in this case.

B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie is action packed with a good story.  To sum it up in one sentence: It has a political story line based in the future where peoples feelings are regulated by the government/police force.  I don't want to give away anything, but I recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining action flick.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Learned a great deal about the history of WW I and the Russian Revolution. Follett weaves the  various characters and plot together in a seamless and non- contrived manner. I grew to care about the inhabitants of the story and can't wait to read the sequel!

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Gave it 4 stars because I have had several days of fun for free, but the further you get in game the more glitchy it gets. Graphics are great, you build a town right from start includes everything you could think of farming, hunting, building houses, business, roads. You even make clothes at tailors, make own medicine in another shop, Has blacksmith also for tools. You really have alot of things to do starting town from shantys, then progressing to bigger houses. Business are same start with basic boom town products and increase to more modern town.<br />Now to bad right now can still play but cant reach goals try to buy certain things for a goal and game stops. Unable to even see 1 goal. game stops if I do. BUT again I have built nice town and hours of fun for free.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|I first saw this film when it premiered in 1956 and it's as good today as it was back then. Okay, now you know I'm a senior, but I still know what's good compared with most of the 'junk' made since then.  I met Warren Stevens a few years ago and we had a nice chat about the film.  He laughed when I told him I had only paid 20 cents to get in.  Boy have prices changed.  Anyway, this newly enhanced version is well worth the money. I doubt there are many who have never seen it, but if you are one of them then you are in for a treat. Having a member of Disney's special effects department work on the 'invisible' creature makes it even more impressive.<br />ENJOY!!!
1118156307|2.0|IMHO the main idea of the book is: Service Design is a new creative interdisciplinary approach so systematization and structured knowledge transfer are not needed. Even clear definitions are not required. Thoughts are not specific and fragmented.<br />So this is not a manual. Book just gives vague feeling but not specific knowledge. It's like a friends party. Several groups are chattering about their achievements.<br /><br />Very nice and helpful design of the book.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I've read all the Reacher books and have enjoyed all but the last two.  This one takes the cake, though, for being the most boring book.  I skipped over so many repetitve passages and honestly could not wait for the book to end.  I will be very wary of any future Reacher novels.  In addition I think the casting of Tom Cruise as Reacher is quite simply a joke.  If more Reacher movies are made, serious consideration should be given to re~casting the title character.

1423140605|4.0|1) Rating: 4 out of 5 stars    2) Genre: YA Fantasy    3) Synopsis: Camp Jupiter vs Camp Half-Blood. Romans vs Greeks. While they are fighting among themselves Gaea is about to wake up and rule the world. It is up to the prophecy of seven to stop this from happening.    4) Feelings: This is told from the point of view of four different people. It is a little herky-jerky from that way but it is typical for the Heroes of Olympus series. My biggest problem with it is that this book ends on a cliffhanger. Never been a fan of ending a book without resolving the big bad. Now I will have to wait until fall of 2013    5) Final recommendation: I liked this book. Even stopping in the middle for NaNoWrimo. These are certainly fun books. Worth the read but I might wait until closer to fall of 2013 before I do.    Ryan James Burt  Husband, Father, and Writer  [...]
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Our son was very excited when he saw this & quickly payed some of his allowance for it. He said he didn't waste his money!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Hate the topic, but love the style. Novel, grim, and magnetic. I recommend it if you don't mind zombies nibbling at the edges of your dreams.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|At first I worried that Proof of Heaven would be just another near death experience. I am a recovering Catholic and am somewhat jaded about all of it, but after age sixty, I began to see a different idea of Heaven and it is very similar to Eben Alexander's.<br />After reading his book I could imagine Heaven as a very reassuring existence.  No judgements, no worries. Just peace and serenity, the kind that seems to come into our lives as we age, when all the responsibilities of youth have gone by.<br />I feel that peace now and have often hoped that it was a sign of a future life to come. Eben Alexander confirms that hope for me.
B001706I5I|5.0|I was very satisfied with my order. My son loves this movie, 'it may drive me crazy'  watching it 20 times a day but was very satisfied with my order.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire it is great concentration training.  Beating my own scores is my goal.  Good game.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|what can I say nice to have the use of it on a tablet for the portablity.  and ebay speaks for it self
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I FELL ASLEEP IN THE THEATRE WHEN BREAKING DAWN CAME OUT SO I COULDNT WAIT TO SEE THIS GREAT VIDEO AND WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great little family film. Fun and interesting characters and not too preachy about parenthood. Great to have in the movie collection
B009FXIICK|4.0|This is a familiar type of game (think Bejeweled).  It's cute and manages to be more addictive than expected.  Decent faotd overall.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Was unsure about The Hunger Games but I wasn't able to put it down once I started reading it. Very good book.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|So many things can be said about this album. The most outstanding points are how all the songs fit together with each other. And then you have Ellie's voice which is raspy and quite feminine.<br /><br />I was not a big fan of &#34;Lights&#34; (her previous album), but this certaiinly turned me into a fan.
B00275EHJG|5.0|great movie!!!!! loved it.  watched many, many times already.  will tell all my friends and relatives to get this movie. Toy Story 3.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game to clear the stress at the end of day cant get better then that great app to have on kindle
B007SGLZP8|1.0|“Plodding “ is the word that came to mind after the first few chapters of “The Racketeer.“  “When is Grisham ever going to get started telling a believable story?“  A few chapters of ill conceived (<br />and executed “  pedant prose) later, a thought begins to creep in: “Grisham is playing a joke.\\"<br /><br />And he has!  He even admits it when apparently even he could stand the journey to nowhere and<br /> quit writing. He leaves the reader literally all wet, but, hey,--with millions of imaginary wealth in gold bars stuck on an island, where could the plot conceivably have gone from there?
B00008BXJG|5.0|Never to old to rock I guess. Never did listen to them much when I was young, now at 63 I like them a lot.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is lots of fun my kids love it and its so easy even my 2 year old plays it
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the ending, it was unexpected (the assasination of President Coin instead of Snow).  I enjoyed reading the entire triology.  Great story telling....page turner.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|I bought this because I love older 'Smith. Even found small redeeming quality in 'Get A Grip'. They truly lost their way now. Don't get it. But I still cant give it a 1. maybe out of pure respect? or maybe because I am not a total 'die hard' Aerosmith fan. If I was, I would be heartbroken and wish for a 0 rating for this return CD.<br /><br />They should have waited longer.<br /><br />Bad in 2 regards. they are trying to relive their 80's early 90's ballad filled hit-streak (but failing miserably), and they really left their ba**s behind on this. There isn't much passion where there should be, even in the soft tracks (which compile 80% of the CD). The cheese factor is strong here. Sounds very 'by the numbers'. Add the fact that Tyler's voice is overbearingly on top in the mix, and that there is no real punch to the tracks except for the sound quality and you get this uninspired, directionless offering. Its a pretty boring mess. An extremely hyped and 'polished' mess. Especially for us old fans.<br /><br />I bought it because it was cheap and I figured, with so many songs and liking most of the bands stages, a few songs had to be keepers. Not the case. I mean of 15 tracks not even 3 or 4 good songs? Its nothing offensively bad, just very very very safe. no real substance or swagger you would expect from the band. I wont be going back to this one very often because i don't remember most of it.<br /><br />Oh well, its only money.. But save yours and if you want decent Aerosmith look elsewhere. Buy 'Rocks' or 'Live Bootleg' from the 70's, 'Rock In A Hard Place' from the 80's  or 'Pump', 'Get a Grip' for later stuff, not this. Don't be fooled by the pretty package. Not good.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love pinterest! it has great ideas and I can spend all day on it and not get bored!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a wonderful film that every mom, dad, or grandparent should at least see, if not own. Its message about fatherhood is inspiring and challenges each viewer to lead by example. Wow!
B006YXTRHY|4.0|Watched the previous 3 right before watching this one...Decent pace, enough action to stay engaged...set up nicely for second one...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Read the book because there was so much buzz about it. Did not like it at all. Very sad how<br />a young woman would go through that just to keep a man.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Really got into the details of why and how gluten/wheat are harmful to us now and why we should eliminate it from our diets. I have been gluten free/sugar free and notice a huge difference in how I feel as well as my behavior and attitude. This book give me to tools to explain to other WHY
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great graphics and action...love the game. Better than first Angry Birds. More challenges but not too difficult My grand daughter can not put it down.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Great book. Really good for a young kid interested in law related things. Its a very interesting and detailed book.
0425263916|5.0|What can I say about this book, but amazing!! I am so glad Sylvia Day picked up literally where the first one stopped, but as soon as you pass the sappy love parts you get into the meat of the story and what a man would do for the woman he loves!! I am so excited about book 3 to find out how it all ends!!
0060987464|5.0|So this book is just really wonderful because if you're a person who really wants to know things about people that you admire then this is a great book to look at. Many people during the 90's I want to say had a really big problem with Mr. Manson and reading this book I got some enlightenment on who he is as a person both as a rock-star and a human. Also this book can be a fast read and I often find myself going back to a certain page or chapter and reread to make a note on if I ever read a similar bio of someone else. But all in all just a great book and if you are a fan of Mr. Manson's then I would recommend this book to you and hopefully you enjoy it every time you read the contents, and even if you do not like him I still would recommend this book to you because you can get some reasoning on why he is the way he is.
B001GJ3VYG|5.0|met the requirements and arrived on time. works fine too.. considering that it arrived from uk, great price and great timing..
B0034G4P94|5.0|this is a great place if your looking to purchase some dvd movies, great selection at a good price, check them out
B007SGM084|5.0|I heared about this book and wanted to read..but first than i just started to read it i wasnt sure i will gonna end even first one..but i did finish all free of them and loved it..i prolly will read it again sometime.
B009KNPM9W|5.0|Excellent reissue! So much outstanding unreleased material that CD1 feels/sounds like \\"Trouble Man soundtrack\\" the way I imagine Marvin Gaye intended it to be. CD2 is full of behind-the-scenes working material & other rarities.<br /><br />I've enjoyed this expanded Trouble Man so much, that I'm giving it 5-stars!<br /><br />That said, please take heed:<br />My only complaint is that the liner notes are incomplete. They stop mid-sentence, around page 16, of an otherwise elaborate booklet. (I e-mailed Hip-O-Select & asked for the missing liner notes-text, but they never responded.)
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Very funny animated character.  My 7yr old loves to check in with Ben.  Unlimites hours of good clean fun for all ages.
1451695195|5.0|This book was well-written with an extraordinary account of the life that awaits us beyond this earthly realm.  Highly recommended.
B008458O3S|5.0|As an avid puzzle fan I love trying out new kinds of puzzles and this one was a blast.  I did finally manage to solve ALL of the puzzles (regular and bonus).  Excellent puzzle game if that is your forte.
B006RXQ0JO|4.0|better than we expected, krpt us on edge and despite the sixth sense that my wife has about &#34;always see it coming&#34;, she didn't have a clue.  Very intriguing
0385528752|4.0|Dan and Chip Heath have a light-hearted way of sharing very sound, research-based principles, making books like Switch both enjoyable and practical. Throughout Switch, the authors rely on an analogy from Dr. Jonathan Haidt that refers to our emotional side as the Elephant and our rational side, the Rider. \\"Anytime the six-ton elephant and the Rider disagree about which direction to go, the Rider is going to lose,\\" they write. \\"He is completely overmatched.\\"<br /><br />The same goes for change. Let's say you, as the rational Rider, want to start arriving to the office at 7a.m. When the alarm goes off early the next morning, however, your Elephant (emotional side) automatically hits the snooze button and makes some justification such as, \\"I'll work late instead\\" or \\"I'll get there early tomorrow.\\" That powerful Elephant will beat the Rider every time - unless we learn how to clear the path, steer the Elephant, and make the switch.<br /><br />A few of my takeaways:<br /><br />Remove ambiguity. Get crystal-clear about the change you want to make. I'd also add to connect with the purpose behind your change. Arriving to the office at 7:30 so you'll be home in time to bond with your family over dinner each evening will connect your change to your bigger purpose. \\"What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity,\\" Chip & Dan conclude.<br /><br />Break down the task, or \\"shrink the change\\" in the Heaths' words. Identify all the little steps that will lead to your overall change, then...<br /><br />Start small. This can be a challenge for the all-or-nothing personality types among us. But rather than thinking we need to make a huge overhaul - which typically leads to procrastination or overwhelm - we usually need to just take small steps. \\"Big problems are rarely solved with commensurately big solutions,\\" the authors assert, \\"but rather a sequence of small solutions, sometimes over months, sometimes over decades.\\"<br /><br />I like how the material applies to goal-setting, too. Whether you want to start arriving to the office early, growing your business, investing more time with your family, or sustaining an exercise routine, you'll reap greater benefits by removing any ambiguity (and connecting to the purpose), breaking down the task, and starting small. The authors give terrific examples to showcase that, with each step, we'll find we can change - even when change is hard.
0439680093|3.0|Matt, a troubled 14-year-old, goes a step too far and lands himself in England's juvenile court system. He opts for a special rehab project that sends him to the countryside, only to find himself trapped in the creepy town of Lesser Malling by Mrs. Devrill whose evil intentions for Matt become quickly apparent.<br /><br />Raven's Gate opened well but then faltered. It had a solid premise and strong writing. Matt is a very well-developed character and Horowitz can really build a sense of danger that gets the pages turning.<br /><br />But, I had two big problems with the book. First, it was almost a self-consciously boy-oriented story. There is absolutely no romance and very few female characters except for evil old ladies.<br /><br />But its worst flaw is that it descends into random action at the end. In the best thriller stories, the action is surprising but makes sense. It arises out of the decisions of the characters. Too much in Raven's Gate just seems to happen.<br /><br />Raven's Gate wasn't for me. However, I suspect some readers might really enjoy this dark adventure. I consider Raven's Gate to be \\"horror-light\\"--not as terrifying or gruesome as something Stephen King might write--but scary and evil enough to make for some chilling reading.
0812981448|4.0|Imagine starting a shoe business in which, for every pair you sold, you gave a pair away to someone in need. While it sounds wonderful, it's not a sustainable business model...or is it?<br /><br />Blake Mycoskie dreamed up this idea after a trip to South America, where he saw many children who couldn't afford shoes to protect their little feet from the elements. In 2006, he founded TOMS Shoes, a business designed to provide consumers with quality shoes and donate just as many to those children in need.<br /><br />His business model is simple: One For One. For every pair sold, a pair is donated.<br /><br />While he encountered his fair share of naysayers (\\"It will never work,\\" \\"You'll put yourself out of business\\"), Blake carried his vision high and honored his underlying mission. Within 5 years, TOMS had given more than a million pairs of shoes to children in need.<br /><br />Start Something That Matters shares Blake's journey from idea-conception to today, where TOMS is a thriving, socially responsible business making a difference. Three of my takeaways from this book:<br /><br />Know Your Mission. A mission statement is a succinct tool that can guide every decision you make and action you take. \\"I didn't have to compartmentalize any of my life's ambitions: personal, professional, or philanthropic,\\" writes Blake. \\"They all converged in a single mission.\\"<br /><br />Think Big, Start Small. While we often crave the dramatic overhaul, \\"small improvements made every day will lead to massive improvement overall.\\" Capture your vision, then break it into manageable pieces that you can move on daily.<br /><br />Plan Your Giving. Rather than scattering your giving, or donating only when you feel you have extra money, incorporate philanthropy into your strategy. You can do this as a business owner, an employee, and an individual - and it allows you to make a more significant contribution to the causes you care most about, in a much more sustainable way.<br /><br />The examples and practical action steps shared in Start Something That Matters will leave you feeling inspired, optimistic, and motivated to act. You may even find yourself wanting to buy a pair of shoes - and can do so knowing you're doing something that matters!
B003V6L94Q|5.0|What more is there to say.  This is happy music with a great vibe.  Every song is a sing along and it's motivating.
B005XI9456|1.0|This album is way to poppy.  I can see why so many 10 year old girls would love this album.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I absolutely love this app. this is my very favorite thing to do at a fair or a carnival and I freaking love that I can do it on my kindle!
B000JLQSW4|5.0|Of the three Alan Parsons CD's I received a month ago this one is really better than I had remembered.  This CD is great.
B009FXIICK|4.0|Its a bejeweled clone. not much to say about it.  buttons are responsive and it wastes some time.  lacks modes and repetitive.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|Many people may have not heard of Alan Parsons but their music is great.  This CD is purely refreshing and is like no other band's music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME WAS SO AWESOME THAT I JUST HAD TO BUY IT. IT HAS VERY LITTLE LAG AND PREFORMS PERFECT IF YOU DO NOT GET THIS GAME YOUR MISSING OUT DO GET THE GAME.
B00006GA4C|4.0|Mark Farner and the guys had a way of making music feel good.  This is a very good CD and nobody compares with them from that era or the present.  A very special sound that nobody has ever immulated or probably ever will.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I GOT IT AND PLAYED IT FOR A MONTH THEN IT CRASHED NOT LETTING ME PLAY EVEN IF YOU START OVER YOU DON'T GET ANY THING BACK BY FAR WORST GAME EVER. :(
B00006GA48|5.0|Kick Butt Rock & Roll that has not been duplicated by anyone.  Grand Funk seems to have their own sound and format in performing their music that is unique and refined.  Rock & Roll is better because of these three gentlemen.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|THE GAME IS NOT THAT FUN FOR IT'S PRICE ANGRY BIRDS ORIGINAL IS A DOLLAR AND IT'S WAY BETTER DON'T. WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B000IOM1Z0|5.0|It is a pleasure to listen to this CD.  I was a big fan of Alan Parsons as a teen but I had not listened to them since back in the 1980's.
B004N868DS|5.0|This is the best mouse-pad I ever owned (and I've tried many).  The double-sided aluminum alloy allows the mouse to glide smoothly and precisely at different speeds and really works well for FPS, like COD, etc. The size of the pad is perfect for gaming.  The support memory foam pad (which I decided works better for the WASD section of the keyboard) really compliment the comfort, and add a refined, Razer product-like touch (although the only thing that compares to precision/comfort of this pad is the aluminum Steel Series one; however, I still like the textured finish of this one a tad better).
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Played this for several years on my phone.  I just bought a kindal fire hd and the game is unbelievable.  The graphics are wonderful.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The aithor keeps you guessing.  I love Gone Girl as it relates to real life events and thoughts. Helps wake up some of the inner thoughts of real life relationships.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I would recommend this for all ages.  Well constructed tale with both humor and drama about breaking and healing relationships.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Best princess movie EVER! My whole family loved this movie and it was surprisingly funny and cute. The characters are brilliant.
B002M7A79S|4.0|Great story and good special effects<br /><br />Good chemistry between the characters and an interesting and fast moving plot.  Enjoyed it.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Watched this movie with a smile on my face the whole time! Sweet story and characters that are more real than whats in most movies.<br />Only one part that may be a little risky for my 13 year old grand-daughter. Opens the door for a good talk though.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Downloading was not an issue at all, my daughter is reading every chance she gets.  Pages turn with no problems.
B009FXIICK|5.0|Sound and graphics at first made me think it was an old video game, but game play was similar to bejeweled only with new twist of having to collect a certain number of each animal to level up. Still has the old video game feel and sounds to promote a familiar feeling.
B008BM9L72|5.0|What can I say about this trilogy??? I am completely addicted to both Christian and Ana. Lots of ups and downs with them both but how love wins in the end.
B002TVQ4AS|5.0|The director did a superb job in bringing this part of history back to life. I was enraptured as the musicians told their story. Thank you for sharing this beautiful story.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Very badly written. Could not be bothered reading past the first few pages. Don't know what all the fuss is about.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a really great movie for the kids and the entire family as well. My 7 year old loves it!
B001N26GFM|5.0|This story has the most heart breaking theme of any I have seen in years. Little Bruno does not understand why his surroundings need to be changed, or where he is going. After his encounter  with the little Jewish boy they become friends and behave as boys their age do. The finale is devastating. Poor little boys, they lost their youth, they lost their lives.
B000244FDW|5.0|We have owned a VHS for the show for years. So we bought a DVD to replace it when it wore out
0525958002|5.0|I devoured this book as soon as I received it.  I only wish it had been longer.  Being a loyal Duranie, it was a must buy and a must read.  I learned a lot about my favorite band and favorite bass player!
B00364K6YW|5.0|This restored edition looks like it did when it originally aired. (Maybe a bit better even)<br />I recommend it to any Austin fan
B00A17AD36|5.0|Really can't argue with the price for the amount of songs received and all of the songs are good songs.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Possible spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I'm going to begin by saying I am a 21 year old who absolutely loves animated movies.  For a long time, I would have considered Finding Nemo to be my favorite Disney/Pixar, but Brave effortlessly replaced it with its Celtic charm and lovable characters.<br /><br />This movie was excellent.  The animation is stunning, the characters are quirky and interesting, and although the plot is short it really covers everything they could have done with this plot.  It was nice to see a princess who finally didn't end up with the man and openly admitted that she may never be interested in getting married, ever.  It's much more common to see the princess fall in love and leave happily ever after, especially with Disney, so it was definitely refreshing to see the princess taking the front seat and controlling her own life rather than letting the men in her life control her.  Feminist thoughts aside, the characters in the movie were enjoyable (adore the little brothers... \\"wee devils, more like!\\") and the visual representation of Scotland is breathtaking, as most Pixar animation tends to be.<br /><br />Those who are complaining about the nudity and humor (\\"feast yer eyes!\\"...it's funny because traditionally, men wear nothing beneath their kilt) have clearly never seen what else their kids are watching on television (seriously, if your kid is watching Spongebob, Adventure Time, The Fairly Oddparents, etc., they've seen almost literally the same thing).  Seriously, Merida is a great influence for the little girls of this generation:  Merida can teach them that they are able to make their own choices and they do not always have to follow tradition.<br /><br />While the movie was short and I do believe they could have made it a little bit longer and a little more suspenseful, but if you didn't tear up a wee bit during the climax, you may have missed the point of it, and that is a shame.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|DVD shipped with a broken case. Was disappointed but the disk was in good shape. This movie is a family tradition we watch it every Christmas! Glad to have in bluray!!
B008RTE08E|5.0|I am an avid Beatles fan from way back!!  I had this video on VHS.  To find it on DVD was wonderful to me.  My favorite song is &#34;Your Mother Should Know&#34;!  I'm still waiting for the release of &#34;Let It Be&#34; which is N/A.  I have time as GOD is willing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the best in the series - very captivating and quick-paced. The second and third books aren't nearly as good, but this is worth the read.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is for the ages as we are living in now.  I watched it out of curiousity because of the hype.  it was such a hit.  My 12 year old neice loved it.  I was in awe after I saw it.  It made me stop & think about our situation now.  The acting is exceptional.  When I found it on Cyber Monday on the Sunday before, I could not pass up the price!!  TYVM, Amazon!
B00540G3G6|4.0|We love Jack Skellington and all things Disney in our family.  Not one of Disney's best films, but still very good!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you liked 50 shades ,this is very similar storyline. Different names and situation but it all comes down to the same thing!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I lovelovelove the script, the acting, everything! I especially loved the way they put a spin on the different fairy tales in order to connect them and make them into a cohesive &#34;super-fairy-tale&#34;. Just awesome. Can't wait for the rest of the season!
0061703087|5.0|This book is one of the best of Michael Chrichton's reads. I would suggest this book to anybody who like's science fiction and a what if book, for which wakes the reader to the possible danger!
1451695187|1.0|This book is a self-serving piece of ridiculousity meant to line the doctor's pockets, and hoodwink its readers.  The good doctor spends most of his time talking about his family, early history, hobbies, love of medicine, illness, etc., but precious little about the \\"indisputable\\" reality of heaven.  He meets his long-lost sister is this supra-reality. She's dressed in a gossamer gown as are the others.  Right out of a fairy tale.  What of the other several billion dead souls ?  Then there's the \\"soul\\" of every living thing that every has dwelt upon the earth - huh ?
B007EE564U|5.0|Hopefully we will hear more about Mitch Rapp in the near future. If not I guess I can start again at the beginning and read the whole series again.
B007NCSQFO|5.0|I feel like she may be losing her rawness on some tracks, but all in all it's Nicki she's amazing and hilarious! But I do miss the Nicki Minaj that was in Monster or Roman's Revenge, although it's coming back in her new track &#34;The Boys&#34; and in Stupid Hoe.
0062183591|3.0|I have the feeling this book does not take itself seriously. I recommend mistakes were made but not by me, over this book any day of the week.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Best series I have ever read. The characters are wonderfully developed and each one brings something interesting to the table so that you never get bored. The story is sometimes slow-moving, but this is rare and doesn't last long enough to cause serious complaint. Definitely for mature audiences, but avoids feeling gratuitous. Simply wonderful reading.
B006H5120E|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite movie,  I had to get it on Blu ray so she can watch it at college
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Couldn't make it through book 2.  I have a more adventurous sex life by myself than these two portay.  The writing sucks and its very repetative.  When I found out it was Twilight fanfiction I realized why!
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I got it for my son's 21 birthday.  It's hard to know what they would like, but he LOVES this movie
B005PK1G76|5.0|This little organizer fits great on our MacClaren stroller, and also on our jogger.  The velcro is really strong so it doesn't slip, the cup holder is stretchy to hold various size cups, and they is a little secret zipper part to old ID, small wallet, keys, etc.  Great product.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Struggled with book 1 but actually got into a story line with book 2. Wanted to read book 3.  Irregardless of all the sex and porn the story was actually entertaining.  Lots of twists and turns. Ending was so good.  EL James was able to twist and turn this story and make me enjoy a good read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i have a lot of homework to do everyday and it is mostly math so i have needed a calculator for a long time. i love this because it help with math and stuff stuff i gotta do homework and stuff and stuff listening to music.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The 1st book I struggled through trying to find out what all the hype was about.  Boot 2 actually had a story line that I found interesting.  Still lots of physological drama and sex.  Lots of mind manipulation and dream like qualities. It really sets you up for book 3 and I actually wanted to continue the series.
B002WIDRM6|3.0|I enjoyed a few of the songs but found most of the recordings to rocky for likings, if you like your country with a little rock to it then you will enjoy this cd.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|The zoom for Kinect is great when you have limited room. When you clip it on it lets you get about 25% closer than without. I can use this any where, just put in with the rest of my XBOX 360 accessories & off you go. No need to set it up or calibrate it!! Just clip on before you start any Kinect game and it sets up just like it is not there, only you can use in a more confined area! If you use a Kinect this is a must have add-on for XBOX 360.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Very predictable plot even for those who did not read the book.<br />Maybe the next one to be a little better !!!
159562015X|5.0|I received this book in the mail from my company, they use it as part of their training process to help employees work effectively. I read the first sections of the book and was very excited to jump online and take my assessment! Hmm, but where do I find this code they speak of? After flipping page by page I realized the code had been torn out :(<br /><br />I immediately looked online for cheat codes and solutions but didn't find any so I contacted the website help, by the following morning I had a response asking for detailed information about my purchase. I responded with everything they asked for and was emailed a new code the same day! That's impressive, if you ask me.<br /><br />Upon taking the assessment I printed my report and read with amazement. It was dead on! Like almost creepy how well these personalized descriptions described me and the tips for action were VERY helpful.<br /><br />I'm actually back online today ordering several copies to give as gifts to friends and family. I wish I had read this a decade ago!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This book is a great for getting you jumpstarted on the process of preparing your first book published through KDP, but it is not a replacement for the information on the KDP website. This book  needs to reflect newer information on the website so  you don't end up having to redo mountains of work (like I did) to suit the new KF8 format.
B009B50QOU|2.0|I had high hopes for this album, but to me this is one of Green Day's weakest efforts.  The songs have a pop feel that violates the senses; honestly, it sounds like they're trying to be some other band.  It took me a while to nail it down, but I finally figured out that they watched \\"That Thing You Do\\" one too many times.  They sound just like the One-ders, only without all the talent and great songwriting...
B003M696QS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and the subject of UN-localized consciousness which I have been talking about since having psychic experiences since I was a small child.  How else can you explain this stuff?  Which this author does very well.  I think this is a great book for those just beginning to delve into lay mans physics of a unified consciousness.  And of course I always appreciate the NDE experiences that can not be explained pointing to the true mystery of life (and death).
1451695187|3.0|Great subject matter and very credible source of experience.  However far too much repitition of the same descriptives. Literally dozens of lines of repeated thoughts. But still interesting and thought provoking.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great app !! this app has plenty of games to keep you busy. only downside is controlling some of the games with the touch screen only is hit and miss at times
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|By the third book I lost interest in the concept of the story, it wasn't as riveting as the first two.  A little disappointed.
1401937519|5.0|i could not put it down. she talked about what she learned in nda.and it made you stop and think.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is an amazing show. I have not seen the first season but I was expecting this to be a lot scarier. So far not too bad. It is scary just more in an emotional way rather than physically getting scared.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for the grand children, they love DVD like this to put them in the Christmas spirit.
B0091REZMW|3.0|wish it wouldn't ask for me to spend my money I work for. But is a fun game to play.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I took my daughter to Universal last week for her early Christmas present, and they have the Despicable Me ride...honestly, I never saw the movie and had no clue what a minion was, but they were so cute when we got home I watched the movie...and still think it was the cutest movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the BEST &amp; and most useful app I have used.  This is the only app I would even consider buying!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The game is so much fun and sooo adictive.  I would recommend this for the whole family.  It is just like being at the fair.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|While Kevin Spacey does an excellent job playing a &#34;Hal&#34; like computer, essentially Sam Rockwell is the only actor in this movie. In combination with the excellent soundtrack, he is easily able to capture your attention for a few hours. For first time watchers there are a few good twists in the movie. I'm still not sure how much replay value there is in this movie, but it's still worth picking up for the price as I doubt you'll be able to find it anywhere to rent. One last thing that some of you may not know is it was directed by Duncan Jones who is none other than the son of David Bowie!
B005PTYOTE|5.0|Awesome bargain!  When I bought this, the price was $10.00 cheaper than Walmart!  Moreover, there were no bargains which even cam remotely close.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Must own blu ray if fan of the film. Transfer is solid. It's one of those films that's unexpectedly good out of no where.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I realize I'm in the minority, but I thought it was a fantastic book. A little depressing, a little more vulgar than Harry Potter (okay, a lot more vulgar), but I thought it was written well and had great character development through the way. If you go into it expecting HP, you're going to be thoroughly disappointed. If you go into it with an open mind, you might find that you enjoy it.
1609611543|4.0|Have not read the book fully but appears to be factually correct.I will try some of the guidelines and report results
B007HACDLK|5.0|Typical Vince Flynn- great spy/clandestine adventure, I could not put it down.  This book is a must read for all Mitch Rapp fans
B005VPRET4|5.0|One of the few cases when the product is not competitive with Wal-Mart.  I just picked it up for around half of the above advertised price (~55).
0525952926|5.0|Only downside to this book was that it had to end. I can't wait until the final installment comes out.
0547884591|5.0|Just started reading but I'm really excited. Part about learning is really good, and I can't wait to start cooking. Get it and live the good life!!
1423140605|5.0|I love all of Rick Riordan's books. I've read the original Percy Jackson series, the Kane Chronicles, and now the Heroes of Olympus. All are good. I recommend for teens and beyond.
B00328G4XY|5.0|Not being immersed in the music world I may have missed a few nuances however I can pretty much quote from each song in the list. Everyone will have a favorite. The favorite may be base on a Hendrix original or a Hendrix interpretation of someone else's work. I bought this as an album because it is hard for me to pick. If it were to be one for me it would be \\"All Along The Watchtower.\\" Well I also listen to Bob Dylan. Yet it was Hendrix at the time that carried me through a war and right in time for Woodstock.<br /><br />Periodically I think back on the time and think \\"There must be some way out of here,\\"<br /><br />If not buying this for nostalgia, or a project, it is work making some new memories of where you are now listing to this classic.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|ive been wanting this game fiinally it is 99 cents so I get it.it Sucks all it does is shows a clip then goes to home screen! !!!!!!!!!! this Sucks!!!!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|There's no shortage of reviewers giving praises to this item, I am no exception.<br />The folio cover fits my tablet like a custom tailored suit. It makes whatever I am holding look so much more sophisticated. People usually start by asking &#34;is that a book?&#34; Or what is that, followed by &#34;That's so beautiful !&#34;<br />Workmanship and material are supreme superb compared to other covers I have had. The attention to detail is excellent.  The WOW factor is unmatched. I would recommend anyone to buy this cover any time.<br />Strongly recommended!<br />By the way, I am using it for my iPad mini.
B00A12VW86|5.0|I'm a huge Green Day fan! I usually buy the CDs at a store, but if offers like this one keep coming up I'm definitely buying it from here. The songs are amazing, I love this album <3
B008RTE09S|5.0|Magical Mystery Tour was The Beatles first real production, and project since the death of their manager Brian Epstein serveral months before it's release. It is common knowledge that although all 4 Beatles had a hand in production, Paul Mccartney was the major producer and director. This was made during a very sad period with the group losing their manager and their escallating drug usage. The group at the time of his death were lost, confused, and not sure what direction to take. Of course their music didn't suffer, but other major problems were starting to arise. As far as this movie (or experimental film, depending on who you ask) was concerned, no one knew much about it before it's release. It is part avant garde meets Monty Python. It was shown right before Christmas 1967, in black and white, and was seriously panned right away by all the critics. Yes The Beatles had their first flop, no question. As of today the film now has a strong cult following and is enjoyed by many who now understand it. You are either going to love this film or hate it. The Beatles themselves look tired and drugged out to say the least. No happy and crazyness like \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" or \\"HELP\\" here. But the film has some good moments. I believe the best is the \\"I Am The Walrus\\" musical excerpt. If you are a Beatles completist you must have this in your collection. As for the blu-ray itself, it looks like a brand new recently discovered print was used and it trumps over the previous home video and dvd version. Most scratches and debris have been removed, and picture is sharper, colors brighter and more detail. Although this is far from hd demo quality. The audio has been remixed to DTS HD 5.1, and sounds spectacular. You also get a new Paul Mccartney commentary, plus some other extras, plus a couple of hidden easter eggs, if you can find them. So weird as it all is, if you are a Beatles fan, you definitely want to upgrade to the Blu-ray version of Magical Mystery Tour. Highly recommended.ed.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I bought the book for my 12 year-old daughter and she said it was inspirational. I suggest getting your child this book!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Saw this in the movies and it was awesome.  I have been looking forward in obtaining a copy of the movie once it came out on blu ray.  Can't wait
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It really helps you go to sleep. Especially Christmas eve or the day before your birthday when you get excited. And when your stressed or mad you can listen to itakd it will com you down
B004UQPM4E|5.0|Huge Christopher Reeve fan considering he played Superman since my childhood days.  Now with Blu-Ray, I can relive the moments and memories of this great movie collection
B000I9X67W|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen. It shows Teens and young adults that they can make a difference.... but it takes hard work.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Huge fan since the first release of the first lethal weapon series.  Mel and Danny are awesome and can't wait to see all the series on blu ray
B003WEA4UM|5.0|I have read this book three times because I find it so fascinating, and each time I learn some new wrinkle about how all Mitchell's different worlds connect. Brilliant.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|Many words comes to play when it comes to this movie...but nevetheless...it is an awesome great movie with much action.  Can't wait to see it on Blu Ray
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Beautifully written page turner with a shocking end! Loved it! Ian McEwan has done it again with a great story, characters, and plot!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Considering there are many holiday movies out there, this one for me tops it off.  I guess since me and my dad have always been Chevy Chase fans, this one tops it off.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|It's not so much about Christmas, but it truly will make you laugh, and sometimes that is just what you really need.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|Robocop was a breakthrough smash hit when it first came out in the 1980's.  Now that the movie comes out in Blu Ray...look forward to it
0425263916|5.0|This book is a great follow up to her first, Bared to You. It's a quick, easy, fun read. I couldn't put it down! I am a huge Fifty Shades fan and this was the first series I have read since that is similar. Can't wait for the third to come out in May!
0425263916|5.0|This is the second book in the Crossfire series.  I can't wait until the next one comes out!  this series is so much steamier than the Fifty Shades of Grey.
1451696191|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I also learned it was made it a movie. I hope the movie was better than the book. I couldn't get past page 10.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|love this app. however, I am 13, so I cant have a facebook.  so w/  kindle fire, I can't invite any friends! other than that, totally get this app.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I was anxious to get Flynn's latest Rapp story which ultimately proved a bit of a disappointment. I was never fully engaged in this one and almost felt like I had read it before which I think means its getting a little stale. This does not mean I will not buy the next one in the series, I just hope its a better effort.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is freaking amazing, I'm so hooked! Every episode just gets better and better, I would recommend this ti anyone who likes scary action packed shows.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Once again Lee Child delivers a great story. Hooked me from the very beginning and held my interest until the last page. If you are a Reacher fan you will not be disappointed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A friend recommend this series after I finished Fifty Shades of Grey. I think this is better than Fifty Shades!! Characters are well written and I can't get enough. If you liked Fifty, you will love Crossfire!!! If you did not like Fifty, you will love Crossfire. There is no S & M in this series, but plenty of sex!
B00447L4JG|5.0|THIS IS TIM BURTONS FINEST.I LOVED THE WHOLE STORY. IT WAS FUNNY AND JUST A BIT DARK. BUT THATS TIM BURTON FOR YOU.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I love this movie. I heard there may be a prequel or sequel, and I will definitely be watching for it.
B001HN6922|1.0|I LOVED THE FIRST CARS.. THIS ONE CAN NOT HOLD WATER TO THE FIRST..STORY LINE SUCKED. I WAS DISAPPOINTED.THOUGHT THIS  WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
B002S9DRA6|5.0|This is a must have for any Enigma fan.  It provides all the remixes and the works that didn't make the original CDs (should have been bonus tracks).
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS REALLY GOOD CAUSE IT WENT BACK TO THE BEGINING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE ALIEN MOVIE THE FIRST ONE. KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT WITH MY JAW DROPPED THE WHOLE TIME..LOVE IT..THEY WERE LOOKING FOR WHO MADE HUMANS AND IT STILL COMES DOWN TO GOD MADE US!!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|the streaming quality was great ...got it right on my TV and enjoyed it with the whole family. The trailer leaves out the main essence of the movie...a must see family movie
B002HWRYJE|2.0|THIS IS O KBUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED..IT WAS HARD SEEING SPOCK AND KIRK SO YOUNG.ILL RATE THIS AT AND E FOR EFFORT...
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another action-packed, suspense filled read from the master of the espionage genre. Having read all of Vince Flynn's novels I find I am dissapointed each time I finish a book because I realize I have to wait for the next one to be released!
B003F29D44|2.0|MOVIE WAS ...WELL ILL GRADE IT A C IN MY BOOK...IM NOT INTO STUFF LIKE THAT AND ALL WAS SO CROOKED
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of my favorite to watch during the Christmas season. Chevy Chase is hilarious! The family interaction, the work interactions, so close to reality you have to laugh.
B005LAIH54|5.0|LOVE THIS..THIS HAD GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS.NEW BAD GUYS.DIDNT LIKE THE ENDING ALL GODS DIED BUT HADES.DIDNT LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ANYMORE SEQUELS..
B0036CYKQE|5.0|I started to watch this show about 3 days ago and loved it so much that I watched the entire season 1 and season 2 in the last 3 days.<br /><br />I am amazed at how many times true sci-fi shows such as this get canned. I am atleast thankful that the writers were able to write something that gave a finally to the show. So many times I have seen good sci-fi shows end a season and be cancelled leaving the show up in the air.<br /><br />Thank you to all the writers and the cast for creating this amazing show. It is a shame that there is no channel dedicated to sci-fi what will commit to true science fiction as opposed to channels that call themselves sci-fi and then show programs like wrestling or treasure hunting programs and the like.<br /><br />If you like sci-fi this program is a must watch.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|this was a great contineince of the series underworld.the last of the movie was the best. worth waiting on...hope they make another.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The game is fun but none of my friends play it which means there is lots of stuff I can't do. Also the facebook stuff I send to invite them never reaches them.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|HEY THIS IS ALWAYS GOOD.. ALL I CAN SAY IS I HATE THE SERIES IS OVER....ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TO A NEW HARRY POTTER EVERY YEAR..BUT NO MORE
B005P58PIO|4.0|I really like this series.  It is kind of like 24 though, after awhile they run of of tricks and its kind of like the same ole same ole.  Great cast though.
B005LAIH2W|2.0|THOUGHT THIS ONE WAS GOING TO BE A BLOCK BUSTER. BUT IT WASNT.MONSTERS IN THIS ONE LOOKED TO COMICAL.I LIKE THE LITTLE DOG OR WHAT EVER IT WAS. STORY COULDNT HOLD MY INTEREST.
1451695195|3.0|This book was only okay.  Too technical for me, and not really sure it proved anything I didn't already believe.
0142418471|5.0|Bought this for my daughter, but she insisted I read it.  It was great.  An easy read, funny.  I was cheering for both Will Graysons at the end.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I couldn't get through this book, I felt depressed after reading the first half. I also felt like it was really slow paced. Maybe it's too close to my heart because I'm getting married soon, and nobody getting married wants to read about people falling out of love with their spouse.<br /><br />I thought it would be different, but I was disappointed.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Great Saturday night moving to sit back and be entertained by. Lots of action and adventure and good character continuation from past movies.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|If you are familiar with Algebra you will see the layer underneath the game as your child is playing this app.  There are two screens - two sides of an equation.  On each side there are pictures to combine and cancel.  They used a 'day' and 'night' visual queue for the images.  This would be cancelling out terms.  When you add pictures to one screen to cancel something you have to add the same picture to the other screen.  This would be balancing the equation.  It's really a great app that teaches Algebraic concepts in the form of a game.  My 8 year old started playing and figuring out the game immediately.  I was sitting with him to help and answer questions.  He didn't have many questions.  I just couldn't believe how well they simulated solving equations with this game.<br />I've purchased a lot of 'educational' apps for my children on their Kindle Fire's.  This one is for real!
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|Obviously, this has been done before. That being said, I thought that they did a good job with the movie (Mogs were really bad ass) and hopefully they will make another one.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Our book club dressed in black, white with hints of red.<br />Good book. The imagery is fabulous and real to the reader.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I got this for my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" tablet.  It's pretty awesome what you can do with it.  I mainly want to use it to control my PowerPoint presentations from my PC to my video projector.  It works just fine for that.  There's just one little quibble that I have.  The PC desktop does not use all of the real estate on the 8.9\\" screen.  It's designed for a 7\\" screen.  The developer needs to update the app so that it detects the larger size of the Kindle 8.9\\" and adjusts accordingly.<br /><br />Update: My comments above were for my Dell 1720 running Windows 7.  I upgraded to an Asus running Windows 8.  Neither Splashtop HD, Splashtop Whiteboard, or Splashtop 2 worked properly.  They would connect through my Kindle with the Asus, but I got a blank screen on the Kindle.  However, the cursor was there and would function between the two devices.  After some investigation, I came across a fix on the Splashtop site.  Here's the website address, in which a few other issues are also addressed: support-splashtop2.splashtop.com/entries/21516892-why-do-i-see-a-black-green-screen-on-my-tablet-phone<br /><br />2nd update: I had previously titled my review \\"Almost perfect\\" because of the \\"real estate\\" issue mentioned above.  Great news.  An update to the app has solved this problem.  The entire screen of the Kindle HD 8.9\\" is now used by the Splashtop HD app.  Thanks Splashtop!
141659521X|5.0|I loved this book, but then again I love every Vince Flynn Book written.  The Mitch Rapp Series is the best one out there if you like reading about Covert Operations and CIA intrigue.  In This book however Mitch was not his usual REAL bad A** Hard line self. He was still tough but not as tough as before. My impression is Flynn is trying to take Rapp into a new direction. The book was great once started its hard to put down. Its an airplane or beach read for sure. He did leave some new characters unfinished. The book just ended and you find your self saying thats it!!! this is how it ends? At 2:00 am I was not happy about that because I spent the next hour thinking about the book . I was dissapointed in the ending but I have a feeling he will continue his next book from where this one let off. He developed some new characters that really need to be expanded. Irene Kennedy the head of the CIA was a lot tougher and bad a** in this book her atitude was if he looks at you wrong shoot him. I liked a stronger Irene, I would love to see more of her in future books. I dont think any one out there would regret buying or reading this book
B002A4UE78|5.0|Bought this album when it came out back in the fall of '86. Great playing and great tunes. Yngwie went a little more commerical, but not too much. Still sounds good to this day.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show kills me. Every episode ends with me wanting it to go on at least another hour. This season has a lot of new characters and things going on, but it is good to see them expanding the story line.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love romance novels!  I have been reading them for many years.  This is not a romance novel, this is a curl up in bed with your husband and try some mind blowing ideas out!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I was very excited for this movie, but was really disappointed. Charlize Therron was amazing, but &#34;eh&#34; to the rest.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My mouth is still watering!  My heart is still beating furiously!  I can't wait to read Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy!
B002RSQGQK|5.0|I bought Rear Window so I can watch it whenever I want to.<br />The acting is excellent with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. Loved Thelma Ritter also.<br />I believe it was made in the 50's. It is full of suspense and a, sit on the edge of your seat movie.<br />I have watched it maybe 6 or 8 times already. Never get bored with it.<br />This is a real classic!<br />Book Lover.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great acting, awesome story!  you literally dont know whos gonna die from one show to the next. def must have in the library.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|works very well for multiple users to stay up on activities and ideas. didn't realize how easy it worked over multiple platforms, Mac and Android at same time. still learning allit can do!
B000WTNCYA|5.0|This is a great CD. The music is wonderful infusing jazz with a little bit of pop. Nice to listen to at the end of a hard day. It is so relaxing and fun to listen to.
B0092MKFIY|3.0|If you're buying this because you like &#34;It's Time&#34; or &#34;Radioactive&#34;, be warned that there may not be much else to listen to. The album has an unbalanced feel that makes you want more of each song. It shifts tones a few times and can make continuous listening feel disjointed. I like albums to be like rollercoasters: Ups and downs, but all-in-all, one great ride. Night Visions feels like a bumper car: You rev up, just to hit somebody and change course altogether. Some of the songs are really good, but the flow just isn't there for me. That being said, if you like to listen to one song here and there, you'll be surprised by how catchy they all are. Put your iPod on shuffle and I'm sure the songs won't feel out of place.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I like all of the songs that was put into this album. This has got to be this first album I purchased that got me into this genre of music.
B001KEHAI0|2.0|I love this movie, but not this blu-ray release.  This dishonest labeling is an on-going problem with DVDs.  The package lists the aspect ratio (width-to-height) as 1.85:1 (or greater), but when you play the disc, the only choice is 1.77:1 (16x9).  To coin a phrase, this is not rocket science.  Tell the customer what they are actually buying.  Normally, this is a problem with Warner discs.  This one is from Columbia.  The stupidity spreads.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|I chose this rating because of the songs in the album, this album pretty much has all of their best songs.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Very good movie about how mothers and daughters may not always see eye to eye but still loves each other.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Saw it before and now my 2.5 year old is into all superheroes so we are getting it as a stocking stuffer for Xmas. She is going to love it!
0802798225|2.0|I've read most of Simone Elkeles's books and she's a good writer. She has a fabulous sense of humor that shines in the 'How to Ruin' series. My biggest complaint with her books, especially Perfect Chemistry, is that the main characters have a rather superficial relationship. To be more specific, it's all sexually driven and revolves around hot people hooking up with other hot people. I just think love is about more that sex, desire, and physical attraction. The end was also very unrealistic.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Very fun and imaginative, surprising, quirky inventive cinematography. Overall I finish this movie happy to see what movies are like when the creators just allow themselves to be  creative, odd and just have some fun with it.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|LANE IS INCREDIBLE, HER VOICE IS PURE MAGIC. SHE DOES WHAT SHE DOES AND ONLY SHE CAN DO, WHAT SHE DOES. PURE MAGIC
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Wonderfully heartwarming movie that teaches a valuable lesson on the dangers of pride. The special effects are really really good as are all of Pixars movies.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|LANA IS THE BEST, HER MUSIC IS HEART WARMING AND ENJOYABLE. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO LOVES GOOD HEART WARMING MUSIC
B004CJB0CM|4.0|I like this because the first level has you tired in 20 minutes than when I spend 45 minutes in the gym!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is a much improved movie over the last couple, I was very surprised with the gay villian, but Javiar plays a good one. It was refreshing to watch this one, longest Bond film I've ever seen.  But the film never got slow anywhere.
B0012250IM|5.0|My daughters and I love the Polar Express. I was so excited to by this album so my 5 year old could sing along with &#34;When Christmas Comes to Town&#34; which is one of her favorite songs. I love that the album also included all of the classic versions of Christmas songs by Bing Crosby and Perry Como ( and many others) that are featured in the movie. Great purchase for any Christmas lover!
B0063GORYU|3.0|when tapping card it does not always go into the best column to continue the straight &amp; then I have to move it manually which adds an extra move &amp; is very frustrating &amp; wastes time.
B008602KQI|5.0|A really good movie ~ even if you have not read the book!<br />Not for young children.  Would recommend it to be watched
B009NPKTN6|1.0|hated the lip-synced, badly acted, changed plot, that was this movie. What a waste. Russell was bad. Tom C was in a stupor. Good music didn't make it to the screen. This review is more effort than this one deserved.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I love flowers and would recommend this book to anyone who does, mainly because of the association of certain flowers with certain qualities/characteristics.  I thought the author portrayal of Victoria's struggle to make a success of her life under trying circumstances was very realistic.  I may get this one in hardcover too!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have been following the show since the initial pilot episode eight years ago.  It's one of the best shows on TV!
B007RI56NY|4.0|Great CD every new cd that they come out with I am more surprised that they are still able to have a good sound. One of the few CDs that I am able to listen to the whole CD from start to finish and not have to skip a song because i dont like it. You can tell Train tried to go with a few different sounds on this CD they have the usual Pop rock on there but they have a little country sound, mariachi band, etc.
B009B0L324|4.0|Just listened to the album yesterday.  As usual, song choices are great (nice that they included a live version of \\"Dog Eat Dog\\")!  The reason for the four stars is that the energy doesn't sound as intense as their previous live releases (\\"If You Want Blood...\\" or \\"Live\\").  The production is a little too \\"clean\\" sounding and not as raw as before.  All-in-all, this is an enjoyable collection of their classics and the Black Ice material.  Enjoyable listen!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Of course I have never seen the original show so i can really only base the story line off the movie. The story line was ok but at points you felt like it was going no where and pretty much everything that happened you expected it to happen. Johny Depp you would expect to have a great preference in the movie but he just gives a so so preference in the movie. There are random scenes in the movie it seems like they just threw in to add to the length of the movie and has nothing to do with the plot line. Having said that they overall movie was ok.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|I'm big fun of Tim Ferriss since reading 4 hour work week and I thought that he won't suprise me with anything else.<br />But his new book is taking ability to learn no matter what skill  to whole new level.<br />Simply awesome!!!
0811870413|5.0|This book overdelivers in its attempt to explain the \\"art\\" of baking one perfect loaf of bread.  I have baked and cooked for 40 some years and was enraptured when I bit into my first loaf of bread following Chad's detailed, beautiful guidance.  Those who say the book doesn't have enough recipes miss the entire point.  It is about years poured into one perfect loaf that anyone can bake at home.  I have shared this with many friends and family and all are enthralled.  Torn with a slice of cheese, thick slices of french toast with maple syrup, toasted with marmalade, dipped in olive oil...heaven in three ingredients: flour, water, salt.  The end.

B008EZVNO0|5.0|This is an incredible piece of music from one of the world's best musicians--Van proves he's still got it.  If you are a fan, you really need to have this album.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|We have this movie on DVD as well but when we found it for a great price we purchased the Blu-ray as well. This movie was meant to be seen on Blu-ray. I don't always notice a difference between the two but with this movie is was obvious. You can see so much more detail.<br /><br />If you like The Polar Express, which we think is an excellent movie and my children (4 and 2) LOVE, then get the Blu-ray! It's worth it.
B007ZCOT6C|5.0|Really enjoyed the storyline, found the characters to be believeable and well-developed. Would probably recommend 15+ based on some of the language and relationship stuff. Will definitely be checking to see if this author has anything else out!

034580404X|5.0|After hearing a lot abut these books, I sought out to buy them. I found this package of the entire Trilogy for about 28$ here in Amazon and it's a very worthwhile deal.<br /><br />This trilogy is thrilling, drawing you deeper and deeper into the reading experience.<br />I'm not a native English speaker and I've read each 600 pages volume in about three days.<br /><br />The books are from a very feminine point of view, so I guess women will enjoy it more.<br />The books are sexually explicit, so if you are too coy or too young - it's not for you.<br /><br />Enjoy Enjoy Enjoy!

B00A12VW86|5.0|DOS is an excellent progression from the band's Sept. release, UNO. The \\"action\\" is not unlike that of a Shakespearean drama in the sense that these three albums represent the three acts of a play. Let me stress that this is not a rock opera like American Idiot, or even 21st Century Breakdown.<br /><br />UNO is a great opener and hits you fast and hard. DOS progresses into the depths of the band's talent, age, musical/lyrical progression, with new twists and old favorites. It's hard to compare the albums as there is definitely a strong sense of progression. It's not always clear how it all fits together, but it works and does an excellent job of picking up right where UNO left off.<br /><br />Overall, it is a more mature album, although not all tracks represent this and there are one or two misses. Still, it is an excellent album. A lot of great guitar riffs that we've yet to hear from Armstrong. It is also evident that there was a lot of collaboration between all members of Green Day, whereas past albums can be credited more to Billie Joe.<br /><br />Great Album! Can't wait for Tre...due out in December!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008G59IBI Tre]]<br />[[ASIN:B009B50QOU ¡UNO! [Explicit]]]<br />[[ASIN:B00A12VW86 ¡DOS! [Explicit]]]

B009SIE6AA|5.0|Heck yes. I've always loved James Taylor's voice, but his drawback has been his occasionally formulaic melodies (with the exception of his masterpieces like &#34;Fire and Rain&#34; and &#34;Your Smiling Face&#34;) hold his capabilities back. This album fixes that problem by wrapping his voice around a variety of Christmas classics, and a few surprises. The obvious stand-out is &#34;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&#34;, in which Taylor perfectly encapsulates the wistful mood of the tune. My favorite, however, is his cover of Joni Mitchell's &#34;River&#34;, a great tune that is the perfect combination of Taylor's voice and Mitchell's songwritting poweress. Overall, the best Christmas album I've ever heard.<br />Period.

Exceptional storytelling and perfect pacing, especially in 1 & 2! Mature writing that had me spellbound the whole time. Still in awe that Mr. Howey is a new writer! Classic stories that will stand the test of time. Best of all, there's more to come with the Shift series! Bring on the movie/TV series!

B005K0HDGE|4.0|not spooky or scary, but full of suspense.  I liked how SK actually goes through time, not skipping months ahead just to get to 200 pages of the end result.  All of the characters aren't far fetched and I actually see myself looking to this being made a movie very soon.  Ewen McGregore as male and Anne Hathaway as the female roles.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because of its lengthy read.  I know i said I liked the &#34;not skipping ahead&#34; but it could have been done a little.  Also, I am not a typical SK reader and I know of a few references of other books he has written.  I tend not to like that as it is apperent that may have &#34;missed&#34; something somehow.  Good example is the book IT.  There is a clown reference in Derry and Bevie on the Levy.  Didnt read IT, but after having to Google it to understand WHY that was in there, it makes more sense now.  Its not the only book reference.  I'll leave it at that.
B001GJ7E9E|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the interplay between the two main characters in this movie, and Vince Vaughn adds a comedic slant that elevates the story line.  Their undeniable sexual chemistry is a sad testament of the &#34;real-life&#34; love story that played out between Pitt and Jolie while they filmed this movie.
B001GS1DS8|4.0|I liked it because it made sense in a way and was really funny at moments it'd be interesting to see a part 2 in near future to see how they evolve the characters and action scene.

1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House by Kathleen Grissom is a very popular book!  My friend Mindy recommended that I pick it up, and then the wonderful elementary teachers where I used to work are also reading it for their book club meeting today!  Even though I'm far away from my Florida school, I was happy to be invited to join them digitally.<br /><br />This novel is told from both the points of view of Lavinia and Belle, with the two women alternating chapters.  Lavinia is an Irish orphan who is taken in as a servant by a wealthy white family.  She ends up living with and working with the slaves that maintain the farm, working in the kitchen.  To her, these women and men are her only family, and she is welcomed with open arms.<br /><br />Belle is a black slave who takes Lavinia under her wing, becoming like a big sister to her.  She has troubles of her own, being the mixed race daughter of the master of the home.  Will Belle ever get her free papers?  Does she even want them?<br /><br />As Lavinia grows up, she is taken into the main house more often and accepted by the white family.  Can Lavinia find a balance among the white and black people who mean so much to her, when in fact showing loyalty to the wrong people could bring her and those she loves immense trouble?<br /><br />The Kitchen House was a fantastic read.  It reminds me a little bit of The Help by Kathryn Stockett.  Both books have whites and blacks coming together in order to be friends, be a family, and try to solve problems while hitting severe resistance.  Of course, the book is also very different.  But if you enjoyed The Help, you will also enjoy The Kitchen House!<br /><br />If you had to face the difficult choice of being free but having to leave your loved ones, possibly forever, what would you do?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book

B009G8GRX6|4.0|The 2nd Law has continued Muse's trend of encompassing many different styles and moods across a single album. This album spans early to mid-career Muse with songe like Animals and Explorers, to songs like Madness that incorporate Queen-like vocal stylings. Muse get their two-cents in the dubstep trend with Follow Me (which was co-produced by Nero), Madness and Unsustainable. Finally they close with an instrumental track to round out the ride.<br /><br />Like many old Muse fans, I would rank their discology almost exactly in chronological order with the older albums being their best work and waning from there. I was nervous to listen to this album the first time, and after the first listen through, I thought the trend was being continued. I quickly came around and feel like this is a strong step back in the right direction for Muse. I would recommend this album to anyone that has liked Muse at any point in their career.

0307743659|3.0|I never saw the movie, partly because I'm not a fan of horror, but I do like great writing, so lately I've been checking out some of Stephen King's recommended best reads. King is a great writer, let me say that, but I feel this story didn't benefit with the supernatural stuff. It works well in \\"Firestarter\\" and \\"Carrie\\" (which I enjoyed much better) but in \\"The Shining\\" it felt more ridiculous to this reader. I felt it would've been spookier without \\"the shine\\", still I was scared to read this novel when it got dark (I live alone).<br /><br />The ability to pass the shine 2000 or something miles from Colorado to Florida didn't seem plausible as well as Haloran's crazy interest in the 5yr old boy. Some things never added up well (the hedge animals). All in all I would only recommend this novel to hardcore horror fans. So far, \\"Misery\\", \\"Carrie\\" and \\"Firestarter\\" are my recommended SK reads.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I received mine and it works great. General I was looking for a light case to protect my Fire when I put it in my purse. This fits the bill perfectly. The case fits the Kindle tightly and the cover provides good protection for the screen. The stand works as advertised, holding the Fire at a good viewing angle. This is a nice understated case that does the job as advertised whithout providing a lot of bulk. I would buy it again.

0385536828|4.0|Intellectually interesting more than emotionally engaging (until, perhaps, the very last pages), Sweet Tooth tells a languid tale before taking a surprising twist that alters the reader's perspective of everything that passed before.<br /><br />In 1972, Serena Frome graduates Cambridge with an undistinguished third in maths.  On the strength of some anti-communist essays she's written and a recommendation from a history professor with whom she is having an affair, Serena is recruited to work for the British security service.  Although she's initially treated as a clerk and servant girl, her interest in modern literature draws the attention of her superiors, who are launching a new project to attract and fund young writers who reliably promote democratic ideals, as least as those ideals are envisioned by the security service.  The goal is to create a counterweight against the left-wing bent of British intellectuals without overtly influencing the content of the writing.  The project's code name is Sweet Tooth.<br /><br />Serena's first task is to vet Thomas Haley, the only writer of fiction that Sweet Tooth is considering.  Serena reads Haley's published stories, giving Ian McEwan the opportunity to tell those stories in outline form -- a sort of literary bonus for the reader, who is treated not just to McEwan's novel but to unrelated stories within the novel.  Yet the stories are also a tool to open up Serena; while Serena examines Haley's stories, the reader examines Serena.  The conclusions Serena draws from Haley's stories tell the reader as much about Serena as the stories tell Serena about Haley.<br /><br />Serena has a tendency to become ridiculously attached to men she barely knows.  Since she believes she knows Haley, having read his stories, it is in keeping with her character that she becomes obsessed with him, a process that starts before they meet.  An earlier obsession led to an unhappy affair with the professor who introduced her to the security service, a man who initially seems to play a tangential role in the novel, only to resurface in a way that forces Serena to rethink their relationship.  The need to rethink relationships is a constant in Sweet Tooth.  It happens again when Serena flirts with her superior, and still again when she becomes attached to Haley, putting her career and Haley's integrity at risk.<br /><br />Despite McEwan's customary winning prose, my initial reaction to Sweet Tooth was one of indifference.  I was never able to warm up to the character of Serena.  While that troubled me, by the novel's end I understood my reaction -- it is exactly the reaction McEwan intended.  I suppose it is a mark of literary genius that McEwan was able to fashion a character who is full of insecurities, fearful (with some justification) that she is shallow and dull, easily manipulated, politically myopic, a bit judgmental (even snobbish), and ethically challenged -- in short, a less than admirable character who, for many small reasons, isn't easy to like -- while making it possible, at the novel's end, for the reader to view the character with a sympathetic eye.  The misdirection that McEwan employs is quite remarkable.  More than that I cannot say without spoiling the surprise.<br /><br />Sweet Tooth gives McEwan the opportunity to address invention, the indispensable tool of both writer and spy.  The novel's greater theme is the cultural cold war, the indecency of governmental attempts to manipulate (however indirectly) the content of fiction, film, or journalism, and the blow to artistic integrity that results when the government promotes art for propagandistic reasons.  All of that is interesting, but it is McEwan's deft manipulation of the characters and plot that finally won me over.  While it was difficult to set aside the chilliness I felt while reading most of the novel, in the end I admired the cunning way in which McEwan structured the story.  If I could, I would give Sweet Tooth 4 1/2 stars.e, a man who initially seems to play a tangential role in the novel, only to resurface in a way that forces Serena to rethink their relationship.

B0071MQBX0|5.0|Having just seen the Broadway production of 'Phantom' for the first time, my husband and I wanted to watch it again as soon as possible. We found the Royal Albert Hall performance on On Demand and enjoyed it thoroughly, especially since facial expressions were easy to see, which is not often true of live viewing. An added attraction at the end of this DVD is the performance by Sarah Brightman and several of the erstwhile Phantoms. There is nothing we disliked. We have bought 3 copies, one to keep and two to give as gifts.

B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie is absolutely adorable, has a good message, and catchy songs. Fun, family-friendly humor, but still enough to keep an adult's attention. I'd definitely recommend it!
030758836X|3.0|After reading many reviews and raves, I succumbed to temptation and read the book.  Although it is well written, I find I have to agree with those who felt the author never did end the story.  Also, in order to really like a book, I need to like at least one of the characters.  I could not sympathize with anyone in the book.  I'm sure there must be people like these in the world, but I did find them not very believable.  Should this be re-classified as fantasy?

B0091LS07E|4.0|Alicia Keys returns after a three-year hiatus with 2012's anticipated [[ASIN:B0091LS07E Girl On Fire]], the follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:B002R0F3Q2 The Element of Freedom]]. Girl On Fire may be characterized by its numerous departures for Keys including Keys's role as a co-songwriter all songs (none written solely by herself), extension of collaboration beyond songwriting (Nicki Minaj, Maxwell, Gary Clark, Jr., and Bruno Mars), and experimental updates to her brand of R&B. Because of a more forward-thinking Keys,  Girl on Fire, though somewhat scattered, is still one of 2012's more captivating R&B efforts.<br /><br />\\"De Novo Adagio (Intro)\\" gives Alicia Keys her standard classical piano intro, something formulaic she fails to alter.  \\"Brand New Me\\" opens the effort more reserved than her past,  opting for a ballad co-written with Emeli Sand&eacute;.  Keys's performance is relaxed throughout, but grows in power towards the end.  After reaching its peak, the ballad diminishes back down with Keys closing with her signature vocal nuances.<br /><br />\\"When It's All Over\\" seeks contrast, initiating with pounding, ultra-syncopated drums. Co-written with  John Legend (and Stacy Barthe), \\"When It's All Over\\" balances 'old' and 'new'. The cut garners the distinction of being different than previously released songs by Keys, which seals its uniqueness.  Similar to the contrast of the opener, \\"When It's All Over\\" requires a couple of spins to completely appreciate it.<br /><br />\\"Listen To Your Heart\\" is produced by Rodney \\"Darkchild\\" Jerkins, who reins himself in.  The cut modern soul cues with a hint classicism via neo-soul.  Keys approaches the vocal cooly, calmly, and sultry. While it is `low key,' the heft of the impact is instantaneous, more so than the first two cuts. This is 'classy' Keys at her best.<br /><br />\\"New Day\\" shocks with Swizz Beatz's hard drums and an overall manic nature and gimmicky.  If 'contrast' is the goal of Girl On Fire, \\"New Day\\" accomplishes this task for Keys.  \\"Party people say, party people say, ay/it's a new day, it's a new day,\\" Keys sings enthusiastically on her simplest chorus in sometime. Many will love it while many will probably loathe it. None will deny it is an interesting `sound' for Keys.<br /><br />\\"Girl On Fire (Inferno Version)\\" follows, featuring Nicki Minaj (a rapper on an Alicia Keys album?). The true promo single is both hailed and scrutinized depending on who you poll, almost always because of  its 'simple' lyrics (\\"Oh, she got both feet on the ground/and she's burning it down/Oh, she got her head in the clouds/and she's not backing down...\\") or Keys vocal stretch on the chorus (\\"this girl is on fire...\\"). Ultimately, it is a cut that is a major part of the narrative.<br /><br />\\"Fire We Make\\" finds Keys duetting  with Maxwell. A neo-soul cut by all accounts,  the chemistry between the two is sound for the most part. Maxwell steals the show on his solo verse with his accurate falsetto penetrating through the production. Gary Clark, Jr. adds to the sound production his guitar playing.<br /><br />\\"Tears Always Win\\" mixes retro-soul and gospel. Thank writers  Keys, Jeff Bhasker, Bruno Mars, and Phillip Lawrence for this. \\"Tears Always Win\\" may be the cut most suited for Keys from Girl On Fire given the soulful grit she achieves, particularly on the chorus: \\"These lips are miss you, cause these lips ain't kissing you/these eyes put up a fight/but once again these fears always win...\\"<br /><br />\\"Not Even The King\\" diminishes the 'energy,' finding Keys opting for a more 'stripped' setting, even stripping beyond the first Emeli Sand&eacute; co-write (\\"Brand New Me\\"). Keys performs this acoustic number well, even if it lacks the oomph of better, more notable offerings.<br /><br />\\"That's When I Knew\\" showcases Keys's dedication to her lover - obviously Swizz Beatz.  \\"That's when I knew/I fell in love/that's when I knew you were the one/that's when I knew you stole my heart away from me...,\\" she sings on the chorus. Keys takes a more restrained approach to this `ode', while Mary J. Blige was more rhythmic in her ode to husband Kendu (\\"I Love You (Yes I Du)\\").<br /><br />\\"Limitedless\\" is the most shocking cut, slated as reggae/tropically-tinged number.  Another contrast, \\"Limitedless\\" is the least successful as the gimmickry seems a bit far-fetched for the soulful singer/songwriter.<br /><br />\\"One Thing\\" has co-writer Frank Ocean's fingerprint all over it, even finding Keys employing a lovely falsetto (for lack of better wording) that shines.  Moody in the vein of  modern `Bohemian' R&B, \\"One Thing\\" atones somewhat for the gimmicky \\"Limitedless.\\"<br /><br />Closing cut \\"101\\" is the final of three cuts written with Emeli Sand&eacute;.  Keys remains emotionally connected. A manic embedded outro finds Keys at perhaps her most assertive shouting \\"Hallelujah, Hallelujah, kicked in the door...\\" etc. The production reflects Keys's emotional resolved, with pummeling clapping drums.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B0091LS07E Girl On Fire]] receives my seal of approval.  It is different from all of Keys's previous albums, both positively and negatively.  These days Keys seems just to allude to the 'glory days' of neo-soul rather than embrace it full-fledged as she did during the movement's dominance. That both blesses and curses Keys's most recent releases. Regardless, There are lots of good pieces on Girl On Fire, even when it falls short of the glory of her best releases of the past.he chorus.

B000I9VZJ8|5.0|I thought this movie was so dumb after the first time I watched it, but every single time I've watched it since then, I've adored it. Cute and funny, cheesy and silly, weird and wonderful.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After seeing lots of recommendations for this series, I finally picked it up and read through it over a week or so of commuting. This is just great, and doesn't read like a self-published book. The characters are compelling, the world is consistent, and the technology felt possible to me. It's hard to say much more without spoiling the wonder.<br />This collection is easily worth the price - try it, you'll like it.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark offers no fancy stuff here, what he offers is plain old talk like you were sitting with your friend and he is sharing situations that offered him insight, well worth the read
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Affordable, entertaining, good quality. I'm pleased with my purchase. Clear images, good sound, fast loading time, and a good movie.
B009AMANH4|4.0|In the very short 2 1/2 hours that you spend watching a brief portion of the greatest test in our nation's history, the impact comes not from gory scenes of battlefields but from a script, a director, and a cinematographer who catch the most intense instances of pain, memory, and hope in the faces of its splendid actors.  I wanted to stay in the theater and watch it a second time once the applause of the audience died down.  I cannot wait to purchase it so that I can watch it again and again.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|Affordable, entertaining, good quality. I'm pleased with my purchase. Clear images, good sound, fast loading time, and a good show.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its amazing!I'm a huge mlp fan and the only way u cant spend coins is collecting blue stars and then princess celestia gives u money
B0027MJU00|4.0|Good read. Somewhat gritty with twists and turns that keep you guessing whodunit. Hard to put down with an ending that doesn't leave you with unanswered questions.
0671027387|5.0|I am a huge fan of this author.  This book is so different than any other of his books.  I loved it.
B008HK3XU4|1.0|it stopped turning the kindle on & off after  a couple of weeks.<br />of course the 9 yr old who uses it failed to tell me and now I'm 4 days past being able to return it. I will go to Best Buy next time.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|I've seen Amadeus many times so I was able to spot the added scenes, there were many, you will not be disappointed if you are watching this your second or third time.  Nice surprise for me, was not expecting so many additional scenes.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|If you love T. Swift and her angsty lyrics, this is the album for you. If you have 2 X chromosomes, there is no way you will not like this album.
B0058YPLA2|2.0|I was happy until episode five when the searchers learned a boy was in a mine because they found a candy bar he had dropped.  (Note to network writers: boys don't loose whole candy bars out of a backpack; these things are important to them.)  This contempt for the audience is what makes network shows second rate compared to, say, HBO.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the second best virson of Minecraft ever!!!!!! If there were more than 5 stars, I would give this game the top star rating possible.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Charlize Theron is wonderful as the evil queen.  Beautiful cinematography and location.  As usual, Kristen Stewart is a bit flat, but overall, this is one of the better attempts at Snow White.
1577311760|5.0|The tapes are great to listen to while shaving etc. to reinforce the reading!  I find this helpful to reinforce the book.
0385535147|5.0|While I ALWAYS enjoy the escape while I submerge myself in Grisham's story lines, this one was particularly captivating.  As the sister of someone currently serving in a Federal Prison Camp(and a frequent visitor of the facility) I can certainly attest to the accurate detail of  the Camp life and of the nuances of an inmate's mindset.  I do not know to whom he turned for information---but in this book he nailed Malcolm's general experience while incarcerated!  Kudos for that accuracy and for turning it into a fun read!
B003QO8TDC|5.0|Simple story line, but what a great movie, great dancing and great music.  Makes you want to go out and conquer the world or go after your dream.
