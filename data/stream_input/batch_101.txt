B00IQX75BU|5|Just a great product, couldn't be more pleased. Arrived before expected time, rates great, washed great, comfortable, what more could you ask for. Fit is perfect. Very happy with these as well since I ended up ordering about six from different distributer. Will order this again if the quality holds. I like the ones with the panel behind the ties and all bus one of the ones I ordered had that. The last ones I ordered didn't and wasn't sure about ordering them again, thus ordering from three different distributors. Very pleased.
B00K8PLJW0|5|Great snowsuit for the little one and very easy to wash (already washed the jacket twice)!!
B00WVNXPP6|5|Just a little small,  other than that i love it
B00375DHFK|3|i like this camo alot but my only issue is that it came too big. i use it for airsoft so i guess its good when hit cause it doesnt hurt as much..
B00O8WPXS0|4|These scrubs fit true to size. Scrubs usually run large and you may be tempted to go down a size... But I highly recommend sticking to the size you normally buy in REGULAR clothes if you want it to be fitted. However, if you want it to fit more comfortably (like how scrubs should fit..), buy a size up. I'm a petite girl, 5'1&#34; and 100 lbs and I got the XXS which actually fits perfectly and looks great but it fits a little too well. The length, shoulders, and sleeves are perfect but the bust area is slightly tight which makes it a little hard to take off and put on (I'm a 32C). I should've stuck to my true size of XS but I figured all scrubs are always oversized and usually XS is still huge on me. If you are a bustier woman, definitely size up because it's a bit on the snug side under the bust area.<br />Overall, I adore the scrubs. Great material, so comfortable, and very flattering!! Next time I will be buying XS for this brand for tops, though. But the pants in XXS fit perfectly!
B003HLCH6O|5|I have a small waist, at 31-32, and I had to re-order a large, as the medium was skin tight.  The large are tight, but if work out, then you'll like these, as they are not like speedos, but like tight boxers, and my girlfriend loves them as they fit great.  I would recommend a size larger than you are, if you are fit, otherwise, maybe two sizes.
B003BIHY6Q|3|The Holster Is Missing From The Set So I'm Not Happy About Having To Purchase One When It Clearly States It Is Included.
B0067LQX6G|4|This was just what I expected I will order from this company again
B00DPEOBEE|5|all good, thanks
B00AQMR5DM|5|I cannot imagine how beautiful this scarf is until it is on my hand. It is soft, it is light and it seems to flow like the water. My friend just loves it.<br />In addition, I made a bargain buying this at amazon.com &#60;3
B002SZSV92|4|The jacket is great! The vest is cheap but we will dye it darker to fit our needs. However, I do need to make clear to anyone ordering this, it SMELLS! It smelled horrible like tunafish. I am not sure if its the packaging or the dye in the fabric, but the stench when we pulled it out was crazy. have now sprayed with Febreze 4 times and hung outside to air out, will be fine by Halloween.
B00LHU6PAG|5|i like it!
B0028NW1TK|4|So far it has worked great in keeping purses off the ground.  The one my wife received had a huge gash in the top with a chunk of the resin missing which is annoying but not a huge deal.  She has not had any issues with the hanger not fitting on the width of any tables yet however there have been a few close calls.  If you put the purse on the hook before attaching it to the table it makes it easier to get the hook on the thicker tables.  It would be nice if the hook swiveled to change the direction the purse hangs so that it is parallel to the people instead of perpendicular where it hits people's knees at tighter sittings.
B00OFF50BA|5|Nice product.  I love it!
B00FXHA7RQ|1|These leggings are beautiful but extremely small. Made to fit a very thin child-maybe.
B002X78T42|5|I dislike undershirts or t-shirts that are close to my neck. Makes me feel like I am choking. Over the years the V-neck undershirts seem to have gotten less and less of a &#34;V&#34;. These undershirts have a nice, deep V which is great. They are soft and comfortable. Time will tell how well they hold up but so far I am happy.
B00K00WHSS|1|Way to small.
B0010ELZFY|5|I purchased the coat as my Mom's Christmas gift...I shop early!! I love it and it fits me perfectly! She has talked about owning a cashmere coat for years and we finally found just the right one. She will love it I am sure!
B00KBIW16C|3|legs are very long!!!
B007CFJXPE|5|Great price for this multipack of socks.  These are my go-to socks because they fit well and don't bunch up.  They are also easy to match when sorting laundry.
B00AHOQCSI|1|We have several Gerber sleep 'n plays for boys and I thought the yellow would be a nice change.  However, the unisex is very wrongly sized for boys.  This item in a  6-9 month size is the same as a boys Gerber sleep 'n play that is 3-6 months, which is the size my baby is already out of.  Waste of money - I'll stick with boy specific garments from Gerber.
B001FD1BA4|5|Anytime I find something on sale for half the price I'm worried there's a reason it's on sale. My grandmother passed away and my 4 year old som needed something to wear to her funeral and with everything going on I didn't have time to run to the mall and find him something so I took a gamble and ordered this jacket and I'm so glad I did. This is a good quality jacket. The material is not too thin. It's made well and fits the way I expected a 4T jacket to fit. Some black material seems to be a magnet for fuzz and lint and this jacket doesn't have that issue. Also it doesn't wrinkle easily. I had it in my suitcase folded in half on its side for 2 days and didn't need to iron it before he wore it. I would highly recommend this jacket to anyone looking for one. Since purchasing it my son has worn it multiple times to church and a funeral. I think you could dress this jacket up or down.
B00KZJMGUS|5|These jeans are perfect! They're my favorite jeans, period.
B0008EO0EK|5|These are the first pair of LEE Jeans I've purchased since the mid 70's. Everything about this new pair has not changed since then. The Quality and Softness is still the same. They Look Great and are Still as Comfortable as I remember. The Shipping from Amazon was Super Fast!!! Ordered them on a Wed, Got them on a Fri.
B000V9FNWU|5|I thought this was an excellent gift for my son that travels a lot.  He didn't like it, but it fit perfectly...he doesn't like anything I buy him. I should stop trying to give him things.
B00KT8VBJ2|5|Amazing jacket, great fit
B00DN1EFZE|5|Received as described. fits as should.
B0069VD4GG|4|Nice goggles. Not top of the line but is still a solid set. I have no problem with them.
B000T360Z2|5|Eureka I found it!  I had been wearing the Minimizer bra by Lilyette but it was discontinued, this is the closest bra to that one if you are looking for it!<br /><br />This is what you need to know:<br />- This bra is sheer in the front, so if you wear a silk blouse, you can't see bulges from lace or other additions to the cup that tend to poke out in your clothes<br />- the cup is not padded, however, it's thick enough so that if it's cold, you don't have your nipples poking out<br />- the cup is very bountiful - meaning that the side of my DDD breasts are fully covered and none of my breasts are spilling out of the cup<br />- I take a DDD and there are three hooks in the back, so I feel it's sturdy<br />- This is hugely comfortable!  I sometimes wear it to bed as it's more comfortable for me than going bra-less<br />- The straps are adjustable all the way to the front of the bra from the back (I've had other bras, that I didn't like) that you could only adjust the side straps up to the tops of your shoulders, and not take it all the way to the front of the bra<br />- The design and other additions to the bra are MINIMAL, so you don't get poking out of your blouse<br />- This is a FULL COVERAGE bra, so even with DDD cups, I don't have cleavage that shows if my blouse buttons too low<br />- I do not jiggle when I walk in this bra as I did in others that claimed to be minimizers (Spanx)<br />- The best comparison with this bra is the Prima Dona bra, I am trying both out on my 38 DDD breasts, I tried the Spanx, but it's too jiggly<br /><br />In short: I recommend this if you have large breasts, don't want cleavage to show, want your breasts FULLY COVERED, and do not want to jiggle!<br /><br />Marcy
B0026N9SI4|3|Didn't read that it was a skinny tie so was surprised when I recieved it.  It was my mistake, but it was still it nice pattern and made the  tie into a  suit scarf.
B001JE50D8|5|Bought this tie as a gift for my boyfriend. He got it in 4 business days and loves it. :) It came quickly and is exactly what it looks like in the photo... just awesome.
B00CAAQVI8|4|The jeans are a bit baggy/loose, but that makes them very comfortable, which was what I was looking for in the first place, so I am quite happy with them. I just hope they don't shrink too much after being washed.
B008K7HCBU|5|My husband asked for a Stormy Kromer for Christmas. I honestly didn't know what one was but discovered one on Amazon, researched it, (which I always do before buying) and got it for him. I measured his head for size and it fits perfect. The quality is top notch.
B007USOH2C|5|I got these for my friend for Christmas because she is a FOX fanatic. They look super cute on her and she even wears them when she goes riding.
B002CVGEMS|4|Fits perfect.
B004ASFMM4|1|It is aggravating to have to go through the hassle of returning merchandise because a large that is purported to be a 42&#34;/44&#34; is not! At least LaLeela gets its right.
B00KO6GIW4|5|Perfect crop. It looks great with my navy stripped maxi shirt. The built in shelf bra is very comfortable and keeps everything covered up!
B00IYDBPIG|4|Love it
B00T6HXWQW|4|Good sheen, tight fitting underwear. Since cottonfield went out of business( they made the best organic underwear) I have had to try the PACT and bgreen brands. The PACT fit and look great and have a pee hole. The bgreen fit and look great as well but are Made in the USA and have no pee hole. The PACT and bgreen are made of thin, soft material while the cottonfield were made of thick material which made them last a very long time. The construction and material used for PACT and bgreen make me wonder how long they will last and for the price they better last a long time.
B00VF3XSUA|5|I have gotten so many compliments on this shirt. Everybody wants to know where I got it.
B00L02V5YM|3|Lace is not soft and very fragile.  Ripped it the first time I tried it on. Not worth it.
B003B39HIY|5|This sweatshirt is unbelievably soft inside and made of a wonderful material. I got the black color which is more like a dark heather gray, which I also love. I highly recommend this item, in fact I'm considering the pants as well.
B00MFB8CB6|4|Great looking board shorts, just wish it came with mesh lining.
B007PCQ4WY|4|my granddaughter loved this and she can wear it in school. great look and price. there is just nothing more to be said
B007REB0UQ|5|I was alittle concerned with the cage but once I attached the feather piece...it all came together!! It is a beautiful piece, cant wait to wear it in a couple of weeks!!
B008RNLQJG|5|I really like the different ways you can wear the scarf. The cotton material is<br />good quality and was washable with no dramas.  I use it on a daily basis<br />as it is great on windy days when you can configure the multiple head<br />dresses to make.
B00JD710CS|5|Great all around, Perfect fit! I'M 5'7 And weigh 115 pound, i ordered a size large and it fits perfect!
B000E2D2GS|4|Nice shirt for the price. Bought this shirt to replace one just like it that iv had for a long time. Faces on back were a lighter color/shade then my old shirt, not a big deal IMO.
B0016LKA84|5|Fits well. I had to have help to put it on. Doesn't fold in on itself like some cheap corsets do. I like the fact that you can change the ribbon out. And, its very shiny in person if you're looking for that.
B004U7UBLC|5|Not the best quality ever butthis wig was used for Halloweena nd a few other times and held up!! Perfect for Velma Dinkley from Scooby Doo!
B00GSV53YI|5|Beautiful
B000G3HNGA|2|My only suggestion to anyone looking to purchase this bra is know your measurements and how to convert them.  I followed the online measurement guidelines and when I received the bra it was too large. In addition, the garters which were to accompany the order were not included. I opened and searched the package thoroughly for them.  Alas, I ended up returning the bra, although I had hoped it was just what I needed for my upcoming wedding.  Very disappointed.
B000WVEA7G|5|color was perfect. holds more credit cards than i expected. small size fits perfect in inside pocket or rear pocket.  grade of product is excellent.  and price very reasonable.
B008AQD5GW|5|Stylish enough for appearance,tough enough for a hard days work . This is a repeat item for me. Extremely Durable
B0038LGW1E|5|Finely a plain white T-shirt, heavy duty fabric, large enough in both directions and comfortable. Shipping was prompt and packaged good enough.
B008293S5U|4|I was pleased with the costume.The material is pretty thin but overall a good costume for the price. I ordered a small As I am 5'1 and have a 26 inch waist but it still fit a little snug.
B003IISPNU|1|Buyers beware.  The package comes with a VERY small piece that covers ONLY the right eye.  The nose & mouth sections in the photograph are not included, although this isn't stated in the product description.
B00DRORG0S|5|THE MATERIAL WAS REALLY GOOD QUALITY
B004SE228M|4|Bought them cause most stores don't carry 34 to 36. And that's what I need sizewise. Quality is fine and price was good.
B00AA02LHA|5|very nice
B00D8DY2QY|5|Perfect and good quality.
B004QF0TJ2|4|Uncomfortable but they still sorta do the job of keeping your feet warm. It's weird... im sort of conflicted on whether I'm satisfied or not. They just seem a little on the cheap thin side. Definitely not wat I expected
B00E8GREGK|5|Great tacky sweater!!
B00E8CMD7Y|1|The quality of this shirt is poor. It has a double layer of fabric around the neck that you can see and it ends in a straight line across your chest that is noticeable. the fabric is thin and there are no loops for the belt. The belt is bright white and doesn't really look like it matches the shirt.
B008N997MW|5|Nice tie and decent quality! XL
B000686I6G|5|I bought this robe for my wife over two years ago and it's still going strong.  A few loose threads here and there, but that can be blamed on our cats.  Probably the nicest robe I have ever seen first hand, better than the uber comfy robes I see in posh hotels.
B00HYXWFIQ|4|Pretty but more padding than I like.
B006TM0ON6|5|Great gloves for kids who live in cold climates with lots of snow!
B001OCKB34|2|I usually like champion sports bras but this one is very large between the shoulders so when I put one on my shoulder blades  rub a blister into my skin because the material is too wide in between my shoulders. Other than that I love the reversible feature and the actual feel of the material itself..
B00MGF00BG|5|Fits good
B008AT4MSO|5|This long sweater is beautiful! Shipping was fast,  and arrived in sealed ziplock style bag. If you're still debating, get this sweater!
B00C88FF8O|5|As described and arrived on time
B006L3V7F2|5|If you are even looking at this product, it's probably because you wear flats, don't always want to wear them barefoot and are looking for another solution.<br />I've tried other liners before and they either 1) slip off or 2) dig into my skin. These are the first I've tried that I've ever worn more than once - they actually work.<br />The liners fit my foot perfect (I wear a 7.5 and ordered the small/medium) and the rubber on the heel helps grip it to stay in place. The elastic has never caused any sort of pain.<br />You have to have the right style of shoe for these to fit without peeking out - but it'll work for the majority of flats. Spend an extra couple seconds when putting them on to adjust the toes and the rubber gripping and they'll stay in place through almost anything.
B007015K66|5|nice
B004S6NAPO|5|Love it
B008R6U2I4|4|It has a good comfortable fit.  I will be buying more of them soon.  I recommend checking Hanes sizing guide to ensure a good fit.
B00HF6GDYE|2|Frickin huge
B007T4S8OU|5|This costume was perfect for my 1 yo daughter. She looked absolutely adorable and everyone commented on how great the costume was. It comes with the big pumpkin outfit and the hat so child will likely need to buy tights and a long sleeve shirt to go under it, but I would definitely recommend it!
B00JLDLT7A|4|Very cute but a bit on a smaller side!
B00L3EMOAG|5|The product was as described.
B00GM0T2V0|5|With a great sense of humor and love for running, my friend loved this shirt! Havent washed it yet, so may shrink a bit but was decent size small, should be great! print on front is awesome
B00JE4YRXY|5|This hoodie is perfect!, Fits just the way i wanted which is baggy, the colors are phenomenal and its SOOO warm! My boyfriend steals in constantly, definitely reccomend!
B00PICL23O|3|Cheaply made, but i guess you get what you pay for.
B001JTC428|5|LOVE this hat. The older and more abused it gets the better. Bought one for a guy at my gym because he mentioned liking it. He LOVES it. Have had mine for 3-4 years
B00PW3A1FO|3|The item looked really nice, but it was definitely too small. I ordered a medium (32-34 waist) and it probably was a size 30. The shorts were snug around my thighs as well.
B00ESMSCWO|3|it is so tight, and apparently you must wear it for about 12 hrs...that's way too much time for me to struggle breathing but it is really well made and quality materials!
B00ZPI5LV0|5|Fits perfect
B0014F50L4|4|Through no fault of the product manufacturer, I'm almost 40 and have no business wearing fishnet leg warmers. No, not even to an 80's throwback party. The material and the top cuffs are really soft and comfortable, though, so I'm going to wear them like fingerless gloves (with the top band on my upper arm and my thumb poking through the fishnet at the bottom), which is still retro but a little more appropriate for this old lady.
B00K758IAM|5|So pretty
B005EJ6KME|5|Fits great. Feels great. Great price! No complaints about this shirt. Would definitely order again from this seller.  I like the slim fit and the softness of this shirt. Definitely glows in the dark.
B005UALYJG|4|I am a long Lowepro user.  I have waist bag I've been using for 14+ years that was enough when I used to carry one body and 2 lenses. It has lasted many miles (has been all over Europe and still looks great).  Nowadays I carry a body, 3 lenses plus phone, keys, and wallet.  My equipment has gotten bigger too!  You know you are spending too much money on lenses when your filter sizes go up from 58mm to 77mm.  Anyway,  This is a great compact bag for daily quick trips.  I was able to fit my Canon 7D with the 17-55 f2.8 + hood attached,  a Canon 55-250mm lense, and a Canon 85mm 1.8.  I still have space for my wallet, keys, phone a I could probaly either fit a flash or a Tamron 90mm macro If I really need too. I can add spare memory cards but not on the intended space (since my 7D + lense is already makes a tight fit).   Very happy with the purchase.
B00C85JMJU|5|My husband really liked the styling of this sweater.  The color and quality are very nice.  We will be keeping our eye out for more styles from this designer.
B00JFKTPRU|4|very quite
B00505DRBY|4|it was for my kid and he loves it
B00HWUDRHE|4|I bought these for canoe camping. I haven't tried them out in the field yet, but they seem to provide adequate coverage and I'm able to move easily in them. The only thing I really wish they had is zippered pockets (or even better, cargo pockets!), because I can tell that the side pockets aren't deep enough to be secure in a canoe. The back pocket zippers, but it won't be comfortable to sit for hours in a canoe on whatever is stored in the back pocket.
B006QXPZBO|5|My fiance loved it!  He asked for hoodies for Christmas so he got tons of hoodies and this was his favorite.  It looks nicer than the usual black, blue, or grey hoodie.  Oh and its really soft.
B00HNA8O0I|4|Looks like pic except its kind of like a crop top but its really cute!
B00FZHFLYS|5|He is very happy with them and says they are his most comfortable pair of jeans.
B006MRNMFU|5|I HAD MORE FUN WITH THIS COSTUME THAN I HAVE HAD IN A LONG<br />TIME,  MY GRANDKIDS WERE AMAZED TO SEE THEIR 74 YR OLD PAPA<br />LOOKING SO SPIFFY IN MY BATMAN OUTFIT.
B00LGR52SG|5|Love the style...true to size for 5.7 and 160.
B009T1SXPU|3|I bought these to match a bra. They are quite tine and i feel them falling down and exposing my bum when i wear them with jeans
B00K5OXQC0|5|thanks
B001N1C8ZA|5|Quality product fast shipping and item as described! highly recommended if you want your little man get super! you wont regret the item.
B00VC7V3X8|5|Absolutely love this tunic.  Fits as expected- material is great.  Another great Neon Buddha product.
B005IQT7NM|5|The frames are great and much better than any others I have seen
B00LE3NO46|5|I just ordered another one like this. It is a great suit for the hot tub, It does not hold a lot of water and dries fast.
B00BVHCM9I|5|Light weight. Dries fast. Easy on and off. Packs tight. Bought this for a cruise and loved it for that. Someone suggested it would make a great summer weight nightie and I think I will buy some more for that purpose. Very comfy feeling.
B007FULXFY|5|I recently purchased two Red Cap Shop Coats.  Both fit well (company provides excellent sizing chart).  I have<br />worn Red Cap Shop Coats for years.  No problem recommending this product to anyone who is looking for a<br />shop coat and the right price point.  This review covers both coats that I purchased.
B00LCSZT6O|5|Went up a size and glad I did.
B004BAEP3I|5|Great
B00ARDD6PG|5|Love the colors! Good quality.
B00EEDKDFQ|5|My husband loves these shorts
B00JHVTOOQ|3|As the other reviewers state, the hair clip that comes with the dress was Hello Kitty, not Peppa Pig. But I was expecting that after reading the reviews. I got size 3/4 for my daughter who just started wearing 2T clothes and it fits her well, with a little bit of room to grow. The dress has held up very well over the last few weeks, considering my girl is a total tomboy and is rough with her clothes and has only wanted to wear this dress pretty much every day! Shipping took a few weeks.
B0085IGXQE|5|I was very happy with my purchase, but I was interested in purchasing some other items of the same brand but couldn't because of shipping restriction. That really suck, I like a quality item at a reasonable price. Thanks amazon
B00CB2KZUK|5|Love it!  I'm petite. 5'2&#34; and wear a size 4 petite. This is slightly to large but I can wear it. I am going to try to shrink it in the dryer. Great fabric. Great print. Great quality. You cannot see thru this fabric.
B00VDSGQUQ|5|i made a good choice and I'm happy.
B0007QN5R2|5|Have had these for some time and as they wear out try to find them at the store I usually get them and they did not carry the size any more...love Amazon for having them and my size..
B00AOCBJ9K|5|Cute! Fast shipping too
B001H0FTR6|3|I ordered silver tabs I returned this products this is good quality but I ordered silver tabs and I 560's & 569's
B00AHTYZ6E|5|I really like this t-shirt,the quality is nice,the print is super cool and it fits just right ( for a 7 year old).<br />Our kid,now in love with wolves really likes this shirt!<br />I think is awesome!!!!
B003KGIZ4O|4|i had high expectations for this robe, but it fit large and wasn't that impressive, i do like the hood option though
B001SN7Q1Y|5|the shirt is great in every way. The graphics are first class, and the fabric is high quality. The label says the brand is &#34;Anvil&#34; and it seems to be of high quality. The fit is perfect as an XL.
B00BXX2CF4|5|Gave for baby shower gift. Such a darling outfit. Excellent quality. Super soft. Vibrant colors. Terrific price. I like getting something practical yet unique and I find that here. Very happy.
B00IDHFZHA|5|I'm very please with these pants. They are made well and are very comfortable. I will definitely be buying more.
B0081CXNVM|5|I wear it with a strapless bra...looks exactly how I thought it would and just so ya know I'm not am size 2 and it still looks good!
B0034L1MYK|5|The best thing of this hat is to shape whatever you like. Make brim large at the beach or crush to make it small in town. Nice shape and color.
B009ANIELU|5|cosey,keeps you nice and warm...suggestion wash in cold water and hang dry to avoid any shrinkage. nice to wear on those cold nights...
B00D7P9NRQ|3|I wanted to order these. It gives the sizes but does not give the option to Select a size. One size for Adults but has (s,m,l,xl) Doesn't help without being able to select what I want. The contact number for the seller, Cornerstone, is NOT helpful!! Tried calling twice and nothing. It sounds as someone answers but still nothing.
B00QT8MJ3I|5|Great buy
B008ZHSU1Q|5|LOVE IT!
B0017TO090|5|This shawl is just as pretty as its picture.  I was very pleased with the quality and the price was great!  Delivery was also very quick.  The length was perfect and the lace detail is very pretty.
B000E96AQK|3|Doesn't hold buckle well
B00PUVTVWW|4|Very nice
B00HYV5VG6|5|The vest is so cute!
B00960SZPW|5|My granddaughter loved it!
B00XC3YGXO|5|Fits perfectly
B00BC5YQ8O|4|Really love it very comfortable just a tad bit large at top but not bad. I am a size 6 and small in the bust maybe that's why it's big. I am 5'11\\" and it is floor length in kitten heels . Great quality ! Can't wait to wear it to the Mardi Gras ball.<br />I wore the dress to the ball it was a hit so many compliments !!! Very comfortable goegeous and pleased. That extra space at top did not make that big of deal however if I had time I would have gotten top altered .
B008MPV97I|5|I had a turquoise belt buckle and needed a leather belt strap for it.  This &#34;BS-40 Vintage Full Grain Leather Belt Strap&#34; was perfect!
B00UHGFDIG|5|I bought this for my wife. The fit and material were excellent.
B00LP6BSTU|5|A very lovely dress and the fit was perfect.
B00K5QWXQS|4|I'm 5'7, approx. 135-140 lbs. B36 cup, and I purchased a small.  It fits perfectly.  I like the material, I can tell it is made well.  nice Rolling Stones shirt to dress up or down....
B00JSILI0G|1|I order a M and this dress feels like XL
B0084Y99LA|4|Cute shirt, nothing too special. My son wears a 2T and some 3T, so I bought the 3T. It fits like a 2T so size up!
B007ZN3WCS|1|I'm a big fan of Rafaella's curvy fit -- it's one of the few brands that sell curvy fit pants on Amazon.  I ordered this item and received a &#34;classic&#34; rather than &#34;curvy&#34; fit.  I returned it, and received yet another &#34;classic&#34; fit, so I gave up and reported it as incorrectly described.<br /><br />I took a look at Rafaella's website and could not find this pant in a curvy fit, so I'm fairly certain it's a labeling mistake on Amazon's part.  Curvy buyers beware.
B00A2YR6VA|2|I usually buy hoodies in an XL to comensate for cloths underneath. This was too small even for an XL. Seller had no 2xl in stock. After the first wash, some of the black ink washed out leaving a faint red showing through. However, after three washes and hang out to dry then tumble dry no heat with fabric softener balls, this thing is comfy!
B002DYOI2W|5|I get lots of compliments while wearing this hat. It's comfortable and breathes very well. It's made of a nylon mesh material that you can almost see through.
B003ILZ1FW|4|I really needed a brown pair of shorts and these fit the bill.  They fit like I hoped and were very comfortable.  They are quite retro and reminds of the 1970's.
B004WKTI2A|5|I bought bigger than what I need but I like the extra room.  Very comfortable.  Noticed little shrinkage after washing
B00IL6ZL7C|1|The elastic that went around the hand stretched out the first time she tried it on and looked terrible! It never regained it's shape. So it just looked weird and she didn't wear it.
B00826PQCG|5|I really love it!, is just what you can see it in the photo. nice material, excellent style. it fit very well
B00IUGQ0RS|4|It's tricky when you have a son who's alllllmost in men's sizes but can fit into some XL boys, too.  My guy is tall for his age (5'1&#34; in fifth grade) so the problem I run into with kids' sizes is that T-shirts like this can be too short to be worn for long.<br /><br />There are different shapes out there for t-shirts like this.  Some are long and narrow, some short and blocky (wide), some huge all over.  This shape, after washing, is wide and somewhat short.  Great if your child is average height and a little bit husky (pretty generous for husky here).  Not so great if your son is on the tall side.  This won't last long for us before it's too short and rides up too often.  On a positive note, the graphic is really nice and well done.  Very casual and understated - doesn't look or feel like a stiff new shirt and the quality of the fabric is nice.  Looks better in person than in the pic.
B007WA4CQ4|3|I like the overall look of this dress, the cinch is very cute and the dress fits me perfectly. The only problem I have is that the built in slip is a bit too short. The dress itself comes right above my knee (I'm 5'8\\"), but the slip is a good 6 inches shorter, barely covering my butt! Since the dress is see through like the picture I will probably wear something underneath. The material is not the best quality, but it is acceptable. The slip is made of satin and is very stretchy, which I like.
B00CIPHXSM|5|Very cute tami top! As worn by Elena Gilbert in TVD!
B00IXNUPOW|1|Too flimsy bends
B002GHC2RE|5|Great coat, I wish the width of the fabric of the zipper was a little wider, difficult to zip, however the Velcro fasteners work just fine!
B00OUO75SM|3|This is bright and beautiful...a little bigger than anticipated.  Disappointed on stitching being loose around the edges.
B008F5DM02|5|Excellent!!!
B00GR8VQ48|4|Product was received in perfect condition in a reasonable time frame. The product was exactly as what was shown to be and fit perfectly.
B00AZF50U0|5|Loved the fit and look of these jeans.  Can't wait to wear them.  Would recommend them to anyone.  Was unsure about the length but turned out to be great.
B00E00638Y|4|Good shirt for 10 bucks. I'm an athletic build ex military and this shirt is cut just right.  Has some logos that I like and others that don't move me. Kinda generic  and durability is yet to be determined.
B0076ZZ6YM|4|These are great little hats for the price. I used them as prizes for our stick horse race and the kids loved them. Thanks
B00AZC7WWM|4|excellent.
B003Z04YHW|5|Just what I needed to give as a gift- nothing disappointing, product was exactly as expected and depicted, good packaging
B00EVDMBGI|3|Way small! I got a large and will probably let my daughter steal it from me. Lovely vest, not realistic sizing.
B006SWGQM0|2|Not the same as purchased in dept. store.  Will return shortly.
B00DYZHF3S|5|The dress is beautiful and my daughter loves it.
B0082JO1NI|5|Great
B00IZ0BSCG|4|The only problem was thats a little smaller than normal medium. But just barely and it still fits.
B00NHO2B4Y|4|Good product
B00FFKZAP0|4|thank you
B00KDY989W|5|Great
B001KALKCQ|3|Cozy, a bit tight between the fingers. Ymmv, my hands are big.
B00SBSZDNW|4|I bet Amazon let me post this review because it's 4 stars. Overall the shirt is lightweight and well made. It does run big to let other buyers know.
B00GREQCZA|5|Cute top.
B00FD16YWO|4|Fabric is very waterproof but not very breathable.
B00ME0Z4C8|5|Cute little jacket.
B0009MZW2A|5|Perfect for long hikes and walks. These sox are padded for comfort. They last forever. Top quality and worth the price.
B00B8VA0QY|5|Excellent fit and good coverage for a &#34;balcony&#34; bra. High sides provide good lateral support. I was afraid the padding would make me look bigger than the 36DDD I already am, but no! And to top everything off, it has a very sexy look. The first time I wore it, it was a bit stiff, but that went away after the first hand wash. Also, I had to adjust the straps (make them longer) so that the sides would not dig into my armpits. I bought the matching panty, and it makes a wonderfully cute underwear &#34;outfit.&#34; Yes, the lace texture at the top of the cups can show through garments that fit very close to the body, but I just use another bra when I wear one of those. I bought a Freya balcony bra at the same time, and I was highly disappointed with that one. I will start looking into this brand more often now!
B00LCS0A3Q|3|My size is between medium and large. There was not enough give in the material to wear them. Another waste of money. Probably would have enjoyed a proper fit.
B00PP2TRWK|2|Fits as expected but looks cheep.
B00HYU0Z3Q|5|My granddaughter loved it. Light and airy and perfect for summer.
B00KZD9NNM|5|My granddaughter loved the outfit.
B00AO2H9XA|4|I got this for my daughter's baby blessing and I am very happy with it.  Soft material, cute design, and it doesn't look like a christening dress.  Price was excellent too.
B004OWKYUG|5|Perfect fit and material is not flimsy thin--solid quality and good color pigmentation. The thermal print isn't too strong, but thermal-like enough. I like that it's not full synthetic fabric, but has enough cotton to render it soft and durable. I bought one in the eggplant purple color, too. It hugs the body well and is very comfortable to wear with a comfortable, unobtrusive neckline.
B00KOF6B8Q|4|Like it but a little big.
B00ENOS84O|5|Good quality N good price
B00RMK4RYG|5|Awesome jacket. Great material. Fits perfectly. Can be worn with yoga pants as workout clothes or dressed up a bit with jeans. Amazing customer service.
B00AEU4NN6|5|Very well made and cute as can be.  Love it.  If you are a fozzie bear lover like my daughter is you will just love this cute hat.
B00ID25PXY|3|Very cute and Love the color...ORDERED 2. Not a good fit on... RETURNING BOTH.
B00JGPA6CC|5|My little wookie gets compliments ever where he goes! Very nice, well made coat!
B00C4RC3QG|1|I have never had a problem with the legs being too tight when ordering pants, but these were. I reordered in a larger and they were still too tight. I cut them off and made them into shorts.
B00J9EPTO0|5|Good, casual sock. Thin material. Excellent for a loafer or lace up shoe, won't stretch shoes out.
B00P5R3GV8|1|Awful.. Poorly made - I am a size 2 and did not fit.  Was not made like the picture.
B00L62DH74|4|I love it!
B00OCBZGS4|5|This is a nice purse to take to meetings, lectures, etc because it is reminiscent of a briefcase and you can easily put tablets, folders and notebooks inside, (It is more of a stiff-sided bag rather than a floppy one.) It's a great size for everyday carrying, not too big that it becomes cumbersome to carry and not too small that you can't fit anything in it. The color of the &#34;brown&#34; purse is more like a cognac color, more on the orange side of brown. It includes a shoulder strap that you can use instead of the carrying handles, which is a nice option. As any nice purse it came with a dust cover and each handle was protectively wrapped in plastic and the feet were covered in tape to prevent scratches. Those attentions to detail are all signs of good quality. The zippers on the front are decoration only, they provide a nice detail but do not open up to expand the bag or have secret pockets. Every other zipper is functional. The liner is a durable dark brown and is a good color and material for keeping the bag looking nice inside (easy to clean, dark enough to not show stains.)  I do not know if this is actual leather, it feels like vinyl, but it is still attractive and nice-looking. The stitching is pretty good (about 98% perfect) and any flaw I noticed was only detected because I looked extremely carefully at it, definitely not noticeable unless you are looking for it. The black edging is done well, they did a very good job on it. It is comfortable to carry and looks smart, I look forward to seeing more from this company. I am pretty picky when it comes to my handbags and I am looking forward to using this one, especially with the &#34;patchwork&#34; trend being on point this season.<br />(This sample was provided for testing and review purposes.)
B008AL0NBM|5|The shirt looks good and I was surprised to find that it runs true to size.  I ordererd a 2X and it fits like it should.
B0051U1846|5|good value
B0019SGHVS|5|I had some of these shirts already and they fit really good so I was searching and found them on Amazon. I have some probably like 5 years or more that I still use for work, so they last as well.
B00DTOCT26|4|Bought it for the brand &#34;Nautica&#34;, it's a  good fit and looking great even though i won't give more than 50$ for this quality
B004H0MFTI|5|.RECOMMENDED .... QUALITY AND DESIGN....VERY GOOD PRICE IN SALE ....VERY GOOD PRODUCT ....RECOMMENDED .... QUALITY AND DESIGN....VERY GOOD PRICE IN SALE ....VERY GOOD PRODUCT ....RECOMMENDED ..
B00EI5V5W0|5|The jackets are awesome.  Definitely run a little big though.  Worth the $
B0071OIPHS|4|This was bought as part of a costume for my 17 year old daughter to wear to the Renaissance Festival. Once she got the front fastened and we tightened it up in the back, it did very well. She had no issues with it coming undone and it was a great addition to her attire. We were even asked where she got it and how much we paid for it, which was in my eyes a very reasonable amount of money considering the item and the cost of them in the market.
B00O15IJNA|1|It was smaller than I expected. I ordered a size larger than what I normally wear but it was still way too small.
B00ALUQBIO|1|cheaply made.WAY  TO SMAL AND WIDE
B0032G87DQ|4|I bought these as a joke for a friend of mine.  He loved them and we both had a great laugh together.
B003YJBYPE|5|Socks came in and they are good size and length. Perfect for what I use them for, the gym. Soft and not too high on the ankle.
B0042ZR9ZI|5|when I saw it, I knew this was the perfect gift for my sister because I know she love domo,<br /><br />I will state the key features that make give the 5 stars:<br /><br />- size, it have a big size so anyone could use it<br /><br />_ material, looks great and fells cool and strong, so you can be sure it will be with you for a long time<br /><br />- design, same as appear on the image, everything is equal no differences at all<br /><br />for short, great product, great materials, great design equal a happy customer
B00FFGQDOQ|5|Great fit, nice heavy cotton just like I like.
B00028AVEU|5|Good pants with the Dickies look. They do run small, I normally wear 32\\" waist in every brand under the sun except Dickies. I ordered 34\\" waist and they are perfect. I wish they were low rise on the waist because they come up to my nipples, but that is what you get with this brand. Just keep your shirt untucked so you don't end up looking like Dustin Hoffman in Rainman. I bought them for the style so I don't plan on using them as they were intended (work pants) so I have no doubt they will hold up. I have another pair in black I wear at the office (during the winter months - too hot for summer) and they are great. They wash up nice, never shrink and NEVER need ironing! Good stuff over all.
B005DSLU9Y|4|A bit too large, however my child should grow into it.
B00GXEHGOA|5|I love this sports bra, it is worth every penny!!  I loved this bra so much I bought six more in every color!
B00UB5YHAS|5|This bag is awesome
B007TBMTC0|5|I bought this buckle for my husband as a gift. He loves it and wears it to work everyday. It's a great looking buckle with good quality.
B00FOSEUIQ|5|Great socks.  Can't see them in boat shoes.  Fit nice, don't slip.  Very happy with them.
B00L5GAFQ2|4|I ordered one size larger after reading all the reviews. The top is slightly larger however the bottom fits perfectly
B00MSQLAOY|5|the shipping was really good, the onesie it self is very comfy and cozy<br />i love it
B00DZUCR4Y|5|This skirt is so cute! Fit is awesome! Length is perfect! Quality is excellent! This skirt can be dressed up or worn casual. I highly recommend this skirt, and I am very picky, especially with quality and fit. Excellent!!
B000UOHC16|3|Scrubs are not required where I work, but they make life much easier because of my work with young children. These are shapeless, somewhat sloppy looking, and have no redeeming qualities at all except for the fact that they are comfortable and can be washed and washed without the color fading. They don't look any better with washing, but at least they don't look worse.
B00H7HD09C|5|great  shirt
B00TEWR3N2|4|well-made, good fit.  The neckline is a too high even for a swimmer's suit as the suit shifts a bit from standing to backstroke position and touches the front of my collar bone (a consideration if you're used to the beach suit's lower or V-cut necklines)
B00MJHB8XA|5|Love it!  Very flattering!
B003CX18LW|5|Great looking hat but didn't fit me right. I'm really particular about hats so I will stick to UA. This hat seemed to run a little small. Gave me a bad headache but I can't give it a bad rating cause it is a good had that's made well.
B00BU4CKXA|4|I bought the solid and the Ikat variation in Small. I found the solid piece to be much longer and more generous on top and the  shoulders needed alterations --  wheras, the Ikat variation seemed more true to size with the exception of the length, which could easily be rectified with a good tailor.
B00B8NGRW8|5|It's really cool, fits as expected, nice soft fabric, very high quality. I am so happy! My son loves wearing it.
B00AQK5KKE|3|The shorts look great but feel a little tight.<br /><br />I may end up going into get the bigger size of the sam style because i love the look so much and the price is right.
B009QD1I80|5|I never buy scarfs. This one is completely comfortable. I suggest buying this one
B005I34K96|5|Although more expensive than others, these are warm and hold up well when you use them. They are too thick for dress gloves or precise manipulation of small items, but they are not intended for that. Despite being insulated workhorse gloves, they actually look pretty good.
B0054OTMEM|5|These are adorable, stay put on baby, and keep his tootsies warm.  Plus if you buy them a size up you can easily fit them onto the baby and they will last for months!  We bought 18 mos size for our 6 month old, who has been wearing them for two months and will easily wear them for 4 more months.  We love this product!  Worth the extra money.  You don't even need socks if you have these (and socks are so annoying because they fall off!)
B00HZHSUM6|3|I love the material but it's a little small so I can't wear it unless I have clothes on underneath...otherwise I'll be flashing everything which typically defeats the purpose of a robe :)
B00A3SEP32|3|Based on my experience with the black Roar Sunburst tee, I ordered this in an XXL and it just barely fits and I haven't even washed it yet (I'm 6'-1\\" with average build).  Also, the neck line is not really smooth (unlike the Sunburst which is perfect) so I am undecided if I'm going to keep it or not.  So due to size issue, neck line and somewhat high price, I cannot rate a 5-star, but otherwise, I think it's soft and comfortable with a great color and style.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Yeah, I decided to return it.  The neck line wasn't working for me.  I wish they would have made it like the sunburst tee.
B001HO3YE2|5|I just received my order for this hat in Grey.  I have 4 wool caps made in Ireland, three are by Eddie Dougherty who hand looms the wool on an old wooden loom. These Dougherty hats are simply excellent. I also have one other tailored wool flat cap also cap made in Ireland.  I enjoy hats very much.  Dougherty's are supreme.  I also have a brown Scala wool felt Pork Pie hat.  I wear it with the brim turned up and down to suit my mood.  All these hats fit well, though the Pork Pie took a bit of breaking in.<br /><br />This Bailey is really very nice with plush thick wool felt and it is nicely softer than the Scala Pork Pie.  It is very comfortable right out of the box.  The gray color is really nice and goes with almost anything.  I ordered an XL.  At 7 1/2 I was just outside the online size chart for L.  I think an L would have been fine.  This hat fits well right now out of the box.  I just wonder if over time it could loosen up.<br /><br />But it is quite handsome, very good quality with thick rich, substantial wool felt.  The hats look is great. Very comfortable.  I would say it is up to the quality of the Eddie Dougherty caps which is outstanding.  But those are lined quite nicely.<br /><br />If you are looking for a handsome had of really nice quality, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I will update the review are a number of months of use as to the size issue, i.e. if you are on the margin of a large, does the hat get loose over time if you go XL.  Right now it is perfect.
B00BZ5WL2Y|3|The tutu started to come apart as soon as i opened the package. The booties didn't stay on at all. But everyone said it was cute
B00TVGJE06|5|Fits great, SO comfortable.
B00DYF100W|2|Out of 10 socks. I like 2 of them, 3 of them are OK, and the other 5 I'll probably never wear.  At 2$/pair..i guess it was worth the risk, but if I could have my money back I'd take it. Most of the socks ended up being beige/tan/grey in color with thin (not very colorful) stripes through. Not very aesthetic imo.
B002DESA4E|5|Very nice thx
B00F9WH6G0|5|Got here on time and fit as expected everything was as expected from site to home love love love it
B00JHQKJSQ|4|Love this dress.  I bought a size small and it is quite long.  However, I am only 5' tall so I expected this.  I will have to have it taken up but do not care since it is sooo pretty and worth it.  It seems to run true to size.  The colors are beautiful.  I love the long sleeves yet the wrap neckline gives it such a summer look and feel.  I am looking forward to this as being my go to dress for dressy and casual occasions throughout the summer.  Get the dress!!!!
B00IGEAP5W|5|I ordered this to go with a Kasper orange short jacket, looks amazing! Its true to size and looks chic yet classy. Love itt
B00LUGOZ5E|3|Stretchy so it fits pretty well.
B00DP3ZLB2|5|I am 5'7&#34; tall and have a 44&#34; bust and the XL fits me just fine. It is easy to get into even without a zipper and I am very fond of linen and light wt cottons and just wash it in the machine and hang to dry. I prefer to roll the sleeves up to below the paisley on the shoulder. I wear it over swimsuits, with white or colored linen/cotton shorts or with pedal pushers or jeans..very cool and comfortable.
B009WO2BBQ|2|I was hoping that these would be just right. The color is great, but for a little kid they will not be soft enough. I'm hoping they will soften in the wash
B00A4J7VDQ|5|I'm very happy with this jersey.  It's colorful and shows my love of the best team in the NFL.  It does tend to run big size wise but that's okay with me.
B005CJMGCE|5|Just get them. These are excellent PERFECT Slim fits. They are not tight nor loose.<br />I just love them. They sit a little low on the waist.
B0019ZNOO4|5|So pleased with this slip, material as well as workmanship, bought the 22 inch one also.
B00FZVJV4K|5|I've been looking for months if not years for slipper socks for my husband that would come up high on his legs. These do just that and he loves them. In fact, I've ordered a second pair! They come out of the washer clean & looking great! I don't put them in the dryer though - just hang to let dry naturally.
B00817E046|4|My order of this product was exactly as pictured above, all the same colors and its a good fit for me
B00KZLRJH6|4|I wear a size small. Received this as a gift in a size Large - it was too big. I sent it back and ordered the medium and it fits perfect!<br /><br />This is a great jacket! I have received many compliments on how great it looks!!
B007C2B4X6|5|Like all the other reviews, this met or exceeded expectations.  She fit just right in it but if you've got kind of a bigger woman trying to do the same thing, I'd reconsider finding something not in the &#34;One Size&#34; category.
B009W3RUCM|4|Good quality, good price; just wish Amazon offered the same style of jean for girls; most of the ones for girls were too narrow (skinny).
B00LKPHYQM|5|Great product!! Quick shipment. Great experience!!!! :D
B00VMSR0AM|5|Prefect. Exactly what we were looking for!
B00OBL71BU|3|By the time I got them my so was ready to wear the size bigger.
B00FSB5VS2|4|a bit tall and tight but good product overall.
B00BYST7GA|1|I ordered these in Black in XS and they sent them in Navy Blue in a size S. However the quality of the shorts were nice considering the price. The size was okay but I still would've preferred a tighter fit. It wasn't worth the time and shipping to return this product. I really wish they got it right I would've given it 5 stars.
B008DD2QU8|5|My husband is very happy with these jeans.  Great fit, great price, and fast shipping. We will definately buy from this seller again!
B000LPAIFQ|5|This shirt is cool and comfortable and will dry quickly when washed. It is true to size and durable.
B00DG00D7Q|5|Cute, comfortable, and great price. Fits true to size. Love the studded shoulder detail! Very pleased with this purchase!
B00JN63UJ0|3|Too small (even though we followed measurement guide) and the quality just wasn't there.  Did not expect more than what I paid for, however, so it might be great for someone else.
B007S0YEKC|5|This is one of the best shirts we have ordered.
B007U3HCHE|5|My son and I are BIG coke drinkers and he wanted to dress up this year for school.  This was PERFECT. ( I couldn't stick him in the beer one, I think he would of been suspended ) anyway, he has autism, so he doesn't like stuff stuck on his head and this costume worked as it didn't confine him. Just sorry we didn't get him big white gloves to wear. Arrived on time and it really was a great price.
B001R2IQD8|4|This is a pretty standard scrub top, the kind hospitals sometimes provide to surgical staff. It has a straight cut, (almost like a \\"rectangle with sleeves\\") so it is not the most flattering cut out there, but is is very practical for everyday use. I has two pockets, the fabric is a polyester/cotton bland, so don't expect it to be super soft, but on the plus side that makes it harder for \\"icky\\" things to stick on it.
B00EA7NNDA|5|I bought these for my son and was very happy with them, citing perfect fit and very good quality. I might buy some for myself!
B00997L504|5|Bought as bridesmaid dress. Perfect fit, very nice dress for the price. Great color! We got the bright pink. Love it!
B00441967E|4|After my lounge pants & worn-out maternity t-shirts became boring and ugly to wear to bed, I bought a decent pair of maternity pjs, and these were a great find.  These are a very soft, comfy fabric and a great fit.  I am petite (5'2\\", A cup and normally wear a size 6-8) and I bought a medium at 6 and 1/2 mos that fit great.  I'm planning to buy a second pair to rotate with.
B00OQIGDJ4|5|nice
B00EAEPDEU|5|fit-fast delivery
B008M4A1VY|5|These pj's are just adorable.  The fabric is soft and pants have an extra horseshoe of fabric in the back to keep them from creeping up while child is sleeping.  The sizes look true, but they are gifts not opened yet.  I orderd a 3T for a 2 year old, and a 4T for a 3 year old.
B00S814E1O|2|This is NOT a wrinkle free shirt.  Nice but be ready to iron.
B0016LSXGU|5|Excelent product, nice fit great material.    Looks really nice and is really waterproof.
B00BRDDINA|3|The quailty is good they hold their shape quite well and have a decent weight and thickness they do however run a bit on the smaller side I'd order one size up if I order any more
B00GHD7GDI|5|Perfect, perfect, perfect. can not say enough makes my figure look outstanding and very sexy but with class.  I got a small and my measurements are 35-26-35 and it fit perfect
B00A7Y41YU|5|This shirt is perfect for vacationing in the tropics!  Fits my man just right!
B006ZYZC7Q|5|I literally &#34;felt up&#34; every sweatshirt in our city to find one that was super thick. My father had a sweatshirt from CHASE brand (nascar) that he loved and finally wore it out after 5 years. I went straight to their site and ordered a new one-I was very disappointed that their quality had declined and I had to return it. I took a chance on Arborwear and I am so glad that I did! I have NEVER found a sweatshirt this thick with as good of craftsmanship. Thank you for making and providing a product that lives up to its name!
B005UOX5YO|1|Shirt did not have adjusting straps, they just hung down because they were sewn in front and back, but were not adjustable. Skirt was ok, but too short, I thought it'd atleast cover my butt. Also the tie is not already tied, you have to tie it and it looks really bulky when you do because of the material. Returned product.
B00KLQD4E2|1|the size was good as i expected but the quality sucks... the fabric is of poor quality and it fades.. i dont like i lost my money
B00EOM9E9I|5|I bought this sweater for my picky son and he loved it !<br />It fit perfectly and looks great on him.
B00AHTK4VE|1|I ordered a small and it was suuuuuper tight and hard to take off. I have other sports bras that hold in place and don't cause for any challenges when taking off.<br /><br />I'll be returning it- but unsure if I want to trouble with one size bigger.
B0018MNZYC|5|Quality of product was excellant and the sizing chart provided by seller was exact to size.
B00CPNR08K|5|Sizing was spot on, True 14. Great length, great lines. Bought this in khaki too, wish there were more colours to choose from.
B0054SOJOQ|5|Great item!!!
B00DYF13TU|4|Nice looking socks with a little more color than usual!  Very cool!  These socks fit nicely and are a very nice gauge of cotton, not too thin or too thick. They look good, feel good, wash & dry nicely!
B00B6KBYY4|5|Since you did not have kids size I bought the XS and my 10 year old loves it.  We also got a autograph on it from one of the cast members-Sasha!!  Washes well especially now that I have to be super careful with autograph.
B009BKWE9U|4|Works well to organize a purse with a large, unstructured interior.  I would have liked the sides to be a bit more stiff, but it is keeping the items where they belong.  I'd have liked better colors.
B006GGM4ZG|5|I got this it's nice to wash and wears well. It is a beautiful wrinkle-resistant and looks wonderful distinctive in quality pleased with your purchase!...
B00BJFKS5W|4|love it
B00BJORK04|5|This outfit fits great and is comfortable as well as sexy. Probably one of my best lingerie sets I ever bought.
B00KQFKFPY|5|great
B00CHSEB3K|5|I wore it ALL day & it worked for casual as well as,  a bit dressier later in the evening w/some added jewelry and a shoe change as well as, a cute bolero. Voila! It almost looked like a different dress. VERY worth the price!!!!!!!!!!!
B00E0J2HV2|5|it fits perfect very comfortable and color is great
B001CJY8K6|4|I liked it, fair price.
B00PYE2RJY|5|Easy to fit in any wallet or purse that I have.  Gives me a sense of security with my information and credit cards
B001LJQFZS|5|This is exactly what I was looking for! The spread for credit cards is incredibly helpful. The size keeps the wallet from getting too thick.
B00F8O7RV8|5|I always wanted to try one of these, and now I finally have one! It fits somewhat small, I'm not quiet sure if that's how it's supposed to fit. But then again I'm assuming it is, after all it is kind of sort of like a girdle. But besides that, I Love how it shapes my lower Body! Not only do I look amazing but I feel amazing as well! Is actually more of what I expected my body to look like. I'm Very Satisfied with my purchase.
B003LO1XXK|4|Good quality, keeps in heat which could be good or bad depending...
B00L3YRT4C|4|The skirt fits very nice, and looks really good on me but I thought it would be a little long, but it's fine
B004XYAH2K|3|Very very attractive. Very very uncomfortable.
B0114KZ62Q|4|Awesome dress!!
B00O854Z1S|5|but sizes are larger than they look, your best bet is to order a size smaller than you wear.
B0070S5V7M|5|Love the show and this shirt fits as promised, looks good and its amazing! Definetly worth more than five stars!
B00DR8YLQ6|5|GOOD
B008M5S052|4|Good fit
B008MOY0U2|2|I really like this shirt; however, it shrinks a lot so definitely buy a size up.  I would definitely buy another one in the future, just a bigger size.
B00AAHA936|5|I bought this looking for something while it is raining and I need to go running/walking. This jacket does a good job at keeping me dry and the pockets hold my essentials.
B008BB7YJU|5|love this. true to size. don't be intimidated by the model pic. the larger sizes will fit if you get the correct one.<br />my bf loves these
B00AFF9VEQ|5|We love the warm and cuddly hat, scarf, and mitten combo, no more lost mittens.  The girls are nice and warm at the bus stop.
B00V6O1Z9Y|5|Everything ok!
B001LOKRG6|4|Great shirt really enjoyed the fit....
B003V3CMV8|5|I already had one of these camis  when I ordered this in white. My first purchase was the leopard print purchased  in a department store. I simply love the way it feels on my skin. I will use it mostly as a  layer under sheer tops and as an extra layer in the winter. For those wearing it under something sheer in the summer, if you tend to run a bit cool, or will be in air conditioning all day it will be perfect. If you tend to be a bit warmer than most, then between the 'hug the body' fit and the material it may prove just a bit too warm. I recently wore mine on a hot summer day and wished I'd opted for my looser cotton cami. It is my 'go to' for any mild or cool days. It is soft, stretchable and comfortable and in no way feels tight or confining.  Not a criticism, but an observation is that if you wear this tucked into your pants or skirt and also are wearing silky underwear it may slide up from them as the cami has some silkiness to it as well.
B003JH8STQ|5|Love this wig! It's so much fun. You'll probably need to proof it out a little but I was overall very satisfied with this product for costume use. Everyone loved it!
B00MPR8FYE|4|Only one bad thing, you have to wash it by hand and it sheds a lot, so don't wear any light colors under it; it will show up on the clothing underneath😦 . Other than that, It looks Great on you, but get a size larger cause they run small;)!
B005PX0YMQ|5|Nice shirt...it's roomy, and the tail is long enough
B0006PJPGO|5|All I can say is that these shirts provide the same comfort level as my favorite, worn in pajamas.  Even on the golf course you feel like you are back on the couch just vegging out in your favorite lounge wear.  And what a price for such a quality brand!!!! <br />Buy this shirt now and thank me later.
B00VECCCTU|5|perfect
B007HIHO9S|5|Its very nice .
B00FQE1HJS|4|I bought this bag a few years ago. Upon receiving it the size was larger than expected. It is a true satchel type bag. Being used to smaller bags it took a bit of time to adjust to the roominess this bag offers. It has quickly become my &#34;go to&#34; bag for the warmer months.  Mine had a strong odor when received. I remedied this by putting vanilla scented candles in it for a short while. I love it. It really fits who i am.  It is feminine looking with the lace (which I love) and is extremely versatile to go with many styles, both romantic to conservative.  It has quality construction.
B009M1QCLE|3|I like the shirt and the design but its just a tad big. tried washing it and in got a little smaller but still to long for my taste.
B008AUYQFC|4|I'm 5'3 and got a little extra mean on my bones (around 180) and the socks are cute, soft, and go over my knees about 3 inches. The very end of the socks (by the knee) is a little tight, and the socks like to slide down. But all around cute lounging socks.
B007S016WQ|3|Hmm; it was warm with this product on.
B00FYINEBA|2|Will be sending this back -will not be able to wear this to work.  A disappointment from Calvin Klein  Sizing is not consistent
B001C4RSWG|3|This boa is ok, but the feathers are very loose and quite a few of them will come off throughout the evening.  OK value for the price.  I'm not sure what expensive boas cost.
B007CS8FTG|5|this will fit my son great, they are a little thin but thats ok I got a good deal on them.
B00OODW3FO|5|Just what I expected and wanted.  Fits great!
B00BUGDAOG|5|this dress is high quality and fits as expected
B00KCY9QPY|2|Embroidery was unraveling in the package.  Fit was mumu-like.  Returned it.
B00OQLDET8|5|Amazing
B00AZ2ZNZU|5|Excellent for under my daughter's uniform.  Extremely handy and versatile.  Can be used for other than the purpose for which I bought it.
B00KKPM93G|5|great quality and fun
B009XB61JQ|5|I have approx. 25 belts (some costing $45.) and this one of the best!  Will order a couple more.
B00HL4BQ9C|5|A little bit large but so gorgeous!
B00IH5N0FM|4|Cute sundress, runs a bit smaller than I thought it would, but I still like it and expect to wear it a lot.
B00K5L2H2S|5|Only jacket I can get my 12 yo son to wear, even in the snow.  Very thick and warm and great quality.  Runs a bit small.
B00MW7G2L0|1|This is very poor quality. I was going to give it to my Grandmother for Christmas but decided not to because this looks so cheap. There is a big &#34;iron on&#34; square on the front of this shirt. It looks awful. I am very unhappy with this purchase. I  going to try to send it back.
B00HU0C13M|3|I'm 5'5\\" and 116 pounds, I ordered a small according to the sizing chart but the costume was ill fitting, It fit lose in the body but short in length and terrible material.  Thank god for the accessories  that came with the costume I was able to wear black tights and a black shirt which really made the costume look great.  So my review of three stars are based on the accessories alone.
B00FS7F0GO|5|So perfect ,I like it !
B00DMADKTS|5|Nice bandanas
B00P3SGR06|4|Well made just a little tight.
B00VSAKOGG|5|I love them the fabric feels amazing
B009SCQH8K|5|My son finds it very comfortable and he has sensory issues. Its great quality. Also it looks awesome so you can not beat that.
B002UICF1M|4|This bra is comfortable, supportive and well made.  It's not a particularly exciting bra, but it gets the job done without fanfare.  My only complaint is that the straps are a little closer together than I had anticipated, which means I have issues with them showing with anything other than a crew neckline or something like a button down shirt (forget wearing this bra with a scoop neckline or any neckline that doesn't come practically to your neck).  But with the proper neckline, this bra is a good choice, and it's a really decent price for a Wacoal bra, which tend to run pretty high (and are generally worth the price for how well made they are).
B00ACIFT5G|5|ever nice shirts
B005XZXYSC|5|I absolutely love this jacket.  Great features.  Weatherproof.  I haven't worn it in a torrential downpour yet, but it has successfully repelled steady rain.  Have worn it in temps in 30s with no under layer because of the light fleece liner.  Is OK if you keep moving at those temps.  However, throw on a fleece underneath and this thing is good down in 20s.  Love the hood and the fact that it can be stowed in the collar when not using it.  On those cool days that are really windy, but you have to keep moving so you get hot when totally zipped up, just unzip some of the plentiful venting.<br />I have done PT in it, weightlifting, run... etc.  The only nit I have is with the zipper start.  This thing is hard to get started.  Can't tell if it is the double zipper or what.  A little silicone spray helps.  Other than that, great jacket.
B009W2G8R6|1|Linen material.  not suitable for nose blowing
B00KX86RIS|5|Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loved it and his friends were jealous! Great product
B006W2P0VY|5|They are adorable and stay on. My newborn wore the until he was 3 months now he is big for them. Too bad I can't find a bigger size. Great product
B00B1H5TN4|5|perfectly
B0076PJ2T2|3|I bought this for my daughter who is somewhat busty.  It is tight across the chest and I will probably be sending it back.
B00N2MQXYU|5|Very nice and comfortable quality leather purse. It is a gift for my father in law. He is very happy.
B00AMTRTOO|5|great hood. Long so you can tuck into your coat. I would  recommend this a friend. Priced rights and met my expectations.
B00LZER44A|5|Gorgeous
B00OKQ42CM|4|Not so small that it wouldn't fit, but snug. I wear an American size 6/8
B00D2N7AG4|3|Though the size was a little bit large the design is great and my aunt love it
B00592VMNI|5|I don't expect this would last for more than a season or 2, but given how little ones grow, that doesn't matter--and the price makes it more than worthwhile.  Since my little one is a huge Thomas fan, this was a no-brainer.  We bought it a bit larger than needed, so hopefully it'll last 2 seasons.  We'll see.
B00DVPYI7W|4|Super cute! Took our Christmas pictures in it. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the tutu could use a little more fluff and after washing the tights there were a bit stringy! But very nice, soft and adorable!
B009O9YHQ6|1|Way smaller fit than advertised size.  Made sure to check.  Very tight in chest area  Buttons won't stay<br />Buttoned up
B00ET9GCW8|2|I bought this this for myself turns out it's kind of on the girly side but that's fine my wife loves it it's nice and warm to. good product especially for the price
B00K5NOI2S|4|My nephew loved them!
B00NQVFQJU|5|Comfortable, well-made shirt for casual wear!
B003HC92JS|5|These socks are priced right and the quality is high.  I routinely purchase a few pairs every quarter to replenish the ones I lose.  I would highly recommend these socks to a gym rat or outdoor runner.
B00QA83S50|5|It's really big but cozy and warm. I love this shirt and now i'm buying 3 more.
B007P294Z8|5|I run and train for half marathons and these are by far the best socks I have ever had the fortune of finding. The double layer really keeps feet blister free and they are super comfortable.
B00KHQ8U40|2|It broke very early. I got it and wore it moderately, but it broke after a month. It worked amazingly, just broke. Not very durable.
B00QMOVWR8|4|Not slouchy on me but it's okay I love it(maybe I just have a big head)!
B00G2G9AXE|5|I ordered the blouse for my first Mehndi just a couple weeks before.  It was delivered quickly as I requested and they were quick to respond to my questions.  I was happy to find out the blouse can be adjustable.  I used a seam ripper to take out seams until it fit.  Everyone at the Mehndi complemented me on the fabric and quality of the blouse.  I would recommend Saris and Things to anyone.
B00B7W1IDI|5|Pretty, comfortable and fits exactly as I thought it would.
B00CFIB540|2|Not warm enough for any cold weather conditions. Too slippery for smart phone usage.
B00H9BG2AU|5|I have been trying to find a pair of Levis that were light blue for a long time that fit me and now I finally have.
B008GT83MO|2|I think it's very over priced for this specific wallet. Material is not great, feels like something you would buy on canal street in ny for 10$. The button didn't close, no matter how many credit cards you put in. Not worth it.<br />The only good thing was the design was great inside and out... And the refund/return!
B00CSIN54U|4|The other Reebok sports briefs are my preference. These have more cotton and have elastic around the thighs (which is a caveat I do not care for, but not a bad thing for all). They don't breathe as well and the waistband is a little thick--YET, they are viable underwear because of their price, they're just not amazing.
B000ZN236Q|5|great quality tie
B000B5GU1M|4|I volunteer to do trail maintenance at a state park and it can be very sunny during the day. This is a great addition to my pack. The only addition I will make is to sew on a single snap so that I can snap the flap up over the top when it's too hot and I need a little ventilation.
B000P9I3S2|2|Extremely thin. My husband thankfully is too warm all the time so he was okay with the thinner material or I would have sent it back!
B000WY24BC|5|Easy, breezy way to dress up for a party.  I was even able to steam iron it carefully in order to get the shipping wrinkles out of it.
B006ZS7N6K|3|I liked the pants; however they were way too big.  Generally,  I wear a size 8, which is usually just slightly loose. I am 5'5 and 135 + pounds, and was drowning in these jeans.
B00NX77R0S|2|This Product is not true to size. Runs small when I made sure I ordered a larger size..
B00FYFC2MK|4|Little to long....but other than that its a good quality shirt
B00ORKV6K2|4|Great hat it's a little snug but it's still worth getting
B004WSD6HU|5|Fiti is perfect and nice fabric. Looks great on. No complaints. Great for a casual night out with family or friends.
B00L22XT2G|5|I ordered this for.my bridesmaid I love it and perfect fit
B007P8A2SK|4|A bit bigger than I expected, but solid quality.
B00L9GKWKC|5|Love it.
B00J366G3M|5|She loves them.
B00SLQV21G|4|Great
B003G8ZEMW|5|i am happy with the chrome covered gun buckle. i hate to be nit picky but it really doesnt look like a glock at all... maybe a 911 or a M9, but not a glock. however, it fits nicely and looks great. comfortable and item is as described by seller.
B00LVSAV4U|5|My kid love it
B00EVAWUC6|5|=)
B008VL8AW0|5|bought it for my size 8 1/2 to fit it slouchy was like asking to much? but nice beanie. black.
B00FQSGSW0|4|Not an exact match for the finish and Material of Mr. Bagging' attire, but you can see that from the images. Great quality and construction. My only gripe is that the inner shirt is nothing more than what you see. Though the jacket is a separate item (w/o working pockets by the way), if you take off the jacket, you're basically wearing a bare back tank top/vest combo. I would have liked the shirt to be a real shirt for the price.
B003G5A628|5|I was afraid that these socks would be too snug for my calves, but they fit great and are so comfy. After many Crossfit workouts and washes, they are still in perfect condition and have not faded! I would recommend this brand to anyone!
B00LQMZKV0|5|Amazing quality and lovely dress
B00L8YOCO2|5|Fit great ,  very good quality and fast shipping!!!
B0076S9SQQ|5|Ordered this hat because it is a plain old hat.  No team logos or advertising.  I have a Phila. Phillies hat and got tired of people stopping me to talk about how awful they are.  It's true though.
B009S3CFOO|1|this sweater is for child not for a woman and it's super cheap it has pills already I had to stretch it out to even make it usable and ended up giving it to my 6 year old niece the woman in the picture must be a midget and it comes from China so it's not even worth returning lose lose why do the sellers continue to lie and miss represent their products because Amazon let them get away with it and makes it incredibly difficult to get your money back or even file a complaint
B005JXLSEK|2|I have worn the original ah bra for years they last a long time but im disappointed in the racer back  way too shear... it would b perfect if like the original gave a place to add pads, but it does not im sending it back
B007WAF09W|3|It's a bit tight and see-through and the buttons kinda make it look cheap. there are also buttons on the side that are not visible in the picture that I didn't like very much but they are easily removable. I bought new buttons and sowed them on and despite the fact that its a bit tight still wear it and love it
B00GI1WFVM|4|I loved the dress, but it was way too small and cost too much to return.
B00PV9NI6I|1|Good idea, but just does not do anything for your figure.
B002IWJF5E|5|Purchased this wig with black and white flowers to complete my costume, and boy is it going to do that. Gorgeous quality wig;looks exactly like the picture shown, all the added accessories are cute too. I'm adding a few of my own things to it and taking a few off that it came with, but that was simple enough!! Packaged in a nice box for storing and keeping in good condition when done. Read the other reviews before me and was convinced to go ahead, i'm glad I did. You won't be sorry either. :)
B005LSO4KS|3|product is well made.  Product is as described, the size may be a little snug compared to other manufacturers.  It's okay.
B00O7MRSZ2|5|Best sports bra For those who are more &#34;blessed&#34; than others in the chest area. No bounce or movement.
B009OKPUVG|5|fits nice definately have to have a lint brush as black attracts..but otherwise no complaints.great pair of anytime jeans would purchase again.in other colors.material is nice for price as well
B00OJ9OUMW|5|love these socks - warm and comfortable
B00GPXQ76C|2|Hat was kind of tight and it does not stretch
B00F8XPLU8|5|Fits great, very comfortable and it looks good! I wear these all the time, and just got a few other pairs in different colors so I can alternate between them. Definitely my favorite brand of shorts.
B00KZ6JGOK|3|Product very fragile around triggers but the accuracy very high
B00BVGCA1E|3|The most I've ever paid for a piece of elastic with snaps, pretending to be a belt. I thought this was actually a three set of toddler belts. Just small elastic pieces to tighten the top of pants. Sure it may come in handy, but not what I was expecting.
B008RBOQ68|1|I ordered a medium shirt for my size 7, 16 year old daughter.  It barely fits my 13 year old.  A woman's medium is more like a small Junior.  When I went to exchange, it was placed as a refund, not an exchange.  I did like the design.  Right now I am at 6+ dollars for shipping for a $16 shirt and I have nothing to show for it. UPDATED BELOW.  There are very few out there with the Olympic rings.  No wonder I hate to mail order.  I contacted the company and got an immediate response that they would ship a new shirt.  However, it did not show up.  Contacted them again and received an extra-large women's shirt.  I tried it on (I wear a women's large and it is too tight).  Should, however, fit my daughter (women's medium) well and she gets her Olympic ring t-shirt.  Pluses to company for reshipping, sizes are still way off.  Material is thin, will likely require a cami under it.  The company should revisit the base t-shirts that they are using.
B00A69ET7U|5|comfortable
B00DY86EQE|5|WAS A GUIFT FOR GRANDAUGHTER
B00K4OQUS8|4|It fits fine.
B0030BFV3M|1|They were supposed to be big and tall and they were not. Sent back
B000N8Q09O|5|Cargo shorts and a work shirt make a great work uniform. Durable and stain resistant dickies are a good value.
B00A17K4K8|5|I have worn them for years. I haven't been able to find anything as comfortable. For the price, they're hard to top.
B00CIYFRO0|5|I like it but I think my thighs are to big but I will keep it I did order another one in a bigger size.
B00D4KWQ1E|4|My daughter loves to wear this outfit. It's not really top of the line in terms of quality, but the colors and butterfly are cute.
B00HSZHEQS|4|Fit well, but the shipping wax paper over the logo got stuck on the letters. I used a warm rag to get it off and it was ok.
B00GFAKPXG|4|This dress is beautiful. The skirt is very simple but the top has embroidery that is sparkly and makes a good combo between simple and festive. I would still put a onesie or camisole underneath to make it more comfortable on little girls' skin.
B00NL5WVTE|4|lovely on
B007L8W3FY|5|The skirt came sooner than expected. I was happy with the quality and fit of the skirt and will order NYDJ products again!
B00DOPM22M|3|the color was not a pink rose color but a true purple..... Still watching for bight darker pink.
B001W9032S|1|This hat is absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately I had to send it back because the brim was bent and damaged during shipping. Hopefully  the company will create a better way to ship the hats, because if it was not damaged it would've been an amazing purchase. I am 5'10&#34; with broad shoulders. The hat fully covered me from shoulder to shoulder and there was incredible coverage on the neck. The material was very comfortable on my head. I thought I had a big head, and after reading all the reviews was surprised that the hat fit. I do have a short pixie hair cut, so that could be why it fit so nicely. Ultimately I was sad to have to return this product. I think it would've been great on the beach
B00QK71QAU|5|These are very soft, and my daughter says they are very comfortable. The colors are so sweet! I have looked everywhere for cute underwear that had a soft palette and a good cut. These are so perfect!!
B002WTC6CC|2|When I first wore these socks, I was fairly impressed. They are comfortable and also thick enough to prevent one's feet from rubbing against the shoes, but not so thick that they become too warm. Once I took the socks off, though, I realized how mediocre these socks actually are. Both the interior and the exterior of the socks shed lots and lots of black lint. Several other reviewers have mentioned this as well. This is a consistent annoyance and remains even after many washings. It is, in fact, so severe that it left a trail of black lint on a white carpet. At the time I believed that what I was seeing was residue from the bottom of someone's shoes, but then I realized they were from my socks. I had to get down on my hands and knees to gather the lint from the carpet, which was a real pain. There is also black lint all over my feet when I take the socks off. In short, avoid these socks unless you want a mess.
B00IZOPQLQ|3|Extremely way to big!
B00ZPLE064|5|Awesome fit and looks great on.
B00SG7M4JE|5|Great assortment of socks for those who rarely purchase socks and want to show some style.
B00F9QC3I2|5|Cutest swim top i have. Fits great! good quality
B00BPUXFIS|5|I love this bra. I am 5'4&#34; and 135 pounds and a 34 DDD/F - a challenging size to fit. This bra provides maximum support, comfort and  a great shape. I wear it not only for workouts but for many outdoor activities when I expect to perspire and don't want to ruin my more delicate bras. This is a winner.
B00R7CKS56|5|My nephew loves them.
B00AXX84QQ|3|The dress is nice and its texture is great but the design is not for teens nor juniors. Its just ok
B00081IB7K|3|This card case features quality material and is well-made. I purchased it to use as a wallet -- I'm into less is more. It DOES NOT have the outside pocket referred to in the listed features. That made all the difference for me -- that pocket is essential in making this a useable wallet. I returned it. Also, along the less-is-more line, the leather is padded which adds a thicker feel. Conclusion: If you're looking for luscious, luxurious, natural bling with which to indicate your gilt-edged success, there may be none better. If you're looking for a slim, minimalist, practical card case to use as a wallet, look elsewhere.
B00BXRC3QI|4|This product looks good. The quality could be a little better hence the four stars. If you are looking for this style it is a good fit.
B001O5ZTPG|5|Fits everything I need in it. Like anything else it needs to be broke in. I would recommend this to a friend or would buy again
B00AYIB5NY|4|It's a snug, cozy hat - I like it!
B000R5NQJK|4|Nice pattern. i thought it would be a little busy but it actually looks pretty nice. The empire waist really seperates the bust line nicely and I like the halter look. Fits a little snug through the waist and under the arms.
B00K7DH4LI|2|size was all wrong , sent it back.
B006FKPDYW|5|My daughter fell in love with a peasant skirt hand me down from her older sister. She wore it and wore it, until it was a stained and no longer able to be worn in public, so I searched all over the net for a replacement for a reasonable price. I found one! My only complaint is that it only comes in white. This will be a church skirt until it inevitably gets stained. I'll sew her some more for play. She loves this skirt!!!
B00JV3DRPW|5|Tq. I loved it..i feel great wearing it and I do get compliments about the belt.<br />Thank you. Glad I bought it.<br />Thank you also for your prompt delivery and service is excellent.
B009AFGK82|3|The neck was too wide. I felt like my son would get cold because so exposed on top.
B00B8B466O|5|He looked so good with it on and even HE enjoys wearing it!  Next purchase will be a 'real' bowtie!
B001J6OMK8|4|GREAT FITTING  BRA,  BUT NOT IN GOOD CONDITION!!!  The problem is when they were shipped three out of four were creased and pitted.  This is a push up bra with some padding.  When the padding is creased, wrinkled, or pitted it shows through when wearing a t-shirt or sweater.  I sent the three back and they were replaced.  Two of those three were also creased, wrinkled, and pitted.  I had sent a note asking they please check them before mailing the replacements.  Then two more were sent and of course, they were also creased, wrinkled, and pitted.  I finally gave up and was only able to keep two good bras.  Packaging and handling became a serious issue that needs to be fixed!!!
B00BYILOHU|4|Very comfotable
B0012ZGK4M|4|I really like it I do it is just a little on the small size around not cup... I would recommend this bra just make sure of the size.
B009N5NWC6|4|I ordered these and they came in a timely fashion. It fit as I expected and serves its purpose very well.
B0036OS6LW|5|loved them they fit well
B00EDSIRKK|5|I purchased this Batgirl set for my girlfriend.  She normally fits a medium in juniors.  I purchased a large for her and it fits perfectly.  I did purchase one of these for her before in a medium, and it did seem to fit a little small.  After washing and drying it many times, it seems to have shrunk a little.  If you love super heroes and you love sexy, you will love this set.  Buy one for your girlfriend or wife.  You will not be disappointed.
B00LHN8L2S|5|son loves it. he looks adorable in it
B00MVBTBTW|2|The colors and fit weren't as shown. Pretty disappointed, so I ended up returning it.
B00J0HDI0I|3|The dress if very long and hits the floor.  I am 5' 8&#34; and it is that long on me.  Also I normally wear a 2x but ordered a 3x and it is very tight.
B00SVXYP68|5|Ordered this for our baby girl's Baptism.  It was the perfect size and so soft & comfortable for her to wear...not like some headbands that can be extremely scratchy against an infant's head.  She's worn it many times since then.  Highly recommend this product!
B00VSW7DAE|4|These are nice pants but they are Asian sizing. They have a lot of stretch but are for small frame girls / women. I knew when buying so I ordered the XL. I am 5'6&#34; & weigh 110 and my normal size is size 3 juniors. These fit nicely without any bulging. The only issue is they are also shorter then reg. pants so are just long enough. Any shorter & they'd be to short. I really like them. Just know they are made to fit a very small frame.
B00IOG1Q1Y|5|I love this bra!  It is very comfortable and non-binding.  I do wash it in a lingerie bag and do not put it in the dryer.
B00H5IWNPA|3|These are not warm at all
B004WPHPAC|5|Great costume, looks like the real thing, guests thought it was one of the best if not the best. The one thing you need to know is that the spade and shield need to be bought apart since they are noy included.
B00CLCW5IU|4|Very cute sweater. A little thinner on material than expected but still looks good with a shirt underneath. Overall good.
B009X5JW70|5|Great style and material. My 8-yr old son found it comfy and it was stylish too - a bonus indeed!
B003WINE0K|5|Love it and fit perfectly , material are good and color is exactly the same. Didnt like the hat much but served the porpuse
B0018OOW0G|5|I have been wearing 501 Levis since I was in high school in the 50's (except for 4 years in the Navy). These are always the same fit, no matter where purchased. Best thing about Amazon is they offer these in 38 by 29 (short legs) so that I don't need to have them hemmed, saving $10 per pair. They also offer them in various washes (colors) which is great.<br />Wtih Prime free shipping, Amazon is perfect for buying things with a very consisitent fit (also includes Merril and Columbia shoes).
B00T2JI7VY|2|just arrivied fits but looks like shint Halloween costume if thats what u like. design is off doesn't look like pic at all wont order again
B00R8JKS6W|5|Always hard to find a shirt long enough for my tall husband and it fits perfect!!
B007W3UIQE|5|bra size fits nice around - haven't worn it out yet but should be interesting - I like the way it feels - wish it had a little more support underneath but overall - should be fun
B00D60Y67Y|5|I love my babyphat dress its a beautiful dress, thanks alot, hope u get different styles! Thanks again for dress love it
B00C4745XU|4|It's a shirt
B00PRA6OTO|1|welts all over my body everywhere the nightgown touched, had to go to hospital for severe allergic reaction, IV's and now 3 prescriptions to take! .
B00EK93Q5I|2|I love the sweater on in the picture,  but this is t-shirt material. I ordered a M, but it fits like an xs. I'm 5'2&#34; and I usually wear a size 2 and s, i could fit an xs but I like my clothes a little lose. I took the advice of some reviews and got a M, but even that was too small. The bottm has na elastic that doesn't allow the shirt to go over my butt, and when I pull it town below my butt, it looks ridiculous & cheap.<br /><br />I'm more bummed that it isn't a sweater...
B00FZVWYZS|5|Another fine plaid shirt to add to my collection of plaids. I fits perfect, looks rich, and has great color. A great buy.
B00VANQ2QM|3|Size Runs A Little Small
B00FFCKZEO|5|Great topcoat, the wool feels great and so does the shawl. Nothing bad to say about this coat! . .
B008WYDR6U|1|I do not recommend anyone to buy these clothes. Is very poor!! Consider that if you buy it in the air to throw money at!
B00UY13V4C|4|Size is ACTUALLY about 1/8&#34; larger than other fitted / sized Caps I have.
B00CWUGYTC|5|Just got my cat ears I love them. a little different from the picture but I REALLY LOVE THEM. Can't stop wearing them now.
B00OC7JK80|1|I haven't even had the costume for one week, and they won't take it back.  I ordered two not knowing what size would fit and they have the nerve to ask me why I waited a week to try and return it.  Then on top of saying that a week has exceeded their return policy they want to charge me a 15% restocking fee.  They must be desperate to make a buck and must have one foot out the bankruptcy door to try and pull this.  I would never recommend a company with NO RETURN POLICY!!!!
B008EL95WQ|5|I ordered a size medium, not knowing if it was going to work since I was on the edge of M and L according to some of the size charts I could find. No need to worry as it fit beautifully, with a little room to spare. It's so hard to find nice satin tap shorts and matching tanks at a reasonable price! This was a great deal, on sale for $31. I tried it on as soon as it came today and it's just gorgeous. The shade of yellow is so soft, not to mention how silky it is. The shoulder straps have a nice detail of being looped around in the front, with the rest of the strap being adjustable in the back. For reference, I'm 5'7\\", 140lbs, 37\\" bust, 29-30\\" waist, and 36\\" hips. The medium is perfect. I'm looking forward to wearing it often.
B00MUDXIAE|5|Very happy
B00MUT49MO|5|Perfectly tailored! Best 'dress-up' clothes (for the money) I have ever seen, really!
B00CA38836|5|LOVE these leggings. Ponte knit fabric is perfect for fall & winter. Flattering fit, true to size & comfortable. Perfect length for me - I'm 5' 7&#34; & size 12 in women's jeans. Will order another pair in large. I like these better than another pair I ordered from a big name brand that were more than $100. One of the features of the legging that I like is that they are not skin tight around the ankle. Close fitting but not squeezing the ankle. I like that one inch of room at the bottom of the leg. They fit easily inside a boot but can be worn outside of an ankle boot & look great with black patent pumps too. Versatile.
B00QKL9X56|1|One was the wrong size and the other was to small
B001HCUFKK|5|Very fast service!! Very nice product! I cannot wait for my little girl to get here so she can wear them!! I'm also planning to order more in different colors, I only ordered 5, so I plan to get her some more colors!!
B003NNVSFC|2|Nice shirts but I ordered a large but it was really really a tiny large! I needed a real large!
B00SR4XV5M|3|This don't fit well.
B00CIA5ZCS|5|I bought this shirt for my 4 year old grandson as a Christmas gift because he LOVES trucks!  He told me that &#34;it was the best shirt EVER&#34;!  What more can I add to that?
B00JWNHTI2|5|My favorite features about these Levis are the comfort, look, fit, and slant trouser pockets.<br /><br />Casual Friday is everyday with these pants. Dress them up with some Clark's suede or leather Bushacre casual boots.
B00A17JYIG|5|They really are great. Very supportive and comfortable.<br />The 8% spandex really make them fit just perfectly and support everything in all the right places without stretching out.<br /><br />Will buy more in the future!
B003LO1Z6A|5|This product is comfortable as well as durable. At a great price point. I have to write 7 more words. Done!
B00KX84LDG|2|Meh.  I was optimistic that these would be a comfortable cotton ragg sock, but they're rather thin and baggy with no give or cushion whatsoever and the toe seams puckered after a single wash.  Also, the corners of the toe seams and the heels poke out rather than lying flat and smooth.  I purchased grey, but the color was more accurately light khaki.  I wouldn't buy these again, especially at the listed price ($13/pr).
B00R62QO28|5|I would never have thought anything with polyester in it could be cool and breezy.  I have bought 100% cotton PJs for years as I get hot and then don't sleep well.  Now I have my own personal summers.....anyway, I decided to fork out the money and try these moisture wicking pjs.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!  They aren't super stylish but are super comfortable and are so light and breezy you won't know there is polyester in them.  I liked them so well that this is the 2nd pair I purchased.  The tops and bottoms are interchangeable in the pink set and the black and pink plaid set.  The only thing is the photo shows there is a white inset in the top---neither of mine have that little white inset. Don't know if it missed a production step or what, but it doesn't matter.  Now I want to throw out all the 100% cotton pjs as they seem heavy compared to these.
B005CSOMO0|4|Replacement for 10+ year old pairs of swim trunks.  Of course they feel wonderful!  Love the various bright colors that I chose.  Recently lost a leg so find these easy to slip on & off by &#34;Bridging&#34; my body.
B00871V2VA|5|Given as a gift
B00ESCWMJ8|5|Great stockings, are great, I love the fabric of these is very good, is soft and durable, is not that kind of breaking in half a trice, 100% recommended
B00A34UD7S|4|Fit is fine. They ride up a bit but overall good
B00P8793LM|4|I'm a 36 1/2 inch waist and the waist on the size Large was a perfect fit - secure but not too tight. The length from top of waistband to bottom of leg is about 14 1/2 inches. These are a relaxed fit and look pretty sharp actually. Comfortable and non-binding when sitting, no tight legs to ride up. The material is quite light weight and stretchy and hangs nicely. My comments are after one warm wash. I couldn't give 5 stars yet as the durability is TBD. Recommend washing black and navy colors separately to start with as there was some dye released.
B008XDZ97A|5|My daughter is four and going through a pink princess phase, so this hit the mark.  She loves it and it washes well also.
B00DUGLYYM|5|So comfortable and washes well. I will be buying more of these!
B006PI12FS|5|I liked the first one so much, I bought another one.  One I use for credit cards, the other I use for medical, insurance cards.
B0012OG3FE|4|Exactly what I wanted and works well for me.
B00YHAUARW|5|I can not explain how much I love this set. The bottom was a small and top was a medium. ??? I don't know how that happened. You can mix and match. Defiantly guy guys.
B00FFXEQ48|3|I thought the dress looked really cute (and it is cute), but the sizing is way off. It is not a true 16, in my opinion.
B00HWISWBC|4|A little thin but good length and good fit
B00KGFFVPI|4|Very thin. I had to wear around the house or with a slip
B000YHNRDG|5|The shirt fits great, heavy 100% cotton (not that thin fabric some other places sell) and the price was too good to not buy it. Now get all my other favorite bands so I can keep on livin' the dream...
B00FE4FYT4|1|I merely went shopping today for groceries in this sweater and I have come to realize I have at least 6 pulls in this sweaters knit.  One is about 3 inches in length.  The sweater styling is cute but apparently it isn't made for sitting in a car, walking, reaching for things etc....I would expect shoddy craftsmanship on something I paid a fraction of this price for but as it stands, I have a $80 sweater that looks like I wore it for years rather than a short outing to get groceries.
B00HFEHSD6|4|Bought this for my wife a few weeks ago. It's cute and made of a decent quality fabric. It's not super short, but still a little daring with the cutouts. She has the medium which fit fairly well as it has some stretch, her waist is 29. The hips are less of an issue in this type of style, but she is around 39-40. Color is as pictured.
B00LYT9SD6|5|I'm going to order different color shirts. I loved it.  It felt comfortable.
B00A3QY0RK|5|Love love love this shirt! Right size, came early than expected. I hardly take it off.<br /><br />'Hands up who likes me ? '
B00CEH22BC|4|LONG shirts
B00H3R8ETM|5|These products are great. I like how my liitle princess wears. I recommend these.
B005CW06UA|4|Good for the price....
B00FFIIH8O|5|These are the only bras that fit me well.  I love them!
B003CBNTOI|5|I wear superhero shirts all the time, fly my geek flag.  At least THE BIG BANG THEORY has made wearing these shirt acceptable.  I'd actually had one of these before and ended up wearing it out.  Decided to get another one because I want to keep it in my wardrobe with the rest of the Justice League panels collection.
B00WL6E2J6|3|The straps are very uncomfortable and so is the neckline. The straps keep getting tangled and twisting and pinching my shoulders. I am a size 16 and the body part does an OK job but like I said, the straps are awfully annoying. It does ride up a bit too, so keep that in mind when purchasing.
B006SRTFWI|4|These are just what I expected; well made & comfortable.
B00DOO05TU|5|our school is tigers and i keep score for volleyball and people always want to know where i get all my tee's they are original
B00GD4WSHU|4|Nice swim shorts
B00O4BNDCI|5|Great mask I'm very delighted with the material. The size fits perfect and it arrived before the deadline I'm very pleased. I'll be ordering again very soon.
B00B35JALG|3|Not very sturdy. Runs and rips just putting on and it was pretty much shredded by the end of the night.
B00KU0NLZQ|4|The shirt and color is amazing, would order one size bigger.
B00O85GEAI|4|I never give a five, unless it's free.
B00FEJJDVO|5|Bought this T shirt for my son for Xmas. He LOVED it! Excellent image, & good quality of the shirt. Definitely recommend it.
B0079ME63E|5|Super cute!
B0084K3V7C|5|Quality of cap is wonderful!  Bought it as a gift and it was just perfect!  It is very well made and I'm sure it will last a long time!
B00HIK9P9M|3|Didn't quite look like the picture..quality is okay. It was pretty big but it shrinks slightly when washed. I'm petite so it was a bit long and wide for me.
B00BXT584U|5|Bought this for my daughter for Xmas.She wore it all winter.Good quality and it looks alittle different than a standard scarf.She absolutely loves it.
B009CKH99O|4|The jacket is excellent. Only size is little bigger than I was expected. The jacket itself is very warm and nice quality.
B00NEFQ5ES|5|I love it !
B003E77FZ4|5|My brother's an air force brat and won't wear it, but he loves kitten mittens and the shirt is awesome
B00553XHZC|5|always hard to find a good bra; especially larger cup sizes with smaller back measurement. this is made exceptionally well. feels great. while I do not like having to hand wash, I am happy to do so if it means I have a great and comfy and supportive bra to wear. I plan on buying more and stocking up! it was shipped and arrived quickly. love it love it love it!
B0084FZZT4|4|Great bra at an even better price.
B00MVBDUNU|1|My son was so excited to play in the snow in these gloves. Sadly, after the first hour, the &#34;waterproof&#34; gloves were completely soaked on the inside and his fingers were frozen. I washed and dried them per the label's instructions to attempt to use again the next day, but after four - yes, FOUR - cycles in the dryer, the insides were still wet. It also seemed like the inside lining was smaller than when he first put them on after they had been wet. We are returning and will have to look elsewhere for a decent pair of outdoor gloves.
B000OPHVYE|3|I love the covered elastic, but they shrunk to be a bit tight.
B003VKYH28|4|The fabric colors was great (I ordered the Purple Camo) and the material was nice and substantial (but not that soft, even after washing).  Unfortunately it was a little annoying because they weren't perfect squares so you couldn't fold them into perfect triangles, but all in all, a solid product for the price and they served their purpose for the 1 or 2 times I might wear it.
B00IULA9X4|5|This jacket is great for fall weather (high 40s to low 60s). Very warm and soft. Its super comfortable (I fall asleep on it at work sometimes...lol) And the fit is great! Carhartt is a great brand!
B00UI9G05W|5|Beautiful and flattering.  Seems well made.
B004GG3JBG|1|Don't like them.  I thought they'd be softer. Waistband is too large - they fit too loose.  I'm donating them to the vets.
B00M20E91M|3|Runs a little small.
B00N3KE6VI|3|Nice tie but arrived wrinkled and I didn't feel getting it dry cleaned was worth it for such a cheap tie.
B000147652|5|I was really happy with this cincher.  It is very comfortable and breaths well in moderate temperatures. I have had it a month or so and washed it every week and let it air dry. It has kept its shape. I found that the size guide was accurate.  I also double checked size guides in other retailers just to double check.
B00AZNREXI|5|Looks great, fits great!
B00U12TRBK|5|super cute
B00AY4MM1M|5|It's so hard to find cute baby pants in black, and this one came with a nice set!  The pants are ribbed and stretchy, making it easy on and easy off for baby.
B0018P329W|5|I love the way these jeans fit,perfectly,always comfortable,I always have to get them hemmed up because I have short legs,I'm giving serious consideration of other colors,as long as they are available in my size.    Levis are an American icon in jeans,they have been around a very long time,my only disappointment is they are now made in China,says so on the tag inside them,but I like the fit so much,I bought another pair.
B00C2YSYDM|5|Really niece jacket special for my job that's working outside.Worth the money
B00DM28DB6|1|Not a good coat! the snow pants fit well, and both pieces are cute, but the velcro on the coat was sharp and cut my daughters chin
B00OK2RSYK|5|Soft, beautiful, ideal for casual or dress. I love the color and design.
B0073VOQEK|5|My wife and I had the opportunity to go to Rome in February of this year.  Before going, we had read all the travel literature we could get our hands on.  Rome is absolutely fascinating, but one thing that we read in the literature that concerned us was to beware of the many pickpockets throughout the city, especially on the trains. While surfing on the internet one day we came upon the Scottvest site, and we were sold. We both bought Revolution Plus coats for the trip, and they proved to be a great investment.<br />Throughout the trip, we wore our coats everywhere we went.  When it was cold, they kept us warm; when warm, we removed the sleeves and wore them as vests.<br />We were able to carry everything of value in our coats--money, cameras, passports, our water bottles, snacks, etc. in complete comfort.  The pockets are so balanced in the coat that we were not even aware that we were carrying such loads all around Rome for 11 days.<br />These coats are fabulous, and we recommend them to anyone.  Thank you Scottvest!
B008UZNV3U|5|super cute I absolutely love these. got a size s/m and it fit perfectly. (I'm very slim). came a little past the expected date but I wasn't in any rush
B00HUU8D34|2|Worked for the purpose but only could get one wear out of them, the color fabric started to peel in between the thighs.
B00FRKC9AC|4|Quality not bad. Material is soft, but sizing is big.
B001AQK0EO|5|I usually wear an XL and this vest fit this 220 LB . man perfect . And that is good when I go to biker rallies . This vest was made with some fine material the leather is soft and it feels good . I recommend it to all my friends because the price is right also. this vest was above my expectations .
B00K5T70G8|4|Very good quality and comfortable, correct fit.
B00SD324VY|5|Fits perfect, love the look.
B00KSKBL78|5|This summer plus size blouse fit so beautifully. It's gorgeous and one of my favorite blouses. It's not heavy at all and the material is so breathable. I got it in a real color and it's so soft and vibrant. I was given this long sleeve summer blouse at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B000WID03O|5|This was a HUGE hit at Easter when our grandson wore it at Easter Egg Hunts and for pictures with the bunny.  Everyone loved it!  It is the cutest little costume and definitely would purchase it again.  They delivered it quickly and was in excellent condition.  Thanks!
B00HV0CEQA|5|My daughter loves this necklace. Quick purchase great sale. Thanks
B00JUM2V4W|1|Beware: If you are ordering the black X-Large in these hoodies they are all coming as 2x hoodies. I ordered 8 of these, 4 in this order, 2 a few days later and 2 more a few days after that and ALL of them are labeled X-Large on the plastic packaging but opening them up reveals that they are all actuall XXL. I don't believe that this is the sellers fault unless they are putting the plastic around the hoodies
B00JJ5FIYA|2|The picture totally look different to me, and I don't like it at all.
B00LT1EJ1A|5|Prefect fit, love them
B005N70F4G|4|Super cute outfit! perfect for these weird fluctuating temps. The only snag is that the onesie that goes underneath seems to have weird shaped outlets, where my baby's legs go. So that when Im carrying her, it looks like she's wearing a thong over her diaper. I don't know about that, but if you put the pants on, you can't tell. Although i don't know if it feels like a wedgie for my poor baby, lol. overall super cute!
B00C51XCDO|5|Nice quality shirt!!
B00J36VL4G|5|Am very pleased with it
B00TKOQ506|5|It's a beautiful print and fit true to size for me. Love that it has adjustable straps. Very soft and comfortable. Great price! Will be able to wear it all year on it's own or with cardigans. Love it.
B003EE8NSK|4|The only negative I have to say about this shirt is that I smell like vingar. I had to wash it once but the t shirt did not shirnk and the image did not fade.
B00JN59O6E|4|Very cute
B005QR09A8|2|I live in Michigan and needed a head scarf to keep me warm as I walk throughout the winter.  This scarf was very flimsy and provided no warmth whatsoever.  I returned it immediately.  Company was very good about refunding my money.
B00AW0J7TS|5|I bought them for my husband.  They are a Perfect fit.  They look great  and they are well made and very inexpensive.
B008L56A3M|3|This robe shrunk a LOT as predictd by one reviewer but it ifs fairly well now.  However, I expected it to be a softer cotton after washing. Hopefully it will soften up eventually after wear and future washings.  Otherwise it appears to be a nice heavy weight and well made
B004U4RC8K|5|The picture explains itself!! I love these!!I'm so glad I bought. Of course the sizing is questionable depending on body curves. I wear a size 7 but I have curvy thighs so I went with a 9 just in case.(From my past experience) a little loose on the thighs but I can pop the jeans in the dryer and they'll fit. So if you have curves, really think of the sizing.
B00CO2XX2Y|5|good
B00LNCFSQA|5|Exactly what you see and fits amazing
B00G5HMU4G|3|Love the cover up but it is huge. I'm usually a 12/14.  Plan to return it for a medium
B00GYU49RU|5|The flower does cause the hat to drop but I just move the flower the side.
B00IABYIZO|2|Toooooooo large. Again the size chart was misleading.
B00TZKTYXA|5|Pleasantly surprised. Loved the material. And made in the U.S. Bonus
B00DQNFKMG|5|The cup size is just right, and I'm a G cup so it's hard to find a well fitting bra, the band is a little snug, but it's nothing an extender won't fix. And this is John's wife writing this review, not John ;-) .
B00NLNLN54|5|When u zip it up it looks pretty legit
B00JM4UOWY|5|Comfortable and awesome.
B001LNIAFM|5|Awesome thin jacket, perfect for the office! I read the other reviews that said to order up a size. I usually wear an x-small so I decided to order a medium just in case. It fits great! already ordered another color!
B000RXVJSC|3|I was really excited for this bra for the clear strap in the middle but there the cups are really, oddly flat.  I've tried on a lot of bras in my time and I've never encountered a cup so flat.  But, as you know, boobs come in all shapes so I would recommend this for flat boobs.
B00JZXHD26|5|Over twenty years ago I bought a Pendleton wool Native American pattern jacket that still looks new - that's with proper care and storage.  I saw this jacket on the Pendleton website and hesitated because of the price point.  When the Amazon price point dropped I ordered.  The xxl size fits perfectly and despite the form fitting look on the model it fits those of us who don't have form fitting bodies. I also buy the Pendleton blankets as well.  This is the perfect jacket for a dry Texas hill country and is bright enough to keep some idiot city hunter thinking you're a trophy buck.
B0007YXVLE|5|I have worn this style bra for many years and love it.  The gel straps are very comfortable and there's no indentations on your shoulders.  The bra offers the perfect fit and support for me.
B00DZ0NQ9O|5|This is my daughter's favorite shirt, it's such a comfortable material
B00NY2B40Q|5|Bought for Christmas and the wife LOVES them.. Currently her FAVORITE! Plus I scored huge points for buying her something &#34;cute and useful&#34; unlike the usual gift card..
B00CUGBX08|5|This is a great value. Very pretty bows in vibrant colors. They are a little loose on my 8 month old but she will grow into them.
B007KFZGVG|2|I first got the &#34;back support&#34; Glamorise bras and was absolutely delighted! I've only recently discovered I wear a U.S. size 40J bra, and have been trying a lot of different bras.<br /><br />Sadly, as much as I wanted to love this, I had already discovered the lift, support and comfort of Elomi underwire bras (in 40GG for me). However, when I'm just around the house and having to do housework or work outside on our property, this bra works fairly comfortably for that.<br /><br />It doesn't offer the amount of support I need for daily wear, thus I keep it for my &#34;work at home/property&#34; days, especially because I can be a heavy sweater when working! I don't want to ruin my good bras, so this one comes in to play during the above, or if it's laundry time again.<br /><br />I think if I were not so incredibly heavy breasted (with the dreaded &#34;Omega boobs&#34;), then this bra could have been a winner. It is worth a try if you're needing to start sizing up to find your properly fitting bra.<br /><br />EDIT: 19 July 2016<br />Deducted a star, so from three stars to two stars. I would not purchase this bra again-- there is just not the support and certainly no &#34;magic lift!&#34; I still like my &#34;back support&#34; Glamorise bras, and use them at night for comfortable &#34;hold.&#34; This &#34;Magic Lift&#34; bra doesn't even work for night time. I do NOT recommend this bra.
B00A37UK5U|5|I love the Vassarette Silken Heather bras, both push up and lightly padded.  They are comfortable, sturdy and do not show through clothing.  I also love the fabric.  They are really great and I plan to buy them again when my current bras need replacing.
B008QVL3C4|5|i love it i wish i can wear this everyday but that would be weird i highly recommend this vest the color is amazing
B0012OJP40|5|Fits perfect. Great quality.
B00I1EW1PE|5|The jacket is adorable!  My son looks so cute in it!  I'm looking forward to the next raining day just so that he can wear it! Haha
B00826WCAU|3|Needed hat for Jack Skellington costume. Fit o.k., but think it may shrink if washed. Very loose knit, a little short
B00JC030EW|5|Love these. They are pretty short which is not normal for me but i love them. Cute little fabric belt too. Cool stretchy material
B00407JMYE|5|I just returned from a two week trip to Southeast Asia and used this case for the first time. It was great and provided the security I wanted for my netbook. I like to use a mouse and zipped it into the pocket on the front so everything was together. I would highly recommend.
B00J8FVA0M|3|I read & reread the comments about sizing until I just couldn't read them anymore. My bust fit was most concerning, so I went with a size that seemed a bit large but had the right bust measurement for me. The dress arrived super quick (yay, Prime!) and was absolutely adorable. Great color, well made, fully lined, and the material is a great quality for the price... Unfortunately, I'm sending it back. The bust fit perfectly, but the rest of the dress is too large, roomy through the ribs and waist. And because it's well lined, alterations would be pricier than just trying a different size. :/ Hopefully the next Lindy Bop dress I try will be a better fit.
B00249E09C|5|These scrub pants are perfect for work.  They are exactly what I was expecting. I would definitely order these again.
B00BLW2QUI|1|It was a very cute shirt, but was to small. I wear a us medium and the Chinese XL didn't work for me.
B00BFRZI04|3|This is a nice looking JD cap, however it is the absolute lightest khaki i've ever felt. The hat feels cheaply made and it doesn't have the weight of my other similar caps. It is adjustable and fits as you'd expect.
B00NFC2GAW|4|Nice looking sweater.
B005QR76SQ|5|I bought these as a gift and wanted my own pair very good and easy to use and really works with the phones and tablets
B0068L69OG|1|I got these in the mail snd they were not the color as depicted.  Very disappointed. Didn't even try them on.
B007CPH6VC|5|I got this shirt for my husband and boy does he look sexy in it i'm almost afraid to let him out of the house!!
B00NIVAEG8|5|My husband loves this hat. He had wanted a wide brim hat that covered his face entirely and the back of his neck and one that was not too snug on his big noggin -and this is it! It does run big in my opinion. Some imperfections in the straw inter-weaving. The black fabric on the inside adds comfort on both levels of how it fits and in eliminating glare from the sun. The packaging is poor as the box is too small for the hat and there are some kinks on the brim but nothing so serious that compromised it's function.
B00LKW2S3E|4|It's a great looking top but runs a lil small. I'm a med/lrg top and had ordered a large. It's tight but beautiful just got to lose 5lbs to fit comfortable.
B00SY65CJG|5|Great buy!
B00DPQ8G16|4|Bought this as a gift in a VERY large size. The recipient loved the message and the large size. I was happy with the product.
B00JA0AO7K|5|I love this outfit.
B004HSN6O8|5|Wow this one... I mean I bought a similar material dress (long dress in black & yellow) last summer and I know the material is so soft and I trust this seller as well but this dress is magnificent! Can't wait to wear it to a party or a nice dinner with my man or whenever I wanna look fabulous! Lol!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!
B008J1Z0PW|4|Based on other reviews, these run a little small. I'm usually a small, so I decided to go with a medium. It's a tad big, but a small would've been too small. Since it's adjustable, I was still able to make it work. As for the style, I got the green one just in time for St. Patrick's Day. It's really cute on!
B00DZZQY0C|3|The  mask is alright. It's funny when you're around your friends, but isn't very realistic for when you feel like pranking someone into thinking you're an old man. They might think it's true from far away. The mouth doesn't move with the lips, but the eyes actually look good. You get what you pay for with this 60 dollar mask. It's not an extreme realistic pranking mask. I'd say it's more for Halloween.
B00NYBWZGY|5|small and sleek and handsome--could you want more?  if you want to carry your life around in your billfold, this is not for you.  if, however, you like to carry only the essentials--driver's license, 2 credit cards, cash--in a smartly designed and executed wallet, this is for you.  The primary difficulty is choosing from the several tantalizing colors.
B007KFZHMY|4|I wore this sports bra during a 6K run and found it to be very comfortable.  No wires means no digging into my armpits as other sports bras have done.  The mesh panel in the front means I do not have to worry about anything spilling out of the top of the bra and can wear low cut tee shirts without a problem.
B007O3SE40|5|Loved it, I will never buy a costume from another company that isn't from the US. It was woren to the Disney 1/2 marathon and made it through. Nothing ripped or dulled in the hot sun or drentched water and sweat. Thank you!
B00BJOH6PI|4|High quality material, needs to be washed a couple of times to get comfortable but very nice and will last for years.
B0042GK9O0|5|very good
B00YDXKRIU|5|If you're a fan of the Fab Four, Mark Lewis has created a classic image of the group with a moody use of color that's absolutely unique. It's a neat objet d'art that makes a great Beatles collectible!
B00DVW6XAK|5|I am so happy with these socks- they fit great and they feel comfy. I couldn't find black low-rise/ankle socks with NO logos at any stores-- this was the only place I could find them. I'm so glad that I got them!
B00BGIUIY8|3|The quality of the dress is good, but the fabric is not very elastic so the dress will not adjust to the body if you are skinny.
B00I3LAXBO|5|Perfect swim suit cover
B003YFSE60|4|It looks and feels nice but I am concerned that over time the letters will ware off but since I have just purchased this I will just have to wait and see, I hope I'm wrong.
B004PLNFOI|3|The material is very thin and I don't think it will last long.  The fit is not &quot;relaxed&quot; enough...not loose enough in the thighs.  These are NOT the same as the Levi's from years ago.  I will find higher quality denim somewhere else next time.
B000Y8G17O|5|These are very comfortable denims.  I had had a pair and wore them out.  Glad still available.
B00I1QIVJM|5|I bought this tuxedo for my son, who escorted his sister on stage during a pageant formal competition. I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on something he wore for about an hour, and this is a really great tuxedo for any occasion. The price is great and it looks way more expensive than it is. He felt great in it and got many compliments. I was concerned about the fit but I bought him the same size as he wears in street clothes and it fit great. Can't beat the price on this one, especially for something they will likely only wear once!
B0082A02K8|5|My kid (8 yrs old/ 121 cm) is into many kinds of sport but never American football, however he adores those pajamas, it looks cool and different than the usual kids pajamas and nothing is more comfortable than wearing this- according to my son :)
B001OLZ48C|5|Great quality & very helpful staff!
B00LWIN920|5|So I'm a woman with long slender fingers. I usually find men's gloves to fit me better. These are definitely waterproof, warm, and functional. The thing that I didn't expect was that the length of the gloves go up to my elbows like some serious oven mits. I pictured them more about half that length based on the pics. These would likely be very beneficial if u are a biker, working outside or just wanna make some serious snowmen. I got them for the snowmen and so far so good, but if I just wore them out and about when it was cold they would be definite overkill and I would look ridiculous.
B00OLJ02WM|5|Exactly as it should be.
B009DIG7PC|3|These are definately not for relieving the legs swelling during pregnancy.. or at least didn't worked for me.. Still hope to use them later when i can return to my running routine...
B00IP8XTCK|1|I ordered a small. Dress is too big, considering I'm 5'0 and 100lbs. Wish the material was spandex so it'd at least hug a little tighter. Details weren't printed as well as they should be. Will be  returning.
B00EVAIQ4C|5|I originally bought this as a gift for my friend but now I'm going to have to buy a new set for her sense I ended up taking these for myself. These are absolutely fabulous! The bows look exactly like the picture and their size makes everything look super cute. Honestly I'm way to excited over these, they're just so beautiful and even though my hair is kinda thin they hold so well! definitely would recommend and obviously gonna buy again.
B008OV9HU6|5|I love to wear these to the pool to work out! Good tight fit and stays put when ya get out looks reat colors are amazing I have all the different varieties. N2N does it agin other than hard to find itemin my size.
B00NPGIMNI|5|Perfect !!
B00DY3XCRI|5|my daughter love this coat very good and my grandson wear his coat..thank alot
B00PJ6WKKS|5|Fit great & the fabric is surprisingly heavy/thick.  High quality.
B00H8AD01Q|5|Loved this sweatshirt and the minion that's on t...
B003E3BS9W|5|Great costume.  I did stuff the wig with bubble wrap so that it kept its shape.
B00ICTENB8|5|Worth the wait...
B00IF55YWG|2|The size is way off and I will return this This runs much smaller than stated and if you do order it be aware of the size
B00OTM766Q|2|the shipping was waaay too slow - 8 B. Days. for the IRON FISTS, the white fade is DEFINITELY  not as flamboyant as the pic shows. Thank Clever lighting and photo shop for that. In real life they fade is WAAAAYY more subtle. As long as you head my warning and don't expect a bright white fade and picture a more light sanding Than you won't be disappointed like I was. In the end they're still levis and pretty nice shorts so I'll keep em bcuz my review is strictly to lower the expectations of the buyer for these exact shorts. I gave 2 stars cuz I'm coming from a pov that was expecting suhm else.
B007KEJBMW|5|This dress is fantastic! I'm 5'6&#34; and about 150 pounds with a curvy frame, and the dress looks like a million bucks on me, it flatters my curves without emphasizing any fat. It's very comfortable with really soft fabric. It feels really high end and is a great value for the price! The dress looks exactly like the picture and falls about to the knees on me.<br /><br />I was told the dress was gorgeous within minutes of leaving the house. I would highly recommend it!
B00AARJ2W0|5|nice material. fits slightly large for a medium
B000BZCHAA|3|This was my favorite Christmas present, until I washed it.  DO NOT dry with heat.  It shrinks quite a bit.
B005I33K5Q|5|The winter we had this year showed me that I got good value for money.  I now have gloves that will last me long time and I sure am glad that I bought these gloves.
B0052B8A5Y|4|I bought this as a compliment to my son's Jake and the Neverland Pirates costume so we could match.  I'm very happy with it overall.<br /><br />It isn't the highest quality, but it's way better than the cheap junk I'd looked at before.  It'll definitely last through a few parties or rounds of trick or treat.<br /><br />Starting from bottom to top, the boot toppers are what you'd expect, they tend to droop a bit, but I fixed that with a rubber band.  The pants are comfortable (but as was mentioned before, no pockets).  They're roomy enough for me (I wear a 33/30 and the medium was perfect) and they held together well enough.  The vest doesn't have any buttons, which is fine, except for the jabot, which I'll speak to later.  The jacket is the best part of the entire thing, really well put together and looks really great.  It fits about like it should, maybe just a tad small for me in the medium size, but I tend to straddle the medium to large gap usually.  The hat is okay, it's not as pictured here, so you may want to pick up something nicer or truer to the picture if you're a stickler for details.  I didn't have a huge problem with the hat, so I chose to stay with it.  The jabot looks great, but you'll definitely need an appropriate shirt to wear under the vest, so just expect that expense ahead of time.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great costume and I'm really happy I bought it.
B00063VS0C|5|I love this sun visor!!  The quality is first rate!  It is the right size for an adult sized head even though I did make an adjustment to it but that is because I have a big head... I had been looking all over for a well made sun visor and this one is the best I have ever purchased.
B00WHMS1C8|5|good quality
B00180OMIC|4|I'm 5'2 about 100 lbs and the small t shirt fits fairly as expected, but more-so a junior's medium for my size. It's always harder for shorter, smaller people to find shirts that fit without being too baggy around the waist or breast areas.  Other than the fitting, the product is well-made: durable material, bright coloring, and soft.  Would recommend to any Futurama fan!
B002QCWIHI|5|It came on time, it fits great and the material for the shirt is very quality.
B002AN6B9O|2|Material is a poor quality and very rough in texture.
B00MXZ4ZZQ|5|Great set
B00WRPZRSG|3|material is very thin. it looks cheap
B00AFJM5MC|4|I think its the perfect gift for the book reader in the family, It's such a funny saying & knew she would get a kick out of it.
B001SLF9MY|2|Not like the picture.
B003QPSKEE|5|Very good quality.  First tri-fold wallet.
B00AY4VWJA|2|I am 5' 2\\" about 115 lbs. and the regular size small was huge, especially in the shoulders, arms and chest. The arms are especially wide, roomy, and also long. The coat is also too stiff. The sizing is NOT accurate according to the size charts provided by Eddie Bauer - The coats are much larger than the measurements shown in the chart, and the 'Small' I received fit me more like a roomy Medium - I easily wore a down coat underneath. Overall, very disappointing because the attempted cut is so cute - But the finished product is just cheap looking and feeling, with a bad fit. Not wearable.
B00KVZYDKC|5|Bonita
B0053JV43A|5|Adorable costume,  price was right, and our son looks so cute in it for Halloween.  chaps run a little long, but everything else runs true to size for sure
B002MX6ZOI|4|These are absolutely lovely panties.  I have spent much more for panties that I thought were sexy, fit well, etc and these are a great value.
B0044QEBIS|4|Looks good. Fits nicely. I'm an Asian male (5'5&#34;) with an athletic/slim build and the size Small fit just right. Not too tight, not too loose.<br />The material is thin, but nice...doesn't appear cheap. Let's hope it is durable!
B0051D84MW|5|I ordered these to wear for work and am pleased with the fit (I'm tall). I went a size bigger to allow room to grow :) The quality of the pants is excellent.
B00IXF7U1G|5|Bought a size larger. For well with room to grow. Super cute and looked just like the picture. My daughter has received lots of compliments.
B00H5DLIVU|5|Loved it! great for my cat costume!
B00D82VFBA|4|I received this jacket today and was very pleased with it however if u r thick in the middle I suggest u go up a size it is fitted.  The leather is nice n soft and the style is perfect n will be for yrs to come.  The price is also fair for the quality of the jacket.
B00QWA85W2|3|These don't stretch so it hard to put on my baby.
B00T0B7DLE|3|Ordered by my waist size and they were too small so order the next size larger. Other than that I think they would be fine, 100% polyester wicb I like better than cotton they are lighter and cooler, may not last as long but for the price I will buy again just get a bigger size
B0014KZ2JE|5|I was impressed by the quality of the material. Light weight fabric which is very comfortable for me. I wear that through the summer season and it's so comfortable that I sometimes forget I'm wearing a high suit.
B005KST8IW|5|Looks great with my new hair. It arrived in a very timely fashion. Comfortable material. It's a good accessory to many of my outfits.
B007EI0GJQ|5|Quality is very good and the price is much better than Lobel's Store...I'm buying this again.
B007FCEX5E|5|As soon as I get over this back pain, really doing to wok with this corset this winter.  Summer it was to hot.  It makes one feel somewhat sexy realizing how good you look with it on, and how much better you'll look when your natural waist has lost those inches... which isn't as easy as one might think...bUT I HAVE THE FAITH
B007ZJRYBC|3|This wig did it's job.  My family dressed up as the Avengers for Halloween.  I needed a Thor wig for my husband, and for ten bucks, this was worth it.  It's not pretty, and there's nothing sexy about it, but when you're wearing a costume with fake muscles and a nylon cape, it completes the look and adds to the humor of the evening.  I have no regrets in this purchase, but if you're looking for long golden locks, I'd suggest going to a wig store for a \\"real\\" wig, not a Halloween prop.
B00LNWAM1G|3|Thought it was plastic not what I was hoping for.
B00FWDHM3I|5|I was skeptical about all the rave reviews I read here but was in a rush and didn't have time to shop, so I decided to take a gamble. To my surprise what the ladies said is true. This dress is elegant and flattering. I received so many compliments as the other ladies did, so I would definitely recommend it. I was a little confused as to what size to buy because you know the charts don't always translate to your body but this was true to size. I am 5'3 and I weigh 125. I would be considered to be a medium petite. I usually wear around a size 6, so I purchased a size Medium and it fit perfectly. As for the length it is right above the knees. The first one I purchased was white. The material is thick enough that you can't really see through but I used something under just to feel more secure. I loved it so much I bought one in every color!
B003NSBVAE|5|this is the ultimate bra !!...  no more cutting and binding for me.  comfortable for all day wear.. and washing in delicate ( no dryer) and really lasts !!!....  amazon price beats every other site
B00EY54BW0|5|So cute! Perfect for boys!
B004NNB0KY|5|Ordered Medium for my 5-yr-old.  Fits him great now, and still gives him a little room to grow.  Perfect.
B00DQ59IT0|1|I ask for a L size and It is like XS size.<br />I don't understand which is the reference of size that this supplier used.<br />:(
B00BU9QOVE|4|The product was delivered promptly. However, I returned it the next day. There was a face like image within the center of the ribbon that was very disturbing . I know the pattern is random, but the image was just too strange and disturbing.<br />The overall product was fine and sizing was fine. I would definitely do business with vendor again.
B001DDS6AE|5|My daughter had this same costume (smaller size of course) years ago and this is exactly the same just bigger.  Cute costume great for layering underneath if needed.
B00I38YIOA|5|This product showed up much quicker than advertised and is perfect. A+++
B00CE5D1FK|5|I bought a dozen of these in different colours. I totally recommend them. They're great fit, very comfortable and there is no VPL!
B00IEQZH1Y|4|shearer then I thought but cool and comfortable
B00E50AIVW|4|But that could just be the stretchy fabric.. I am keeping it because it still looks nice and it will go with everything.
B004M71RQ8|5|Nice wallet.
B00C7M1V3O|2|The color of the blazer in the picture is a pale yellow, however it is canary yellow. The cut in the picture give an illusion of some shape, however it is straight as described in the title... Boyfriend.<br /><br />Disappointed with the purchase.
B0067NB99K|1|(kid's review) I got this costume for Halloween a few years ago. I actually wanted a ghost, but Pac-Man was the only one they sold at my local costume store. In the pictures, the costume looked great. However, when I opened the package (it comes in a large plastic bag), something felt...off.<br /><br />First off, Pac-Man's mouth was not at all like the picture showed. It was really floppy and extended to the point where it barley looked like a mouth at all. Also, my version came with only one red shoe cover and 3 gloves, making me have to wear my regular shoes without covers. Despite this, I wore the costume and went out trick-or-treating with some of my friends.<br /><br />When I was wearing the costume, I expected a bunch of 80s parents to say &#34;That's Pac-Man!&#34; or something along those lines. However, most of them gave me weird stares trying to figure out what the costume was (which surprised me considering the likeness shown in the photo). Eventually I got tired and headed back to my house...where I found that Pac-Man's eyes fell off! No wonder people were confused! And they were somewhere outside-I wasn't getting them back. I later tried to glue some felt eyes on I made using superglue, but all it did was make the costume look worse.<br /><br />To be fair, the costume does have some cool features. For example, you can keep your head tucked inside the costume so it isn't peeking out of Pac's brain. The costume is also comfortable and easy to put on, albeit being extremely bulky on the outside. But if you don't like being a demonic yellow circle with a dangly mouth, no eyes, and 3 hands for Halloween, this costume probably isn't for you.
B0081FQKXC|1|this coat was way to small, not the mentioned size per chart. Waste of money for S&H. Very disappointed, because the fabric wasvery nice.
B00MI6GNRI|5|My wife likes this shirt and is pleased with it.
B00P1G066Q|5|Yeah love it
B000A0LRCK|5|Great quality, built to last.
B00EUMSGW8|1|I want my money back.I dont use this product and i return to amazon.
B00MOUEOYM|5|My husband loves it!!  He wears them for shoveling snow or while out on patrol.
B004P8FTJ0|4|For help with sizing, I am 5'5'', 140 pounds, bra size 36B or 36C and ordered a Medium.  It fits well.  It isn't a fitted style, it's loose-fitting which I like since I am wearing it in very hot weather and it allows air to circulate well.    The orangey-coral color is very bright but I like it.  The fabric has a lovely natural subtle sheen to it and is very lightweight, soft and quick-drying.  I have worn it a few days in a row in hot sweaty weather cycling a lot and it doesn't smell.    Support: depending on your bra size and your body shape, you may want/have to wear a bra underneath this tank even though it has a built-in shelf bra.  This is because the top is quite low-cut (don't buy this tank if you don't like low-cut tops!!)  For this reason the top seems more geared towards the city end of the scale - for going out - and it can be a flattering top.  But if you want to use it for hiking, yoga or other sports it's a bit too low cut and unsupportive without something underneath.    The racerback and gathering at the neckline look good and overall I really like this top.    I would give it a 5th star if it were not quite so low-cut. I would prefer it to be more suited to practical (athletic) wear.
B00AEO1L6O|5|Title says it all. They are durable, they never slip down your heal, and the do what they claim.<br /><br />I've been through other brands (Calvin Klein and other such Macy's mens dept brands) and they have all fallen apart and been horrible.<br /><br />These socks wear like a normal athletic sock, not a weak dress sock.
B00F0O8H6K|4|Not large it fits good , is just a little too long.
B00A76OYMW|4|I bought this dress reading the previous comments and did a very good purchase. My friend has a cocktail wedding soon which this dress will prefectly fit.
B00D83PWE0|3|This item was okay, but after I washed it once, the next time I wore it, it got little balls of fuzz on everything! I wore a jacket over it and had fuzzies all over my jacket and my leggings that I wore with it.
B00ACIGNH4|5|Great deal!
B002KMJGLU|4|good
B00GGBQBY6|5|The small is a little big on my daughter but as fast as they grow I expect this not to be an issue. The shirt is great! My daughter loves it!
B00E1LB3SC|5|Got this for my girlfriend and it arrived after her nipples were pierced. WOW! Nice and stretchy and showed off every little bit of her! She doesn't like that it shows off her tummy (she says she is fat, but her cute little tummy is SO SEXY!) and she refuses to wear it out. I will work on that.
B00DYNPGF4|5|Awesome underwear!
B00MM1M1MU|4|These pants feel really soft, they look cute but the \\"140\\" size, which I assumed would be European 140 (for 140cm height), are exactly the length and width of US 5T with 17\\" inseam.  Since they are labeled \\"winter,\\" I suppose they should be full length... My 8-yr old is 128cm, her current pants have 23\\" inseam, so the 140 size should be even longer.  Too bad I have to return.
B005LLYOIW|5|Love the rich color and adjustable strap. Great quality.
B00VIIX2WG|3|Nice shirt but it runs extremely small. Purchased an XL, disappointed...more like a girls XL.
B00RGH00R8|1|I'm a size 4, so I order the medium in American size. I have to button at the very end of it and there were 6 rows to clip button and feel like they give me the small in Chinese size. regret bought this item.
B00M550CCE|3|Wasn't the style that I expected.  It's a nice dress, but didn't look good on me.
B00GOBAHV6|5|Love these!! They fit perfectly and stay up on my hips/waist. I don't have to keep pulling them up every few minues like most winter-tights. Some people were complaining about how they are not brushed interior, but i don't know what they are talking about. It isn't super furry inside, but there is a thin brushed layer on the interior.<br /><br />These tights are perfect for cool fall/spring days, I haven't worn them in the winter yet, but I think so long as the day isn't too cold, they'll be fine. I get holes easily in tights, but I've already worn these a bunch and the quality seems to be really good.<br /><br />These are exactly what I was looking for.
B008PS2F5C|5|I ordered these Jeans in 2013. Still wearing them with no problems at all....Looking to buy more.
B00A0AGQ30|5|With this top, my friend's tummy is invisible!
B00I0WRRLK|5|i bought this shirt for my boyfriend and he loves it! he wears it all the time and it fits him perfectly. shipped very fast & actually arrived sooner than i expected. great product, no complaints here :-)
B005DKDPPY|5|These pants deliver great quality, great fit, and great comfort. I have washed them many times now and the color still holds well. No shrinkage issues or anything whatever. They feel so soft. I love them. They may seem expensive, but you are getting true quality. I am very picky when it comes to buying clothes, but I'm also price-conscious. I think these pants were a good deal as I don't have to see them fade and have a need to buy a new pair.
B000E153FM|3|Although the cut is slim and is meant to be pretty tight in certain places i found it that when ordering it'd be best if you go a size up just for comfort
B003LA3TWW|5|This product was a great purchase. It was cheap and I wear it all the time whenever I wear dresses or skirts. Highly recommended.
B00AJTAIM2|5|Excellent fleece (light and thin, is that micropolar?) and adorable pattern. Fits perfect on my 11 yo girl, who is average in size.
B00AB62PQK|1|Terrible tie terrible service
B002LSI39Y|3|Like the pants, except for the color.  Described as Khaki but instead has a greenish tone.  Was informed that all dickies brand are the same.
B00GY4V3JI|5|Very warm and comfy. Not to heavy.
B00E2ZNPGU|5|Really warm and stays on my squirmy one year old.  Love that the mittens have elastic on the wrists and no thumbs.
B000ZQAFIQ|5|Perfect for armed robberies, or heists as well as kidnapping and burglaries. I only use it to scare people. Lol. Don't do those other things.
B00CC3MQ3W|5|No negative feedback great service
B0018OMIMK|1|Comment on 505 Regulars.<br />Didn't bother trying them on because I could always trust Levis sizes.  It's been about 8 years since I bought new ones because my old ones lasted so long.... tried these things on and couldn't believe how silly these jeans are!! Are they designed for punks? Or maybe designed by punks.. In short they are Light Weight, Hip Hugging, Short Crotch, Short Pocket Punk Pants. Levis claim they &#34;Sit At the waist&#34;... but if you measure the rise against my old 505s they are a full inch shorter! and yet they still call these jeans 505 Regulars? The thigh is smaller... the pockets are about 1 inch shorter...WHAT A JOKE
B001EIO6YS|5|It is very hard to find a belt that is well constructed and doesn't cost a lot.  This belt seems to be what I have been looking for, but only time will tell.
B00HU0NRTY|5|Well made and cute!!! The coloring is not as shown though. The orange is more of a tangerine color...and the blue is less like a denim blue. I'm satisfied
B004ARZKJA|3|Nice Dockers quality, but they are definitely not permanent press.  They are incredibly wrinkled when they come out of the dryer.  They must be ironed, if you prefer a pressed look.
B00I83X9KY|1|I HAD TO GIVE THEM 1 STAR TO WRITE THIS REVIEW. I ORDERED THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MADE SENSE. I AM A SIZE PETITE SMALL. I ORDERED THIS IN MEDIUM, BUT IT COULD PROBABLY FIT A FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD. I TRIED TO PUT IT ON AND MY FINGURE WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE MATERIAL. THESE PEOPLE ARE REAL THIEVES. GIVE YOUR MONEY TO CHARITY, BUT DON'T LET THESE PEOPLE STEAL IT FROM YOU.
B007GB8EYU|4|Love these pajamas on our little guy. These are 100% cotton, so they do shrink quite a bit. Our son is 9 months old and a little taller than average. We bought him the 18-24 month size and they fit pretty well with some room to grow.
B0007YXRV8|5|This fit is perfect and no underwires to bind and pinch--Ilove this style as the straps stay where they are supposed to stay.
B0024VFRX8|5|American Flag Embroidered Patch Gold Border USA United States of America... what I ordered and what I wanted, it's alright.
B00FJ90368|5|love it perfect
B001G6MNA2|5|These shorts a great fun gift.  Uniquely packaged, and a great gift for anyone who loves bears!
B00CRXHRCM|4|nice rice and my dad likes it !
B00O6T5HX6|2|It is odd. Sometimes odd is good but not in this case. In fairness I don't think it was mis represented but its just not great. The belt is wide at parts and narrow at other parts.
B000P32BBI|5|These are outrageously wonderful warm and wonderfully beautiful socks.  Colors and textures far better than photograph can show.  The smoke hue is incredible-a rich, warm charcoal.  The turquoise is just brilliant and beautiful.<br /><br />Fit is generous, working for women with larger feet and ankles, including a real size 10.  Stretch is knit into the fabric, so these will never leave an elastic mark on your ankles.  These socks truly cradle your skin.<br /><br />I have circulation problems in my feet and these warm fuzzy socks have earned the title \\"new favorite\\".  So comfortable, warm, and outrageously satisfying that I am going to order more right away.<br /><br />Recommended as a gift for women of all ages!
B00A4JTDEQ|5|Our whole family lives this show.  We choose a family ornament for the tree each year and this is the first time one got a unanimous vote.
B001PO6JDM|5|This a very good bra.  A winner!  I have bought them in all colors offered.  I highly recommend this bra.
B00PY504A2|1|Dress was too small, very see through and thin material and overall very cheaply made.  Wouldn't recommend.
B00S9X8I0Y|4|Vey much like thee colors, fit well
B006G7JZAM|5|Fit well on my son
B0000AT8HE|5|Great Jeans.  Fit my old body just right. Well built too
B00GFMS5WM|4|these socks are well cushioned, soft, and comfortable. i have used gold toe socks before and they last much longer than your average pair. they seem a little big until you wash and dry a couple times, they shrink just enough for a better fit. im a size 10 shoe but they have plenty of stretch for larger sizes. they handle moisture fairly well keeping your feet dry in average conditions. i did receive one bad sock in a pack of eight, it had a hole from bad stitching.
B00M59JKCS|5|great!
B00AQAZW34|5|very comfortable fit and true to size.
B005JCDYHA|5|I love these pants. They fit really comfortable and are really durable. I had bought the olive colred ones like 7 months ago and are holding up really strong still. These are in my opinion the best work pants I've ever purchased. Thats why i ordered these black ones and will be ordering more. I love them because I am 6'4 around 240 lbs and these feel awesome unlike the more expensive levis I own. I would definitely recommend these.
B003XU6RRY|1|Guess you get what you pay for.  Got this for my dad and when I looked at his other belt of superior leather and craftsmanship, was disappointed with the quality of this one.
B005CWNYUO|2|I have little faith in the material and build quality of this somewhat fuzzy and thin fabric. We will see after the first washing.
B00X9VJLHU|3|Elastic waist very tight, babies that age have tummies and diapers so need more play in waistband.
B001CBCMFW|5|I found this on sale after Christmas and it matches the PJ's by Nick & Nora.  My daugther loves it.  Most of the elephant print is on the inside and the outside is very soft and comfy.  She wears it all the time when she is lounging, and coming from an NON PJ / NON ROBE type, this speaks volumes.
B003ZN4YUQ|1|I bought this bra because it had great reviews and looked comfortable. I looked at the sizing chart and ordered an xl plus (I'm a size DD/E). I got it and it was way to small. I figured since it was the biggest size they had and it's maternity, I would be okay. I tried it on and I was spilling out. The straps are thin and not a lot of adjustment room. If you have a larger bust this is not the bra for you. The straps cut in and the bra itself does not offer enough comfortable support. It looked like I wasn't even wearing a bra and just was overall uncomfortable. For the price this bra is a complete rip off.
B00KMQ9ZTO|5|This is a beautiful quality made Jacket. I am so impressed with the quality of the wool & leather. I bought it for a my grandson not knowing if he would like or wear it and he loves it! The pricing was fantastic for such a well made product with the bonus of it being made in the USA!
B00HUS796I|5|Sturdy, soft, nice colors.  They hold up well washing after washing.
B00JZBX2IC|5|Nice they work well
B004VODA7G|4|It's a bit small on our two year old son, but with the straps, we can tie it on anyway.  The straps are important because he rips off hats that aren't tied on, and then he gets burnt in the sun.<br /><br />Everyone loves it on him too.  Cute.
B00DYSS3OK|5|lindo
B0012Q2NLU|1|I ordered a large and I recvd a medium.  The mediums are too small.  Probably should have ordered an x-large.
B00OBU7K1C|4|It's a beautiful cardigan that looks and feels great. The only downside is the fabric is very thin.
B0078Z0SXE|3|scratchy, wear hose or a half slip underneath.
B00GDGAK9Q|5|The quality of this robe is excellent and the length is perfect
B0098I34OO|4|The print on these is so incredibly cool. They don't stretch very much, which is kind of inconvenient. They also kinda fall down past your crack throughout the day. Either need to wear a longer shirt or constantly pull them up. Will see if they were worth it.
B00MM3OD8S|5|This was incredibly beautiful! I still can't believe the price! It was a hit! My 2.5 year old loved it. The packaging it arrived in was the only bad thing. The bag came wrapped in so much tape it required scissors to open. I accidentally cut the costume a little. :( other than that, this was better than the pictures show!
B00OBHQV7O|5|Great!
B008CN7T5Q|5|I was really pleased when this robe arrived. The fit is great & it feels soft & comfy! For the price it is a real great buy!
B00EECKQ6S|5|I like the style and fabric texture of these pants.  I am quite satisfied with this purchase and recommend them to anyone considering pants for casual or business wear.
B00SGC23ZE|4|A cool top to wear loose and cute.
B00TXCM2CA|5|I was given some BluErro socks to try and I have to admit that while the socks looked nice to me, I didn't think they would be that different from other socks I owned. I mean, sock are socks, and I had a whole drawer of black socks already that seemed just fine. But I have to say that these are now my favorite go-to socks. Once I tried them on, I found I really liked how soft and comfortable they were. They looked and felt like high quality socks. There are thicker, cozier styles this company makes (which I also own), but this thinner, black/gray style works great at home and for work for me. If you want a soft, good-quality sock that will last (I hate having to buy new socks every few months when they get holes in them), then I definitely recommend these.
B000NZWX8O|5|So, you think you are you ready for this shirt? Why, because you managed to strut around in that old wolf one? Well, let me tell you: this is a whole new ballgame - and you might find yourself out of your league!<br /><br />If you could barely control the effects of the wolves, attempting to slip right into the Big Ape without further consideration is beyond irresponsible. Civilizations have came to an end for less.<br /><br />You too may sport opposable thumbs but do you have the titanic strength of Kong? Can you match his fierce pride? His territorial jealousy? His unstoppable anger? I did not think so.<br /><br />Move along now. What ever made you think you could handle Kong?
B00T46ZEAM|3|Top too tight
B00SNOHSDC|5|I just love this top it is more fitted at the top and than flowing at bottom , I purchased an extra large and I usually wear large and I'm glad I did , as I have a thick mid section  I love the feel of the material and the way it fits at the neckline it open but not to low as to show more than I want to , I purchased in a few other colors and I love them all , thanks for all the variety of colors , I recommend to any age group women  I love LOCk and LOVE  brand for my tops more than the others
B00CI1HWMI|5|I needed a long petticoat for a special dress I wear for renissance festival. The dress is very heavy so I was worried about the petticoat structurally. Tried it on tonight and it's perfect!! I'm 5'8&#34; and it stopped at my above the ankles like it should. The train portion is sturdy. Very happy with my purchase. Quick delivery too!
B008Y96KDU|2|I don't like it
B0077CO5V4|5|Great value! I bought one too large but am happy to buy one that fits.
B00AESCSPS|5|I'm 39 and too old to wear ripped up boyfriend jeans. These are my new favorite. They fit perfectly in 16 and very hip but classy...wore them to my freshman basketball game with my favorite flats and a cute sweater poncho. My friend bought a pair too. It's hard at 39 not to fall into younger styles..but still not look like your 50 quite yet :)....These would be very cute at 59 too. Thank you Levi.....
B000SKLM7W|2|I bought these under the impression that they were identical to my military clips. A side-by-side comparison revieled that they were quite different.  The over all quality of metals and how they were fitted together is lacking.  The metal is quit soft and can be bent with in your hand.  Also, they spring open about 3/8ths of an inch.  I bent them so that the would slide in better only to realize that the added tension of the spring was the only thing keeping it closed (other that gravity).  Also the slides stick up farther when closed and have a smaller loop size.  They do however, perform their job, just not a neatly as the higher quality ones.  On the real clips the loop at the top of the slide should be a paper width from the top of the clip when closed.  Like those that black hawk seems to be selling.
B00WLIC3GS|3|It's a bit too tight for comfort. My husband loves it, but I will only wear it for him. Beautiful suit, but just not for me. I will only wear it privately.
B00SMHB0SY|4|Loved the quality of the product but did seem smaller than expected.  Not sure it will last through this season.
B00M2ZLLUY|4|Very nice
B00D3G16L0|5|All good
B00C9VN9KG|5|Never seen this color Carhartt before so, I was beyond excited when I found it! It is a little darker in person but, still super cute!
B00SMA45V0|2|The bottom runs very small I'm a medium and I ordered a large I should have ordered an extra large
B00ARH92PA|1|I bought 2 pair of these shorts in size 34. It would be generous of me to say they were only size 32. And this was before washing...
B001H0FQJ2|5|Good quality
B00QXXVGC4|5|Nice long hanger, sturdy holder, elegant and nice weight to it. Box, bag, and cleaner cloth all exactly as described.
B009K676BG|5|I love this dress.  It is comfortable and I adore the pockets.  The fit was great and true to size.
B0051HFHXW|1|I order my exact size that i alway get. The leg holes were too small.  Is this a misshapened package??  Very disappointed
B00OVUY25O|4|I wear this to work everyday and love this. I have everyone wanting one at my job.
B00PXYLREG|5|Fabulous skirt! Fits like a charm! Im 5'7 and around 125 pounds.. And i got a large.. Already ordered my next skirt! Very wonderful product, not too thin, not too thick. And a wonderful length.. Goes to about mid thigh. Very pleased with the product
B00MDHX7LM|3|OK
B008HNJ89G|5|Stripes and the color are really solid enough to give the shirt a decent look.The material looks rich in quality and wrinkle free.Good buy!
B000VKSOB6|2|There is virtually no stretch in the waistband of this thong at all.  The fabric is quite stiff as well.  I can usually wear a small or medium with other brands but I would've had to order an XL for this one to fit.  Returned it.
B00F4SDHEO|1|I purchased an xlarge because of the reviews stating how small this shirt is.  I usually wear a medium or large in shirts depending on the style.  The Xlarge large was still way too small, so returned the shirt.
B00OXSP1FE|1|Is to small.
B00PXALL32|5|I'm very happy with the scrubs. The pants and shirt are both made with good quality materials. And they were delivered exactly the time it was expected to be here. The only thing I was a little disappointed with was the pants were still a little too long for me. But that's not the sellers fault. I just have to shorten the legs up a little bit. I would like to see more extra small petite scrubs for us smaller ladies! That would be nice. But other than that, I am very pleased with the outfit and delivery time and the quality. Thanks again!
B00XKOWQFK|5|These boxer briefs have my stamp of approval. My only regret is not buying a size larger. Even though they are one size too small, they fit really nicely still. I'll be keeping them needless to say.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Very comfortable fit<br />Shows off your package<br />My SO has noticed and other benefits have been gained because of it<br /><br />CONS:<br />No flap in the front<br />Shows off your package<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase. Comfortable, flattering and purchased at an unbeatable price. I definitely encourage those wanting to experiment with &#34;sexy&#34; underwear to give these a shot.
B0098HRFTA|5|This is a very cute shirt.  The material is soft and after being washed and dried it didn't shrink.  It is true to size-I Have a chunky 1 year old son and the 18 month shirt fit him perfectly.  This shirt will look great on him once the weather gets cooler!  I would recommend this shirt!
B00N3XEWDC|5|Fits great, looks great
B00KET339M|5|Like everyone says, it isn't laced how I would prefer it laced. But for a costume corset it's very attractive. Perfect for club wear or just playin in the room. My husband loves it. The sizing chart worked good for me.
B00ENG7WGM|5|waw i love it
B000TA529A|5|Good
B00LM3N7W2|4|The gray knit section is a somewhat lighter and very slightly different gray that the shirt. I have bought knit backed shirts from Patty Boutique before and the knit usually fades faster than the shirt. I bought gray because its harder to tell when it fades, I am betting that the fade will even things out.<br />Beautiful shirt and it fits great and is very comfy.
B009DH4W2S|5|This dress was perfect. The fit and the look were beyond expectation. Would recommend to anyone. Made her look like a perfect angel
B0041QT212|5|Yay yay
B00LJJISQE|5|I'm always looking for I Love Grandpa merchandise and this was just what I wanted. A perfect Christmas gift.
B00HV6GFOG|4|very good！
B00LBDYK10|5|Purchased for a Winter excursion to NYC and it was perfect. Cannot beat this quality & warmth at this price point. Highly recommend.
B0013FXZYO|2|Cup size was odd, seemed too wide and open at the top. Would not order again. The body portion fits nicely aside from the ribbing which bows when you sit. Unhappy with purchase
B000GISJRC|4|generally a great deal for what you pay...a little tighter in the elastic than i would prefer, but then, i have thick thighs.
B00PY579MI|5|Fits well and looks great
B00LA7W4GA|5|The color and fit was exactly as described
B0007YY8Z2|5|I don't have big cup nor my breasts are sagging, so this wireless bra is perfect for me.  I like it thin but no show through with blouse or t-shirt and it is full coverage! I tried it on at Mervyns and bought a couple, but it don't have the other color in my size. I recommend shopper need to try bras on at least in a department store first, then buy it online with the  size you want and color with cheaper price!
B00DQM58SI|3|I bought these for myself but they were way too small. They did fit my 11 year old daughter though...
B009X59BYE|4|They fit well and look fine.  They just feel thicker and different than I expected.  I might get used to them and order another batch.
B006M6IOWC|4|Excellent and quality is worth buying an average of under Premier Thank you for your service, we will continue to seek
B004R8PWKY|4|I've worn a few different brands of pocket t-shirts and I thought for a minute I had came close to perfect with these. Then I noticed how short the sleeves were, they want to creep up towards your armpits. The fit and length are good, doesn't hang on you like a curtain as others do. Wish these had sleeves more towards the elbow and offered more colors. Wish maybe others would make pocket tees with wicking also. But really the sleeves are too short.
B00JNQBB1E|3|Dull color, light yet warm
B00IWLTGQS|4|I have been separated from my husband for about 4 months because of work  and bought this for fun and games. it was a little small for big girls but it done the trick.
B004QUMVNO|5|Very soft and easy to wrap.
B000Y8ENNS|5|I have already returned these and want to order the next larger size (36X30)
B00PIQ3ZB2|5|Great shirt with a really cute pattern. People ask us where we got it when we're out and about. A good buy for the price.
B009PMJUNC|5|Great product! Good construction. Fit my 3yo and 13mo beautifully. Will keep for future use at weddings, holidays and other special occasions.  Thank you.
B007IQKUZO|5|I bought this for my daughter last year and got compliment after compliment on it. I love Bonnie Baby! The materials are fantastic and the price is great for a boutique-like look. The outfit washed nicely and it never stained (despite having a sweet-potato loving baby).
B00L4GPLUI|5|This jacket turned out to be more beautiful than what the picture shows. It is super cute! I would recommend future buyers order a size or two above what they would normally wear. For instance I wear a medium, but I ordered a large to be on the safe side. The large fits snugly and very nicely. This jacket turned out to be better than what I expected. This jacket is also made from 100% vegan materials, but is a great knock off for a real leather jacket! I am vegetarian, so I am so happy to have found a cruelty free jacket that doesn't sacrifice style!<br /><br />All of the zippers and the buttons function correctly and the color is a very nice black. I honestly couldn't wait to wear it!<br />The jacket arrived on time as scheduled, and was in a plastic wrapping. The jacket was in perfect condition!<br />For the price, this is definetly worth it! I bought one similar to this jacket for $50-60 and the quality was slightly poorer. But for nearly half the price and better quality, this jacket is the better pick!!<br /><br />I would purchase this product again and again!
B00LTPD5A2|5|American sized!!! (YEA)  If you get the correct size it is very comfortable and nicely nips you.  I have three so far working on 7 total for everyday of the week.
B00DOPKLMU|4|This is a beautiful jacket, just as described. I knew from previous comments that the sizes were smaller than average. I took the chance anyway, and, sure enough, it was way too small.
B00IQ6TITO|3|I ordered the 18 month size, the pants were HUGE, so HUGE that we had to safety pin them and roll them (he is the 97 percentile for his height and 59th for weight, 14 months old) but the shirt was TOO SMALL!  we had to roll up the arms, because we couldn't button the sleeves and the sleeves hit mid forearm.<br /><br />Thankfully the vest fit perfectly, the tie was super cute and we will be able to use the pants in the future and i will just find a new shirt to wear with it. Really for $15 it wasn't bad!
B00N9C77G6|5|Everything and more than I hoped for. Warm & light weight. Wicks away moisture to keep you even warmer.  price was a bargain for this type of sock. We do lots of outdoor all season sports ? we've tried every type of sock out there. Im going to go order more now.
B00MY63ZLO|5|Love it... Love the color... love the fit... Great service
B00NV34PW2|2|Ordered 2x & it fit my size 0 daughter! So disappointed!
B00MTZUYEQ|4|This went great with my daughter's Halloween costume. She was Princess Peach.
B00GR4R0MY|5|lots of compliments!
B00KNG0QJG|4|I love the zippers on these jeans and I hope that they won't eventually stretch out as other people have reported on here. They fit me well though, so I'm happy.
B005ESMAEM|4|I saw the recommendations that if the size chart calls you a size small, order medium... So glad I did! My friend ordered the medium because that was her &#34;size&#34; according to the chart and it fit but the graphic was all stretched and the dress itself was uncomfortable.
B00RCYGJ70|2|The shoes did not fit my daughter. They were toooooo big. Very cute shoe for the money though. I altered them myself to fit her properly! I ordered 12 months and these fit an aprox 3-4 infant
B00LN0RP8Q|5|Fantastic.I have six set's of Vanity Fair pajamas and I would recommend them Highly.Extremely comfortable and wash beautifully.
B0042D6LWM|1|I have worn the previous version of this bra with no problems.  The newest one I bought left me with oozing blisters.  I am calling their headquarters tomorrow.  Do not buy this bra.  I have never had a reaction from any bra before.  So upset.  I can't even wear a bra right now.  Terrific.
B00TF178F0|2|I orderd a XLarge and it fits me small!! Very snug and normally I also buy med size pants, so thinking these would fit. Also  very very tight on the leg area.
B0072DEXEW|4|good space for credit cards
B00CU6GG3C|5|GRANDSON LOVES THEM.  THESE OUTFITS ARE GREAT FOR COLD NIGHTS.  HE CAN WEAR THIS WHEN HE PLAYS WITH HIS TRAIN.
B00DN1C5NI|5|Outstanding fit and very comfortable to wear at the grill or oven area.
B0058YRL9G|5|Fits good, wears good. Excellent price
B00P0DQ4KM|5|This waist clincher is great! It's exactly what I was looking for. It fits me perfectly right the box. I LOVE it and it is super comfortable. I planned on wear a lot and can see ordering another size soon!
B00KCR1PGO|5|Great quality, very confortable
B004N7T4SK|5|Doesn't bulge too much. Doesn't itch or pinch. Covers you well for men with some &#34;junk in the trunk.&#34;
B00GD60I4I|5|I bought this for my just turned 11 year old son. He has to roll up the waist one time, but doesn't care.  He is 55 inches. The are comfortable and he finally has something that matches his green brazil shirt.
B007XD8TG4|5|I bought these in black for my little boy, zutano makes the best little booties and these are our 2nd pair.  I have the thicker fleece ones as well that are great for winter.  I layer a pair of socks under these for the colder days.  My baby is 5.5 mo old now and the 6 mo size is fitting exactly from heel to toe so I'll be purchasing a new set of 12mo soon.  We used them from early on as they stayed on perfectly even with the extra room in the toe as he grew into them.<br />Also just bought a pair for a baby shower present and I tell all new moms about these, especially when I see their baby's socks falling off :)
B00DTUOCDY|4|I got a medium and usually wear a medium.  I could have gotten a small to fit better.  Also, while it is slick and shiny, it's somewhat annoying because I have to tie it tight to keep it closed and really pay attention when I'm doing something or it will have slipped opened.  This is even with a interior tie.  It does have pockets, which I like.  I will keep it but next one will be a cotton blend.
B00LEJH694|4|Very nice and comfy yoga pants.
B001BF3G90|4|I owned this model and brand before.  I ordered online for convenience, and all was as expected.  Comfortable and I didn't have to leave my couch!
B001HL2BU8|4|the one on picture look different and the one look  received small ... but they did  say one size !  .... maybe put the actual size on the posting ...hope this help
B002CCF2FM|4|I like simple design dress, and this is good for me.  Also the seller accepted kindely my hope which is changing backside design.  If I tell the trouble, the detail of the reached dress was different from the photograph.  But I don't care and I am satisfied.
B00FQIJTVW|5|I like using handkerchiefs because I always have one on hand and also I protecting trees by not using tissues.
B00SKPNF9U|5|Fit perfectly. Every time I wear it, I receive complements!
B00IMFR7MO|5|Great fitting sweater and nice weight. WIll buy again!
B0083EZDS4|5|Fits well and I wear with pride.
B0023UNUZW|4|Just back from three weeks in Argentina where it's late summer--temps in the mid-80's. This shirt was loose fitting and comfortable for the weather, looked good with jeans or khakis, and laundered well. [I'd say the shirt runs a little large for the size]. I'd recommend it.
B003BVJ3M6|5|My gf loves this she said it is worth the effort to get in to it. It is soft and she looks great in it.
B00I1YBZOC|2|Didn't fit good and was too loose. Not slim fit. Terrible fit
B003ESZQZY|5|lots of pockets, like 8. Cute change purse, but don't fill it up too much. Gotta put bills in carefully so the wallet doesn't bulge. Super soft, cute and overall a nice wallet. Magnetic button on it works great and is quick. :D
B00F13NABC|5|I love this sweater it's so warm. (: I wear I with leggings all the time.it fit as expected,came on time and looks just like the picture
B002EV3EWY|2|I bought this helmet for a Greek warrior costume I was putting together.  In the photos it looked really cool, but when I got it it was made with very flimsy materials.  It looks OK, but you have to be very careful not to set it where it will be squished (it is paper thin plastic sheeting held together with velcro).  The good news is, if I wear it, it is SUPER light weight, so it doesnt' get hot or weigh me down.  The downside is if you take it off, it can be crushed by a large housefly.  All in all, I got what I paid for ($10).
B002XFI83G|5|Great work pants
B00K76ZIWM|4|good quality materials, shipping in a timely manner
B00V65HLG4|2|I'll begin by saying that I'm a pretty slender person. I'm 5'8&#34; and about 115 pounds. I expected these pants to fit like normal leggings, that is, form fitting all around.<br /><br />The product was decent quality. 100% cotton, not very soft but that might change when I wash them. The tag says to dry clean for the first wash but I plan on washing them in a bucket with cold water instead.<br /><br />Okay, now on to my problem. If I was 9 months pregnant with twins, these would be perfect! As it is, I am not pregnant. The amount of extra fabric in the front is astounding, and yes, I had them on the right way. There was more space for a belly than for a bum. I'm including a few pictures showing how they fit when I wore them right way on (the first two pics with more extra fabric) and backwards (the last two pics with less extra fabric), since my butt filled in most of the space in the front of the pants.<br /><br />My only real complaint here is that the description of these leggings did not convey the style of legging. Maybe the extra space in front is a normal cultural thing, but it sure doesn't show it in the photos.
B00AKFXB4M|5|I'm happy with them. They are not baggy which some are too baggy. They don't look stupid. I've had trunks that were baggy and would look like floats in the water. Not these.
B0009MZVO4|5|These are great socks!
B000MOW78M|5|These are the best! They're super comfy, good elastic, and they don't ride up. It's REALLY hard to find undies in this style that are well-made and don't creep (I'm a size 12, so I have some junk in the trunk). But be aware, Fruit of the Loom makes a different style that they sell 6 packs of and those are different- not nearly as good. You have to get the product line called \\"cotton stretch\\". I don't know why this style is so hard to find- they're awesome. I haven't been this happy with undies since back when Mervyn's made good \\"partners\\" brand cotton undies (they changed the whole line a few years ago and now they're over-priced and  uncomfortable).
B0088CUJX0|5|Our son is 27, but still loves to watch ninja turtles with his two boys. He and the grandsons love daddy's sweatshirt
B00QRHH3RS|5|I love this wallet! I was not expecting it to look this good for the price. The material is great it almost looks like a MK or high end wallet. I love that it has a detachable wrist band holder thing as well:) all around love this and defiantly buying other colors
B003YUU1M0|5|This was packaged professionally. I love it. We mix and match all the time! Great purchase! It has been over a year since I purchased these and they are still in great condition. LOVE!
B00H5DME9U|4|This coat was just as advertised, but I would have rather had a choice of wool.  The color was great and just what I needed.
B00JR7HK5A|5|bought as a gift for my son-in--law-- he really likes it!!
B00FSKQCLS|5|I already had 3 pair of these jeans that are so worn out due to being my favorite! I have lost weight so decided to go with a size 16, because an 18 plus size was not offered (I could not find plus sizes in this style?) so when I got them they were a bit too tight but I am bound and determined to loose more weight so I will keep them as insentive! Does anyone know where/how to find this style in size 18? Try them you'll love them!
B002PINMJQ|2|MY daughter cannot use this dress, the measures did not correspond to the chart for a size plus 14x, the buttons were loose, the application are too basic, no shine no glitter, even the satin fabric is opaque
B006I9PP84|4|Usually wear an XL- but was afraid would shrink. it didn't. Arrived on time & made perfect gift to my sister!
B0064X6JMU|5|Very classy. Nice weight to the fabric. Perfect length. Falls just past knee and I am 5'5&#34;. A little tight under arms but still comfortable for me. I weigh 125# and got a small.
B00JRUO70S|1|This bra is excellent in every way you can think of. I give  one star only because it gives a cone shape and it looks absolutely awful
B0081EME4M|5|The coat is warm, fits well, and looks great.  The removable hood allows me to wear it in bad weather, but remove it when I have a business meeting.  The price was right with the pre-black Friday deal.
B00NG0RZEK|5|Great fit. Great color
B00HHOXT0A|5|Fantastic  I love this jacket for my next winters<br />Thanks
B005S0TF5S|5|Great sock ... usually i wouldn't say that about socks.
B009NA6KIO|5|It's a great work sock.
B00NPBYDWC|3|it  still felt tight ....
B00KAYAZS8|5|High Quality, Keeps him very warm even in the coldest weather. Very nice material. Its easy to put on, but hard for him to take off.
B00HSGJ8E8|4|I ordered these without checking the review first. When I read the review, I was afraid I would end up with a smaller size which would not fit. But when my package arrived, it fit perfectly (I ordered a small). The color is exactly as pictured and its cute!
B00GZ0NEXO|5|Great Sorry for my 3 year old. He didn't complain of it being uncomfortable during the 6 hours he wore it to a wedding. Love this shirt.
B003CMYTDC|5|These keep us warm during or snowy winters.
B00KW6PQ42|4|For the price, this dress can't be beat for a costume or fun party. Very sheer in back but a black slip took care of that.
B004XH66QS|5|The story: My fiance' and I went to several sporting goods shops (Dick's/sports authority/sport chalet) looking for an everyday jacket that was both warm and water resistant. Most jackets are either directed towards snow/ski/board conditions (too warm and not meant for everyday use) or for rain (light shell with no warmth).  A fleece is fine but we were trying to find something more water repellent. For our So-California winters you need a jacket that covers the range from light warmth to water resistant/proof or you need 3 or 4 jackets! The other big issue is cost. Most of the other jackets, other than the fleece cost upwards of $200. He needed something, comfortable to walk to work in and to wear on the weekend that didn't break the bank. I saw this online and took a risk on it: the risk paid off.  The jacket: it looks great; sporty looking in both fit and styling the turquoise blue logo accent adds subtle pop and looks and complements the dark navy color well. It is roomy enough for a light layer if you need it but not bulky looking. Most likely you won't need another layer as it is sufficiently warm. He is built more or less like the model-slim but not skinny and the jacket in large fit just right. It has a detachable hood which is smart since most of the time it isn't needed. He wore it in a light to moderate rain to walk 1/2 mile to work and remained dry-the water just beaded off. An unexpected benefit was that it was good enough for field work and was more comfortable/flexible than his standard issue field jacket he wears for occasional outdoor GPS work at his job. The quality is even better than most other Columbia jackets in my opinion and his. The price on amazon when we bought it was half what I saw the same jacket for two weeks ago in our local sports store! (It wasn't there when we looked before).   What more can I say. It is a great jacket. If you are looking for a warm water resistant jacket suitable for work and weekend wear than I suggest purchasingthis jacket. It simply and sufficiently meets the need.
B00FHKL8R2|3|I bought the orange one and I wear it to sleep. It looked alot nicer on the model. She can pull it off, wearing it outside, but I definitely can't. It's still cute though, but not on me cuz it's way too big and I ordered the size small. It's really not flattering on my small tiny body. It's whatever, I can at least wear it as my pjs.
B006Z8H46E|5|Bought these shirts to help keep me warm during this past winter and I am glad I did. They worked great
B008D94REU|3|I thought i read something good about this and looked at rating. I want to try it but its not for me.
B00JYJEHT8|3|The material its made out of is really silky so when you fold it down at the top, it never stays put which is super annoying. Instead of straight lines for the chevron, their jagged. I'm not really fond of that part either.
B00PKKGCFC|5|Nice quality and comfortable.  Just ordered another set!
B001UQ6SV8|5|Came as I expected...my baby son likes it. I will order more for him soon.
B00GOXHRE4|5|Good quality Kurta. The fit was fine and quality was good.
B00EYYBPSO|1|Cut like a small xxl. I don't know who they expect to wear this. Very disappointed at this purchase! !
B00CZENZFQ|1|Super short!
B00KDCBN56|4|This is a nice corset but is hard to wear for long periods of time.  It does form a small waist but is pretty brutal to wear.  I am 55 years old, 133 lbs and 5' 6&#34; tall.  I use to have a nice waistline but times does funny things to the mid section.  This garment will cinch your waist and look great, but seems to smash your intestines and other organs that may be dangerous for someone my age.  I will wear only if necessary with the right dress.
B00NKX7ULQ|1|The fit is horrible, all the stings are tangled with loose threads and it does absolutely nothing for support
B00LTKLIFQ|5|Gorgeous. The petals move at the bottom. My daughter looked like a little princess with the dress on.  People gave me a lot of compliments on this dress.
B00Q0GRT70|1|Had to send back,reason they almost went half way up to my knees.
B00JBVUTHI|4|its a nice mini dress/tunic. the shoulders do slide up thou, but i only wear it off one shoulder, so not an issue for me. so if you want to wear it like the picture, expect to be adjusting it constantly. i'm 5'2 100lbs. normally a xsmall, but i ordered a small, cuz i didn't want it skin tight. fits perfect, not to tight, not too loose. definitely true too size. i like it. :)
B004HZYPE6|5|I bought this shirt for my daughter a little over a year ago. The color and print is still vibrant and there is no fray. Nice quality piece of clothing.
B003VQQGLC|2|I bought this because it was advertised as similar to the goddess model 3910 which I have worn for years but has been discontinued. It doesn't fit anything like it the 3910.  The cup do not provide the same coverage and the straps are not wide and dig into my shoulders.  I find it considerably uncomfortable.
B00RXHJRXO|5|I love these panties they fit so well and are comfortable and adorable keeps me smooth in my clothes
B00LQR9R8C|1|It's a cute shirt, jus the large is too small. I even order a size bigger than what I normally wear.
B005CC6P9G|5|i got these for my nephews as ring bearers. they were absolutely adorable.<br /><br />i was concerned that the quality was low because of the price. they were high quality! soft and delicious.
B00IQZOHIC|4|Great Dress!
B00HFLB70O|5|Size zero fit my seventeen year old daughter perfectly fine. She loves the way it fits and the style. It was folded so it was a tad bit wrinkled but that was expected with that kind of material. I love it & so does she. ALSO FAST SHIPPING!
B00OLFXRSM|5|I weight 167 and I ordered a small love the snug fit on my curves
B00LUH1FCO|4|Likes the camo dinos
B00FEJ6TIE|5|Nice socks for yoga or barre classes.
B001LIS1TW|5|Love it! Light weight and comfortable.
B00RY9P0PA|5|Love it! Great service. Thank you!!!
B00LCS06A8|5|I've tried both boxers and briefs, wearing briefs most of my 40 years, and these Hanes Performance Boxers are the most comfortable I've ever worn. The waistband is unnoticeable, and I'd recommend these for any man wanting extra support along with great comfort.  The temperature control is amazing as I tend to sweat throughout the day and these keep me dry and feeling great. They do ride up every now and again and even when they do you cannot feel them riding up and they don't dig into your thighs when they do. Overall this is a well made underwear and I would recommend them to anyone.<br /><br />--Roger Meyer
B0099XRZT8|1|These socks were supposed to be for a small child and they are very large - more like adult size. They also have an extremely strong perfume smell. I washed them in my machine to get the smell out and they still smell and now everything I washed them with also has the same smell. I can't return them since they've been washed but I don't want to put them in a drawer and make everything else smell as well. So I'm planning to just get rid of them, making this purchase a big waste of money. Too bad because they look pretty cute.
B00BU9PPLY|5|Perfect fit and flattering. Good price. Looks more expensive than it. If red is your color, you should get it!
B00HDD7VLS|5|This  is exactly what I was looking for. Perfect color descrioft ption. The weight is not to thin for cooler weather. Soft not stiff.
B004DDH0M6|5|This is a lovely scarf that I've been very pleased with.  The colors don't look exactly like the picture - the picture makes the embroidery appear gold and silver (and that's in the name, also), but the embroidery on my scarf is more deep antique gold, copper and auburn red.  Also, the picture makes the embroidery appear like two large stripes, at least from a distance, but that's not how the front of my scarf looks.  Did they photograph the back?<br /><br />I like the shape and weight of this.  Rather than an awkward square or something wide enough to be a shawl, this scarf is long and thin enough to be comfortable yet dressy with jackets, sweaters or even tee shirts.<br /><br />I'm planning to buy more of these and hope they start offering a wider range of colors.
B00VF3VEZG|2|Coloring not bold like the picture. Wording looks washed out. Cheap rough material shirt. I am not thrilled with this shirt. Sadly it was a birthday present for my Orioles loving daughter, I will get her a better one to add to her collection.
B00AZIB31M|5|Perfect fit, looks real classy and the price was very good.  Would purchase shirts in the other colors as well.
B006G7JXM2|5|I love these socks, they're not too tight on top and are soft. They're also thick enough to not feel cheap.
B001JQLQNY|5|Best bra ever!
B00M8Z9SQM|5|It is very light and soft but the legs are too long. I am 1.80 cm.
B00E9SEAZ0|4|I love this dress and the colors. The fit is a bit odd - perhaps its just the shape of my body that makes me appear top heavy in this dress. I am planning to keep it. Will wear it with a jacket.
B008RON5R6|1|This is very cheaply made! I would not waste your money. There was visible glue residue on the nose, around the eyes, between the sequins. Despite that, the sequins were already detaching from the mask! The fabric did not cover the cheap plastic mask completely. I tried to return it, but because I did not inspect it and report it within 7 days, they would not take it back. I would be skeptical of ordering anything else from this company.
B00LI0SYWC|5|One size fits all for dashiki but if i had to guess maybe 2XL. Im about 140Ibs so it was huge but i liked very much I can also wear as a dress:) Colors are bright. You will be very impressed and I highly recmnd.
B00FW1DTZA|3|While this top is pretty it fits unusually small at the waistline, also runs short
B000V194N2|5|Great socks so far. I wear a 15 shoe and almost all the socks for my size are too tight. These are perfect.
B00HQBW3V0|5|What little boy doesn't look adorable in his favorite super hero pajamas?  My grandson wore this last night for the first time, and he loved it.  The fabric is very comfortable and launders well.  I bought a 4T and my grandson will turn 4 in a few months.  This fit perfectly, but he's small for his age, so if your child is big/tall for his age, I recommend sizing up.
B00N3XHIIS|4|Pretty good shirt ...... Runs a little big but not too bad overall I think I'm going to be ordering more shirts from tee stars
B001GUM9E8|5|Excellent - came in a timely manner - size was accurate - would purchase from this vendor again - would recommend this site to anyone looking for quality - thank you
B00IM0X2SC|3|Cheap quality...smaller than the size purchased
B0030BG7A8|5|I love it
B005KOJ1S8|4|With my big feet (size 14) I have a lot of trouble getting socks to fit, with the foreign sizing, which is almost always too small. These socks fit well and are pretty comfortable to wear.
B00LSF2VLC|3|My Fiance said it was alright, but smaller than she thought it was supposed to be....
B004XYK14Y|4|These socks were very nice but too large for my 5 year old grandson even though I ordered according to the size chart.  Very easy to return thanks to Amazon's return procedure and policy.  Waiting to receive smaller size, hope they fit.
B003V4AKLG|4|I've had this wallet for about one year now. Functionality wise, I don't have any complaints. The ID window is great, a tiny bit oversized so it doesn't cling to your card like many others do. Just the right amount of card slots for me, and you can get a decent amount of cash/change/receipts in the main fold before it gets overwhelmed. I'm knocking one star because there's a little more scuffing from normal use than I would like over 1 year. That said, it seems to be built durably and there are no indications it will need to be replaced any time soon.
B00MOQFC4C|5|Considering it was perfect for my husband's 50th birthday due to an inside joke... we loved it
B007JTBU5Y|5|Very warm and comfortable.
B007A3JW9U|5|Great!!
B00RCXTIMY|4|the jeans are beautifully made, a great cut and the material is just to die for. Unfortunately it stretches a lot almost immediately, even though I pre-soaked it in my bathtub. Order it a size smaller than you normally would.
B00QK2RJXI|4|Exactly what I expected.
B00GZRD1ZI|4|I'm giving it four stars because it's SUPER cropped.  I got it to wear with my high waisted jeans but the top it's literally past my boobs.. Really cute though, just shorter than it's pictured!
B0027WO8CA|1|Item is poorly crafted.  Stitching is bunched around the collar and disproportioned.<br /><br />Sorry i wasted the time to order.<br /><br />I am returning it.
B00548YWBQ|5|Bought these to take on a trip so I could wash and wear. The fit is great and they are very comfortable. They wash up nicely and dry fast.
B006UJFOHO|5|Nice quality tee that fits true to size. I gave it to my daughter as a BD gift, and she loved the color and how it fit. It's form-fitting, but not super clingy. It's nice that it's fashionably tailored and isn't just another clunky t-shirt. The material is a bit thinner than standard t-shirt material, but it doesn't seem cheap or inferior. It has laundered well (washed about 20 times so far), and the lettering still looks fine. (I always wash it inside out.) Overall, very pleased with this purchase!
B007IDM2B2|3|i bought this top hoping that it would fit as good as it did on the model, and that i would be receiving what was described on the website.  Being only 5'7\\" tall and 155 lbs, the very light sweat top fit me very nicely. Although, it was much lighter and thinner than i had expected like that of a thin t-shirt, I thought it was an OK purchase.  I will most likely wear it on a nice warm day or just around the house. It will not be a 'go to top' on a cold day. I will see how long this top will last me (hopefully by next Spring) before I consider buying a different colour.
B00H3T1G8Q|3|NICE THANK YOU ITS WHAT I WANTED YOU HAVE VERY GOOD PRODUCTS I WILL COME BACK TO YOU AGAIN FOR MORE OF THE SAME THINGS
B00M8QQQS4|5|I'm very happy with my purchase and absolutely love this wallet.
B008RKMVKM|5|Comfortable.
B00F6YJPYC|5|Excellent
B004MTG0G8|5|so cute! speedy too. I can't wait till my baby girl can fit into it. It won t b long
B001OR9PUO|3|It works. But I expected more comfort. Don't think I would spend as much for them in the future. The bonus gift of tape helps.
B00D3F83NA|4|Looks ok, fits very stretch.
B00GK8L3CA|5|This sweatshirt looks exactly as pictured, fits great, and is very soft. Thank you for such a wonderful purchase. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this seller.
B00INF3A2O|4|These are exactly what I expected. They fit true to size, and are very light weight. So far so good!
B0050836YO|5|I bought this for my daughter's homecoming float.  I was very well made and looks very good. I was impressed with it.  Since it was fairly inexpensive, I was worried how well it would be made.  I was great!
B00P268VDA|5|Good for what I need it for.
B0050DT11Q|2|First of all, the actual headband is the SAME headband you can buy at Wal-Mart in the Arts & Crafts section. The clips DO NOT come with the EJ logo like one of the picture portrays. The clips can ALSO be bought at Wal-Mart for HALF the price and you don't have to wait on them.
B00GUUP9XM|5|Got a great hat for a more than resonable price. Fits well and looks great!
B00GER3F8M|5|This hat is so much better than I expected it would be for the awesome price!
B003RCWQNC|1|This item runs EXTREMELY small.... Extremely disappointed in this item.  I  would not order anything from this maker again.  Thank you.
B00127O5UG|3|I received these jeans and they were much smaller than this size usually is for me.......I could not tell if I could exchange these jeans and there was no tag in the box to allow me to return them.....How do I proceed - I would have liked to have had this information - Patricia Dunn
B00MKMT2LY|5|These socks fit great and I get compliments each time I wear them. I bought a brown pair and a pink pair.
B00T7CMEKQ|3|This is nice but doesn't look like a bathing suit. More like lingerie. I returned it for that reason.
B00VAMNISI|4|Ordered this in an extra large and it fits perfectly. I've been wearing it for a week now. Only frustrating thing is the hooks when closing. Practice practice practice overall it's a great product.
B001ASEI36|5|This is truly a great mask, the foam latex fits and moves perfectly with my face, the hockey mask is a nice plastic type hard latex, which is really comfortable. 5/5
B001TYFW18|5|This shirt was beautiful and excellent quality. One of the nicest I have seen. It makes an excellent gift. I was very pleased with this item.
B003NCSYI2|5|I bought this shirt for mig & tig welding.  The quality is what you would expect from Carhartt and it fits me well.
B00C8ZITSA|2|They make these look sexy, theyre not. Theyre just long, tube sweat (althletic) socks.
B00MTWRZDM|5|My daughter is a 2t and the 4t fit perfect to make it a long floor length night gown
B002ETC05S|5|This is the perfect case for your kindle if you want to maintain the sleek style. Open it completely and it doubles as a stand. Even with the case, it is still the size of a small legal pad.  Love it.
B001NGIV56|4|Its a nice bracelet but i was mad at the fact that the tightest closer on it, the one i needed for my wrist was broken and wouldn't close.
B008BUCPZE|4|Doesn't last long. Rips easily.
B0056AT3S4|5|Get one size bigger because it does shrink. Luckily I always do so. This shirt is perfect Other than that. The Blu Sun is very clear and it is very comfortable.  I got this for my Jayne cosplay, but I love to wear it regularly as well.
B006GDANNE|5|love it!
B003XDTQOM|4|I ordered these a size I knew would be comfy and they are very snug.  I'm afraid to wash them as that might cause them to be too tight to wear.  It's in the waist where it's too tight.  The material is very durable and well made though.  Just wish I knew they ran small so I could have gotten a size larger.
B00746KPAI|5|Love it, a tad large. Color is wonderful!  T shirt  quality is good, heavy. Haven't washed it yet. Worth it!
B00B71GMKS|5|Just arrived and I love it.  I was worried about the size.  I am very broad with muscle but also very lean with a 28-inch waist so I have a hard time finding clothes that fit me in the shoulders without being boxy in the waist (huge pet peeve).  I am told to wear mediums but squeeze into smalls even if its uncomfortable because I like my clothing fitted and tight.  Since it says slim fit, I decided to order the Asia L - US Med and figured I would return it for the US Small if need be.  This thing does run small but fits AWESOME, it looks like TheLees makes their clothing with someone of my shape in mind.  Looks like I'm getting my jackets overseas from now on.
B00L66KTRQ|5|These Fruit of the Loom briefs have become hard to find ... so<br />I was sure happy to find them on Amazon.<br /><br />The fabric AND elastic is very soft ... and this is my second<br />purchase of same package.<br /><br />Buy 'em -- you'll be glad you did!
B00C6PCCQM|4|I wear yoga pants on a regular basis because I work in a warehouse & go to the gym immediately after work. I've ordered 7 of these. I love the variety of color & being 5'10&#34;, the length is great but they're not worth the price b/c by the 3rd or 4th wash (cold/perm press) holes have already occurred. I'm VERY disappointed! yes these are pretty & cheaper than other extended length yoga pants, but honestly, the pairs I've had for years from Alloy.com & LongElegantLegs have stood the test of time with NO HOLES thus far so I guess u get what u pay for!
B001Y0YH5E|3|The green stripe doesn't look great.  Returning it.
B00KLVFYQI|5|And imagine the same<br /> family is very fond of
B00IDALMGU|5|I brought as a gift for my mother in law and she loved it. I'm going to order another color next time.
B002DUCUDK|2|Not sure I like that much Lycra in my jeans.  They are also way to long.  I am 5'6 and standard jeans usually are just the right length.  I will wash them and see if that help and if not I will take them up.  It is not easy to hem jeans.  The pockets are not deep enough for my liking either.  Sometimes you just  have to try something  new.  I did and they really aren't my cup of tea but oh well!
B0055XJYFO|2|This bra is not for me, wierd shape and the size must be other than American.  I can wear it for sloppy days but would not suggest it otherwise.  I am not sure it is very supportive just more smashing than other bras.  I always wear a 32 band size but this is tighter than anything else I own. Do not like it.
B00LBIA5HI|1|The workmanship on this item is terrible.  The sewing is uneven and missing in places.  The tag is sewn directly to the back inside the shorts rather than attached to a seam ~ and so it shows.  The khaki color is a little grey--not a true khaki color as required by uniform schools.  Certainly not what you'd expect from Eddie Bauer clothing.  I would not buy this product again.  Also, there was no return instructions or label with the product.
B00F277X06|4|:(
B005CSOGNC|4|I've gotten into the habit of wearing sweats around the house most days, and these are much better than the ones with the elastic around the ankles.
B002WGCRYC|5|They feel and fit great!!! Other than really late shipping there good
B00A4FDZ0S|5|This cape was beautifully made!! Love it!
B00XLRI9F2|5|I love the look and function. Great, light jacket for spring and summer storms or cooler summer nights. I very happy with my purchase. Quality seems fine, not cheap.
B008YMERH8|5|This is a gentleman's belt (and a gentlewoman's, too). Beautiful buckle, consistent with other classy styles without sacrificing the lives of any (literally). I wear it wherever I can wear pants to (that's including casual and formal occasions). Enjoy the look and the reversible features, along with the notion of ethically classy fashion.
B008R6TGJU|5|These are great if you're looking for a great pair of tightys. They are soft, no tag, soft waiste band, feel great on you're wiener and even make it look bigger! lmao. I will probably pick up another pack.
B006TI6OMK|1|Orvis usually sell high-quality garments, but this dress really falls short.  The front of the this dress is much longer than the back, making the hem look extremely uneven when the dress is worn.  The fabric is warm, but feels like plastic.  The dress is really unwearable, and Orvis requires that the customer pays shipping for returns.  I am not happy.
B003IYYEBQ|5|Works well with most of my nursing bras.  It's slightly long, so that's great. You don't feel exposed.  It's also slightly fitted, so it feels a bit like shape wear, and flattens your stomach (which is always a plus for a new mom!).
B00CZ737U6|5|Great spring/fall coat for NH where morning chill is often present. very comfortable. Lining just enough to be comfortable but not too hot
B002VS7MSC|4|These are comfortable and wash well. They are however extremely long and go over my knee. They should put the length in the description of these socks. Even after washing 3 times these socks come up 21 inches on my legs. I'm 5'6\\" and ordered the correct size for a 9 1/2 shoe. They do seem like they will last and hold up well after washing.
B00FXLK286|4|They're cute but the image quality is pixelated. Not bad for a 20$ knockoff. I don't like stuff like this enough to justify spending like 80$ on a pair of leggings so this worked out well.
B009G3QOQ6|4|First of all- it doesn't fit like the picture. The item is Juniors sizing, which is different than Women's sizing, so be aware of that.<br /><br />The one in the photo looks short, almost cropped. It is shorter than the Adrian hoodie, but longer than the photo. The shoulders are straight seamed like in the photo, and the material is soft and floppy. It is a slightly heavier, floppier version of their eco fleece. The outside is smooth like fleece, with a tight textured pattern inside. The cuffs and bottom have thick ribbing, like old school sweat pants. The pockets are larger than what you normally find in girl's hoodies, which is a relief. Overall, I'm pleased with it. The only downside is that it doesn't come in an XS, so it fits large on me. But due to the fabric, it hangs well and doesn't look too boxy. Very pleased

B00EE30GJY|3|The product is fine but you need to be careful of the size.  The size 6X that I ordered was quite a bit smaller than a standard 6X from a store, thus it did not fit.  If you are purchasing this for a child that you know is either small for her age or currently wearing 5X clothes, you should be ok.  The return was easy.

B0071A1USS|2|The fit is terrible, i am a medium and jacked , and still the shoulders were loose , and it was like wearing a large..Wouldnt recommend it..
B002EWUXXG|5|My daughter loves to wear these and I like how they fit on her. Plus they are so soft. Only complaint is that they are $3 more than Carter store.
