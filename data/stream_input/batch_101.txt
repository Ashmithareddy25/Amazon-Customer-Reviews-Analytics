B001GC2LVM|5|I had to shorten one of the ramps to fit between the two wheels. The leveler works very well.
B00W2RBI0K|5|Excellent quality and fit.
B000UZWO04|3|Made it better than the siccor style stabilizers but still not solid
B005NLQAHS|1|Junk!
B00062YVIY|2|Extremely tall. The bottom threaded section was too short. Had to use a 45° fitting to fit on rear side of the block. Part works fine, but does not fit well.
B00CVVUQ50|4|Bought these for my 1999 Bmw 323i MY ADVICE TO YOU: Once you get the emblems put like a glue or adherent along with the sticker. They look amazing for the price. But after a week the hood emblem and one wheel emblem fell off . Also the truck emblem is too small but if you just center it you can't tell a difference . Hope this helped!
B0083G3AXC|5|These trays are great!  Holds all of your stuff and will even support your ACD puppy who thinks he belongs on it when you're camping!  The only improvement would be a slot large enough for your smart phone.
B001G6PNRC|5|I can finally read my clock at night
B0024E70L2|1|I'm not sure if the outlet or Camco power grip was bad but it burnt up 3 ground fault outlets that end up costing 50 dollars. So in all the product was no good to me. If it was a 1/4 star if put it.
B000C55ZY4|3|The second set in 3 years. We think it was because our shocks were shot! Moog is the best out there in terms of Rep. I replaced our shocks with this second set. We will see.
B003BNJZFO|5|Easy installation...works great
B00X6DH434|1|a wiper blade does not fit on my Z4. Returned.
B0089F6SMC|5|I love Big Cat Sticker Shack! Not only did my sticker come in early I got two bonus stickers! It also came with instructions on how to place sticker and  how to wash the surface before applying. I would definitely buy from them again!
B004A6OG8M|1|Garbage......the internal transmission cooler had a leak and it caused a whirlwind of problems including draining the entire transmission into the radiator and out the coolant overflow.....Go ahead and spend the extra money on a quality radiator from your local auto parts store
B00B4S29JC|5|Mats are awesome!!!! Look great in the car.  Definitely recommend them to anyone!!
B00JYEUWF6|5|Great !!!
B001E1V49K|5|Love this still on my helmet today easy to apply and a head turner when u wear it around
B00NX00PJK|5|All good easy to put together

B005QW7QCM|5|satisfied!!
B0083TIHY6|3|Love this tank pad just wish they were more specific that it is clear and not red
B006ZLGESK|5|worked perfectly to install loaded pistons into block
B0087TYOPI|5|Works great! Installed them about 4 months with no problems. Glad I didn't spend the extra money on other bulbs.
B0083P3Y2K|4|Right light bulb was not working, so I used the old one from my car that I was swapping out.
B00IFTBLEM|5|Such a ripoff that Shoei won't release these tinted shields for the Neotec in the US, so we have to pay an exorbitant fee (literally 2x the price) to import one from Japan. That being said... The gold (orange? whatever) mirror shield looks awesome! Goes great with a white helmet. I find the gold tint to be a bit lighter than what I expected, but that's okay because I can just pop down the internal sun shield. The shield does have the posts for a pinlock lens insert if you happen to use one (I don't).
B00IGZP2UE|5|Oem at a good price
B002MQCY7C|4|works great but wish the tabs were a little thicker to make it easier to connect
B00449DAQO|5|2009 Vw cc 4 motion 345 mm rotors worked perfect
B0097WW6FE|5|GOOD !!!!
B00513G82U|5|[[VIDEOID:9b0cd0a597adc3f9d2df86d16da56f51]] I used this custom Harley-Davdison Dyna Mounting Rack to mount my TMS Trunk on my 2014 Harley-Davidson Dyna Super Glide Custom<br />Installation was a breeze with this mount, I find it a more secure way to mount my new TMS Motorcycle Trunk
B00DNX92TQ|5|Good little tank bag it will hold a set of rain gear and little trinkets for 2000 miles with no problem
B00QLDH9YA|5|Is this cat not stinking cute!
B00GEA6KGS|4|Product was as described and was very easy to understand instructions. Shipping was quick - I had it a week earlier than expected.
B004I10GAQ|5|Good fit and a good price&#34;!!!
B005ERW9EO|4|Part arrived quickly and correctly.
B005I4DNZ2|5|Good
B00CA2WWUW|5|Solid Stand!! Lifts the bike easily and no worries about the bike tipping over. A little expensive, but in this instance you get what you pay for!!!
B004D5S2KI|4|satisfied customer
B011XBTIHU|1|did not work when arrived. Became a refund after multiple emails with ISSYZONE.
B002BHRXJ6|4|Exactly what I needed.
B00K72C1T4|5|Good, reliable, and efficient battery charger. I am so happy I purchase this charger.
B00JR3XSDW|5|Nice appearance, easy to apply.
B008HRX60E|5|Fit perfect and better quality than the one that came with my exhaust.
B00CE2L98Y|5|Added Just the right amount of growl!  Sounds fantastic and a super easy install.
B0000AXTUY|3|The power cord is too short. I butt spliced the cord from the old one onto the new and<br />it works fine.
B001G7M3LU|5|A must for complete & proper timing belt job
B00FB3GDXE|5|Quality solid sticker.
B0001EW4FE|4|I just installed these on my 2002 Honda CRV. It fit well and installation was a breeze. Took only about 15 minutes, once I read the instructions and test fit the shades. Time will tell how well it works. It looks pretty good too. Looking forward to a cooler car since I have to park it in the sun every day!<br /><br />Just remember, after you peel back part of the tape over the self-adhesive strips, it'll stick once you press it down. So, watch your placement as you install it. It might help to have a helper to hold one end in alignment while you stick down the other end,<br /><br />I'll post an update later after I get more experience with them. :-)
B000HAEPAO|5|I'm using these to hold up a 60lbs bag over a 2x6. Everything holds up very nicely. I have used the bag a few times now and so far there is no visible damage to it.<br /><br />I see no issues with it whatsoever. They were also cheaper than any alternatives I could find!
B001GH5ORK|5|just installed these. Went out on the highway and had no hood flutter. Very happy.
B0040CYTFQ|5|Fit well in 2006 Tacoma mud flaps.
B000CGV7UE|5|Great pads almost no dust which is a big plus for my aftermarket wheels!!!!
B003RQBKLC|4|Kinda bulky but it gets the job done. Wish it had a mount magnet.
B0097TX33G|4|Great replacement socket, has external ground tab also.
B00CJ03HEK|5|They work great. Fast shipping. Great price. I would recommend buying these
B00PQWN5DQ|5|This is a good tire gauge. Definitely satisfied with my purchase. The swivel top makes using the gauge easy from any angle.<br />I like that the pressure reading is held on the meter until you choose to release it by pushing the side button.<br />The device sits comfortably in your palm and the pressure release button sits right at your thumb. A good design overall.<br />I'll be buying another one soon.
B00BZ9KI48|5|Good
B000GU5IH4|3|Cover completely tore during transport of motorcycle from Washington to California and was no longer useable had to throw it away after 2 days of use.
B000CMJ2QE|4|So far so good, hoping they do not rust. Fits my 2012 Hyundai Sonata, however they are a bit longer than stock lug nuts if that bothers you. It stands out better in my opinion.
B00DQUA3IK|5|great!!!!
B00DSD6J10|5|Shipped on time. Easy to peel and stick. Would recommend.
B004W6IU32|5|Work as advertised.  Very satisfied with the purchase
B00GWEY0YA|4|Everything fit just like it should.  Very nice to have extra spots for car audio wires.
B0018YGP7Y|5|Awesome.
B00G1BYYTK|5|Very nice, well made.
B00DOI8TQW|5|Awesome u-joints. Used for years on my Datsun Z, now on my 2000 mustang.
B005XK04WG|5|Works great.
B00R07F8PS|5|Definitely money well spent.  Mitigates the OEM &#34;twist and steal&#34; hardware from Harley...not to mention the recent recall on the quick locks failing.  This solves all the issues, and takes all of 20 minutes to install.  Had the Brukis setup, but these are easier than having a security torx wrench you have to fool with.  Beside you can buy the same &#34;security torx&#34; wrench at any local Lowe's or Home Depot. Might as well have something easy to use and just keep the saddle bags locked when you leave the bike.
B00C8907AE|5|great visibility, perfect fit. looks great
B00DMIAKKM|5|Excellent alternative to OEM! Be sure to email the seller with the last 7 of your VIN. I did, and it turned out that they had to send a different model of this item. I'm very satisfied with this purchase, and the seller.
B0002STR22|1|I could smell odors thru the mask. Was not the seal or air flap. Not safe for organic vapors, will use it as a dust mask.
B00DGEVMMC|5|THIS IS MY SECOND FRAME FROM BLING,QUALITY PRODUCT,VERY PRETTY,HOLDS UP A LOT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD,THE PRICE IS VERY REASONABLE,AND THEY COME WITH EXTRA STONES,ALSO FAST SHIPPING
B005EMGXUA|5|Good value
B00993C4TY|5|Fit perfectly
B001CXZ2O8|5|Great powerpack, good for all kines of things. Great for backup power when camping.
B0041TU56A|5|Exactly what I ordered. Easy installation as well.
B0035533S8|2|I will keep the CTA rethreading set despite being disappointed in the quality of the tools.  The dies chased bolt threads easily and smoothly, although I question the precision of the cutting edges - they seemed to round-off the threads substantially.  I used a small socket wrench and pushed the 12-1.25mm tap forward, backed up, cleaned it with WD-40, added oil, pushed it forward again, and slowly worked it into my cross-threaded bolt hole on the truck frame.  The tap snapped off without me exerting much torque.  Note how the (taps) have a thin neck.  The metal is quite soft, not hardened steel like I would expect.  I was able to drill into the broken tool and extract with an easy-out with any difficulty, suggesting that the tap is exceedingly soft and feeble.  In the end, I am disappointed by quality, but happy with the overall selection of sizes and general ease of use.  In future I think I would be better off carefully using a high-quality tap rather than these rethreaders.
B00KTFLX98|5|It is a nice difference to the tall stock antenna. Still get a good reception.
B003VAWXBA|5|works as expected
B004BL86WS|5|Good price and fast shipping

B00KULLSI2|5|Quick shipping, came in as described, not to much else to say about them.... They are brakes, and they worked!
B00B5ZY07I|5|Easily installed and looks great.  Thanks for an excellent product.
B00O5UFNEO|5|Great product not long enough in the rear of to cover the whole motorcycle
B00DOALJSU|5|This item was purchased as part of a first aid kit for my husband's workshop.
B00B54SJIK|4|After having my old truck broken into and my entire aftermarket stereo system stolen by some lowlifes, I decided to go a different route with my new truck. After stealth mounting subs and replacing factory speakers, I needed a way to play pandora or my iPod. This is<br />The solution. If you take your time and mount everything carefully, there is nothing for dirtbags who live off the government and refuse to be productive members of society to see in your vehicle to encourage them to break in. Aside from that I am<br />Giving it four stars as it does need the system reset every now and again. The Bluetooth does auto connect better with my iPhone 6 better than it did my iPhone 4. Real estate behind the dash is limited on my Silverado, but manageable to place the control and secure it. Just make sure you mount it solid and the reset button is accessible. I would purchase this product again.
B00KTIY4ZA|5|works as advertised! thanks
B00W4G3WSK|1|Need to return, spout will not fit traditional 5 Gal Red Fuel Can, to small need to return.
B000C93ENO|5|Walker 55143 Exhaust Tail Pipe does fight a 1998 Dodge Dakota,Regular cab ; 3.9L V6.<br />Amazon's check fit says it does not.
B000EQNWBY|2|I got the cap without the rotor that's disappointing :/
B00EBQWH4Q|5|Looks good on my wifes q7
B00584OJUK|5|nice and good looking
B00D6N0VW0|5|Fit great working great
B0012GTVVA|5|THIS ITEM DID EXACTLY WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD . Reasonable EASY TO INSTALL make door stronger easy to grab when your inside.
B0068OUXS6|5|My car has leather seats with a &#34;cocoa&#34; color (medium dark brown, like a bar of chocolate). In a couple of places wear had removed the brown surface of the leather exposing the lighter color of the leather itself. I used some of this to selectively darken and blend out the raw areas, and I think it did a pretty good job.
B001KOENRG|4|Worked well for me.
B0009JKI6I|5|Good fit, as advertised.
B004I19G5C|5|Awesome headlight, worked just as good as the original
B00SZ70TP6|5|Top of the line easy install, and speedy delivery.
B00PKRW0LK|5|Highly recommend! Definitely kept people from tailgating, which is always a plus for a new driver.
B00G620ZVU|3|i give it a 3 because 1 was faulty upon hooking it up but the 1 hat functioned seems pretty dam good
B000CRAXEY|5|Product worket well
B0006N5RW2|5|Went right on! Factory fit. Great product.
B00407TVTK|4|Exact match color.
B005FL5B6M|1|Did not fit my 2004 honda accord ex 4 cylinder. I wanted to exchange them for the correct ones, however its pretty difficult to get in contact with the seller.
B00480J4JG|5|It was the correct part and is working perfectly.
B00O7TXHBO|5|Great product that works perfectly in my 2014 Jeep Rubicon.  Seller is also excellent!!!
B00103MC2A|5|Works great!
B0050Z9NDU|5|Beautiful bright color
B0082122I2|3|The wiring harness for power supply is not compatible for the SC-901 head unit in my C70 despite description. Had to run to Best Buy to get a separate wiring harness so I could get power. The pin cable was an easy fit though.
B005FRC132|3|I am satisfied that i have something to cover my seats with because they were getting dirty! But i wish they fit my seats a little better.  I did put in my car make and model thinking it would make a difference, but they'll do for now. I just had to tuck and pull a little more to get them to look fitted.  I do like the pockets behind the driver and passenger seats and the material is great! I would recommend for those reasons. I purchased for my 2014 kia Rio ex.
B00PYQCB4I|5|Great product for the price
B007X7461W|5|magnetic base is strong and the light is bright, once again happy with my OTC purchase.
B00DJE1JOA|5|These are so much better than the stock well nuts.
B00CPGQ1GO|4|Good buy for the price. A must for any off-road enthusiasts!
B00D42AFS8|5|Nic to have a re-charger for when you are not somewhere with AC current.
B00BCR5ZRI|2|I have a 2015 Rav4 XLE.  I found putting these seat covers on to be VERY difficult and as others have said, you must be very careful because the material and strings rip easily.  I tried to be as careful as possible but in order to make the covers tighter over the seats, you need to be able to pull a little bit. Unfortunately, the strings all snapped! The rear cover was a nightmare. So sad too because I love the purple material.
B00ML0843C|5|Thanks
B00B8QFG04|4|Nice but no directions
B000FOL0AA|5|Works as advertised.
B000RN2AHQ|2|the magnets on this are worthless. It's cheap and you get what you pay for, however I did get a 1,200 mile trip out of it before relegating it to the back of the garage and buying a Wolfman tank bag
B0006IX87S|5|Works well at purifying our water and is a must have if you plan to consume the water in your RV. Especially when you do not know the actual source of you water, this gives you added assurance that your are drinking cleaner healthier water and keeping your RV water system more sanitary in general.
B00LXVSCXM|5|Nicer than the &#34;CARS&#34; brand one
B003UVCY00|4|got mine and plugged up to charge, unplugged charger and hit the switch, nothing...... being in industrial maintenance all my life and being curious, i opened it up, found out some dingus at the factory didn't plug the battery plug into the board.  now the light works great, really bright.  some may say i voided the warranty but what the heck, it works
B00751HP96|5|Great product.  Highly recommend.
B00UF85AU2|5|Part arrived as promised and fit exactly like the OEM pump.  Solved the starting/run problem on my 3010 Kawasaki Mule.  Would definitely recommend this vendor.
B002ESXIOQ|1|They are not the right ones they didn't fit
B00XAX4B9A|5|Absolutely Love this shade. I do not fold it up and put it in the bag since I use it everyday. I just fold it inn half and place it in the back seat and then unfold and place on windshield. Easy beans :)
B000Q754E4|5|Works great! Love the unit as it keeps foods hot or cold!
B00RNGX024|5|Works great! No people know to steer clear of my daughter! :-)
B000BQW5LK|5|Works as expected, I was able to easily and efficiently refill my transfer case and transmission fluid with little to no waste.
B00068XCQU|5|Great ,great product!I am gone for months at a time and my cat always starts up immediately when I return no matter how cold it had been!
B0009IQZX4|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B000GU5K4U|5|Easy to install 5 min and look good.
B00062ZDIG|4|Double, even triple check that it will fit your vehicle. I had to make some minor modifications to the base to get it to sit flush, but overall it's a good looking air cleaner assembly for the price,
B00L51ZYE0|5|Great little lights, I have them on my hitch mounted luggage rack for the back of my SUV when we all go on road trips.  They look great, I will have to get pics sometime, Everytime I stop to gas up and someone has been running with me and they stop as well, they always want to talk about it, and look at it, touch the lights.  They always say the same thing, &#34;they're so bright but cool to the touch!!&#34;  lol  Cracks me up.  Helps people not run into you with a luggage rack on the back. I have them wired into the backup lights.
B00VB8BIP6|5|Looks great on my RT.
B001RLOE4O|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B000IYP4W2|5|Very well packaged and high quality.
B000N4YGMQ|5|ty
B0009IQXJK|5|Great Fram filter
B006ZAPDO2|3|This is a great product but whoever designed it had a screw loose. My advice is give up on removing the stem and loctite (blue #242) the nut on tight. Otherwise risk losing your phone.....
B002M589TA|4|I purchased the Pennzoil 36671 Fluid pump so that I can refill the rear VTM differential on a Honda Ridgeline. I worked great for the gallon jug and has a small adapter that I assume will work on quart containers. Very pleased  with purchase.
B0049QPR3Q|5|I installed a 4x2 2.0L engine, it works great.
B003E3K5E6|4|Looks great! Easy to install. I wish it came with the 3rd chrome plate though. I had to order it separately.
B006JJR338|4|Chip in the paint with surface rust right out of the box. Good bumper for the price though.
B00AZK3VT2|5|I love these reflectors. In the past I had bought the plastic type but they did not hold up to the Florida heat, they dried up and cracked. These aluminum base reflectors are great.  They are the prefect size for the mailbox post and can esily be removed when the post needs repainting. I love them so much I ordered extra for my brother.
B00YB5GAEA|5|love it nice and bright  I also purchased my rechargeable  Blitzu  head light from them can't go wrong with these products
B00BTLEJAQ|1|Didn't fit my 2001 Jetta at all. It was way to tight on the backrest and barley fit the seat. Also it feels identical to a cheap child's Halloween costume. Don't waste your time or money.
B0055R5TRC|5|It is AWESOME - thanks!
B001KQD7XA|5|Perfect.....good fit and good price
B007NNH1V8|5|It met our satisfaction and more. It was delivered early ,the product was just what we needed.<br />Thank you so much
B00Q5CT9VI|5|Substantial
B000CPCOB6|5|Russell 'speed bleeders' are the best! Once you use them, you'll never be without them.
B00G258I0G|5|Outstanding and as advertised very Strong A little on the expensive side but as they say you get what you pay for.
B00M0UZEQS|2|material is not  good
B0045K2Q9Y|5|They fit like regular fuses
B007Y53W0Y|1|Poor Fit - Basically, $34.57 for a $10.00 sun shade.
B00IFMWBBQ|1|This seat lasted just 13 days ( on the driver's side ) before the first break in the connecting line.  If I switch the passenger's side over to the driver's side, I might just get a whole month of &#34;benefit&#34; for my $45.00.  I cannot return since I live in Central America so I am just plain unhappy.  Avoid<br />this expensive POS unless you can buy 12 at a time - then you can make it through the first year.
B005RF6G4M|4|Its overall good.
B0002Q83X8|5|I am using two of these.  I have one to fill my air bags and one to let the air back out.
B000TDV3UE|5|Excellent product, description was perfect.
B003EOXEBQ|5|Fit well  Easy install
B00VBDWXAK|5|All good with this purchase!
B00GKG0OJU|5|2nd one in 3 year.
B00GE9Y5IE|5|Great mud flap.  These fit great and look just as good.  I was very pleased with how easy they were to install and how good they fit.  Weathertech does great work with their engineering and manufacturing.
B0002I94CK|5|Our used camper we bought was missing this item.  I am glad we found it on Amazon.  It was priced well, easy to install and makes it much easier to open our awning.
B004HDY8XQ|5|satisfied lowest price!!
B00JMHF5WK|5|Very well made and great price.
B00M9WL6WI|4|Honestly quite good but i sent it back because I couldn't choose between the two i bought and this just happened to be the head on a coin
B001EA0LI6|5|Very easy to apply. The adhesive is also very strong as well.
B000BGHSNK|4|fits great. real happy.
B00W1WHLF2|5|this adapters are real good<br />fit in my car perfect thank you
B00THRJPVW|1|Very thin product not worth the money. Within a week it was ripped.
B00ZXR0VOU|5|Works well<br />Thank you
B00H6XPZN6|5|good
B00PTQOF4W|2|This system you need t hook up a additional + and - to get the light inn the switch illuminated. other kits have it wired into the system already.
B0036QX4EY|4|There is some assembly required by this stand, I don't know if that was already mentioned but I'm not sure I was expecting that when it came in the mail. Either way, it was easy to put together - all the tools you need for assembly are included with the stand.<br /><br />Took a little adjusting to get the forks the right distance for my bike, but once they're good, they're good.<br /><br />Easy to roll around, feels good and stable. I haven't had any issues with it. It looks like one of the arms may be slightly crooked (due to the fact that it's not one single piece of metal) but it doesn't affect the functionality in any way.<br /><br />It holds my bike up and has never dropped it, so I don't know what more I could expect from a stand.
B001KOKPO6|4|It works it just dont have any pockets it held 3 sets of clothes using shorts for 2000 mile run at above speed limits. I dont like the velcro style although it worked thats the reason for 4 stars
B0006IX87S|5|as advertised
B00OBWL5MA|4|good quality and fit. serves dual purpose of lifting rear end on paddock stand and skid protection spools. set screw to lock spools is tricky and could damage plastic threads if not assembled correctly.
B00UXA3HMK|5|Works perfectly.
B007TY769S|4|Good quality product, fit my car and on time delivery.
B00D3298A0|5|Nothing fancy but great value.
B000LY0T6K|5|Love the headers!  The paint sucks though. I even used additional high temperature paint. All burned off the same day. I am not looking forward to removing the headers for coating treatment. The engine has to come part way out of car to get the headers in or out completely.<br /><br />Get them ceramic coated before going into the car. They sound amazing! They look beautiful! I love em!
B000FQ01TE|4|works great
B00R1DB436|5|Very good,  service was  great.  GB
B004BTAJ2A|5|Looks great!
B000UUMM6K|4|Installation instructions were clear and easy to follow giving a good result.
B004TEOTNW|3|No complaints. Shipping was faster than expected.
B009D585EQ|5|This key chain is a beautiful shade of blue and good quality.  I bought it because I wanted my key fob to be distinguishable from other Honda key fobs if I have to leave it with a valet, and it makes it easier to find in my handbag.
B00JBJ3JK4|5|Great
B002GU2OP6|5|excellent product, does all it clains
B00VVEEZ64|4|Great fit looks good
B00SAAW8Y8|1|I connected a 300 watt light bar and two 18 watt cubes to this for a total of 28 amps or less. I switched on the lights and less than 5 minutes later the harness began melting. I secured the power in time so no real damage with the exception of the fused together harness. I recommend buying something else unless you are powering something smaller.
B0012WYDNK|5|What I needed for my 2004 Toyota Sienna. Delivery was fast after placing the order.
B007PVIARW|5|Excellent Product!!!
B007S3N4HS|5|Works great.
B009DJU3IS|5|worked great good coils
B00PLD3WEW|5|I have a '96 Toyota Camry with over 310,000 miles. Hey, my first new car and it runs great but... The car stinks. Everytime my son got in the car he would comment on how it stinks. The sunroof mechinism that closes it when the car shuts off stopped working and, of course, it downpoured leaving a nasty damp smell that layered over all the other nasty smells. I purchased this car ionizer and can say that the odor is gone and my son no longer makes comments that the car stinks. He never asked why it stopped stinking so, I think the comments were reactionary to the fact that he got in the car and it stunk. Thanks for a product that works.
B00OVBBTOK|5|Fit and finish were great. Instruction were great. I've kept the bike upright so far so I cannot rate their crash protection as of yet........
B00C3LXENY|5|Oem at a great price
B001RLZ7L8|4|Ordered and fixed the issue we had with our car. Impressed with the fast delivery.
B002YX563C|3|If you need a pigtail, these work.  I did find that the ACME head &#34;seemed&#34; a bit &#34;cheap&#34; as far as material.  My original equipment seemed to be made of some other material.  This seemed like a hard or brittle plastic.  But it works fine.  Note that you'll likely need a 3/8&#34; adapter to set this 1/4&#34; thread.  But your regulator will likely have one.
B00UBPATNW|3|One of these lights worked for about 2 minutes and then went out. Guess I need to exchange it or order another. I like the temperature of the one that is working though.
B002W2V19I|5|Love the lanyard came right on time!
B00CQLISDC|1|It's a piece of s***
B00YVHGTBM|5|I have a 2014 VW Jetta S, bare bones. I hated the fact that the car beeped when I hit the button to lock it. My last VW had more options and a dash display which allowed me to control some of the features, including deactivating the horn upon locking. This car does not. I searched various forums and saw many threads that said this could be changed with the right equipment.<br />I asked the dealer if it could be deactivated during my last service visit and they told me it couldn't be done because it was written into the alarm code.<br />Upon using the Carista adapter with their app, I was able to deactivate the horn beep upon locking the car. I also made a few other changes including being able to lower/raise the windows using the remote. The pro version of the app ($20) is necessary to make changes, otherwise all you can do is analyze your car for faults.  For about $60 total, less than a service visit would have cost me, I was able to do things the dealer couldn't or maybe just wouldn't do. I only wish my car had more options so I could play with this more.
B00NMTGTR4|5|Excellent !  Good color.  Works well on my car.
B0002NYDZ8|5|This grease gun does exactly as it should.  Take the time to read the manual and learn the intricacies of this gun and you'll be good to go.<br /><br />I've been using this model gun for a couple years to grease trailer wheel bearings and zerk fittings on truck/UTV suspensions.
B00NYAX8VG|5|Perfectly fit! But a little pricey!
B004M29Y5O|5|Fit's perfect and is a great mounting place for my Knight Riderz sequential brake light.
B004BV06ZI|5|Just what I needed.
B0078U9JPW|5|Exactly the tool I needed.
B00KTHXJHK|5|I buy to of the keys, I receive quick, I take it to the dealer and they cutting and activated for me, not even them believe that works so good, too easy
B000NCOKZQ|5|Great tender. I used this because I melted my old one in a power surge. Fits great, long reach to get where you need it and inline fuse so you don't melt it.
B00KMELX9Q|5|Tint fit windows perfect. There are tricks to proper installation. True Line Automotive is a great company to do business with.
B004QRVERG|4|Did not fit very well. I actually had to use a razor blade and take out some rubber on one end so the filter would retain properly into the air box slot. Was kinda disappointed in K&N for this reason. But after modification, it was typical Performance gains they are known for. With help from this filter, a Vance&Hinse widow maker, and a tuner with a good map. My XR is making enough power that no other Harley-Davidson can keep up so far.
B0010AN0SI|5|it good
B0010G80TQ|2|part does not come as displayed,does not include expansion valve as pictured!
B00AN5RWHQ|5|I bought these and replaced just my passenger side, leaving the other as a spare. I have had bad luck with my rotors cracking in half and disintegrating. I've been using this rotor with the pads now for about a month. The performance is fantastic. Stopping power is superb.
B00LO0M918|5|Really good value set. I personally prefer the higher color temperature (&#34;Daylight&#34;) versions like these. This seems to produce sharper images (reading etc.) and seem brighter for a given Lumen output. The fan in the converter doesn't run anymore even with all the lights on.<br />As others have stated, LED's are polarized. If they don't light, flip 'em over. Now I'd like to find the other base styles to update my remaining fixtures.
B0014B7XTA|3|Wasn't exactly what I needed or thought it was but I worked for my application.  It said it have a pressure port and then the other 3 ports,  there was no pressure port but otherwise was light weight and strong.
B004QMXTBU|5|Easy to install, works perfectly now!
B002M5KJYS|1|Ordered 2. Both came in beat up boxes with DIFFERENT model numbers on box. The physical bearings had the right numbers on them but we're clearly made in different locations or times. Both are working fine after six months but I am anticipating a failure
B00LMI7UXO|5|Great windshield for the price. I had it on in less than an hour.
B0002KKTFO|3|works okay
B00PAFKJT2|5|Really happy!!!! Works perfect!!
B00KZD8JV4|5|Will it fit a e46 m3 2002?
B0009PSA5I|4|does what it was advertised to do:)
B0040CZ3SS|5|Works great!!!
B000B5QFHQ|3|Useful but small. Gave to all family members with cars.
B000C14YS6|4|fit worked
B00R6S0MEI|5|sent to someone else. he is very pleased with this item.
B007WICLXM|3|This was not a good fit.  It didn't seem like the best quality either.  I do believe it cooled the vehicle though.
B0050DC604|5|great product
B006YP7HI8|5|Very nice kit of leads for the price
B00BTGSGFK|1|rip at the first use
B008BLFHS0|5|good quality easy to use if you take your time. quick install and exactly as advertised
B003VDX5D2|4|For the money a very good deal and a functional product. The only thing that I did a little different with it is where the hinged bracket bolts to the tailgate plate, I put quick disconnect pins instead of the bolts that way if I need to remove the ladder part I can. The pins should be standard for an option.
B00IO9KG1M|5|Bought this to use with my 2014 Scion FR-S. Installation is a breeze (you just unscrew your OEM antenna and screw this one on). I can't comment on radio signal since I exclusively use Bluetooth in my car to listen to music, but the aesthetics of this is great if you dont like that half foot antenna on your FR-S.
B00C5SR5ZI|1|Package came full of dust, must of been on shelf for years!!!  And I put it up and the glue on the clips r not sticky, fell right off the window.
B00II7PXWW|4|great product, may need to improve on the fold crease to minimize vision obstruction.
B000E7YYDS|2|Very disappointed. The pressure Output from this was less than a cheap plastic nozzle.
B013B3J7D8|5|Exactly what they said they are, but when they wouldn't attach to the back of my car, I found out that the rear tailgate on my Murano is made of plastic and not metal! They attach to the wings and hood find though
B00OC5B6D4|5|I lovee ittt!!! Its so pretty and bright.
B000WJEORY|5|Does what needs to be done at the correct price.  Compact enough to keep it on the saddlebag, easy to use.  Bleeder and non leak valve features are key.
B00IEL0M5K|4|I have a crv and they fit great!!
B00G1Y2HAA|5|There great levers but I myself don't like the shorty clutch lever. The shorty brake is awesome but the clutch I hate. If you wear thin gloves you'll be able to still fit all four fingers. If you wear thick gloves you'll be able to fit three at most but your four finger will get jammed each time. Nonetheless, the levers are perfectly fine and have a quality build. Make sure to take your old bushing from your clutch lever and put it on the new one.
B006B7Z6NW|5|Works in our 2014 Honda Odyssey
B00CHD62ZU|4|The only thing missing the screws.
B00V40EXPS|5|Works great! Looks good!
B00HEB2XEO|4|just received a box of parts and no instructions with them.  Fortunately there is a helpful video on YouTube - search on darmon Ford Explorer sun visor and it should pop up.  Video marked for the -279 but shows passenger side install.  Was a bit of a wrestling match but got it in.  Best check both sides when you order - found the passenger side completely disintegrated as well so will have to order that now.
B006DY66XC|5|I love these due to the lightweight, compact design although one must be careful in using and respositioning them for storage! Definitely worth buying!
B00C66ALNW|5|ok product.
B008E7U9SE|5|High quality pads at a discount price.
B00EANHCNQ|3|A little too big.
B00KJLLXM4|3|great transaction!but not even close in what i received on the picture here,im hoping to get the same thing on the picture because i like the design..but i just hope that it will fit right on my car eventhough i dont like what i have as long as it's works
B00L4OOCKK|5|Saw him at the Lake County Fair and his demo and selling pitch was great! You can't go wrong with purchasing this product. It does everything demonstrated and more!!
B00GHSD3O4|5|Works perfectly
B011EY87RI|5|I loive it!!! It is the cutest cover I've had for my steering wheel so far.  Thank you for such quick service.
B005JPGTNI|5|the best sandpaper that I have used !!!!!! more exclamation points required!!!!
B00BC25ZKA|3|Too expensive for size. But it is as stated
B001NQKH76|3|It didn't last very long.
B00DZUCPXW|5|Took 3 days to get here and was packaged good and in good shape. Had no problems whatsoever. Easy to install and am very happy with them.just for future buyers reference I put the 2 in. spacers on a 07 ford fusion and fit perfectly and looks just awesome!
B00792IU7W|5|Fit great, simple. I put them on with no problem.
B003SJK3R0|5|It's a wheel hub of decent quality. Does exactly what you'd expect! Fit my 2003 Forester no problem. Make sure to use the right tools!
B00NEU5490|5|Excellent product, thanks!! :)
B003AVNX0K|5|Works well.  Pumps vegetable oil to my 1999 E300 OM606 engine no problem.
B00S54Y0AE|4|Switch worked like a charm
B00OHXBH4E|4|good
B00GQO5C9S|5|These are fabulous! Solid, beefy rubber, and they stay put, even on wet pavement. There is a durable molded handle at the back of the chock that will accommodate cording or rope. I'm using these to secure a full size pick-up on a steep incline and they've done the job perfectly. These are so solid that I expect they'll be in use forever. I ordered another brand of chock at the same time as these and there is no comparison: the others were returned. Excellent product!
B00JGHB0Z2|5|Excellent
B00HNF36D8|5|Sounds amazing, very deep, no drone, easy to install and fills the gaps in rear nicely. The logo sticks out just enough to be seen but leaves the tips almost flush with the diffuser, tips are slanted as well to accentuate the rears curve. I'm extremely pleased with this system.
B00EMJAR08|5|Its so adorable
B007ZSZJ42|5|It was exactly as ordered and is working perfectly.
B007MD9GC6|5|Do these come with bulbs and wiring harnesses?
B01328OJAI|4|I bought these as they are almost identical to grabars but 50 dollars cheaper. (Grabars price is ridiculous) The set I got appeared to have been returned and then sent out to me? (package was re taped and bolts/fittings were loose at the bottom of the box) It almost appeared as someone bought them and didn't know how to install them correctly and returned them.  Go on the net and find the grabars directions for install. (Top bolt partially installed first, then side bolt and then tighten both)  Anyway, as far as the product goes, it fit absolutely perfectly and functions great! Handles get a little loose in the closed jeep in the heat we have been having here in social the last week(100's) but not bad.  (plastic handles turn a little on the bar not loose bolts) Good product at a good price.  I'd recommend these over the paracord or roll bar straps, as the function is much better.
B001GJ3FEC|1|I have only had it for barely over two months and it has already burst and is completely unusable. It's junk. If I could give this a zero I would.
B000E4COFG|5|Fit like a charm.  Excelent replacement for my Geo Tracker LSI 1995
B000E4QLH8|5|Perfect fit
B007ZRLQKE|5|It is the best for geay or black water tanks PERIOD............
B00QRHDIPY|5|My car has always run the battery down in about a week, probably due to the tracker installed. Even with a new battery this meant frequent charging of the battery, with everything that that entails. Using the Solar Battery Charger has changed all of that - it works - once I have finished with the car I just clip the charger to the battery terminals and even on grey days there is enough output to keep the battery charged. What a great invention, if I could use the cigarette lighter it would be even easier but the lighter in her car only functions when the car is running. As a trickle charger I would not expect it to charge a flat battery but it certainly keeps it topped up. Easy to use, it does the job, problem solved.
B001F7EK3U|1|Did not fit 2004 subaru legacy L 35th Anniversary, different connector type. Had to cut the wires and reuse the connector from old sensor.
B006L92R2S|4|Good, but I had to remove one of the zippers and see it together. Now it works great!
B0036PUHN6|5|Very solid replacement for the wimpy winch that came with the trailer. Easy to install.
B003ZN730O|5|I don't know about a 2500 lb capacity but they are good quality and work perfect as a tie down point.
B0012GTVVA|5|Great product. Very easy to install. Arrived quickly. Would recommend this product to all RV's.
B000U527J2|4|works well
B00O836EQE|5|Loved it!! It stands out, great quality
B0063ZBXZC|5|Bought this for my husband for Father's Day! It makes leveling and unhooking the trailer so much easier! We have a 22 foot trailer and it works perfectly!!!
B001FAI9KC|4|Ordered this as a replacement for my original which was starting to rust through (I drilled holes in the middle and mounted lights but had done my best to seal the exposed metal with rustoleum). If you're making multiple purchases from this manufacturer, be aware that they have a 2015 year long 5% mail in cash rebate program for Rugged Ridge, Omix-ADA, Alloy USA and Outland products. http://www.rubitrux.com/media/pdfs/rugged-ridge-rebate-print-form.pdf
B00GJ1EJQA|5|I took my 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix to Belle Tire to get an alignment and they came to me and said they were unable to because the subframe bushing was missing and that it had stripped out.<br /><br />Long story short, the threads on the car were not stripped at all.<br /><br />I changed both sides and it took about 30 minutes total. I have a lift in my garage, and a hydraulic jack helped. They fit PERFECTLY, and a little bit of silicon grease aided their application.<br /><br />Consider changing these if you notice any popping or cracking noise when braking or accelerating quickly.<br /><br />Thank you so much!!
B001B13ZKY|4|This is a nice soft brush for car washing.  A bit pricey but it works well, holds a lot of washing water/suds and keeps it's shape.  Be sure to rinse it well and air dry it after use and it should last years.
B0055UBVS0|2|Cute fox tails but they are more like kit tails unfortunately. They say large but it's actually quite small. Came from a young fox
B00UA4RL0I|5|A+
B005DSSEOI|5|Love it,!!!!
B00HXCI2FS|5|Great product great shipper got it on time and this wrap really does look grwat and increases performance
B004JKOR9C|5|Once i figured this out, it's wonderful!  I didn't realize you have to tighten up the bolt in the hitch!  Lol. I traveled 500 miles with two bikes on it and it does need to be tightened up, so travel with tools!
B006H34ABY|5|Nice microfiber wash pad.  I use it on my vintage sports car.  If you need one, get one.
B000BUU5TU|5|It is the best thing to buy for your camper
B00TMFB8KU|5|Very pleased!
B007PK17BO|5|My wife and I just purchased a 2014 Mazda CX-5 that came with the carpet mats. We decided to order these mats and they make so much of a difference. Cleanup is easier and these are the perfect fit for the car...not to mention it make the whole car look more sporty. Great find and for $80 they were the best option.
B005LXTOEY|5|Great product. Found instructions to replace it on youtube but this product also came with instructions. Took about 30 minutes to replace.
B00JBICJDI|4|One (passenger side) didn't fit as well as the other.  A little annoying but not a show-stopper.
B000RXNLK6|5|Again a reorder of a product that I use. Use it with a microfiber cloth and the result is amazing
B00H1ZP5E8|5|Fit just right, service was great!!
B00HQFWOG0|4|Bought two of these for a DR650 Dual sport motorcycle. Was able to mount them on the front and they work well. As far as lighting up the road ahead of you, the beam is not focused enough so that you can actually light up a distance greater than 40-50 feet in front of you. I leave these on during the day when I ride because it increases your visibility and safety with other drivers. I love them, they were easy to install.  Cons: One of the two lights I bought went from the bright white to yellow. I can hear something rattling inside the housing, so if you do a lot of offroading take this into consideration as these lights may not be able to endure heavy riding for a long period of time. I ride a lot of offroad, jumps, mud, etc, and they held up very well for over 4 months before I had this issue with the one light. One other issue is that the housing rattles a lot when you ride due to poor construction of the light housing. (Just one allen bolt holds the light tight) I fixed this with super glue.  I am not sure how to go about repairing the light as ASSEM has no contact information listed. I do not want to take apart the light as it would void the warranty, but since they recently updated the listing, I'm not sure if the light had any warranty outside of the Amazon prime guarantee. UPDATE: I contacted ASSEM directly and they sent me a replacement light free upon me showing a photo of the broken internal housing.   Overall best bang for the buck LED lights you can get.
B000M3V95U|5|It's definitely a step up from Windex. No streaks!
B003CEFJ2U|5|It holds my jack without issue and this mount looks strong enough. Shipping was really, really fast and the price even better.
B00M5EU0JU|1|You have to provide the parpart number or the size. I ordered this thinking it will fit.it didnt so had to send it back ,for a bigger size.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|A little tricky to take it down and store it but it's not hard once you get the motion down (I just grab both ends and twist while squeezing).  Edit: I got annoyed putting it up and taking it down because it's one big sunshade with two flexible circles as the frame. I cut it in half and now I find it easier to deal with.  Still 5 stars because it works great.
B00065ZIJ2|5|While it doesn't stop thieves from getting into your car, it will definitely give them a handle to help bend your steering wheel. This device kept my 25 year old honda parked in front of my house and even aided in some custom steering wheel work. 10/10 will buy again.
B00L51ZYIQ|5|Great little lights, I have them on my hitch mounted luggage rack for the back of my SUV when we all go on road trips.  They look great, I will have to get pics sometime, Everytime I stop to gas up and someone has been running with me and they stop as well, they always want to talk about it, and look at it, touch the lights.  They always say the same thing, &#34;they're so bright but cool to the touch!!&#34;  lol  Cracks me up.  Helps people not run into you with a luggage rack on the back.
B009DJPWBQ|5|great
B002MEYKXU|3|They look great on my 2001 jetta. They took miles off the front buy getting rid of my old yellow lenses. However they aren't the best because they are flimsy and slightly off in its construction. Get what you pay for. The ridges in the bulb housing where the bulb sits securely aren't exactly like the originals so the bulb doesn't feel secure. However I have been driving all over and they haven't moved or wobbled so I suppose it isn't a huge deal. Make sure if you get them you align them correctly when everything is off. Reason being is because to replace them you have to remove the whole front bumper and grill and it is annoying to have to take off multiple times. There is a video youtube just search Jetta headlight removal.
B00GUBMC8G|5|Made in the USA and a actual AC Delco part this is so rare these days.
B0011YTZAU|5|Fits like factory installed and the price was great.
B0049Z8A0Y|5|Excelente
B00GJKBS6U|1|Keeps peeling off the wall.
B00J5BPMA8|5|great product
B001C6OYYE|5|Exactly like the original (cracked) part it replaced.
B006M9VIRM|5|best ever
B0036USLSY|5|Very complete kit, shipped quickly. Great price, good quality parts
B00KGHB93E|5|Really works well with AC.  Just let is float on seat instead of fixing to seat.  Second one owned, first last years.
B00BCRMB34|5|thanks for your service, very good
B00NQVFM9O|5|These are the handiest gadgets I've seen in a long time! Now my purse hangs conveniently out of my passenger's way and doesn't tip over spilling everything across the back seat floor. I highly recommend them!
B00HTX3BNE|5|Amazing performance out of this intake. When you hear it you wouldn't think it was an altima!
B00VDSS0AK|5|Perfect. Just what we needed
B00VNNR1UA|5|Very nice product would give it a A+....
B000GTY61E|5|Great product and a perfect fit for a good price.
B00TGACUHG|5|great product
B00GJKBQKS|1|Keeps peeling off the wall
B00APTSCC4|4|Love the product! I will order it again when it's time!
B00DK3VNZ0|5|The previous owner of my car had thrown this away.  I was excited to see that I could replace it!  Now my drinks don't spill every time I turn a corner.  I love that there are accommodations for different sized cups.<br />I am assuming that the smaller slots are for coins???  They seem more suited for poker chips.
B00XM107FC|1|Extra wiring, so thick, made to cut and make adjustments. Make your own or buy the real one.
B00BR06GPA|4|I really liked it.
B00KH9PW3E|2|The size does not fit my Honda Civic. The length is fine but the width is too short. Does not cover the wind shield fully. There were no vacuum cups to keep the reflector in place.
B00PF9C5WM|5|Product was perfect, exactly as advertised. Quality product, excellent price.
B00JEB19TW|1|Not even close. You get a stator cover gasket. They don't know the difference
B009VYWJ0A|4|It is an excellent product for the cost, but I had to return it. NOTE that the wireless uses 2.4 GHZ, which is the same frequency as Bluetooth on my Ford Truck. Recommend you verify compatibility with Bluetooth or other wireless devices on your vehicle first. I would also recommend that Peak make this potential issue clear in their product description. Finally, I have great praise for the folks at Peak. Peak's customer service was excellent and fast. The return process to Peak facilitated by Amazon was easy and I received full credit for the purchase in two days. I'll continue to be a user of Peak products.
B008VQ003M|5|very happy with purchase!
B00MU5X17M|5|It works great love it
B005CLQ3RQ|5|Easy to install. Fit like a glove.
B00FSL5DOE|5|worked like a champ!
B002INP6QU|5|excellent!! lowest price!!
B00IQCBQ0M|5|These lights are made very well , and light up bright. I'm very happy with them.
B00KNNPPZO|4|Item fit perfectly and is basically the exact color.  Thanks!
B003HYBDJS|4|the fuse I got are ok but the were not plated gold, they were silver.
B003VLBPJA|5|A+
B000PEPCGI|4|Perfect for wet sanding out orange peel!
B0006MRR2Q|5|EZ on & off now----Thanks
B00NDTMO04|4|OK
B0007LZI8G|4|Good quality and quick shipping.
B00U7XT1C8|2|like looking through a fog.  When the sun is directly in front, you are nearly blinded.
B002LNI8GW|5|These are perfect for use with Speed Shine by Griot's.
B001TI5IIQ|5|I was amazed how well this stuff works.  The instructions tell you to rub on this cream, then buff it out. If that does not clear your headlights, then they have these little sanding pads and another liquid to use.  I only had to do the first step it cleared my lights right up.  I didn't even have to use the sandpaper.  Great product.
B004GCS7GC|5|V.nice good job
B009DK39LU|4|Bought this electric fan as a replacement for the stock one on my 99 jeep Cherokee. The quality and thickness of the parts seemed the same as the OEM part. I would have given 5 stars except the fan was slightly out of balance. It seemed as though the fan blades (plastic) were bent by the way it was packaged. I installed it hoping that over time it may get back into shape. It's not warped enough to effect cooling, and is just short of bad vibration. Yes, I would probably buy/ recommend this fan. The quality and price was good and I receive it in a timely manner.
B00FAICU64|1|Looks like child's play. The lettering was crooked and not aligned properly. Appears this project was completed by hand using basic stencil materials. Totally inferior product.
B000C2QO7O|2|Well .. problem 1, it is not the correct fit for the car (although the fit was supposed to be guaranteed, and the information I provided was dead on accurate), so I cannot rate it by performance.  Problem 2, since I did not have time to install it within 30 days of receipt, they will not take it back for either cash or exchange.....very poor customer service.  I do not think this to be right, especially since it would not have worked anyway. I did purchase a different one locally which worked fine, but cost much more. I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1) because it was nicely priced and it was delivered very quickly, although in this case I did not need it to be so.
B00MBP6UJC|5|I got it today, thank you so very much
B00KO8KJ04|5|Went on easy.
B00N2HGF2A|5|it is a replacement part for some scooter. i used it to mount a slide carb on my go kart... worked very well for that.
B006HHRJFY|4|There OK
B001IZKDZI|5|Excellent cover.  Keeps tree sap off of camper and vents well.  Would buy again.
B000VKRQEM|5|Fits my 2007 VW Rabbit just fine, and the air feels a lot more clean now.
B00IFMOVE6|1|It not a year old yet and it is falling apart!!! I have been trying to restring the beads but nothing works. I would not recommend this to anyone.  very sorry I bought it.  smokey
B001U8SIBE|5|I like I Like It and the colors matches my car
B000IY7RC2|4|perfect fit
B001NYYREC|5|This works great I like the duel connections
B0081S8Z0K|5|Had to use it to replace the solenoid for the windless anchor in our boat, works great so far!
B004GCMVSM|4|Mirror shakes little when driving
B005WNMI32|5|Very nice quality
B000CMIV8O|5|Identical to what I had and the best price around and a savings of  nearly $70.
B00NTPSLZ4|5|Excellent shipping, excellent quality item
B009ZPH4HS|4|2015 Focus ST - fronts fit good, rears ok they are a little too big. Minor wind noise at speed. Worth the price in hot weather.
B0002NIKJ8|5|Perfect size.
B000E7YYDS|2|Didn't work for me. Water just came on and off. I could not see much difference in spray except for more or less water.
B001NZMZ5E|5|Fits perfectly well my 2008 V6 Accord EXL. Could feel the car breathing again properly, when I push that gas pedal :D
B001V8U12M|5|This socket makes putting the leveling jacks on the camper up and down super easy and fast. Just throw your cordless drill in the camper when you leave and you can have the whole thing set up in 2 minutes without any effort.
B002E59QDQ|5|Great product fast delivery
B00B3YL3OY|5|Not only did the bag arrive the day before our weekend trip but it works well on our roadglide. Had plenty of room for clothes and personal items. Also nice that it came with a rain cover as we ran into some heavy rain while in Milwaukee, WI.
B0028JW4PU|5|Great for the price.  Basic, but functional.
B00WDSVEE8|1|I am unable to use the polaroid clip-on while driving because it filters out reflected light. My auto (a BMW X3) uses a reflected image on the windshield to display my  speed and other driving data. The data is invisible when wearing the clip-on. Yes, I should have realized this before buying. I post this as an alert to others as ignorant as I.
B007KFPL7A|5|great rotors for a 99 jeep cherokee noticeable performance difference when using the power stop pads as well!!
B009DIYB6E|5|Nice filter! Just received it today and I'm impressed as to the build quality and looks. Almost too nice to stick in my engine so I'm enjoying it just sitting on my desk for the moment. Price is excellent too and with the lifetime warranty it's hard to ignore. As for mpg and performance I can't say right now but I'm very glad I purchased this filter instead of my usual Fram product. And yes, I would buy again and recommend it to anyone looking to replace their air filter with a quality product at a reasonable price.
B007Z4XQSW|5|makes the f-150 look good
B000GV9XD8|5|Very easy to install, just had to loosen the radiator and foot peg and everything fit like a glove and they sound great. I get a lot of compliments for my small motor sounding so good. Worth every penny.
B00NPM37U0|1|Mine stopped working a few months after installation. Company wants me to send the unit to China for repair. They expect me to drive around for a month with a huge hole in my dash and no music. Not happy at all.
B00KTICEZ2|5|Very satisfied $$ wise and it came on time and it really glows!
B004X9XR3Q|3|I got this for my 03 Tiburon 2.7L and it didn't even fit. I had to custom fit it and it still didn't work right. I think more info definitely needs to be in the description to help us buyers know it it's the right one or not.
B000IHJZD8|5|Does its job
B0068C2ASE|5|Great fit for my 07 ZX6R. Even came a day early. Great all around!
B00EZ9DGYO|4|Took 7 days to get here other than that perfect. comes with everything you need.
B00032K4FG|4|I like how it makes your license plate look. But here in NYC you would get a fine for having any sort of covers on your plate :(
B000GQOZ2M|4|I used the one I had before to cover my really large snow blower that I leave out in the summer so I bought another one for my scooter. Work great for me and the price is right. They ship fast also.
B00B57UABQ|4|Reduces glare from dash, saves dash from UV rays, what isn't there to like. Comes with velcro to secure it to dash if wanted
B00ATRYLGS|2|I did not see anything in the 'details' indicating there was no adhesive on one side.  I did see this in the 'questions' section, but only after I received the useless pad.<br /><br />Every foam seat pad I have shopped has adhesive.  I assumed this one would.  I never would've purchased it had I known.  I bought it because of the dimensions.<br /><br />This stuff appears to be pretty old too.  Looks like there was adhesive at one time, but it's all dried up and paper-like.  There's a sticker on the pad instructing the installer to apply adhesive, but the dried up, paper-like surface will not work with adhesive.
B00I5LCEAA|1|These are horrible. I have 3sizes of dishes in the RV and none of them fit. Either too small or too big.
B005GY8AVQ|5|Fit correctly. Works as advertised.
B006N9FC14|5|Good product, Good value. As described by Seller
B00076PG3S|5|Many comments on how well it looked
B00CF5CQHS|5|What can I say...I love my donkeys!
B000AMW0J2|5|Nice replacement filter for the original
B003EOXHOK|4|It's good, just slightly smaller than needed for the front emblem on a 2008 Trailblazer. Simply centered the installation holes for the threaded rods over and through the old emblem, drilled the holes and tightened.
B000L50ZVI|5|Good price and fast shipping
B004BTBP9Q|3|This item doesn't fit to Range Rover Evoque Dynamic 2014..
B0013HHNPY|5|worked as advertised.
B009D2R57M|5|Great product.  Quality parts.  More complete than might have been expected, especially for the price.
B00032K32A|5|This plate frame is for those license that are &#34;full&#34; of details.  Such as specialty plates (i.e.:  Veterans, Handicapped, State School, etc)  Keeps you away from the bare plate look with a nice boarder without hiding the details.  I have a Handicapped veteran plate and the other frames have writing on the covering important information of the very full plate.  This solved the problem.
B00K74STWK|5|Worth every dime...
B006JD481Y|1|This lead me to believe that I could program it my self 2011 and newer must be programmed by a dealer.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Wonderful item works exactly as advertised
B000UVUAFO|1|It doesn't work at all
B00NYU9P9A|5|This is my third controller. The second popular model sold for twice as much and cant compare to the  features this one has. The previous model was frying my batteries so I had to constantly watch for a blinking light. This controller has a fantastic charge controller. When the batteries are fully charged the control feature drops to a trickle charge. There are other great features as well but this one is most important. Now I don't have to attend to the solar system. Just let it run.
B00FFMK17U|5|The bumper protector fits like a charm if you do it right. Make sure you install while your bumbler is hot from the sunlight. This will make the plastic and 3m tape mold to the bumper
B000CP8F4Q|5|Does exactly what it says. My 2&#34; ball (non Reese) mounted perfect, and performs as expected. Reese always seems to be a quality made product.
B00DX8APU6|5|perfect for those hot summer days where a full face is too hot. Visor works well too.
B00T8UY9PA|4|I got the led lights and hooked them up and feel they light up the area pretty good. For 9in lights they are well worth the money.
B006F8TWSW|5|Extremely easy to install and looks great. Definitely a great buy!
B00UNMO4QQ|5|The switch fit my needs just well
B00PLDQ2BW|4|a little cheap and snug. Had to grind down the mount to fit in the front cupholder. Does the job..but does not match the color exactly of the interior plastic. Not enough to be ugly..just enough so you know.
B000BPVV1Q|2|I liked it but it fell apart on me about a month after I had it. Would like the item if it was better built.
B002ZBWKAU|4|If it just had a secondary battery powered option and stabilizing feet it would be perfect.  I can use it on my bikes and car with no issue. But it does want to jump around a lot.  Super simple to use and it's lasted a year so far.
B000EVYGZA|4|Great For The Price.
B00T2GT9L4|4|Just recieved it and have yet to use it so I will update if need be. But I am truely impressed with the quality of the product. The unit is solid and feels nice and it packed very well in it's case.<br /><br />Comed with a standard charger as well as a car charger and a usb cable. 2 usb ports and a flash light.<br /><br />The only con is the jumper cables could have been a little longer. The terminals on the battery are likely your only option.<br /><br />I wish they made a version with a solar panel and a radio for a perfect all around emergency battery pack.
B007VYHLAA|3|It does the job, no more leaks, but the vacu-form mould must be a tad bit off, as one side was about a quarter inch too long. I had to use lots of gasket maker goop to make it stay on. It could be better.
B00496CA90|2|I've been a Bosch Icon fan for a couple of years but unfortunately, ICON is not available for the '15 Silverado. I found these Delco blades and he fit perfectly however that's about all that was good. The drivers side chattered and the passenger side had about a 6 square inch area the the blade did not wipe. For whatever reason, the blade would not sit flat on the windshield.  I cannot return because I threw the packaging out.  I purchased the Trico Onyx. We shall see how they do.
B00CDT7G7Q|5|It is exactly as described.
B0076PKVVK|1|Lasted about a month before partial lights were out and others flickering. Note: Horrible design. Not even attempted to be waterproof. They fill with water anytime you wash your vehicle, so I knew they weren't going to last. They looked good for one month, so if you don't mind buying and installing 12 times per year, go for it. Also, they are just for looks, they have next to no light output.
B000C7ZW68|5|This part was the perfect replacement for my 98 TJ front turn signal.  The old one had become rusty and this one was an exact fit.  Plug and play.  Recommended.
B00OZX6VYM|5|Excellent fit, arrived on time.  Thanks
B001CEG90I|5|Fits perfect
B000GU1VD4|5|Great product, fast shipping speed, good price.....Great Job!  I will be back.  A++++ Seller
B003JAC02Y|5|Very satisfied
B00FWPGPNO|1|Very cheaply made, glass was uneven and the insides were exposed. Returned immediately.
B00EFFVBAO|2|cans were beat up be lucky to put lid on after opening.
B008UFPQG0|3|Thought I was getting a pair, which is what is required. Next time I'll be more careful when ordering.
B003CH3Z8W|5|Works great!!
B00EVIOUDA|5|It works like the 9x12, perfect for Litle space
B0027XEKQ8|5|All parts needed, fits perfect
B00MMQRIHI|5|Looks great on the car.  Fast shipment
B000E4IL8U|5|After having the unfortunate experience of backing into an uninsured tree, I began the process of trying to find a replacement tail light for my 2005 Chevy Tailblazer. The local auto parts stores (Advance Auto, and Auto Zone) wanted over $100 for a used junkyard tail light!  Needless to say, when I found this on Amazon for around $36.00 with shipping, I was thrilled, but couldn't help but wonder if it was too good to be true. Two short days later, I found myself opening the package containing the tail light, and replacing it myself in less than 5 minutes. It works perfectly, and even I cannot tell the difference between the two taillights. If you are hesitant to try this repair, go ahead and order the part and save yourself hundreds of dollars in parts and labor. Youtube has many how-to instructional videos for the taking out, then screwing in of the two phillip-head screws and plugging in the simple electrical unit.
B00JN8UHY4|5|Good priced for a replacement shield for the OEM that broke.  Operator error from lack of experience.  I just let the original retract on its own and eventually the end hooks broke.  I now release the shield and control the retraction with my fingers.  It should last much longer.
B007XXA5HA|1|None of the switches worked. Had to buy all new switches at tractor supply co
B00P4XSMC6|1|They didn't fit, and one was broken in half.
B00KXG1K5K|5|Awesome look. Gets me a lot of complements. I was worried they might not be bright enough during the daylight, but they give off plenty of warning.
B00L2T5ONQ|5|Nice item on time to. Thank you
B003WP1SEC|4|Have used them often, works well.
B007TY0G1I|2|The fitting was way off, cheaply made.
B0002F66H4|4|Obvious not super duper quality, but it looks better than a black tire hanging off the back of our travel trailer.<br />Some mention that is yellows quickly. Not sure but I suspect they might be parking their RV's out in the sun when stored.<br />Our is inside parked. So we'll see if it stays a pretty white.
B007L2JNT4|4|Purchased this product to be used in my 2007 Ford F-150XLT Triton.  The mirrors work great, the installation is a little snug and you have to push it a little bit hard to make them click on the trucks mirrors, but once the click, they will stay there.  I installed them and used them around town for few days before get on a long trip and they worked to perfection, no shaking or looseness.
B00N6KOILS|5|I used this meter to see when the Coach Batteries on an RV were being charged.<br />It works GREAT!  And I would definitely buy it again for my next RV.
B00B8SZWAQ|5|Bought this for my moms car and she loves it! little kids are always trying to take pictures with the car because its from the movie &#34;cars&#34; lol so cute! must get! very trick material and definitely keeps the heat away!
B000OOIZFY|5|Work good but not instruction
B0012TRPGU|5|Melts the crud off of your tires. Shiny black wheels (motorcycle) after application and rinse. I recommend the product.
B0053O9EUA|5|This is some good quality stuff. What more can you say
B00H8YQ3DY|4|love it just what I was looking for
B000HDE7DQ|5|This paint is by far the best that I have used. My seats on my boat was looking pretty bad, I put a towel on the top to cover up the black spots. I tried this paint and all I can say is wow it looks new and it also feels like new. The only problem I had is one can splattered a lot the rest was great!!
B00EFDJB8A|5|Perfect
B00RSOLXFM|1|Broken in first week, couldn't tell any difference in smell in the car.
B00L237SUO|4|the end piece keeps falling out but works most of the time.
B0087RWRL8|5|Awesome lights. Very bright. Good delivery time. Great price! $40 for 2 or $100 for 1 at the local parts store.....easy choice
B008BVVYCI|1|It only cover the front, back of the seat is open, it tie by the string and yes it look like very very ugly spider web. I
B000BUQOCC|5|This tank rinser works terrific / has made life simple and saves time - Love It.
B007NGAW3Y|4|Runs on the small side.  I should have ordered a size larger
B004HCM9H4|5|Great Product
B004XOPZV8|3|does not contain the space to mount a temp sensor, as it shows in the pic and on the box.<br /><br />if that's not a requirement, i'm sure it would be fine.<br /><br />sent it back.
B005CHT4W6|5|This stuff is the best
B00WID0OEE|4|Works fine in shower
B002FXAGPY|5|I had this battery in use for 3-1/2 years before it failed. Maybe it would have lasted longer, if I had been using my battery tender. Anyway, I was so impressed I have ordered the same battery as a replacement.<br /><br />IS IT A GOOD PRODUCT? When your friends are replacing their other branded motorcycle batteries every 1 to 2 years and you're getting 3-1/2. You get the point.<br /><br />SHOULD YOU BUY THIS? Resoundingly; YES!
B0077S1BBU|5|Easy to install. 2003 Honda Accord. Little tricky when the shifter is back. But it works perfect
B00N396SHE|1|Overall it's pretty basic.
B000JFJLP6|5|Great tool!  I bought one of these almost four years ago, and it was still going strong on the original battery when some low-life stole it.  I didn't hesitate to buy a second one and was amazed that in four years the price had only gone up $4!  I LOVE the new insulated clamps as well.  Much less likely to short anything out accidentally.  I'm an automotive locksmith, so I use this a lot while programming automotive transponder systems.  Most of those systems get unstable with low power, and often the cars I work on have been sitting for weeks or months before the owner finally decided to have me come out and fit a new key.  Hopefully I'll be able to hang onto this one longer than the last one!
B00BGZ025G|4|I like it, no problems. Going to buy more. I just wish there was other colors.
B009PHDDGW|5|Fit well, easy to install.  Quick shipping.  Good price.
B00CFPIYUG|5|This little cupholder trashcan is pefect!! Love it for all the little scraps!!
B000UXV9VG|5|Fits perfect, is compact, and definitely helps with this Florida heat. If they offered PRIME shipping it would be the perfect deal.
B00J7E3GF6|5|Excelent. It gives an extra touch of elegance to my Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn.
B006IVIYUS|5|This was just what my jeep needed to raise the rear a few inches. Easy install and looks great.
B009O0COEW|1|Doesn't match the chrome on my Cadillac at all. Had to call dealership.
B000EOGXTO|5|Very good
B008KZK4XU|5|Perfect in every regard. Much recommended
B005ZS1ZVU|5|Fit perfect, shipped quickly, very satisfied customer here!
B00KXGVVU4|1|I bought 6 of them they don't flash so I have to return them
B00KTHY2DA|2|Was the wrong size.
B006X8AUAS|5|Great item sorry for late reply just took it out of the box and installed it into customer truck
B00296D22Q|5|Fantastic product. Thank you.
B00DJ64RNS|5|The product was easy to install and is solid.  I do wish the numbers, however, were a bit larger since it is somewhat difficult to see them looking into the car and under the seat.
B000NW8E94|5|Direct replacement, perfect fit. Timely delivery. Very satisfied with this item.
B00G6IQY1E|1|Bought the gm shiny ebony to color match my glove box door on my hummer. My hummer has stock ebony interior from the factory. I sprayed the glove box door and it doesn't come close to matching the rest of the dark ebony interior. The paint came out more like a lighter greyish tone. Sprayed on well but definitely not happy with the results. Had my hopes up very high reading all the good reviews too. Smh
B008CE070E|5|Great product
B00BEYNBXO|5|Glad I got it!!! Obviously this is an OEM part but I have had OEM paint not match worth a s***. I was also surprised to find that when filling a rock chip it actually was less noticeable without the \\"top coat\\" (sparkle coat) cause it draws attention and you can see where that coat starts and stops more.
B000C11JMA|5|Excellent item!!! Fast Shipment
B000O3U2UQ|4|works great so far, have not had long enough to use a lot.
B000MWGW1C|5|Have WeatherTech in all of our vehicles. Perfect fit for GMC 2500HD 2002.
B0009V1WSE|5|Worked Perfect, Fast a Delivery !
B00CE3PATC|5|Great product. Much easier to install than previous models.
B0051D3MP6|5|Received item very quickly.  Very easy to connect and very lightweight!
B000NU8LEO|5|Very good touch up paint. Color matches.
B0002MABGE|1|This item is very flimsy and I would not recommend it.
B00U0HI02S|5|I really love it. Is perfect. I love minions. Arrived quickly
B00DQ6SIG8|4|Instructions sucked. but once on the product is great!
B00P649RY0|5|Feels more responsive. Sounds great
B005GRGFZ6|1|It looked great out of the box, and ran great once installed but that only lasted for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes it failed and would no longer supply spark.
B00T47KYZ6|5|Awesome product. I liked it. Does not have blades, moves hot air around in car pretty fast!
B000K0WQD4|5|The shocks arrived in 2 days , installed both shocks in less in an hour<br />Very satisfied with the performance
B002Y35O8O|5|Fit like oem
B0040ZQLWM|5|This is nice! Well made and it even looks good. I particularly like how easily it rolls up and the Velcro strap secures it for easy storage. I intend on keeping my FJ until it won't roll anymore so I'm hoping this will help make the dash last just as long! :-)
B000RXKR6M|5|Very good product. Last a good while.
B004TC3D18|1|PAINT DOESN'T MATCH THE HARD TOP AT ALL! HORRIBLE
B0067UBT9S|1|The holes was a little off
B000A0EIJY|4|Fit as it should and was a nice replacement for my very dirty old air filter.
B00Q5MPI4K|4|Only gave it 4 stars because I found it $17 cheaper after I ordered.  The mat is a little thinner than the original it replaced. I do like the Buick logo.  Adds a nice touch. Color matches perfectly.  Delivered on time.
B007JUEOCE|5|many compliments. easy install
B001O005L4|4|Was very easy ordering. Very prompt delivery. Happy with our purchase. Thanks. 4 stars
B004BTMKJA|5|Installed in my 1988 Colt Vista - took it for smog test - PASSED as I needed everything working!
B00HVI8R1S|5|Nice! Thanks!
B00RNCOKKO|5|Very sturdy. Superior quality fabric.
B0055DO3FA|5|These are Buck horn style. They fit my bike perfectly with no problems with cables or wires (Honda shadow 750 ace.) They look perfect and are the best fitting bars I've found to date.
B001JT0L46|3|It will not stay stuck to the smooth plastic dash in my car.  Other that that it is great.
B0031GR05I|5|Great delivery time perfect fit.
B000ILE20U|4|okay - probably deserves a five star. I was only a bit disappointed because I wanted a tip for soldering fine pade (resistor trace pads etc) and this was a BIT big for that... so for general PCB use i might pick the 'D' size - which i did also. Just a tip. (no pun intended)
B00ADLHMJI|5|Good, solidly built can, decent price&#62;&#62;&#62;Happy customer!
B00HS5WKVC|1|Makes a lot of dust, i don't recommend!! My rims are  chrome but now  are black! !
B00PIL9Y9Y|5|Good adhesive and easy to use.
B003YI1BQ2|5|I installed this battery in my Victory Cross Country Tour. It has plenty of cranking owner and with a variety of adapter plates, it can be used in many different makes and models.
B0068C11XO|5|Fit my 84 Shadow perfectly. She looks brand new
B00K889FCI|5|I was naturally sceptical because of the 'as seen on TV!' but holy cow the stuff works and works well!! I'm two weeks in after the application and it still looks amazing. Not to mention the headlights actually project light now. Couldn't recommend any more for how cheap, simple, and well it has worked. Thanks!
B00ZB84CDM|5|The lights came in good packaging.  Everything was in proper order.  These lights kick stock lights out of their place.  Highly recommend
B000C7TV6A|5|worked great.
B005DM8502|5|Best on the market. Fit like a glove.
B00CSWEJZU|3|I have to agree .  The waffle design is brilliant. This is a very absorbent towel and makes drying a car easily. Unfortunately, the towel started to fall apart pretty quickly. The towel snags easily and rips small threads out.<br />Ad feedback
B001QQD9PK|5|I love it 😃😃
B009PJJG1Q|5|I'm a Chrysler tech and this is crucial for me. For the price this rocks. It's 1/4 the cost of the oem miller tool.
B00ZYNOR70|1|This does not fit a 2007 Grizzly 700.  The tabs for the plug are far too large and will not plug in.
B007HAWAAO|5|Perfect. Blended nice on my 2000 em1 Si
B00J0ABRL2|5|I recommend this product decent item for the price.
B004UMB7WY|4|Bottom line this product works. Have you ever drank a small bottle of cherry scent concentrate? Well if you did and then threw up a 1L mixture of stomach acid and cherry scent it wouldn't clean like this stuff does. Maybe they meant cherry as in the smell of a 40yr old virgin couch potatoes Lol.... Seriously if you buy this for the scent get your products at auto zone.. ... this is a serious product! I only gave it 4stars because I personally reserve 5 for above and beyond. This product does its job and it does it better then almost all of its competitors. You will be impressed with its out come. Thanks
B00GXXCP24|5|Worked well
B00TXS7AXA|4|Fits fine.  Has a wide field of view
B0082GKQQW|3|its ok and i did not expect what i expected.
B004K80IJ6|3|White box should I say more.
B00IMUC9YA|5|Just so much fun to see. No problems putting it on or driving with it on. Perfect.
B00HAV0IHC|1|Not impressed, first time buying car seat covers for my car, didnt come with instructions, they constantly slip off when getting out of the car..they look and feel cheap.
B004D8X6R4|1|With the factory fogs on my explorer, i could use them without the headlights using sylvania silverstar 9145 bulbs. These were nowhere near as bright as my factory fog lights but it did fit my truck perfectly as an OEM replacement.  I will upgrade the halogen H3's bulbs that come with the projectors to H3 HID 6000K with ballasts to see if the brightness re appears.  Other than that, the projector look looks nice.  Be cautious of the halo wire harness...the soldering was weak/fragile on mine and now they don't work  ****UPDATE*** the company promptly sent me another set of fogs lights after the original complaint which was nice, but those had the same problem...however sometimes it rains and that's when I found out why these were probably discontinued by the manufacture.  There is water all on the inside of my fog lights. Not worth buying.
B00XBEK002|5|Works great on my commander, would be perfect on any sxs for that matter. Decent distance, shines further than my OEM headlights, and the flood is insane. Super bright, I'm very happy with my purchase.
B000EDUTWM|3|falls of wall
B000O86886|5|If you have Lucas Girling brakes than you need this tool!
B00NLN8JDI|4|Good looking Fenders. Although! Extreme terrain has a problem with shipping. Some nicks in the paint nothing to bad.
B00NRBPSGK|3|Nice graphic and looks cool on helmet
B00F1RJATY|4|This is just a finishing piece to any R line vehicle. The license plate makes my vehicle look one of a kind.  such a nice looking vanity accessory to my VW CC.
B00SLKS990|5|It was exactly what I needed and $50 dollars cheaper than any where else.
B00480FIDW|1|GARBAGE.  I have been using Philips CrystalVisions for years on tons of cars and motorcycles and recommended them to MANY fellow car enthusiast friends, but this pair didnt last me even 4 months and 2000 miles.  Most of that driving was with lights off too.  One blew out a couple of weeks ago and it just hit me I didnt even use them for more than a few hours.  Ill likely never buy Philips CrystalVisions ever again.  Hoping I have better luck with the Sylvania ZXE's I just installed.  Really disappointed :(
B00T4OJMLG|5|This is fantastic!  Looks great and well made.  A great item for the price.
B00CMOV8EE|3|Nothing special here. Chinese rotors and Chinese pads with pretty red painted remanufactured calipers. Could do better buying separately, with higher end parts. Very noisy also.
B00CZG1VZU|4|Works fine
B003CSLAWO|1|Measurement should be from top to top of ridges in the bottom.  Bought because according to measurements, five drawer toolbox would fit with inch to spare.  Was about an inch too tall and had to cut down the ridges to get it to fit.  If I had bought locally, I would have taken it back.  Wasn't going to mess with sending that big box back.
B0013OFIJA|5|Daughter loved this frame.  Her car is decked out in Hello Kitty.  Well made, good quality
B00QSN3RKS|3|It's really cool but a little flimsy for the money.  It also makes it difficult to see the mirror.  Overall I like it but it could be better made
B004I0PP4Y|5|Perfect in all ways for my PT Cruiser.
B0006302M2|5|Excellent item
B008DIZ1S2|3|I would have given 5 stars except the holes didn't match up that good. The screws could not go all the way in, so had to use a file to make the holes wider for it to work. So a simple 1 minute job, took over 1/2 hour. Once it was on, it looked nice.
B00EXG5NHW|5|I bought this for my Yamaha Virago's final drive, but sold the bike before the service was due. Ended up putting it in the tranny of my BMW R1200R since it met the spec.  The bike seems to like it. Shifts smoothly. I'd consider using it again.  No complaints.
B005KOZ25Y|4|good
B00KUL790S|5|Item as described.  Fit great
B00NIHP7ZA|5|I have bought +100 LED lights for earthmovers, this is my best LED buy to date.  2 in a box, 4 boxes.  These have the (old style!) slightly heavier 16ga wire leads, as opposed to the cheaper 18ga I have received from other vendors.  Bass boats and 4-wheelers don't care, rock dozers can bust the lighter lead wires too easily.  Maybe I got old inventory & got lucky, could not be happier...  5 Stars & THANK YOU!!!
B009WEV5AO|4|Worked well , had to put in spacers to make them fit proper.
B00K0WLVF6|5|Spacers are beautifully machined.
B002YCE5V2|5|Fit perfect, stopped the flashing &#34;service 4wd&#34; light on the dash
B00M5WYWPU|3|The 'J' and the 'P' aren't exact dimensions of factory logo. Once I noticed this I opted not to install, but for the $10 cost, I'm not about to return item to China either. I'll wait till I have a motorized toy worthy of the decoration, ironically, of course.
B007Y7XAP4|5|The BMW Dealer  quoted me a price of $102 ea!!!!  I got a pair(2 grills) for less then the price of one from BMW.  Materials are the same and they simply &#34;snap&#34; in!!  Love it.  Perfect fit!!!!
B00756NNN8|4|Liked it but wished it would have lined up with the Jeep indent on the sides of the Jeep.<br /><br />Good-Buy
B000COC67E|5|Solid little stool. Works well. Better than harbor freight stuff for sure.
B000I0VKGK|5|Worked great for my Ford F-150 low and high pressure valves
B00VIVGRS4|5|We own three different &#34;older-larger&#34; jump pack type units for use with camping or helping friends/family out with battery dead issue and they all did their job well. This is MUCH MUCH smaller in all and yet did the same job over the weekend for jump starting our 2003 Explorer 4wheel drive with the six cylinder engine while we were at the camp grounds. I am a believer that this unit can do as it said it can as it worked twice for us. I have an electronic engineering background and believe me when I say that this is a good little unit. After we returned home I plugged it in to the wall charger and it is ready for its next use. Side suggestion, pair this with an inverter and a little know-how and you can have a portable 110 volt house power portable unit for running a blender or toaster when camping.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065L2D8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00 this can give you a plug-gable option for accessories of small current draw. If using an inverter you may need to clip directly on to the inverters screw terminals making certain to avoid potential short circuits. Again, these are just MY thoughts and you do so at your own risk. There is a lot of power available during a short circuit and serious injury may occur or even worse.
B004J07ZAU|5|was a gift
B000BZJ6J0|3|I didn't have any problems with this product. just an o2 sensor. came with antiseize on the threads. No problems with connecting to factory harness. works just fine.
B00OU5LOT2|5|A very good product and took about 2 1/2 to 3 hours to install. Don't understand why the keychain doesn't work, but the other remote works fine and the lights are very bright and the modes all work and so do all of the colors.
B004J317JC|5|Works as advertised, with Denso you will never go wrong.
B004N8VUY0|5|Great mirrors work fantastic
B002SJH5U4|5|This is the second time I've bought this bumper. It is a great bumper for the price, tho all the hardware was lost in shipping, it was probably for the better as it probably would have been cheap Chinese hardware. Very thick and study, goes great with the JCR Offroad frame tie-ins. Would highly recommend.
B00KNNP8R4|5|The product was as expected and it fits very well.
B002EOZFQ4|5|Absolutely love my new Truxedo Truxport cover. It's tough, durable, looks awesome, and kept all of my stuff dry on a recent roadtrip from Florida to Arizona, through several torrential storms and fluctuating temperatures. Definitely saw a bump in my MPG as well! Made my truck look pretty badass too.<br /><br />Excellent customer service made this one of the best buying experiences I've had on Amazon. Go straight to the source, buy from Truxedo!
B000C17G5E|5|good stuff with all the gaskets you need
B00DFVV3BG|5|cant beat the fit and finish for the price, i feel bad for anyone who buys this from the dealer.
B0048FEKW2|5|Works great for my 2013 Ford Eco Boost!
B0033I2WMA|5|I paired these with MSD 32839 8.5mm Super Conductor Spark Plug Wire Set, MSD 8231 Blaster Replacement Coil, ACCEL 120142 Distributor Cap, and ACDelco D465 Professional Ignition Distributor Rotor in a 2003 Chevy S10 Crewcab.  Very responsive plug, definite upgrade from the ACs I pulled out.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend
B000SL4AA2|2|It's okay for an emergency. It doesn't read the right PSI.... For this quality you might find cheaper or just get a foot pump.Would not recommend
B001JT0CGI|5|I used this for another task that needed completion.  I was real happy with the results.
B00A0BAYR8|5|Product works as advertised.
B00CIZAALE|5|My daughter absolutely loved it!  Thanks for offering it.
B00NFP0X7W|5|Nice heavy duty strap for tying down atvs.  Much heavier than the one from HD.  Hooks are larger and will fit around the frame on my larger atv.  i like the heavier ratchet style.  Very fast shipping arrived before I expected them.
B0096DW4C4|4|no instructions had to go buy longer bolts but it does its job
B004971N1K|5|Good morning I have doubts if this serves to spare my 1.6 engine Mazda in March 2008 serial 9FCBK456680106096 I need both sides. Thank You.
B000E0ICXS|5|Was good. Just an oil filter so I guess saying it fit is good lol
B002N5J8CQ|5|Solves otherwise very gross problems.
B009PAK75E|3|Very pretty, but doesn't seem to fit my Kia Rio seats very well.
B00GWTAAIA|5|Seems to be good quality, works really well. I believe I got a good product.  W J Driver
B0002KKIVO|5|The top looks new again thanks
B0068EPQWE|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B000KZ0HYY|4|Exact item as described
B002DZGC52|5|Comes with easy instructions
B00E5OUOCQ|5|After only 2 uses, the threads around the shade came undone. We now have one side that's fine and the metal circle for the other side exposed. I guess I could resew it, but who has the time for that!?! Other than that, it works fine  Update: I was contacted after I left this review and was offered a FULL refund or a free replacement. No further questions asked. That in itself I think deserves commendation. I opted for the replacement. It works, I am happy. Go out and get this, because you now know that the company takes customer satisfaction seriously.
B00QIT8RKM|5|Nice looking and cheap price
B00BFLVZMA|1|junk, plain and simple. lasted two days
B0046BHXO0|5|Cute
B0009IK7YW|4|Part fit without any issues. It was replaced along with the catalytic converter on 1994 Chevrolet C1500 W/T. Emissions test will tell all.
B003TTTIOI|5|We love VP fuel jugs.  We have bought other VP jugs before, so was anxious to see if this one would be as good.  Very pleased with it.  This jug has a hand notch on the bottom that makes it easier to pour. The lids are tight so that moisture and condensation does not leak into your fuel.  The plastic does not rust, and holds up for many years.  Very pleased with this product.
B009YJ3M7G|5|Great product, I'd buy again.
B00KLZ65GM|1|not cut right and  skull not placed right do to the cutting being wrong.
B00539L3VS|1|was not beige..ended up being grey in color..i didnt have the time to send it back for a refund  really needed them..not happy with product
B00R0TU2IO|5|Bought this for my husband's birthday and it's a hit.  He's only had it two days and I swear he is looking for things to fill!  I gave it a try on our riding lawn mower and I have to say it was nice to not have to struggle to see in that dark hole so I don't spill gas everywhere.  Appears to be durable but I guess only time will tell.
B0019I9SB4|5|fit great
B00HSMXG2W|5|simple to use
B00OONXGRS|5|I've tested this light by connecting it directly to the battery, and this thing is bright. Am still waiting on brackets to mount this light. The over build quality seems to be good. It's rugged and appears like it will take the elements on very well. I guess time will tell. So far I am pleased with this light. I received this product for a fair and honest review.
B00QYMY72A|1|This is not worth it, dont spend ur money. First:  After install doesnt look nearly the the image ilustrate.<br />Second: It broke the very next day as i hit it with my foot when getting off car.
B007F1FMIC|5|I love it. I was surprised it was as big as it was. Definitely worth the price!!!
B003G6V6O4|5|Great!
B001SZIFJY|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 Passat 1.8t. Cheaper than anywhere else
B00JGE2PUE|5|fits and works perfectly
B004HEBN1A|5|Awesome .... Some scratches on it..... paint peeling but it's not a $700 one and its gunna eventually do that not for show its for use ..... Delivers quickly
B006QH550Q|1|Garbage battery left me stranded on 1000 mile road trip 3 months after purchase, had to take a tow truck to the nearest advance auto and buy a new battery, very disappointed
B004A6JA1K|3|Works however it didnt really want to fit. Plastic seemed a bit warped so the small clips didnt make contact with the housing.
B00LB8B40A|5|Works fine. No reason not to buy this one.
B000T5BI8Y|5|Works great
B000E28C7M|5|great easy on easy off
B00VJBERIK|5|Great! Fast shipping!
B002824NTW|4|JUST WHAT I EXPECTED
B00252G4K6|5|Everything you need; filter, washer and o-rings.
B00JDOGP6C|5|Great value
B00TA8L50W|5|Awesome looking decal
B003UHX5WU|5|Nice shiel better to have then be in hot helps on 20 degrees less hot good still happy that I bought
B0041HN1HM|4|Works fine for the price.
B00KYJ23HA|5|LOOKS GOOD, FEELS GOOD; IF DURABLE I WILL BE VERY HAPPY
B005Z2D23U|4|JUST WHAT I EXPECTED
B00HJ15AJ4|3|Very nice looking and pretty sturdy BUT covered over the state and some plate numbers and completely covered the state saying at the bottom. Make sure to measure your plate dimensions before purchasing!!!
B002JB86ZE|5|Perfect...thank you!!
B00KTIQAZW|5|Everything that I purchased has been awesome.<br /><br />  Thanks Amazon
B0002T8GL4|3|Application is easy.  Didn't like having to purchase a pump/pressurized sprayer to apply.  Hard to keep from streaking when wiped off.  I will live with the application issues if it performs as advertised.  Haven’t had my camper outside in the dust, rain and sun yet.
B005JZOKO8|5|Quality caps look great thanks!
B00J52H5T8|2|They looked good but didnt feel very good, felt more like rain boots and the tags fell off right away
B00LTU1QYO|5|This was something I needed for a specific job. Item is a quality product and I am very happy with the pliers and seller....
B00KPR031E|5|I have a 2002 lance truck camper. This is the exact replacement. It great not to hear the extra vibrations of a broken speaker.
B004HM0QBK|1|High side gauge leaks. Going to see if I can return it.
B00514AS8E|4|Great product.  My only complaint is that the turn signals are not very visible, especially in daylight.  I am running this light without external signals so for me that is a concern.  My concern though is being overridden by that super clean look that not having external signals provides.
B00PQZMB10|4|Quite amazing for the price.
B001SD2BNW|5|THIS FEELS LIKE BEING IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE YOU KNOW IS GOING TO CHEAT ON YOU .<br />THE  LOVING ?...IT LOOKS SO SLEEK AND SEXY ON MY NEW TRUCK THAT IF I COULD GET IT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR I WOULD LET IT SLEEP ON THE COUCH. IT SEEMS DURABLE, STRONG AND WELL MADE. ONE PERSON OF AVERAGE STRENGTH, AGILITY AND INTELLIGENCE CAN INSTALL IT. IN USE THE CONVENIENCE OF ONLY OPENING SECTIONS AS NEEDED IS WONDERFUL.<br />THE  CHEATING?: ...IT AIN'T WATERTIGHT.  SOME SMALL AMOUNTS OF WATER GET INTO THE BED UNDER DOWNPOUR OR WINDY CONDITIONS. THE DESIGN NEEDS MODIFICATION AROUND THE EDGES AND THE TAILGATE GAPS AND ALSO TO PREVENT AN EVER SO SLIGHT FRONT TO BACK SHIFTING . SINCE I HAD ALREADY PLANNED TO CARRY ALL MY STUFF IN PLASTIC CARGO CARRIERS THIS SMALL AMOUNT OF MOISTURE HASEN'T BEEN A REAL PROBLEM. I WOULD STILL PREFER THIS OVER THE ONE PIECE DESIGNS.
B002YSCCRA|5|👍🏻
B00BG6IJA0|5|Better than expected! Fast shipping!
B004Y5AUTS|5|Great product. Fast shipping.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|I like them
B004W4MEGI|2|These headlights look very cool. But they require some splicing and the lights are aimed incorrectly. Unfortunately, they cannot be adjusted.
B00200B22S|5|Works great
B00ECSIMMO|5|I just got my decal, it is nicer than the picture, it actually and truly looks like it's metal.<br />I have to order more, for me of course and one for everyone in my family. We are all<br />dog people and with a paw print it will look cool.<br />I am going to put  it with my dog paw. I have a tattoo and it's the same as this decal,<br />but a dog paw in the middle.<br />I haven't put it on my car yet, I have to pick the perfect spot.
B000COS8LC|5|It works.
B007V2BU5O|3|when they say two piece, they meant two pieces, separately.  i don't see why they wont' make it into one like any other heat shield besides the fact that they basically got the cut wrong, so for the left half i have to barely squeez it thru without touching the center rear view mirror, and the right side is fine with extra space.  so left side is too tight, and the right side has ample space.  and it is for a 2013 civic lx sedan.  i've had a few and they all worked awesome.  91 325i, 95 integra, 04 STi.  but they really dropped the ball on this one!  besides the fitting, the heat shielding is great still.  just really wish they had a one piece shield that actually fits without hassle.
B00AFZFRE4|5|Easy to install.  Be prepared to drill holes in your car.  A hole saw really helps the process.
B009IK98KQ|5|I love this seat belt cover.  It is soft, attaches easily and makes my seat belt very comfortable instead of hurting my collarbone.<br />Highly recommend it.
B00F0DW88E|3|It was OK but not as good as I was lead to believe. Removed mildew but not so good on tough stains.
B0036QVYPU|5|What can I say???
B007Q63KVC|5|Got it for my mother as a gift and she was extremely happy with it. It's cheap yes but that's not what it is all about!
B00JXNK1Z4|1|Very smelly! So much so, I took it all out of the car! It was giving me headaches. Only thing worth keeping was the seatbelt wraps. The steering wheel cover made my hands smell. The seat covers are flimsy and thin, not worth the money!
B0055W4NW4|5|Great Quality item
B00N9CT56G|5|Exactly as ordered did its job
B0072VYSJE|5|Working great
B00KTIC5B0|5|This was my trial purchase of the product and I'm very SATISFIED!! I'll reorder the same product for the second set
B004GD2NAM|5|Great product
B008I22COE|5|Good deal with super fast shipping.
B00NX00PJK|3|Installed on a 2014 Ram 1500 QC w/ the 6.5' bed.  The rack arrived slightly beat up but nothing too bad.  It seemed to be of pretty decent construction with good welds.  Installation was fairly easy.  However, on my truck, due to the location of my stake pockets and the bolt holes on this rack, I was only able to install 2 out of the 3 bolts per floor plate.  This would likely not be an issue on other vehicles.<br /><br />Once installed, it is a good looking rack and quite functional.  I have added a bracket for a gate application I found at Ace Hardware and mounted a pulaski axe.  The rack does not obscure my third brake light, but the top bar does sit pretty high above the roof of my Ram; about 7 inches.  Consequently, my gas mileage suffered immediately; it went from a daily average of 18.5mpg to around 17.2mpg.  I think I will use my metal chopsaw and cut off about 3&#34; and see if that helps.<br /><br />Why only 3 stars when no real complaints?  Because I've had it on my pickup for about two months during the worst heat wave this area has had in 100 years.  I've washed the truck twice during that time.  All of the hardware bolts have surface rust and there is serious rust forming on multiple welds.  At the rate it's rusting, I'll have to replace it after the winter.<br /><br />At $150, it was a great rack. but to make it last more than a few months in even a desert climate, it will need to be completely sandblasted and repainted with a quality paint.  You will also have to spend another $20 on quality hardware.  I think I'll go with spending an extra $100 or so and save the labor and materials for other projects...
B008BX0AUI|2|Cheap material<br />I recived 2 pieces one was broken<br />I tried to fix it with some superglue but as i closed the door it jumped out of its placed and got crushed.<br />The otherone is fine strong white light
B000M8NZ70|5|I am soo glI used this product! Everyones different I see a few 1 star reviews but this stuff Did just what it said it would! I blew a headgasket on my 05 Mazda 3S 2.4L and I had water incusion in my oil! They wanted 900 to &#34;Fix&#34; my headgasket! on my 4 banger! F!@#$ that kids! I used  this but I will say that after I did the drain and clear out the water until &#34;clear&#34; I shutdown the engine and waited a week to refill with coolant and changed the oil! I just drove 50 miles around town and the water oil problem is &#34;solved do not know how long it will last but getting back my wheels for under 100 bucs is &#34;Awesome&#34; just saved me 800 dollars that I didn't have! 5 Stars for me kidz!
B001EOV492|5|This ball mount is exactly what I wanted. It's heavy, well built and comes with 2&#34; torqued ball. Fit perfectly into my 2&#34; hitch receiver. Pin and clip snapped right-in. Great deal.
B0006MWPZU|5|A little warm; but, very comfortable.
B001KRH5MI|5|slight spacing modification. works great. engine much cooler. larger coolant volume.
B004KED8CO|5|This smaller lug wrench was just what I needed for the cargo trailer I pull behind my Honda Goldwing motorcycle.  It does the job and takes up less space in the trailer.
B005WWNQOS|5|We assembled the mirror rather quickly but it would not work (scrolling down). We took them off and place them back in the box for return. My hubby called the manufacturer and they told us to massage (thats right) the mirror because it has a dot of silicone to prevent damage during shipping. Well we massaged the mirror and assembled. It worked great! There are no instructions so had to go online to watch videos. It felt good to have extended tow mirrors on our old 1999 Ford F350 which didn't have the fancy mirrors. Looks great now!
B003BZCZZE|5|awesome
B00U7YXPVK|5|It came pretty promptly and looks great my jeep. Matches the color perfectly. Love it!
B000LC87V6|5|Genuine replacement.
B00JRG2F1A|4|This appears to be a very strong and well made tie down. I got the ratchet type for my motorcycle trailer since I could never seem to get my smaller non-ratchet type tight enough to keep the bike from moving on long trips over rough roads. I'll update this when I can subject it to a good trip test.
B000P6WQB0|2|I recieved the quart of filler but no tube of hardner as was stated in item description. The filler is useless without hardner.
B001KQD7TY|5|Went way to long without working back windows considering the reasonable price of these regulators.  Installation wasn't too tough, just google it and you'll find a lot of how-to articles.
B00HFWZ1NW|4|Basic truck mats. Worth the price!
B00SCYM8YW|5|They are perfect. Looks awesome on the car.
B000GOJWBS|5|This fit my 2001 Explorer Sport Trac perfectly. Along with the proper resistor, it fixed the problems we were having with the AC in this hot August in Alabama. Installation instructions were easy to find on YouTube. Don't forget the resistor: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009IF2I7G/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
B00JQ1XRIG|1|Tac Didn't work properly in any mode or on any type of motor from single to eight cylinders.<br /><br />Hour meter did work properly
B004VGAJOG|4|Fitted well
B000GV51BG|2|This Big Sucker did not fit my 2015 Harley Heritage Softail...but it was advertised as being a fit....I had to pay postage back and get it back to the UPS store on the same day it arrived...I did get the Big Sucker from a custom shop here in Houston..It was very ez to install you just have to be careful with 4 small o rings...I used the video on the ness website it was excellent..
B000Q0LYNG|5|Just like O E
B000QIWAJ0|5|Poor
B00JDTTXFM|5|I LOVE  this brush guard. It looks amazing. I was having second thoughts while I was waiting to receive it because of the reviews that say the top bar is dinged up. However, mine was not. The only issue I have were with the horrible instructions and the cutting of the air damage and upper cover. I cut it like the instruction pictured and looks like ebay will be getting some business because I need a new upper cover, it's fine I'm just a perfectionist...
B00ET6UXLC|4|They do what is needed and better than playing with dealer.
B005WWNQES|5|We assembled the mirror rather quickly but it would not work (scrolling down). We took them off and place them back in the box for return.

B009PMN9LG|3|It's not too good
B00DBHFCC0|4|Son-in-Law loved this birthday gift !!  Fit his jeep perfectly.  Arrived much sooner than estimated which was a plus.  Installation took longer than reviews indicated and there was some modification of one bolt  It neded to be shortened.  Son-in-law went out, tested it and it worked just liked a dream on the rugged, rock covered trails of Virginia.
B00B4S29JC|5|Perfect and made of heavy rubber material. Fit perfectly in my Toyota Avalon.
B00RHSDRSK|5|works as expected
B004AQYXE4|4|Kit seems OK, I was disappointed to find that gimbal bearing included was not drilled for greasing.  Otherwise the kit is good.
B000JZZ96Q|5|Product was easily installed.  I dabbed dielectric grease (what I had handy) on the threads and the o-ring -  I read that Vaseline is recommended.<br /><br />The old petcock was tough to get out from what appeared to be the broke o-ring that likely caused the leak and need for replacement.  Look at the new petcock and note the tab that gently needs to be fitted in to the radiator at the same location that the old one came out from, then twisted clockwise by hand to fit.  The broke petcock had to be twisted every quarter turn or so to find the &#34;release notch&#34;, then pulled out.
B0027ZZRF4|4|While these worked great on my fianc&eacute;'s Audi Q5 and greatly improved the stopping power, I was a little disappointed that there was no new hardware included for pads that cost upwards of $60. Even the cheap pads at least give you new hardware. I would still recommend the pads, just make sure you clean all the gunk off the old hardware before installing these.
B00N2E3YC2|5|Prefect  fit I like thanks
B00GPJPC1C|5|Delivery was lightning fast, installed them today they look really bright and much whiter than the stock bulbs.
B0083H5EPI|5|good product worked great
B001EOYIKE|5|Super easy to install. Would recommend that you also order a M10-1.25 threading tap to clean out the threads of the fastening points in the vehicle frame. After four years of corrosion threads had to be cleaned out with a tap.  In less than one hour installation was complete and this is without any help. Unit is well built and well worth the money.
B00UNRUCTE|4|Quality top for the price.
B007UHPSCG|5|Looks good, price is reasonable and fast shipping. Highly recommended buy from this seller!  :)
B001CHG19O|1|I purchased this jet thermostat eight months ago…...  my SRT 8  just started overheating last week, and found out that the thermostat was not opening.  I boiled water on the stove and verified that it was not opening…….  that could be a very expensive lesson to learn, do not buy this piece of garbage!!!  Stick with the oem replacement
B00I9PUM0Q|5|Great item and fast shipping....will order again😎
B00NWODRLK|5|Bought this for our Eurovan. The steering wheel is a larger diameter than most other cars and this worked great. It makes it a lot easier to steer.
B003C6AQYY|1|It feel apart as soon as I started to apply it. I've put stickers on windows and never had one break as fast and easy as this one.
B000C11JSE|4|GOOD
B000C7TWH8|4|Was what was ordered. Did't say it would be compatible with my car but it was.
B000FUNZF2|5|VERY GOOD.
B0010DXYH2|5|This is a great product as I can feel the car gain power after the change.. Of course it's a FRAM
B00G0ONNJU|5|excellent item
B00UGHS3G0|5|Works like s*** that's why we keep replacing them but then the car only cost $60K  so I guess we can't expect perfection.
B000BQQWKA|4|works very well and simple compared to trying to attach the end elbow to the treaded coupler then screwing that into the dump. Wish I would have got one years ago.
B006VJO61I|3|Product fine but not compatible with my jeep. Didn't know that until I tried to install it. That would have been nice to read in the instructions or on the website
B0067PUMXW|1|3 of them was crumbled so I couldn't use them,,,, so I throw them away
B000Q0JYWY|5|Great product that one must buy if needed.
B00C0YKJ6E|2|Overall it's OK for the money,although one of the front casters ball bearings came apart after 2 days of use.Haven't emptied the tank yet,we will see I guess. I give it a 2.5 out of 5.
B00068XCQU|5|Product works great.  Used it all winter while we were away on my truck.  Kept the battery perfect and did not have to worry about losing all my settings in the truck from a dead battery in the spring when we returned home.
B007JCSW20|3|These are well built jack pad adapters. I picked up four to place on jack stands with flat pads to work under the car (i.e. transmission fluid changes). They fit fine with the exception that they should be wider. They can roll easier than the jack pad adapters that reverse logic offers. With reverse logic they have four spring balls that hold the jack pad in place so they don't fall out. For this I rate these jack pads three stars. My perfective is from a safety stand point but over all the quality is very solid. I'll be adding additional thickness to the pad so it fits snug in the hard points.
B0002UEN1U|5|good stuff
B000NMDFNY|5|Excellent item
B0010GG7YG|5|Perfect OEM fit. Easy to install and worked flawlessly.
B00TI9OFKK|5|Love this car cover!  Fit is great!  Color is too!  Light weight and very easy to put on and remove.
B00WS3P37C|3|On the one hand, this nozzle is of a similar quality to any nozzle you'd find at any store in a similar price range. It boasts many features, is durable, and is versatile for many different uses. I was disappointed by the water pressure coming out of the hose in jet setting.<br /><br />The real problem is it began leaking out of the rotatable face days after I bought it, during its second use. This reduces the pressure of the water flowing through the nozzle.
B008VQMW9M|2|says its for a 2500 diesel....not even close.
B00A1XLSQG|5|As described. Thanks.
B00ODCT4W6|5|It was exactly what I ordered and is working perfect.  It also came on time.  Thanks.
B000BQWQ0A|5|works good.
B00VGHYQOC|5|It came just as advertised. It came with instructions and was very easy to apply. Looks amazing
B008G1ZWJE|4|They look and work great, best purchase I've made for the car recently.
B001JT5OGG|2|It started to come apart at the seam very early on.
B00PV37ZEA|5|This thing is great, highly recommended.  The one I had before this did not stay open or closed and was too small.
B00KDO336Q|3|Overpriced piece of plastic. Didn't seat well into clips. Not impressed.
B0081H79OY|4|Did not come with all the bushings
B007SDK2KU|1|Garbage, doesn't hold headlight firm impossible to get a good aim on your headlights and is definitely made cheep. Buy nice or buy twice folks!
B00KX35HTS|1|Piece of junk burnt up in a month
B00ESBOL3E|2|After reading reviews I hesitated ordering this light but decided to take my gamble and ordered it. After receiving it I followed advice and caulked around the glass to seal it up and keep moisture out. Sadly after 2 months and only 1 good rain storm it has moisture behind the glass, 1 blown bulb and about 1/4 of the middle of the light flickering off and on I have a feeling I'll be ordering a new one soon. Unless you want it for the looks I would look else where and spend the extra cash. It was awesome while it lasted!
B00394ZF0O|5|These are great in the car. They keep the seat health from cutting into my neck.
B00873J0YY|4|2 Pair's yes 2 Pair's for what most wanted for one. The wife and kayak and have 10' novice kayaks and I hook the kayaks up in a few minutes great price. the assemble was easy simple minor gripes the bolts just a tad too long but in no means endanger your roof. mine when i received them I swear were used or assembled before see pic's but overall great value
B00BKTQV1M|1|Scam they intentionally post a different picture to confuse the consumer
B00BUH0ZUM|5|Arrived just fine.  No problems at all.  Thanks.
B00COOS4ZS|2|After two days the right headlight stopped coming on, also the light pattern on ground was streaky. Box it arrived in looked like it was abused
B00G710Q6E|5|Good
B00RPOOOOW|5|Works great! Wires coloring was off, but still love it!
B0002SA3UW|5|Fit well, I have had no problems.
B0021R5HEE|5|Running my train horns on it.  Works perfectly.
B008LPKV28|5|My new go to Interior Quick Detailer
B009TB9UPW|5|Was exactly what we wanted.
B001AV7SFS|5|I have had these for several months and overall very satisfied with the product. Exactly like the BMW dealer ones you can purchase for $30-40/each. Easy to install, and so far are snug as a bug.
B00CC18LDS|5|Good price
B001L9KI56|2|I only rate it two stars because it is advertised as a universal fit, but does NOT fit a throttle with ridged grips very well. It will not turn in and out of the way if you are not using it. It is hard to drive with because it gets in your way and makes the throttle too hard to grip with gloves on. I am returning mine. This is not to say it would not be a great product for other bikes, just not my Honda Silverwing. Thanks
B00XPL88NC|5|Much better than I was expecting for the price.  I love that it holds the measurement until I release it.  You can tell it is very well made.
B0050VFAOK|5|I used this to plug in an item while on a road trip and it did exactly as promised. There was a high pitched buzzing noise but it wasn't noticeable once the music was on. It was a little bit of an awkward fit and had to try one or two outlets before I could get a tight fit.
B008G43IQK|5|Fit like a charm
B00TP8FVK2|5|Great product, Great experience with the seller. The product os very bright and easy to install. Each light came with 10ft extension cord and i was able to complete install with everything that was supplied. I bought other lighting kits form OPT7 and they work using the same remote and keep all the lights on the same color or mode. Highly recommend the product.
B00G8UI4NQ|5|Awesome sticker i think everyone should put on there car
B00INCIVV2|5|These were exactly what I needed. Easy to install and easy to adjust, perfect!
B0030HLWQG|1|Cheap.  Car charger broke within two weeks.
B0001EFSTI|5|I bought two of these at an Office Max from one of their holiday clearance piles ($2 each if I remember correctly) when I was a teenager. I gave one to my dad and kept the other for myself.<br /><br />Now, around 15 years later, it's still on my keychain (I have no idea what my dad did with his), and it's pretty much in the same condition as the day I bought it. It still has a very sharp blade, and it still locks tight onto my keyring. I don't use it that often, but it's great to always have it there when you need it.<br /><br />You do have to be a bit careful when it's open so that you don't cut yourself with the knife, but...it's a knife. Be careful.<br /><br />I also really like that it can lock open at 90­° to give you extra leverage for the screwdrivers, or it locks open at 180° for using the knife or bottle opener (which I forgot it had until now).
B00FS4S2U8|5|Very nice
B00TQ58XZ4|5|Really cute, inexpensive, and arrived in a timely manner. What more could a person want? Great item!
B004L7J9ZU|5|I have not given it the time test but so far I really like this item and it seems to work great. Does help with the heat and it is easy to store and fold up. It is well designed as it fit my model perfectly. I have the Limited EcoBoost and it worked great.
B005PZMKZI|1|Terrible
B005N53AMC|5|Excelente producto
B008W1NNDU|5|These fit perfectly in my 2015 Patriot for half of the price of the ones i bought that didn't cover half the carpets.
B0049VXV9S|5|Works great for my Victory Vision! Thank you!
B000C59SUG|5|fits good
B00JVQEI3E|5|Worked fine, please note product doesn't come with screws or tape, both had to be purchased separate. I had to cut the back off the vent because the one I replace was a flush vent and I didn't want to cut the hole larger. The back of the vent has an insert attached.
B00EXUJIUQ|5|great product look good on my car!
B0008G5ENY|5|Meets our needs. Shipped Quickly.
B00NHX6TGG|5|A+
B00762JLXC|5|Love it
B005JCY7RG|5|Exactly what I was wanting:)
B008SEM724|4|I was able to compare these to the lights I pulled off.  The quality is exactly the same.  They do come with bulbs installed.  I rated 4 stars cause one of the bulbs didn't work when I pulled it out the package (appears maybe a filaments might have broke free from shipping),  but I was able to use a bulb from the old light.  All I all, it was a great purchase and easy to install.
B004QEKGAA|5|Great for our golf cart.  Can tow everything we own.
B000KKLLFS|5|Works fine.  Good price
B00LOZ9AQA|5|They came just as described! Perfect and small enough for my rims!
B0083KQNBO|4|We carry for emergency.
B00C5RDQK2|5|Excellent seller and great product
B00NTCBN1G|5|Thank you!!
B004RZMCCI|5|Nice and bright!
B00MDLAT82|5|Very pleased
B009CNYJG2|1|Quit working after 3 months.
B003INQ8QQ|1|One of the mugs shorted out while plugged into the power outlet in the car and the plug in melted in the receptical in the cup handle.  When we tried to pull it out, the recptical came out of the cup,  The other cup has worked like it is suppose to.
B00QV4IB1E|3|Comfy
B00T1QGBBG|5|ok
B0051D3MP6|5|I have a motorcycle and hate missing ride time. This keeps it fully charged when I am away for a while.
B00RGZQKJM|4|Needed better instructions
B00852684M|2|Well not too much bright this light
B009AGGMC0|5|works great!!!!
B00A66GYDA|5|Perfect. It works as advertised and the code book is helpful.
B00N9T5WD4|5|Really works great.
B00NJ9MZH0|5|Installed the bulbs, much brighter than the originals and cooler burning. Also product fits and connects well. Plug and play.
B003Z9RFLK|5|this Cover CAN indeed survive the elements: desert 120 degrees to rocky mountain -20 with snow,  to Pacific Northwest rain;  8 months of use across three severe terrains with no issues what so ever.  Easy to install; Easy to flip over for access.  here are two tricks 1) fasten a bungy from the front inside of the truck bed to the rear inside of the truck bed and run it through the middle brace of the cover (which is metal)  (just gives a bit more security in high cross winds.  2) USE THE FOAM strip provided for the front and rear .  Between truck body and the cover. (does make it waterproof).
B008FRFC8U|4|It's a pretty good light for the money. The only complaints I have with it is that the magnetic base doesn't seem that strong.
B007CDYX7Y|5|Great
B006YZ8JLW|2|This product will not fit a Razor 1000 that has (4) seats.
B00JIEX722|3|LED's on the top of of the lamp flicker after being lit for a while. This happened on 2 of the 8 I bought. These lamps are used on my license plate lamps.  Otherwise they work great.
B00LGKMA3I|5|Ohhh my gosh, these are just too cute and too cool! Ive uploaded 2 pics to show what they look like in my truck. The mirror cover fits perfectly, its good and stretchy so it will fit any mirror I would say. Also the &#34;gear shift cover&#34; fit better on my signal bar as you can see in the pic and the &#34;emergency brake cover&#34; fit better on my gear shift. These are awesome. Love the pretty pink cover. My truck is in style now!
B000701HF0|5|Hard to say much about an anode, heck, it is an anode.  This fits and is the recommended model for my SW10DE.  I must be lucky with water sources and I can go as long as 4 years with only about a 50% deterioration rate.  When they do get to about 50% I replace the anode.  I keep two spares as you never know when you or a buddy or neighbor will need one.  There is no &#34;O-ring&#34; for these.  I use sealant paste or tape, depends on what I have in the tool box that is easy to get to.<br /><br />Just make sure you check your thread diameter.  Suburban heaters are 3/4&#34; and the Atwood's tend to be 1/2&#34;.
B000C5SGHC|5|Denso is always quality
B0033QNZZ0|5|This Euro approved antifreeze has a slight yellow tint, not as dark as the factory fluid which is now blue.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|This little device hardly takes up any room in your saddlebag, and can save a lot of frustration when you're putting your kickstand down in soft ground when you're stopping roadside, parking lot, campground, or wherever. The notch on top helps keep the kickstand from sliding off the plate. It's a little classier than the old piece of plywood I used to carry. I keep mine in a zip lock baggie in my saddlebag so it won't dirty anything up.
B00CD8H7VM|1|I received the helmet scratched and it was very cheaply made.
B009SDOGLE|5|Great buy for the money love it!
B005D5U6JW|5|💯
B00U075ARG|5|As expected
B00OM9RGQQ|5|This is the only brand of tire I will purchase. I buy these for my street trucks and hauling trucks and I get the mud terrains for my rock climber. You can't beat their performance in the rain and snow. These don't do super great in the red clay mud, where you would want the mud terrain pattern, but they do great in non-sticky mud and wet weather. They are quiet on the highway.
B00ZBGEEA0|3|It is overall a nice product but the color did not turn out the way I hoped because it was pink not purple as it says
B000CGINB0|5|Can't beat the price
B001LTVG3Y|5|Thank you. Very good.
B0060A7EL2|5|Love this product. Saved me so much money by only having to replace my cracked mirror on my Juke instead of replacing entire mirror mechanism. The mirror was exactly the right size. The adhesive is super sticky so be cautious when placing mirror on because you only get once to line it up right. Happy that it stocks well though because I know it won't just fall of randomly. I highly recommend this mirror. The quality is superb and the price is great!
B0041CBUYS|5|Nice Bright Orange, Mohawk stays standing. It is attached by using a large Velcro strip which is provided. It might leave a sticky residue or peal the helmet shell if taken off. However, just slapping on a different color Mohawk or even getting the Pony tails would be simple since the main strip would already be on the helmet. It definitely turns heads, brings smiles and countless thumbs up!!
B007TX0HS6|5|Super high quality. The same product that the tool trucks put their name on. These things rock
B0021JMU38|5|Nice
B000Z2CDU8|4|Haven't used it yet, but it seems to be well built and should last for years.
B00XB6HLG6|3|It is okay but not long enough for my Hyundai Sante Fe SUV.  I wish it had more length and width.  The clip holds very well.
B00537GKVI|4|Works great and easy to install.  I didn't do a very permanent install, but will in the future.
B001DRLPIK|4|Affordable price works perfect on my 530i
B00IXCQZ1K|5|Excellent.  Softer than anticipated.  Truck Arm Rest Felt as New
B004ZG8JL2|5|great product
B00JXOHHU0|5|Worked perfectly
B00JA2LX4Q|5|Super good quality my husband loves it for his '12 tundra. Looks great super sturdy love it. Comes with screw cap covers also.
B002LPFCBY|4|Just got my order today 08/13/15 delivered on time. Product is real nice. The only thing that bothered me was the quick disconnect on the line that goes to the gauge was hard to put together. Is there any replacement for it ?
B00EEKN6DA|4|So far everything is good with it.
B00IY2D1LQ|5|Classy can how is which is which
B002X8GCG8|5|Good quality and bright light. Little pricey however.
B000LVIN70|1|The product itself is actually decent. The fit was good and the quality of the product was actually good. The problem is in the REBATE that this company offers! They lure you in with the promise of a $10.00 rebate, and there are some very specific steps and procedures that you must follow in order to apply for the rebate......then, two weeks later, you get an email back from Lund saying that your rebate is &#34;not approved&#34;! No further explanation or reason given...You're just flat out of luck! It has ticked me off enough to write this review! It's unfortunate that Lund is not able to back up their rebate process with quality people who can actually satisfy a simple rebate. The end result is that I will NEVER again purchase a Lund product! AND I will tell anyone who will listen to stay away from Lund!! Shame on you, Lund!!
B00D42AFS8|5|Great Product.  Works well and makes dead batteries so much less painful.
B004VLB0SA|5|as described.
B00RUE3Y4I|5|Excellent light!  Great shipping, it was received earlier than estimated!  Easy to mount with just a few tools.
B002T3IIKK|5|Does the job
B0012Q9ZSO|5|good OEM spark plugs for my Yaris
B00THL7MMW|4|Is very nice to have on those long trips!
B0071N4Z0K|5|Perfect fit and replacement for my Chrysler Crossfire SRT6<br />Took care of the failing super charger inter-cooler pump.<br />Great to have my hot rod running great again what fun.
B00BAZBYTU|5|Good
B00026Z3F4|4|I've owned this jack now for 10 years, using it regularly for maintenance and repair of my own cars/trucks. It gets low enough to slip under every Honda/Nissan/Subaru I've owned, and jacks high enough to suit the majority of needs for a 1/2Ton pickup. This jack has never left me down (pun intended). After ten years though it is starting to show a little age. The jack will (over a period of 15-20minutes) drift down under load, but then again I've never checked the fluid level. The release has become hard to release if you're not careful, but I've learned to not tighten it as much before jacking and it's fine. The wheels are rusted and the paint is flaking, but I've never been overly careful with fluids (especially brake fluid) coming into contact. Very happy overall with this jack.<br /><br />My only big annoyance comes with the removable handle - when pulling the jack across the garage sometimes the handle becomes disengaged from the valve mechanism at the jack body, requiring some fiddling to get it back in. I've also since added a threaded bolt to keep the two halves of the handle securely together.<br /><br />To be honest I came to amazon to shop around for a new jack, but after reading reviews here and elsewhere, I decided to just invest a little time and effort and clean mine up. Tightened the casters after adding some fresh grease to bearings, oiled everything up, and it works like new now. Still need to top off the fluid but I suspect this will help with the drifting.
B003PI1BD4|3|It's okay, and it does the job, but it sure hangs down low.  However, they all do, except for the one that mounts behind the bumper cover.  That one is a great hitch, but it costs more and installation is way more involved.  This one took less than 30 minutes on a hoist.  Had no issues hauling my Harbor Freight trailer with my 250cc KTM on it.
B00WZWWTIM|5|I really love my bike's new look, thanks to vagabond.  It gave it more of a sporty look.  It was either this or the yoshimura I had in mind.  I'm happy I made this purchase and I highly recommend this.  It also came with an instruction, and a video tutorial that can be found  on youtube.  Easy step by step process, easy to follow steps.
B004OI7H7S|2|This did not shoot well
B00A3HNMIM|5|dope
B002AQN8UG|5|Excellent Plugs - I previously bout the MotorCraft and they were terrible,  This are Great Dropped right in no issues 2007 Mustang GT.
B001T9GFCS|5|Great price anf perfect fit!
B007VYHRX6|5|I compared these side by side to the Felpro valve cover gaskets.  They both had the same dual raised edge rubber design, but the Felpro had a much thicker metal core sandwiched between rubber sealing surfaces. This is no way means that the Felpro are better or seal better.  The opposite could be true.  Only time will tell if one is better than the other.  They are both quality made gaskets.
B000XY6VZ6|5|fit well and good quality
B0134NP3YC|5|I bought this for my FZ6R. It fits perfectly. Can be slightly difficult to install depending on which configuration you desire, but that doesn't really matter because it looks amazing! I highly recommend this eliminator kit.
B00M135HH0|1|One coil went bad and the seller did not reply on how vto file  a claim to have the bad coil replaced.
B009FUF6DM|5|you would be a fool not to purchase this pack of cleaning cloths more than once. each pack does come with cloths of quality and affordability, but don't you think having more cloths is fun-ner?
B0051SD35K|5|Fantastic.
B00HZSLCIY|5|The mirrors work perfect. They are much better than OEM. Have pulled my trailer with them twice and they give me an excellent view down the sides. I especially like the smaller fish eye lens on the bottom for checking down low when backing up. No vibrations over rough roads. Easy to install in about 45 minutes using the utube video. Highly recommend.
B003MRHAYM|1|Came apart in a week. I used Gorilla Glue and a clamp, fixed.
B00Q34E0T4|5|fits perfectly on my 2005 Kia Sportage.  takes a bit of patience to work it on, but, that's how it's meant to fit.
B001449I5E|5|Works great and was very easy to install.
B000ALIRSQ|5|Love this!!! easy to install.. just pop right in
B0019IQ40W|5|This was an exact fit for my 2001 Jeep Cherokee. I was very satisfied with this product. It came well packaged (thanks, Amazon!) and installed very easily. Additional O-rings and quick connect springs were included in case you didn't have a new set handy for attachment to the condenser end. I would definitely buy again.
B00H7DTMK2|5|Great Battery arived charged ready to go. Its a perfict fit for the Harbor Freight 8750 Generator. The seller should promote this battery to the thoudsnds of H.B.8750 customers  that are having a almost imoossib'le time finding this battery.
B0009T6EA2|5|Highest Quality with a cheap price.
B00G0KRHKK|5|I will order again this works reel good.
B0068OBVN2|5|Great filter for a lot less money than what BMW charges.
B00MQAFXK4|5|Excellent product! Fast service and arrived exactly as described. It is beautiful, shiny chrome.
B000CISMDM|4|Was a little hesitant after reading one review which said he felt that the mirrors &#34;made his truck look cheap&#34;.... I don't know what he was talking about, as from what I can tell, they completely mimic the original mirrors. (except they were shiny-new). The fold in design works smoothly, which is important to me since this is the reason I was in the market for replacements to begin with... (they didn't fold in when my teenage nephew ran into it)... So, this time around, I'll remember to work them in and out occasionally, and lube them as needed! So, the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star rating, is two small things... one is I do agree with one review which said the screws and bolts could be higher quality, if I need to remove them in the future, I'd rather they not be rusted in-place. I also preferred the &#34;torx&#34; (star-shaped) screw heads Ford used, to the Phillips-head screws provided as someone walking around is much more likely to be carrying a Phillips-head driver than a torx-head driver. (Re-use original hardware, problem solved!) Two: The mirror adjustment moves a little too easily for my taste, as with most old trucks, you usually have to slam the doors, shifting the alignment. I believe that mother nature will take care of that one, as some road grit, etc make their way into the moving parts, they'll stiffen naturally. I'm sure the hardware issue is an attempt to keep the price down, so I understand, and was a non-issue as my original were still in good shape. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase, and would recommend them to a friend!
B005PZMLDY|1|They don't stay in place, after a few weeks I took them off from them aggravating me!
B0022ZZ26S|5|Very very good stuff.  I used it to seal up a BMW engine that I rebuilt, despite BMW's recommendation to not use any sealant.  I don't believe they have much room to talk given how bad their engines usually leak oil.  After the rebuild it didn't leak a drop for the year afterwards that I owned the car.<br /><br />Tip:  Clean the surfaces very well with acetone or something similiar.  Then apply a very THIN coat.  You can use a small paint brush to spread a nice even coat.  You do not want to slather it on... It should pretty much be as thin as you can get it.<br /><br />I also recommend letting the area sit a few days prior to use if possible.  This is not the fastest drying stuff, but that was the least of my concerns.
B002OUZK7W|5|Delivered on time, great product !
B00BIA2P9A|5|Nice towels, chemical guys offer top end product
B00A8MZ7IA|4|Short nap on one side and long nap on the other, nice finishing around the edges too.
B00WZWIWLK|5|Very nice product fits nice and snug!!! The mats for floor are beautiful!! Finally and all in one solution!
B000EFP68C|2|Cheap these are not submersible if you drop these in water you will blow the bulbs if hooked up, if you drop them in the water without them hooked up they will rust up on the inside fast. I had to water proof mine filling the holes up with silicone along with all the edges of the lense. If you need boat trailer lights do not buy these. If you need just regular cheap trailer lights these will work fine. Hoping to at the very least get the rest of the fishing season out of them but i have my doubts.
B012LRYO10|5|Great quality, the anodized aluminum is much better than the cheap plastic ones I had. These fit my e92 great and hold the car securely. I use two so I can lift either the front or the back at the same time.
B000CPI5ZK|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B000WMQ5JG|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B002WBF8XY|5|Arrived on time. Product as described
B00SVWEWSU|5|The low price had me not expecting much, but it turned out to be a super nice piece. Looks like the rest of the carbon fiber the bike came with from the factory.
B00B2QTAJS|5|So easy to install, even when lying on a creeper with the car on jack stands. Once the bolts were loosened, the old starter just fell out. The new one went in just as easily. It appears to be just as high quality as the genuine Mazda part, but for about 1/3 the cost.
B00G70YQ4I|5|Does this product fit a 2005 v6 perfectly?
B007AOQWEC|4|They fit well in my 2015 Honda CR-V except for the driver's side mat. The driver's side mat does not adhear to the area closest to the driver's side door perfectly, there's a little bit of plastic buckling going on there. Otherwise, the floor mats fit well and are perfect for the price!
B004K9GJG6|5|Bought one of these for Up-North (Michigan) winter driving. Replaced a highly-advertised plastic frame and cover combined that cost me about $30, as I recall. (This unit lasted about three years, then discolored badly and wouldn't clean up.) This new clear plexiglass cover (made in USA) fit nicely inside a frame I bought separately, and seems to protect the plate nicely. It seems very thin, but very strong. Looks excellent in the summer, but who knows how it will last in the winter. Good price, but not free shipping. Prompt delivery; well packaged. Liked it so much I bought another for a second car. Make sure you check the number of holes to which you attach your plate before you order so you can get the correct cover.
B001KR4CQU|5|Easy to install! Perfect fit!
B00387DX0G|5|fits good
B0064C60P2|1|Only received one
B00EC2CKW8|5|Worked just fine for moving
B003YMPQYQ|5|top
B009DJWMFA|5|Good deal
B000K0WQIO|5|Worked great
B008DWRMBM|3|It's thin
B000CMJ1XI|3|Had to modify it because the horn switch wasn't touching my Grant 832 Steering wheel as the cover touched the spokes first.
B003554TB8|5|Tied in place it withstood 80+ speeds
B00B6QF0U2|5|Great paint and fit
B006TXDCA2|5|Exactly what I wanted.
B00RSHZLTI|5|Absolutely love it! It looks great and it's holding up well in the Florida sun. Might buy another for a back up.
B000UVDNQM|5|Good product
B007OSL3DY|5|Works great. Can't even tell it's there.
B00JDPS852|5|Awesome sound.  Not too loud and provide a deep, deep sound.
B00TF8G110|3|Nice:)
B001O7PNNM|3|Two rain showers a few weeks after application and already starting to wear.
B001IWLL4I|5|Work perfectly for 2005 Land Rover Range Rover HSE. Easy install!
B000BYNGLU|2|Fan motor made some noise like it was out of round or balance so I returned it for my money back.  Otherwise it worked and looked nice.  If it were not for a bedroom application I would probably have kept it.
B00P05CJ54|3|It's not a bad wire harness for the cost. I did however have one of the spade terminals just pull right off so I decided to go ahead and soldier all the wire terminals and heat shrink them. Other than that it works great!!
B00E6A4ZYW|5|Perfect lil sticker
B00TDPY1BC|3|Not very bright. Would not recommend for brake lights.
B007JZ1YYU|5|Awesome product
B004TR8M3W|5|worjs very well. Can't feel the trailer. Easy on and off.  Works great.<br />In response to the &#34;groaning&#34; noises it makes, it's a friction equalizer hitch, that noise is friction.  Be thankful it's working.  Once the powder oat rubs it gets better.  I recommend the lube that equal-I-zer sells to help.
B00PSQGHF8|5|Works great for camp stove fuel
B007XX8EBE|1|It was too short , it like hides under my car... I have a 2005 Honda Civic..
B0030CC2XI|5|For the price ...the best ones out there
B003VGOBZ0|5|I hit a deer and fortunately, the only damage was to my passenger side headlight.  Not worth turning in to insurance for the price of this replacement!  My car is a 2005 and the drivers side factory headlight had a little condensation in it and the lens was a little cloudy as would be expected for its age, so I decided to replace both lights.  Super easy replacement for a non-mechanically inclined female. If you have ever changed a headlight bulb, this is even easier in my opinion. Unplugged the old ones  and plugged the new ones in.  Both sides complete within 15 minutes.  These new lights make the car look great. Waiting to see if they develop moisture problems as some have reported, but for now 5 stars.  Delivered on time and well-packaged.
B0081S97Q6|5|Yes it was exactly what we wanted and it was in perfect shape.  Thanks
B00BYNJ7HY|5|Just installed my rear shocks on my 2004 chev. pickup 4 wheel drive. They went on easy and they are great
B008AGKTES|5|good helmet thats held up well! we got the plain one so that we could have it proffessionaly pin stripped. its slick looking now! perfict for an enduro bike!
B00T9LR2BQ|3|Was not impressed with it. The rain didn't run off like it does with the glass rain-x.
B000BGJWA2|4|makes my 13 year old popup seem newer.
B00A2DX0Y8|5|This cover is exactly what we needed.  It fits perfectly over our 16' toy hauler and is fairly simple to put on and take off.  No more worries about the AZ sun taking its toll on our trailer.
B00ORP122E|5|A friend of mine had bought this for me because I was forever needing a good quality jump starter, but I couldn't exactly find one with a good following or rating. I was shocked at first because this one had many good rating and the company over has a very trust worthy appearance as well.<br />This handy device is so useful for me that even after having it for four months now, it still works as if it was just taken out of the package. It holds charge very well and it jumps my car so easily I can’t even believe it.<br />Every car or atv or vehicle of the sorts, should own this little thing as well because you never know when you’ll need it and it’s so portable that you probably wont even remember if its in your trunk (like I do most times!)
B0006IX87S|5|Thanks
B0031HZHJI|5|Quality made part and engine hold 40 psi at idle.
B0064A226K|5|best add on anyone could put on a motorcycle......highly recommended..<br />my second Healtech product (brake light modulator)  both are great........
B000FIXQXK|5|This has been perfect for keeping my Apple Watch adapters from coming loose.
B00N43I2TG|5|These worked well on my 2010 Genesis Coupe.
B007KPWKU6|5|Fit perfect works great
B00429NKWK|5|GOOD PRODUCT.
B0057FJZGI|4|It worked as stated and seems to run fairly quit.
B004NY1DHS|3|I have mixed feelings about these devices. On the one hand, they're easy to install and use, and do their fundamental job of holding the lap belt snug rather well. On the other hand, they way that all of the recent examples I've seen are built makes it impossible for the slide to work as intended.<br /><br />First of all, the notches in the slide don't engage the corresponding little bumps on the main body of the CG Lock. The the only thing holding it in place when in use is the pressure of the roller and friction of the belt. That's not such a big deal since it's going to get pulled in the right direction if you undergo a sudden deceleration and seems unlikely to come off in that situation.<br /><br />Second, even if the slide did click into position as it's meant to do, those notches and bumps are mispositioned. You're supposed to be able to disable the CG Lock by moving the slide to its upper position. If I position the slide to where it would be if its notches did engage, the gap between the slide and the roller is too narrow by half to let any seat belt that I've ever seen slide freely. In order to allow the latter, I have to move the slide up so far that it simply falls off.<br /><br />I was rather disappointed in the response that I got from the company when I pointed these flaws out to them: &#34;For some cars, the detents do not retain the CG-Lock in the &#34;OFF&#34; position.  For these cars, we recommend simply removing the slide to disable the CG-Lock.&#34; In fact, the detents don't engage ever—even when the device isn't installed in a car—so the first qualifier is inapt. Removing the slide completely isn't much of a workaround, either, since the CG Lock makes the seat belt tongue top-heavy, causing it to flop around and catch on things when not in use. I received no further reply when I pointed all of this out to them.<br /><br />Bottom line: get it for the basic function, but be prepared to fuss with it when not in use. If you can find an old one that someone's not using any more, you might have better luck with the slide.t someone's not using any more, you might have better luck with the slide.
B000CPZWXS|5|These were the best gaskets I've ever used. Heavy duty and super easy to install
B002QGVW3K|5|Just what I needed for my son's electric toy four wheeler!
B000GZMMQY|5|Great product
B00JRE38EA|2|One didn't work, I could accept that.  Then the diode on the tip of another bulb did not work, still somewhat acceptable.  Now the diode on the side of one bulb is flickering, and another bulb is completely flickering, checked connection, and swapping bulbs fixes the problem, so conclusion that poor QA makes these a gamble at best.
B002FZK8K0|5|Good stuff,  works as it was designed
B001NZFCRW|3|Following the instructions on the bottle I ended up with a fluid that was too thick and takes forever to stop dripping.  Make sure you measure carefully.
B001C4SKX2|5|Came in quick and works perfect on my 2007 Saturn Outlook XR. Slightly better gas mileage and a better push when passing cars. First thing I do when I or members of my family get new cars is throw out the paper filters and put in K&N filters.
B002P8UQWW|4|Great price and good quality, especially for the price. I only have two small complaints. I wish they made the plate attachment locations the exact same as the original factory mirrors. We have a silver accord and I was able to remove  He silver plate that clips on to the original mirror, thinking I could put it on this new one. No such luck. I'm going to have to sand down and cut the clips off the silver face plate and glue it directly on, otherwise my drive side will be black face plate (which comes with this mirror) and my passenger side will be silver. Oh well, not a major problem. The other slight problem is like others have mentioned with the mirror vibrating at high (freeway) speeds. Since I'm driving around with no faceplate on the mirror, I'm not sure if that is the cause or not.
B00HZH66ZY|2|Main reason I paid more for this model was the option to engage lockers on Rubicon in 4 high, problem is that they don't tell you is it has to stay plugged in and then you must wait several minutes for the unit to go through all of it's programming checks first. Not worth the extra money,  buy the cheaper model at less than half the price.
B001KQ9L94|3|Purchased from Nikki Auto Parts, Received in a plastic bag, that had the number 79600 Made in Taiwan Exact photo as the one popflash had posted. It is slightly thicker, the outter trim/frame sticks out 1 mm or so in the top center when mounted down.. Not sure if it is actual Dorman product or knock off. I did not test if the hinge part if it was metal or not, but i did notice what I assume are weld marks at the bend. The handle it self is metal and slightly heavy, will take some getting use to when lifting the door, as it feels slightly heavier.<br /><br />The car is rarely used, so hopefully it will last years. Will post again  if it breaks.
B000CL92SS|5|great product
B0017UBHQS|5|I have to admit this is a fantastic cost for 100 of these push retainers. I had to replace some of those cardboard air deflectors on my truck that had been weathered over the years. When I took the old ones out, I knew that I could not use those again. So I went on line and found this exact same push retainer costing $5 a piece from the manufacture, but that was not what I was looking for only the size of the push retainer so that I could search Amazon and I found these for under $8 for all 100 pieces. I use Amazon's garage and have two vehicles listed. I find the part name from online sites and then search on Amazon and I find what I was looking for much less than from the manufacture. Now I have plenty. These fit Ford, GM and Crysler vehicle. I have a Ford and a Chevy. Bonanza for sure. These are the most common size for almost every external retaining push pins.
B0017OVD7M|4|Good product
B00EPA7BXU|1|LOW QUALITY, did not work.
B00D1418KI|4|I like this!  I knew my passenger tires were a bit on the low side but I constantly forget to stop and get air, even though it is free at our WaWa convenience stores.  It never seems convenient and or I'm not dressed for the chore.<br />I tossed this in the car and was able to go out on my lunch break and use this to inflate the tires so they no longer look low on air.  I know the air is supposed to be at a certain pressure but I can tell these are not over inflated and a inspection next month I will have them properly done but it was nice to be able to do this on my own time frame without having to be inconvenienced when rushing around.<br />I was actually looking at a Black and Decker inflator but with a coupon I couldn't beat this price.  I don't think the housing is nearly as slick looking as the bigger home brands but I'm not buying it to look cute, I just need it to work.
B00K3XVMC4|1|A complete waste of money worked for a day before it took a s*** DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS
B00LX0C98M|5|I received them 2 day's ago. I was impressed by there quality. I bought them to add to my emergency road kit which contains a 12v air compressor, a 12v impact wrench, a 12v trouble light, and a tire repair kit. Now I am ready. I like the clamp design. If I am ever faced with cold weather I will be clad for the gloves provided with the cables. ( A nice touch ) The tooth brush type wire brush was a great idea. I am so glad to buy from a seller that does business the old fashioned way, where they through in a goody just to sweeten the deal. I would buy again  and recommend Cartman.
B000PWTIYW|5|Original Denso product. Also comes with a tube of anti-seize. Good quality, fixed the check engine warning in my car.
B000S34NG6|2|got this to replace a bad one. Now months later finally got it ready to use and it doesn't. Something wrong ni the switching valves but too late to return. m fault for taking time theirs for sending a bad part.
B00HMZFEDO|4|Decent set of rivets, wish they were more clearly labeled... but you can easily figure out what you need. Worked just fine on my 2012 Kawasaki Z1000 headlight assembly.
B000QS2XQK|4|solid scale. have used it yet put it is weighing accurately.
B004750WJI|5|I love it
B001AV1WQY|5|I'm a guy with a pretty regular sized face ... long hair, full facial hair ... these look great, and work on my bike.  I got the Rose lenses ... love the view through these!  It's all good.  Arrived in 3-days, too.
B00G0P0ER8|5|Mine was badly damaged due to weather,this part I got, was a perfect fit,pull the old one out and put this in.
B0060BELNA|4|good color match  easy to aply
B00E0IY306|5|I first bought this and wasn't sure if this would be good to install on the exterior of my car or not. When the product arrived, I measured out the dimensions I needed and placed it around the fog lights and grill of my car. It's been about a year since I have installed it, and I have now removed the product due to color fading away.<br /><br />The adhesive of this trim is very sticky and surprisingly held up longer than I thought it would. This strip never lost contact with where it had been placed, and the only problem that I have had with it is the color fading away. I will buy another strip soon and install it again.<br /><br />When I had this installed, many people asked if my car had came with the trim. If you take the time to properly and patiently install the trim, it will make your car stand out.
B000VBAAMG|5|Fits my 2013 Chevy crew cab Silverado perfect!
B001O0U05K|3|Heads up!<br /><br />If you own a 2010 Honda Accord EX, these pads WILL NOT fit.
B00T9AGBOQ|5|Used it for the first time today. Worked flawlessly, and I my coworkers all want one.
B006B24KNY|5|Works great and use your imagination for it to look good<br /><br />Installed mine on a st1300. If you're not as skilled or handy buy the clutch/break reservoir version. It took me a while because I had to take my bike apart to put it right where I wanted it
B00943V7S8|5|It was great! Excellent fit!
B0056PKCZW|5|Sweet sticker for the price. Applies well, and seems like it will withstand the weather no problem
B00DD0YH8K|5|Really nice appearance. I used it on the front of the van.
B001RZ2FIC|5|Best heated grips ever. They are larger around making it easier to grip easing fatigue as I ride. Mine are attached to a roller troller controller so I can dial them in just right. I will buy these again when I get another motorcycle.<br />Take their advice and order their epoxy directly from them. It makes a difference and they guarantee that it is fresh. Nothing worse than getting into a job and having your epoxy old and unusable requiring a trip to a store or having to order and wait.
B00OI0RRSQ|5|Works great!
B00D42AFS8|5|I am very satisfied with the purchase!
B005H53HWQ|5|perfect and fast
B0034ZYE5U|5|Easy hook up.  Hope I don't have to use it.  But it's there if I need it.
B006590ADM|1|I have had BT Jr.for quite some time. It started acting strangely in that it began blinking green & then went to Red. It had never done this before & it makes me apprehensive to use it.<br /><br />I hope I'm not posting in the wrong place, but can't find an answer anywhere.
B0017OAKXA|5|Used to upgrade trailer brake lights. Yes they do seem to be brighter than the bulbs they replaced. They also seem much hotter than the bulbs they replaced. A little worried if they may melt the light covers.
B00Y5I8TTW|5|Sure, I'll be the first to comment:<br /><br />I was advised by my personal mechanic to get some CAT tap to tape of some of the exhaust holes I had.  After an extensive online search, this was all I found online.  When I handed it to my mechanic he said that he never saw this before.  He told me that CAT tape is only about 3 dollars at an auto shop.  But he was impressed with this product saying that this seems to be much better than the CAT tape he knew of.  He put it on my car.  I had 2 places that needed to be wrapped.  One place the entire exhaust was separated from each other close to the catalytic converter.  And to my surprise, it works like a charm.  My car was shaking before this, but is no longer shaking--and I never could figure out what was causing my car to shake.  My car is very quiet now too.<br /><br />I was questioning it at first because there is no adhesive for it, just the ties.  I'm not sure because I didn't ask, but I think the ties are used to temporarily/permanently hold it in place, but when the exhaust gets hot that it fuses onto it.  I'm just guessing that is how it works.  All I know is that it works.  It was much cheaper than replacing the entire exhaust system.
B006ONRIJ8|5|Great. product and seller!!
B00UY374ES|5|Great rack, works for my 600 watts of salor planels on my van. Fast shipping
B009IHGUXC|4|As described
B0096725GA|4|Good
B00D1418KI|5|Perfect little tire pump. I keep it in my trunk where it easily fits, it's about the size of a large thermos. It's not super fast but it gets the job done. Come out for work one morning to find you have a flat tire and you'll be glad you have this. I highly recommend everyone have one of these in their trunk.
B0058J4MF2|5|These are very bright at night and I have never had any problems in the three months I've had them in!
B00192QB3I|5|a1
B008SEBQ2G|1|it works but not well.  reception is poor.  not worth it
B008D8LZAA|3|Wasn't worth the money really. Bulky, kind of heavy. Will just be an extra helmet.
B009VOQ05U|5|These are great ladder racks. Much better than I expected for the price.
B005ER5ONW|5|Great pants for great price.high quality stitching and zippers ,love the zip off feature , can ride shorts on hot days.
B00FFAUT24|1|The flap flew out first trip.  Cheap plastic junk. Not tested.  Not approved.
B00LMM8UK2|5|Perfect!
B000C2WEY6|3|Dose the job but fits to tightly. Broke after 6 months.
B00OZ19JU2|5|Originally it was my husbands second choice, the other was $100 more. He is so happy with the weight, size, sound, and look he told me to give it the best review possible! The product was perfect, he thinks it is better than the first choice and happy I talked him into this one plus shipping was very quick and the item was safely packaged! Thanks for making his first anniversary gift perfect!
B00UMCQI6G|2|This item is not &#34;Genuine OEM.&#34; Ordered this to replace another Hemi badge I bought off amazon. Ended up being the same emblem with the addition of the 392. It is injection molded which the OEM emblem is not (I have a 392 Challenger so this is how I know). This will be the 3rd Hemi emblem I've purchased because the black injection molding has just fallen off. However I purchased this one under the assumption it was the OEM emblem. So beware, it is not.
B002W15BVS|5|Seems good. Suds last incredible long time. I washed my boat with it, got 1/2 way came back out hour or so later<br />and the bucket was still full of sudes. Price per ounce i think works out the same as the larger cheap bottles of shampoo<br />because i use less of this.
B0062IJYUG|4|For the price I got what I ordered.  This is applied to the vehicle using two sided tape material.  I hope it stays on at the car wash.  I would have preferred a bolt on product.  So, I plan to purchase a industrial glue to ensure it stays affixed to my truck.  With that easy fix it was worth the money.
B008DREON6|5|I bought this because my rear view mirror in my car doesn't have that convenient little strap to put pens in. The pockets are great, especially the little mesh on in the front, it has become the home of my coffee cards.
B00144BF9Q|5|Just what I needed.
B0009IQXXG|4|Works ok.
B002ZS4QCS|5|I am very satisfied with the purchase!
B000EPYP6Q|5|OEM as are Hitachi.Didn't put them on because I have 1/2 the original rear pad. Haynes said to change both front & rear.Eh Eh! why would<br />you waste $$ throwing out a perfectly good pad? Not me. I expect it will be like having drums on the rear.You change the front 3 time for one<br />change of the drums. It depends on your braking. I pump slow & easy 90% of the time. Saves brakes.
B000WJYMMQ|4|Not a bad fit and does a good job and looks nice
