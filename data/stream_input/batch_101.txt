B00000DMJF|4.0|The White Album was a revelation for me. Before its release, I thought that the Beatles were one entity, one musical force, one distinctive sound. With each song, all I heard was the Beatles sound: it was like a huge wave  coming directly from the speakers. I never stopped to consider exactly  \\"who\\" was singing, mush less \\"who\\" composed each song. The White Album made  me realize that the Beatles were four separate and unique people with  different styles and visions. For the first time I heard the solo efforts  of John, Paul, George and Ringo. John is an angry rebellious teenaged  rocker, Paul is one of the finest melody writers in popular music, George  is on a musical transcendental trip of innerpeace, and Ringo is the world's  luckiest drummer. The possibility that each was capable of writing and  performing their own songs was an eye opener.<br />Although the White Album  signaled the end of the Beatles, it was not a precursor to the \\"end of  rock'n'roll.\\" John, Paul, George and Ringo, no longer blood brothers  handcuffed together, later went on to pursue their own goals. The White  Album is both joyful and disheartening. Happy because it's time for each  member to leave the comfort and security of the Beatles, and go the road  alone. And bittersweet because the exalted Beatles' sound, that  awe-inspiring aural wave, had to end at sometime. Whoever said that \\"the  whole is greater than the sum of the parts\\" must have been thinking about  the Beatles. They must have owned a copy of the White Album.
B00003CWL5|5.0|I'll try to keep this short.  This film is a satire, so on some levels it's exagerated to highlight certian characterics.  However, the exageration is not as great as most of suburban american would like to  believe, and that's the best part of this movie.  If your an only child, or  any teenager who lives in the suburbs you will relate to something in this  movie.  Parents may write this off as a gross exageration, but it's not.   If everyone gave into their impluses something like this would happen,  because all those feelings lie just beneath the surface.  The mesage that  you have to realize at the end of the movie is that IN THE END NOBODY  REALLY CARED.  It's kind of like The Great Gastby.
6305014140|4.0|&quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; has some of the best action around.  It is very graphic, almost over the top.  It can be a bit confusing at times, and it could have been longer in exposing the 8 devils of their homeland.  But for  edge-of-your seat action, it doesn't get much better than this.  And by the  way, stay away from &quot;Ninja Resurrection.&quot;  It's nothing like this  one.

0446605409|4.0|Plum Island is a good, quick summer read! It's fast-paced and intriguing. Nelson DeMille provides a historical background of Long Island that will really grab history buffs. The story is somewhat predictable, but gripping.  You can feel the terror and fear building throughout the novel that  climaxes with a scene right out of &quot;the Perfect Storm&quot;.
0060245867|4.0|So, after hearing what a great read-aloud this book is, I decided to get it for my two youngest children. They certainly enjoyed the fun little story and the sweet illustrations. But from the first reading, its  conclusion bothered me. You see, the logical progression dictates that if  you give the mouse milk, he's going to want... a straw! Not a cookie,  folks. I thought it was just me, but on the third or fourth read-aloud, the  kids began &quot;reading&quot; along, and when we neared the end, I read,  &quot;And chances are if he asks for a glass of milk,&quot; and they  shouted in unison, &quot;He'll probably ask you for a straw.&quot;<br />Look,  this isn't meant to sound curmudgeonly. While it's far from a classic, the  book is cute. I just wish it didn't toy with budding logical intellects.
B000021Y77|5.0|&quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is beyond description.  You just have to see it.  Very fast paced and exciting, but a great sense of character development for such a short movie.  This is one you will want to watch over and over  again.  Very well done, and the music is great.
0451160916|5.0|I read this 464 page book in FOUR DAYS!  This is a VERY fast paced, easy to read, in your face thriller.  The Shining is a cordial invitation into King's superbly terrifying imagination.  The plot: intriguing, the  characters: stellar,  the imagery: wasps, blood, the hotel, everything was  perfect.  Have You ever felt yourself shine?  Don't read this one at night,  unless you LIKE feeling &quot;zero at the bone&quot;.<br />My only critcisms  would be that the begining is somewhat slow, and WHAT was with the last  chapter?  It was out of the blue and wholly unnecessary.  Cut that chapter  out and the ending is perfect.
B00004T9UH|5.0|This album is so phat I can't even explain. His lyrics are so true.....a little funny but alwayz true. He may seem scary to peeps like funky lil' Britney Spears but ya know.....he's not so bad.....not so bad......(stan)  You gotta listen to that song too. It could touch your soul if you listen  hard enough. I rate this album and all the songs on it a 1000.....if they  had enough stars u'd get that in the beginning. Welp, listen up and u'll  see for urself what I'm talkin about.

6304493681|5.0|This is without a doubt the best feature film anime around.  All the action and suspense you come to expect in this genre.  The storyline is intriguing, to say the least.  You will not regret getting this movie,  watching it numerous times.
B000021XR5|4.0|I'm really glad Scott Weiland decided to get sober, because this albums is great.  After listening to this for almost a year, I have decided this album rocks harder than the previous album &quot;Tiny Music...&quot;  The  first 5 tracks hit you hard.  &quot;Down&quot; is a great intro to get you  pumped for the rest of the album.  And then there's the VERY catchy  &quot;Heaven &amp; Hot Rods&quot;.  And then there's the song  &quot;Atlanta&quot; were Weiland takes a sound very much like Jim Morrison.  And &quot;Sour Girl&quot; the very popular radio hit, which I think is  higly overplayed, for what it's worth (the next time I hear it, I'm gonna  shoot my radio).<br />Overall, after the 3 year wait, this album is a very  satisfying experience.
0380729407|5.0|Sometimes there seem to be two Ray Bradbury's. On the one hand, there's the writer of Twilight Zone-esque (before the TZ existed!) stories that are exciting or just plain creepy (The Illustrated Man, R Is For Rocket). On  the other hand, there's Bradbury the stylist, who can write page after page  of poetry in prose form (Dandelion Wine). Not everybody likes both.<br />But  in this novel the two Bradbury's meet. His love for boyhood, the beauty of  a small town, the love of a father are all captured in gorgeous writing  wrapped around a truly creepy tale. The Wonder Years meets Dracula? There's  really nothing else like this work: it can stand up right beside To Kill a  Mockingbird and a Tales From the Crypt collection.<br />Oh, and whatever you  do, don't watch the movie version.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Well, I don't understand why some people don't like this CD. So what if it's well-produced? I agree with the previous critic, is Abbey Road the worst Beatles album if well-produced means bad? This is the opposite of  selling out, if he just tried to keep up his success by making another  Either/Or or XO, then that would be selling out, but he remains innovative  and makes great music. I've loved Elliott's music for some time now, and I  don't see anything wrong with the way this album turned out. I'd recommend  it to anyone, whether they're a fan of his previous work or not. This is a  beautiful album, and every song on it has a life of its own. Buy it, you  won't regret it.
0446605409|3.0|I just read Plum Island this past weekend and it was my first Nelson DeMille novel.   The story is told through the eyes of the main protagonist John Corey, an NYPD cop convalescing from gun shot wounds at his uncle's  East End house.  He's rude, crude and obnoxious, but he grows on you.  At  times I found myself laughing out loud at his thoughts about the other  characters.  Some reviewers have complained that the Ted Nash character  disappears halfway through the story, but he does lurk in the background  and perhaps DeMille is setting him up to be Corey's nemesis or rival in a  future novel.  I imagine that Beth Penrose would appear in any future books  containing the Corey character.<br />As a Long Islander who has visited the  North Fork, I found it interesting to see places I have seen with my own  eyes used as the setting for a novel, apart from Plum Island itself of  course.<br />As for the story itself, it held my interest, though I knew 1/3rd  of the way through what exactly was being smuggled off the island.  The  high speed boat chase in the middle of a hurricane had Hollywood written  all over it.  I also did not find the romance with Emma Whitestone to be  credible, though I suppose it had to be included because it is part of the  formula for these kinds of stories.  <br />All in all, I found Plum Island to  be a good read. It is certainly not a literary classic, but it does make  for an entertaining diversion and it has instilled in me a desire to see  the North Fork again.
1573225517|5.0|If you are a single 20 or 30-something male, this book is a must read.  The protagonist, Rob, is unabashedly YOU, with all of your fears of commitment and intimacy, all of the mind games you play with yourself and  your significant others, all the fantasies about women's underwear, dating  a supermodel, etc...  Men--who among you has not made a compilation tape  for an object of your desire in lieu of actually TELLING him/her how you  feel?  Fortunately, despite his many faults, Rob accomplishes what none of  us can--gaining perspective on all of his past relationship failures (it IS  fiction, after all).  How does he do it?  Read this book and maybe you can  get a clue.  I can't speak for myself yet...<br />And you ladies that are  dating these pathetic losers (among whom I include myself), you should read  this to understand us a little better.<br />Top 5 reasons to read this book:  1) If you don't, your girlfriend/object of lust will 2) Too late, she  already HAS read it 3) You'll laugh at all of the top 5 lists, especially  as you start conjuring your own to compare to Rob's.... 4) This book is  FUNNY 5) So funny, it's worth TWO places on the top 5 list...

0201485672|5.0|One can read good books on a specific technology (COM, UML etc) or on specific programming languages or even on different approaches to software  development (RUP, OPEN etc) but every now and then a true classic comes  along. Like Design Patterns 4 years ago now refactoring comes along. Every  serious OO developer should own both of these books. Get your hands on  Refactoring if only to read chapter 3, which summarises all the 'bad  smells' that may creep into code. 21 generic examples of what is bad  programming and why. The remainder of the book describes numerous  techniques (refactorings) for changing existing code in order to remove the  'smell'. Most refactorings are accompanied with some UML, which should be  enough to get the idea, and they are then further described in Java. What  makes this great a book is that it can be used as a reference very easily  since its design was well thought out for this purpose with a comprehensive  index and tables matching smells and respective refactorings. If any of  this rings a bell to CODE COMPLETE readers it should cause the ideas are  very similar but very much updated here. Fowler's writing style makes once  again for easy, pleasant reading. Unreservedly recommended.
0393307050|5.0|Having grown up with Horatio Hornblower, Teddy Roosvelt's classic &quot;Naval History of the War of 1812,&quot; and Fletcher pratt's &quot;Empire and the Sea,&quot; among others, I don't impress easily.  I am  impressed by this book, and have three more in the series awaiting my  reading pleasure.  What helps to make the book so enjoyable, above and  beyond a snapping good story, is the superb detail and authenticity of the  telling.  Mr. O'Brien, recently deceased, is a master of his genre, the  period, and of the writer's craft.  The story draws you in; the prose is so  vivid, that there are passages that leave you unaware of your surroundings  as you drink them in.  The turns of fortune, set against the backdrop of  the Napoleonic Wars, nener let the reader guess at the conclusion, even  though the history is well-known.   The principal charachers, Jack Aubrey,  Dr. Stephen Maturin, and Lt. Dillon, are well-sketched, and quirky in ways  that make them seem authentic to their time.  Their speech, and even the  turns of phrase used by the author in telling the tale have an 18th-century  sound to them. The language is reminicent of Gibbon in terms of the  seriousness of the tone of speech. After reading this book, two things are  formost in my mind:  is the rest of the series up to this level, and why,  if they are, didn't he ever get the Nobel Prize? -Lloyd A. Conway

B000005J56|5.0|My niece, of the &quot;younger-hip generation&quot; gave me this CD as a birthday present.  The  electrifying energizing rhythms of &quot;Candela&quot; and the smooth mellow lush romantic serenade  of  &quot;Dos Gardenias&quot; quickly became my favorites.  This is a very  special recording of lyrical beauty that transcends all boundaries.  Such  is the power and scope of the talented performers presenting and preserving  this art-form.  A very special gift.
0440219078|3.0|I read &quot;The Giver&quot; with my class in English lessons. The book handels about a young boy who lives in a community in which no color and no feelings exist. Although this was my first English book, Ive ever read, Ive had some difficulties at the beginning, but in the end, Ive  understood almost everything. A big complimente to the author for her open  ending. So everybody can imagine his or her own ending and Jonaslife in  future. Thats the very interesting thing of the book.
0451169514|5.0|I read this book when I was 12, and I was captivated by it. This truly is the greatest book I have ever read. Even though I am only 14 years old, I read more than almost anyone I know. Yet, through all my reading, this is  the book that I still call my favorite. <br />The best book that I have ever  read. <br />It truly was simply amazing. My first impression of the book was,  &quot;Why is it so long?&quot; But after I finished the book, I started to  wonder why it wasn't longer, and how could anyone write a book of  &quot;It&quot;'s stature within less pages. Now I am not afraid of long  books as I was back in my elementary school days, but now I am going into  high school strongly despising abridged books. And this book was what  caused all that. <br />If you read this book, it will change you, just as it  changed me.

B00000J2KY|3.0|It must be this movie's depection of the title character rather than the Nabokov version that the press drew on when they nicknamed Amy Fisher &quot;the Long Island Lolita&quot;. Sue Lyon co-starred with Liz Taylor and  Richard Burton in a later film, and movie mag articles of the time  mentioned her shamelessly flirting with Burton in front of Taylor. It is  this personna which Lyon brings to the title character rather than the  object of a dirty old man's obsession that Nabokov gave us. Meanwhile,  thoughout the picture, in all non-dialogue scenes, there's this insipid  music on the soundtrack, whose only lyrics I quoted above. Was there a  soundtrack album with this movie? Do I care?
B000002H97|5.0|This is the difinitive Metallica album.<br />It was the first CD I ever bought and will always be one of my favourites.<br />All the songs on this album are classics and can never be overplayed or ruined.They are the true  beginnings of hard rock and Metallica remain the master's when it comes to  bringing the house down.<br />Enter Sandman is probably still their most well  known song but the band showed it's virtuoso talent when it composed  Nothing Else Matters and  Wherever I May Roam.My personal favourite is  still the remarkable, My Friend Of Misery.<br />Combined with rich lyrics are  rich riffs and a hearty helping of power drumming, which were the prime  reasons for this band being catapulted to the top and staying there for  decades.<br />If ever there was an album which you have to have in your  collection,this would be it. Without it it would simply be,  incomplete.<br />kadu81@hotmail.com
0783241399|3.0|Denzel Washington turns in another powerful and intense performance as Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter.  He is so easy to empathize with, no matter what role he is in.  He serves this role aptly as well.<br /><br />  However, I wish he would chose his material better.  This screenplay needed  reworking before it was made into a film.  I'm sure that the life of Rubin  Carter is compelling and needed little embellishment.  But the  embellishment and dramatization that was done, was done poorly.  The role  of Sargeant Della Pesca put a real damper on this movie for me.  His  motives for persecuting Rubin Carter are not explained in a believeable  way.  The whole villainy of this one man, as opposed to, for example, a  pervasive racism of the local police force, just didn't wash.  And we don't  learn enough about Rubin Carter before he was imprisoned, except for his  boxing.  The events leading to Rubin Carter's wrongful imprisonment are  just not developed enough.<br /><br /> But the movie is worth seeing for Denzel  Washington's performance and his relationship with the teenager Lesra  Martin.  That is where The Hurricane really shines.<br /><br />  I loved Denzel  Washington in Malcolm X, Mo' Better Blues, Much Ado About Nothing, and  Glory.  I'd love to see him reteam with Spike Lee.  He's a better  screenwriter.

6305165912|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters, and had a hard time dragging anyone to go see it. I thought it was hilarious and full of great gags (barricading the door, Jesus licking the ball, the &quot;message&quot; written down on  the pad of paper, etc.), and definitely a worthy viewing.<br />However, a  couple of years later I found that a lot of these people who wouldn't watch  it in the theater had taken to repeat viewings on it on DVD. So, in a hazy  room, I watched it, and was amazed at how well it still worked, although  the humor now came more from the characters (and actors), and not from the  plot or the gags. I was also amazed at how good the movie looked,  especially in the bowling alley. The glossiness of the floors and balls  really shows up well in the DVD.<br />I think time will be kind to this film,  and people will realize that it isn't a &quot;minor Coen brothers  film&quot;. Although the plot isn't as tight as some of their other movies,  they are continuing to progress with characters and dialogue. Repeated  viewings will show that this comedy is up there with Dr. Strangelove (well,  not quite), but definitely up there with Back to the Future and  Ghostbusters.
B000002TQV|4.0|One of the better songs on this album is the first one, \\"Planet Telex.\\" It begins with a cold electronic wind sweeping in, then an ominous and vibrating piano. \\"Planet  Telex\\" turns out to be sterile but heavily layered, mysterious, melodic and depressing, with hopeless lyrics like \\"Everything is  broken\\" at the chorus. Though \\"Telex\\" may not dish  out inspiration by the bucket load, it does make for thoughtful, reflective music. Welcome to Radiohead's world; welcome to the \\"The Bends.\\"<br /><br />The more welcoming title track somewhat offsets the icy opener, sounding nearly classic rock and less robotic, giving these guys some needed humanity. The two released singles, \\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Fake Plastic  Trees\\" begin the cycle of hard and soft songs throughout the album. \\"Bones,\\" a high-energy tune, gets things moving again in a big way. Listen for Thom Yorke knocking out the high notes at the chorus and the grinding riff that rocks out with a vengeance. \\"Bones,\\" along with  \\"Planet Telex,\\" are practically worth the price of admission. But there's much more on \\"The Bends,\\" of course. \\"My Iron Lung\\" floats by on a high-pitched guitar lick that sounds half sick and anemic compared to the rip-roaring portion of the song that later kicks in. In a slicker style than Nirvana, Radiohead are adept at begininning their songs in a quiet and lulling fashion, only to tear things apart later on. Back in the early 1990s, you could call Radiohead an electronic Nirvana or aspiring Smashing Pumpkins.<br /><br />The last several songs are worth mentioning, due to their subtle, melodious sounds. \\"Bullet Proof\\" is a slow song with delicate, behind-the-scenes guitars. \\"Black Star\\" follows, fading in with guitars of the same variety, but picking up sonically in a big way; it turns out to be one of the highlights of the entire album. Luckily, Radiohead refuse to rest on their laurels as the album winds down. \\"Sulk\\" keeps up the work of the great chiming guitars, nearly like bells ringing to announce the finality of the record. \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\" ends \\"The Bends\\" on a predictably sour, strange note, with those same tickling guitars.<br /><br />Though \\"The Bends\\" is major-label music created for the masses, Thom Yorke's high-pitched voice may not please everybody. Indisputably, however, the music is ultra-catchy and enjoyable, if not downtrodden in parts, especially lyrically. Overall, this is just a great album that rocks out at times, slows down at precisely the right moments, and places the distortion in all the apt places. It's only a little puzzling why some of the more dynamic tunes on this record weren't released as singles. \\"The Bends\\" is both easy on the ears -- due to all the hooks in every song -- and a little difficult, due to the somber aura that infiltrates the tunes. Still, Radiohead put a lot of effort into this CD, finding a way to hold listeners rapt the whole way through.e the finality of the record. \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\" ends \\"The Bends\\" on a predictably sour, strange note, with those same tickling guitars.

B0000025T6|5.0|This is probably his darkest album. this one or 'Ghost of Tom Joad'. It really marks the beginning of his storysongs. On this album The Boss gives you a great compilation of songs about people's sad fates. I suppose most  of us know Atlantic City. That song is the type of songs featured on this  album. Dark and poor recorded. Atlantic City is actually said to have been  recorded in Bruce's bedroom using an old fourtrack. But that's all part of  what makes this album so magnificent. The human touch. As with all  Springsteen records, this one touches your heart, again because it's so  real. In my opinion it ranks right up there with 'Born in the USA' and  'Darkness on the edge of town'.
B000000OUW|5.0|This cd is worth buying just for tracks 1 'Return of the Warlord' and 3 'The Gods made Heavy Metal'.I'm 33 years old and when i hear either of theese 2 songs i start banging my head,i haven't done that since i was a  teenager.Don't get me wrong the whole cd is freakin' awesome. I haven't  listened to Manowar in 10 years.But a few weeks ago i heard a track off  'Battle Hymns' on an 80's radio show i listen to every Saturday night,and i  realized i still like them as much as i used too,so i came to amazon and  bought their entire catalog on cd,inclding 'Louder than Hell' which i never  heard before,but bought it anyway and it was worth it.In my opinion this is  their best cd.Get it.You won't even miss Ross the Boss.
B000002LBH|4.0|&quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; is a great introduction to the The Smiths.  It contains songs from the early years to some of the last songs Morrissey and Marr recorded together plus everything in between.  If you buy this Cd  and dislike it then you will most likely not like any other releases.  I  own all The Smiths realeases and would recommend starting here.  Some of my  favorites are:  &quot;Oscillate Wildly&quot; (which is one of the best  instrumentals I've ever heard), &quot;These Things Take Time&quot;,  &quot;This Night Has Opened My Eyes&quot; among others.  Some of the tracks  are not as strong as others but that mainly because this CD is a b-sides  and rarites CD not a normal album with singles.  Nonetheless if you like  what you hear I suggest moving on to either &quot;Queen...&quot; or  &quot;The Smiths&quot;.  By all means end your collection with  &quot;Strangeways,.....&quot;.
6305807086|5.0|Being John Malkovich is a masterpiece. Not only is it the definite best movie I have ever watched over and over, but it is also just a twisted piece of film. Spike Jonze was already my favorite music video director,  and now he is my favorite director, period. He is inventive, strange,  scary, and he makes you think. Malkovich tells a very twisted story. It's  about a puppeteer (John Cusack) who can never get payed because people  don't understand his shows. His pet freak wife (Cameron Diaz) lives with  him and supports him. He begins looking for work elsewhere eventually. He  looks in the newspaper and finds a filing job on the 7 1/2th floor of a  skyscraper downtown. There he meets his beautiful office-mate (Catherine  Keener) and his adventures begin. He finds a secret door leading to a  tunnel into John Malkovich's (John Malkovich) brain and devises a plan to  sell tickets to visit his world. Although there are various sub plots and  sub meanings, the basic point of this film is the fact that we are afraid  to be ourselves so we will do anything we can to be someone else. It's  about moving on with life and falling down when it falls down. The DVD is  great, the film is amazing, and it is a must see for everyone into odd  films. Spike Jonze is a genius.
B000002GXS|4.0|I bought this CD after hearing &quot;Please Call Me Baby&quot; in the movie &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot; (the one with Ed Norton and Ben Stiller).  I didn't know it was a Tom Waits tune; but my friend with whom I  was with did, and he told me: &quot;You've got to get you some Tom  Waits.&quot;  He had just returned from a study-abroad sojourn to Italy,  and I guess they're just crazy for Tom Waits over there.<br />Anyway, I picked  this album up after another friend recommended it to me.  That was about a  month ago.  Now I have five Tom Waits albums.  As you've probably discerned  from other reviews, Waits has (arguably) two or three different periods,  ranging from accessible blues/jazz-based barroom tales and beatnik-like  poetry to his heavily percussive, fragmented &quot;avant-garde&quot; phase.   An interesting project would be to trace what has remained the same in his  music throughout his career--because to be honest, if you put on a record  like &quot;Heart of Saturday Night&quot; and then listen to something like  &quot;Bone Machine&quot; or &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, you'll be  hard-pressed to spot any ostensible likenesses (which is why I think it'd  be interesting to dig into the music and see if there are any likenesses in  such disparate music).<br />Anyway, I'm getting long-winded here.  If you've  yet to purchase a Tom Waits album, I think this'd be a good start; it  encapsulates his world view--as expressed through his music, at  least--quite succinctly.  It's very sweet music, without being saccharine.   Plus the level of musicianship is very high for a &quot;pop&quot; album--as  it is on all of his albums.  I also dig the inclusion of horns on some  tracks--something I don't think he's really pursued on other albums.   Anyway, buy this album and you won't be disappointed.  Then go and get  &quot;Heartattack and Vine&quot; or &quot;Small Change&quot;--that should  prime you for his &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; and &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;  phase.  Happy listening!
B00004S6GL|5.0|I've been a huge Elliot Smith fan for quite some time now, and I really don't see how he could be getting worse now that everyone is paying attention to him. In fact I believe he is getting better. He still has that  Beatle-esque, desperate tone in his voice, that makes you really pay  attention to his angst. He is still an incredible musician, who deserves  the recognition he is getting. Figure 8 is definitely a step in a new  direction, but he is no happier than he was before. Still depressed, the  &quot;other&quot; E makes another stab at getting someone to help. Not  exactly lo-fi anymore, Elliot plays indie that easily could fit in a smokey  bar, as he is the man in the corner with his head in his hands. I think the  top songs written on this effort are Son of Sam, Stupidity Tries, and  Everything Means Nothing To Me. 2000 has been a great year for producing  great indie records, it's just that the critics hate them. Don't let this  discourage you, Elliot Smith is one of the greatest artists on the scene.  Also, try to catch him live. He is amazing on stage as well as in the  studio.
0783240503|5.0|In my opinion, this has to be the perfect cast ever assembled for JOSEPH...DREAMCOAT. Donny Osmond plays Joseph with charm and powerful vocals. Maria Friedman is the best I've seen for the narator part visually  and vocally; she brings much charisma and expression to the main role of  the narator. The rest of characters are all perfect visually and vocally as  well. My only gripe is that I feel this movie could have skipped the  annoying scenes of the children in the audience applauding after a few  scenes; it really throws off the flow of the movie and during the scene of  Joseph acussing the thief among the brothers...I found it annoyings as the  kids in the audience interacted in the story yelling &quot;STOP STOP  STOP&quot; &quot;WHO'S THE THIEF?&quot; etc. The kids choir is very good  vocally but leave them out visually.  Overall a very good musical to video  production. Highly recommended. I've watched it about 7 times already. I  love Maria Friedman's Narrator!
B000000HHE|5.0|Ah yes. New York, 1989. Beastie Boys, De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest, Run-DMC. This was possibly the best time for hip-hop music ever. The music had a vibe like no other, as well as keeping its roots and adding more funk  than any other style. Great times, good music. Fast forward ten years or  so. Rappers like Eminem, Dr. Dre, and Juvenille have young audiences  screaming their names on MTV every day. Millions of their records are sold.  The music has lost its edge, the funk and soul are gone, and instead,  childish little songs and backbeats appear frequently. Hip hop has  deteriorated and is now mainsteream. Sad, isn't it? De La Soul represent  everything that was good about hip hop. Keeping African rythmns, adding the  funk of Parliament, and rapping in a style that was (and is) easy to get  into. This was their breakthrough album. There is not a bad song on this  record, and I can easily get into it whenever I want to. This record makes  me wonder why people even like new hip hop. This is smarter and funnier  than anything Juvenille could ever come up with. I think my favorite tracks  on 3 Feet High And Rising are Change in Speak, The Magic Number, and A  Little Bit Of Soap. Quite possibly the greatest hip hop album ever made.
B000002AD0|5.0|Fans of early Santana will love this. It has great versions of Santana standards such as Jingo, Soul Sacrifice, Persuasion and Treat. It also has some rare tunes which I don't think are on other Santana albums such as  Fried Neckbones, Chunk A Funk and Conquistadore. The songs are mostly  lengthy jam-style tunes with plenty of improvisation. Freeway alone is 30  minutes long, but doesn't hardly seem like it. I only have a couple of  complaints about this release. Soul Sacrifice is awesome as always, but  actually has very little guitar soloing. Fortunately, Gregg Rolie's organ  soloing makes up for it. It's still not as good as the awe-inspiring  woodstock version. Second, the absence of Mike Shrieve, future Santana  drummer. The drummer from these performances isn't bad, but not as great as  Mike Shrieve. Petty complaints aside, this is a great CD which fans of  Santana's peak era ('69 to '72) will love. Anyone who likes jam band music  (early Allman Brothers, Phish) will enjoy this also.
6303823351|5.0|I'm an admitted fan of the Beatles, and I have not yet gotten tired of this movie!  Anyone interested in 60's music or culture should find something worthwhile here.  Anyone interested in subtle British humor  should find something worthwhile here!  I notice new jokes with each  viewing.  The soundtrack is amazing: &quot;I Need You&quot; is beautiful,  if perhaps more obscure than the unforgettable title track.  &quot;You've  Got To Hide Your Love Away&quot; is said to be Lennon's tribute to Dylan:  folky, melancholy, awesome.  Listen for the various background arrangements  of Beatles tunes in the &quot;oriental&quot; and elsewhere.  Lots here to  love!  Rent it a couple times and you'll begin to understand this classic's  lasting appeal.
B00000CQJZ|5.0|I had never seen this film until recently. I only knew Hitchcocks later classics and this one is as good as many of them. I love this film. It is fast paced, its got the atmosphere and more. A great classic  spy/mystery/suspense and more from the 30's.
6305263248|5.0|This film is one of my favorite thrillers. The picture and sound are excellent. The alternative ending is better and makes more sense. Although it has just a few seconds added to the original ending it makes a big  difference. The commentary is by the director is very good giving a lot of  interesting trivia on the actors and the filming. The 'stunning' 8-page  booklet isn't that stunning. Only 4 pages of text and not much more  information than the director gives in the commentary. An excellent DVD to  have in your collection especially if you like thrillers.
6305897786|2.0|Based on the previews for this movie I was fairly eager to see this movie in the theater.  I would like to tell you that this movie is definitely not for everyone.  It is not a horror movie.  It is not really suspenseful.  It  is not at all what I was hoping for.  Depp's character was interesting and  played well but I never really felt any connection with him.  I personally  did not like the movie and could not wait for it to be over.  Not only was  the story fairly cliche'd and weak but the ending gave no real sense of a  conclusion and left me wondering why what just happened actually happened.   People into odd, artsy movies that aren't based on good writing or  production will probably like it.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|A must have in any DVD collection. The extra features are very good. A 45 minute documentary gives very good and interesting information on the film. The commentary isn't too verbose and gives further recollections on the  making of the movie. 8 to 15 minute interviews with cast and crew give even  more personal recollections. The production notes were interesting which  consists of letters between various players on pre-production issues. Three  very well put together trailers are also included. I think trailers should  get awards too. Overall a must have in any Western DVD collection.
B0000028P8|5.0|This is a great CD, Mariah sound so amazing live, I hope she does another live album oneday.  <br />The highlights of this album where Emotions and Make It Happen.  This live version of Make It Happen is just one of the best  recordings ever.  Mariah sounds amazing on this CD.
0800177177|1.0|This is one of the worst movies ever to come out. It seems to like to jump around and do weirds stuff. One Minate Dracula is some old dude, the next he is some young stud picking up the ladies and then boom he's a wolf.  No  Primse or anything to this movie. I give it 0 stars out of 5.
6304474652|2.0|If the role of the 'gringo' portrayed by Matthew Perry is typical of the U.S. male, apologizes to U.S. female. This young actor seems as &quot;Forest Gum&quot; in all his scenes.  Even his mouth is open as a fool  every time someone speaks to him.  Nevertheless, Salma is fabulous as the  Mexican girl.  She acts naturally and with convincing dialogues. This could  be better with another young actor; even a beginner could make a good role.    This could be better with another young actor; even a beginner could make  a good role.  Some questions arrive.  How a mature girl can be so immature   (or immoral) to be pregnant with a guy she meets after hours.  Is this the  practice in Latin girls?  Where are the anticonceptives?  How does she  protect from HIV, STD, and other diseases?  This film is a bad example for  the youngsters.  I do not find it any positive in terms of culture clashes  it pretends to portrait neither.
B00003XB8K|5.0|This isn't just a CD. It's a journey. Most artists, when trying to convey a message in their music, just blatantly say it. But Enigma doesn't let you take the easy way out. Their use of symbolism is so surreal, it's creepy.  It's almost like you're playing a game, trying to solve a puzzle. And in a  way, you are. It's music for the thinking individual.
630575067X|3.0|Like as many detractor's of the film as fan's of it I antiscipated the cinematic release like everybody else. Problem is I did'nt expect the same as the previous trilogy to live up to expectation's but felt despite the wonderful although tell-tale CGI effect's there's still something to be said for more organic looking FX however these were on a grander-scale the story itself is fine but somewhat hollow even though it's setting it up for another trilogy the beginning it fall's rather flat all the same. Naturally previous character's Yoda the droid's and Palpatine are great welcoming re-addition's but something sorely lack's with the newly-seen one's like Qui Gon,Amidala and the like that seem devoid of any personality let alone real character although young Obi Wan Kenobi IS VERY GOOD though Ewan McGregor coul'dve been given more than what was presented. Production values were high but even the music score does'nt compare to the other's in the series. Enjoyable for light-weight entertainment but lack's nesscesary dramatic-pull power and involement. Liked the new addition characters Watto,Sebulba and Anakin's mum Shmi Skywalker but agree with most some reviewrs that the casting of Anakin as played by Jake Lyod was an error now forever committed to celluloid. Liam Neeson, Nat Portman were fine, Jar Jar Bink's may have irritated many other's except small kid's but I found him to be more vulnerable,sympathetic and human than the human cast.  Rented this a few times since release on video liked it a little more but just not-enough  until the terriffic DVD release recently.<br />If only the wait for the Hamill,Fisher,Ford trilogy weren't so far off in the DVD future.
B000002KAT|5.0|I have owned this album for 10 years now and I couldn't tell you how many times it has lifted my spirit. You cannot listen to songs on this album separately and understand or feel its beauty and complexity.  Because of  the way a thread moves from one song to another throughout the album it  makes the perfect album for gorgeous scenic drives. It just keeps you  moving down the road.  It could be dangerous though as your mind wanders  off to the images it conjures. Van exposes his soul here and invites you to  open yours. Once in a while the &quot;official&quot; reviews have it right.
0375501851|5.0|Oh, my!  What a stunning debut this is!  It's hard to believe this is the work of a 24 year old woman.  She has an amazing command of language and a highly developed sense of irony for one so young.<br />This is the story of  the Jones and Iqbal families.  Archie Jones, a working class Everyman, is  saved from suicide by a cranky butcher who objects to folks gassing  themselves in the restricted parking space in front of his store.  Fated to  live, Archie meets and marries the 19 year old, Clara, a beautiful,  toothless Jamaican who is running from her Jehovah's Witness mother.  Their  daughter is named Irie, which means &quot;no problem&quot; in Jamaican  patois.  The name is definitely not prophetic.<br />Archie's WWII war buddy,  Samad Iqbal, weds the  cranky, opinionated, and aggressive Alsana in an  arranged marriage.  This union produces the dashingly handsome twins,  Millat and Magid.<br />As the lives of these two multi-ethnic families  progress, Smith addresses weighty questions of race, religion, sex,  history, gene tinkering, and the immigrants' very real fear of loss of  cultural identity as their children are assimilated into the culture of  their adopted land.  In an ironic twist, the &quot;good&quot; son Samad  sends back to India to study his native Muslim religion becomes an atheist  and a truly annoying scientist, while the &quot;bad&quot; son remaining in  England becomes a militant Muslim, but no less annoying.<br />I felt that the  book dragged somewhat in the last hundred pages, as Smith seemed to become  obsessed with her characters' obsessions.  However, she did it with such  grace of phrase and love of language that it's a minor complaint.  This is  a densely plotted and populated novel that requires a commitment from the  reader.   I didn't really &quot;get&quot; the teeth metaphor that runs  through the entire book, however.  Still, I can't wait for her next novel.
0425152251|4.0|It was only after the first 100 or so pages that I got genuinely interested in Sophie's World. The basic subject matter plus the mass-market hype on the paperback cover got me through the first 100. It's not every  day you come across a best seller written by a Norwegian. I can almost hear  Garrison Keillor saying that on 'Prairie Home Companion'. And yet here was  a weighty novel that also claimed to be a history of philosophy.  Scholarship and artistry between the covers of one book-  an irresistable  package. <br />At first however what you notice is the scholarship. The novel  is quite sketchy to begin with. But I have always been fond of philosophy  and since it had been 25 years since my last college course I enjoyed  revisiting the Greek thinkers portrayed early on. As I read farther I began  to appreciate the author's efforts to show how closely aligned philosophy  and religion have been throughout most of Western history. Only in the last  hundred and fifty or so years have they gone their separate ways. <br />In the  end this book just skims the surface of philosophical thought but provides  a coherent, entertaining overview threaded through an engaging plot that  should make most young readers think twice about perspective and the art of  storytelling- just what exactly is going on in a story anyway? I would  recommend it to any high schooler or other person young at heart with a  curiosity about philosophical investigations.
0783240503|1.0|Where do I begin?..... I was VERY disappointed in this film. I thought that it would be something my kids and I could enjoy together. The women are dressing very badly, they look as if they don't have any clothes on at  all. Let's not leave talk about the sceen with Donny and Joan.
0790736926|4.0|I saw the video,and it made me sad that John Wayne helped create the myth of the savage Indian. We see Ethan Edwards transformed into a hard bitter man by the experiences he has been forced to endure, but the movie only  helps to deepen racial distrust between different peoples. The Inians are  always the bad guys, and the cowboys are always the good guys.  We do not  see what led Scar, the Indian leader, to become a killer. We only see the  results of his hatred. We see the burning houses and dead people. We see  the terror in the women's eyes when they see Indians. If we were to  substitute black people for the Indians and give John Wayne a white sheet  to put over his head. I doubt the movie would be legal.
0316777722|5.0|There are great stories in all his books and this is another collection  filled with great observations of human nature. I think poignant is a good  description... the ability to turn disappointment into humor. Sedaris is a  master of it.
B000002U82|5.0|Some CDs are a bunch of songs...this masterpiece must be heard in its entirety.  In my opinion, this is the best album ever recorded.  Year after year my appreciation for it grows.  I loved &quot;The Wall&quot; when I was  a kid, but I feel as though 'Dark Side' has grown up with me.
014028009X|4.0|This novel takes the similar structure with that of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. One more common thing between them, accordingly, is that the heroines, Elizabeth and Bridget are attractive, smart and witty.  Aprt from  rating this novel, I like Bridget. But one thing I cannot understand is  that the important thing the heroines in therit lives are pursuing doesn't  change though it is 19th and 21th century. Marriage and love ! In the times  of Jane Austen, the major issue in middle class may be marriage. love and  money. But major factors influencing on Bridget's life are just boyfriend,  lover, love and marriage in addition to friendship though individuals'  lives become complicated. The ending (?) was also happy union with Darcy.  Of course, I agree with many reviewers in the aspect that this novel  reflects the lives of many single working women.  But something is missing.  That is the passion and ambition of many working women in therit career.  One thing precious in lives is love, that's for sure. But rading this  novel, I feel a little sorry for Bridget.(though she is sometimes admarably  brave)  There are many things to search for and enjoy in lives.
B00000I2UE|5.0|If I could only own five CDs, this would definitely be one of them.  I've been listening to Darklands for fifteen years and still enjoy it frequently.  Your collection is imcomplete without it.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|This CD is Not worth the cash. I only liked 4 songs. DO NOT GET THIS CD!
B00000255F|5.0|Simply the greatest album ever made.  Each song is a masterpiece, and Born to Run and Thunder Road are rock classics.  As a fellow Jersey native, it is easy to see why Bruce is looked upon as a god w/in his own state.
B0000020C4|5.0|Ruthie played it perfectly, Michael was awesome.. he just have to change his facial reaction abit.. he seemed smiling even in the sad moment where Eponine died on his hands.. Judy was okay but i dont think she fits the  role..  and Lea stole the show.. its like everyone was waiting for her to  sing.. she has her own version of her Eponine which was an amazing one..  Eponine is just a short role but her role lingers more than the role of  Cosette.. Francese Rufelle was the original Eponine and everyone has an  ideology that shes the perfect Eponine but when you come to think of it..  Hugo describes Eponine as a harsh voice and that doesnt fit to Francese  either. Francese sounds too nasal..its hard to understand.. she sounds more  like &quot;alvin and the chipmunks&quot; but her acting is quite good. Lea  played it as a different Eponine, its another version which is  unforgetable. Lea re-invented the role of Eponine..   Get this CD its  really awesome.. just get used to the applauses..  and get the video too..
B00000JPH5|5.0|Thelabyrinth, is agreat movie filled whith everything you need to make agood moive like talented actors alot of imganation fun and humor and the labyrinth is jam packed and loaded whtih both and more.
B00003CXAR|5.0|Amazing.  This is considered to be the very first blockbuster ever made.  It is also considered to be one of the best.  After all this time, this movie still has the power to scare many people, and it works like a  charm.<br />Through Speilberg's genuis, as we watch this movie, the tension  builds up all the way to the heart pounding climax.  It was also very smart  not to show the shark until the 2nd half of the film because what scares us  most, is what we DON'T see.<br />This is a rare film that combines tense  action moments, with the art of good filmmaking.  It was also infuential,  it made people scared to go in the water for years after it was released.  25 years later, it's about to do that all over again.  Both the normal and  DTS DVDs are wonderfully packed with features.  Most Highly Reccomended.  This is a movie you need in your collection.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is one of the rawest CD's in my collection. I like more songs than I thought I would.  I play Slipknot every day because it rocks. They are the most aggressive band of the new millenium.
B0000029DD|5.0|What can I say? This cd is amazing, Jeff Buckley's songwriting is simple genius, it's haunting and beautiful, his lyrics just capture me in them.  I don't really know what else to say except BUY THIS CD!  It's for anyone  who appreciates great talent and great music, which is so hard to find  today amongst all the manufactured trash pumping on the radio 24hrs a day,  you won't regret it, if you do you are crazy!  You were amazing jeff, it's  so sad you're gone.
B000002ITM|2.0|I bought this album on tape and I didn't like it that much.  It's too slow and it just doesn't sound like Testament at all. The New Order is much better than this one. It's not worth buying on CD.
6305910103|5.0|&quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; is an excellent sequel to the adequate &quot;Motion Picture.&quot; Khan in my opinion is one of Trek's greatest villains; he's out for revenge on Kirk after a freak accident in  the system he was placed on rendered his world a barren wasteland. This is  one cool thing right here: He doesn't want galactic conquest, he doesn't  want another world to settle on (despite Joachim's suggestion that they use  the Reliant to settle on another world), he wants only revenge on Kirk.  He's more imbalanced than Matt Decker was in TOS's &quot;The Doomsday  Machine,&quot; IMHO.<br />As for the DVD. Sure it only has a theatrical  trailer as an extra feature, but the 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen re-master  is excellent, and it's been re-done; the colors are so much sharper. I even  compared it with the VHS pan-and-scan copy that I've watched for a long  time...BIG MAJOR IMPROVEMENT!  I never saw the movie fully on widescreen  until now. And the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track is excellent! <br />Two  words: BUY IT! <br />Okay two gripes - Chekov wasn't in &quot;Space  Seed&quot; although we can assume he WAS on the Enterprise in that  episode.<br />And of course the reactor room that looked a bit like a disco  floor.
B000002L5I|5.0|I still haven't heard &quot;Live On&quot; but KWS band is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I bought this album only about a week ago and I love it. Just like &quot;Ledbetter Heights&quot; there isn't one bad track on  the album. My overall favorite track is &quot;Blue On Black&quot;, its  perfect, its catchy, has great lyrics and an amazing guitar solo. Some of  my other favs are &quot;Slow Ride&quot; and the cover of &quot;I Don't Live  Today&quot;. I really like every song, no skipping over songs with this  album. Kennys guitar playing is amazing, but besides that I can't exactly  say what makes this album so good, just everything about it works. The new  singer, Noah Hunt has a great voice that works really well w/ this music  (Cory Sterling was really good too, but  Noah Hunt's better for this  album). If you like good music, any kind of music, I suggest this album.
0312853238|5.0|Quite simply my favorite book ever.
B00004TDTO|5.0|You wouldn't know that this film was 25 years by looking at it. Universal did an excellent job of restoring this film.  The picture is clear and bright. No scratches or other film artifacts.  Even the trailers were  polished up for this release.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Over the years I have experienced many bands in the hard rock and such genere. But nothing, has made me come back for more then this cd. It's amazing. From the beggining of (sic) to the second part of scissors, this  album is great. It's something that breaks away from this whole hard rock  genere creating this new wonderful sound. amazing, if you are into this  stuff, buy the cd.
0385495315|5.0|I had no idea of the significance cryptography/cryptanalysis has played in the history of the world, especially WWII.  I found the book to be a great learning experience.  I know why it's so easy to solve those Cryptoquotes  in the paper now.  I even grabbed pencil and paper and solved the first few  problems before I checked the web page and found they were already claimed  done.
0679746048|5.0|After Susanna Kaysen is sent to a mental hospital in 1968, at age 18, she  begins to &quot;vent.&quot; The entire book is her outlook on the hospital,  giving the reader an image of what the hospital is like. There sometimes  seems to be no real plot, that she is doing nothing but putting her  feelings onto paper, but that what makes it so beautiful... so poetic. She  vividly defines the group of odd characters, bringing then to life. <br />This  is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read.
0380973464|4.0|Though I found the outrageous number of typos distracting, and it seemed he was trying too hard to be humorous at times - the book as a whole was very good.  He obviously did his research in the areas of cryptology and  WWII; while he specifies that the story is completely made up, it remains  believable.  Didn't understand why he could name Microsoft, but had to  change Linux to Finux.  And by the way Neal - women don't have Adam's  Apples (page 490), just a normal sized larynx.
057120211X|5.0|If you've seen and liked the movie Girl, Interrupted then you will like  the screenplay. There are a good collection of pictures in the back, and in  the front an interview, which is quite interesting.<br />Set in 1968,  18-year-old Susanna Kaysen is sent to a mental hospital for &quot;having a  headache&quot; (she &quot;cured&quot; it with a bottle of asprin and a  bottle of vodka). She meets pathological liar Georgina, sociopath Lisa, and  many others.<br />Very good story.
B00000F5KH|5.0|Very few times does a movie get as deep as &quot;Central Station&quot; is able to get. From the very beginning you feel that it is going to grab you, and it's not hard to let the tears roll by at so many point throughout the  movie.<br />Fernanda Montenegro's performance is awesome, but we're  accostumed to her doing this. However, the kid is as natural as one can  get. It's hard not to feel for him what the woman in the movie felt...<br />Also, it should be noted that the photography was simply extraordinary!  Beautiful shots that are complemented with some great acting and equally  beautiful music, under a great direction.<br /> In short, a classic before  our eyes. You won't regret buying it!
B000021Y77|5.0|I am ashamed to admit that this is the first forgien film I have ever seen. As a Store Manager in a BLockbuster video, as well as a movie buff, I know thats hard to believe, but it's true. A co-worker suggested I watch  Run Lola Run, claiming it was the best film he'd ever seen. I didn't want  to see it because I figured I would be too busy reading the subtitles to  even notice the action. I was so wrong. This movie was fast paced and fun.  I didn't even notice the subtitles after a while. It put Sliding Doors to  shame. The lead, Lola (who was brilliantly cast) has 20 minutes to get her  boyfriend money he owes some notorious thug. The movie takes us through the  twists and turns of everyday life. It was a little artsy, but not to the  point that it will turn you off. You will find yourself rooting for Lola,  and feeling just about as breathless as she does. It is an incredable movie  and it will not let you down.
1878424319|5.0|A friend tore an article about this book out of Oprah Winfrey's magazine and sent it to me. <br />I purchased the book and read it the same night.  Then I re-read it.  I am still in the process of reading it once  again!<br />This is a practical book that can be adapted across many religious  and spiritual belief systems.  Although I may not agree that all of life is  a dream, as the author says is the Toltec way, I am more than ready to  apply the Four Agreements to my life.<br />Don Miguel Ruiz writes very simply  and beautifully about the Four Agreements, and what he writes about builds  upon itself and weaves together to create an ideal way of perceiving  ourselves, others, and the world at large.<br />Each of the Agreements is a  separate statement, yet they must all be considered together as one large  agreement. <br />What affected me most in this book is what Don Miguel Ruiz  wrote about not taking things personally. For years, I have been stung and  hurt by what people have said to me.  After reading this book, what has  stayed with me is that what people say about me is not WHO I AM.  It is  merely their opinion based on years of their own experiences and reactions.   I no longer base my perception of myself on others' opinions.  This has  stopped all the negative grudging I had against those I perceived were  against me.  <br />I recommend this book to anyone in any walk of life.  You  will view your world and yourself differently after reading it.  It does  not ask you to join an organization, change your religion, or become  something you aren't.  It will, however, change your way of thinking about  how you live your life.  You will realize the impact of your words,  thoughts, and deeds in a way you never have.<br />If the whole world chose to  live their lives this way, what a wonderfully enriching, nourishing place  it would be!  Improve your corner of the world and study the simply  profound wisdom shared within these pages.  If you're selfish, readit  anyway, change yourself through reading it-those around you will appreciate  it!
0783225970|1.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. An epic of organized crime genre.But with the quality of this dvd release I am very dissapointed. Wait for a single layer release. Vcr looks better than this. Sorry but don't  waste your money
0800187792|5.0|Carroll Ballard may not be a household name, but he has created some of the most magical children's films of the few 20 years.  His &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; was based on the beloved Walter Farley novel and was  considered one of the best films of the 1970s.  He followed that film with  &quot;Never Cry Wolf,&quot; one of the best live-action films ever to come  from the Disney Company.  &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is one of his latest  offerings, and as with his earlier films, it is a magical look at life and  nature through more innocent eyes.<br />The film stars Anna Paquin, the young  actress from &quot;The Piano&quot; and the current young superheroine from  &quot;X-Men,&quot; as a young girl whose mother dies in a car accident and  who goes to Canada to live with her estranged father, an eccentric  inventor.  At first, the young girl is angry and reserved and shuns even  her father, but she slowly begins to rediscover a love for life when she  adopts a small flock of orphan gooselings.  The movie follows her almost  maternal kinship with the gooselings and the warming trust she begins to  develop for her father and how they eventually teach the geese to migrate  (hence the title fly away home).<br />Anna Paquin is quite good in this film  and depicts a vulnerable side to her character.  She is certainly one of  the best actresses of her generation.  Jeff Daniels has an amusing turn as  a father who doesn't quite know how to deal with the new daughter in his  life.  Dana Delany (from TV's &quot;China Beach&quot;) also has a role as  Jeff Daniels' faithful girlfriend.  The overall film has a wonderful look  to it, and it was nominated for an oscar for best cinematography.  While  the film deals with some sad issues (death of a parent, the stages of  grief), it is nonetheless a truly enjoying film and one of the more  under-rated children's films from the 1990s.<br />In fact, it is a pity that  more films like &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; are not made.  Hollywoodtends to  produce so many tepid, painful-to-watch children's movies that the true  gems slip through our fingers.  If you liked &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;  or &quot;A Little Princess&quot; or &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; then you  will find much to like in this film.  All of these recent films are superb  family entertainment and were sadly overlooked.<br />I watched this film on  VHS and fell in love with it instantly.  I would have bought it on DVD  except for the absurd decision on the film company's part to make the DVD  pan-and-scan only.  Any film that was nominated for best cinematography  deserves a widescreen treatment on DVD. So, by all means, watch this movie!   But if you want it on DVD for your collection, wait until the film company  regains its senses and offers the widescreen format.
6305265488|5.0|I never made it to the movie theatre to see this movie so I bought it.  I just watched it last night and I thought it was very good.  This is the kind of movie that can lift you out of a bad mood in a hurry.
6305897786|4.0|Roman Polanski is a bit of a bizarre filmmaker who tends to make rather macabre and gloomy films.  His &quot;The Tenant&quot; and &quot;Repulsion&quot; illustrate this trait rather bluntly.  And so it is  with his latest offering, &quot;The Ninth Gate,&quot; as well.  The film  looks like a Roman Polanski film right from the very start, with its muted  hues, supernatural themes, and depressing atmosphere.  For some reason, all  of Polanski's films are quite depressing. Oh well.<br />Anyhow, the film  concerns an egocentric book mercenary (for lack of a better term), played  by Johnny Depp, who is hired by an avid and mysterious book collector  (Frank Langella) to authenticate his copy of a very rare and potentially  very powerful book.  The investigation takes Depp's detective all  throughout Europe, and we meet some quite eccentric characters along the  way who fit in perfectly with Polanski's style.  My personal favorites are  an amusing pair of twin book-keepers who shed some light on the book.   There is also a mysterious woman who seems to follow Depp's every steps.   What is her agenda?  Did Langella hire her to keep an eye on Depp?  What is  her interest in the book?  I won't tell - watch the film and find  out.<br />&quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; is rather deliberately paced.  Some TV  ads had depicted it to be a fast-paced, explosion packed, sexual romp.   This is the exact opposite of what the film really is.  The film really  takes its time developing mood and supernatural tone, and for the most  part, it succeeds.  If you're patient and allow the film to establish  itself, then you'll probably enjoy this film.  Unfortunately, most viewers,  jaded by MTV or Hollywood-style quick-editing, may find this movie too  boring and tedious.  That is a pity. Polanski belongs to an old school of  filmmaking, like the late Stanley Kubrick, wherein the craft of the  filmmaking process itself is more important than the number of blockbusting  special effects one can pack in.<br />I found this film to be quite intriguing  and gripping.  It falters a little at the conclusion by becoming perhaps a  little too over-the-top, but overall it is a fine work by a master  filmmaker.<br />As for the newly-released DVD, I have a few comments.  The  picture and sound are quite good, though not reference quality.  There is a  slight graininess to the picture, but that is deliberate and was also  evident on the actual theatrical release (just as in Kubrick's Eyes Wide  Shut, too).  The subwoofers stay quiet for the most part, but then this is  not a loud film (until the ending, anyways).  Polanski contributes a  commentary track, but I find him a little dry and difficult to understand;  I could have used subtitles with him, perhaps.  Unfortunately, there are  *no* subtitles on this DVD.  The disc contains the usual cast/production  notes info and a variety of trailer/teasers, a few of which are Easter Eggs  but nothing special.  There is a nice isolated soundtrack for the score,  though, which is rather eloquent and sets the proper mood for the film.   And there is a small storyboard section and a gallery of artwork from the  film, too.  Overall, it is a well produced DVD, though I would have liked a  few more extras on the DVD.  Still if you liked the film, you'll be happy  enough with this DVD.
B00003CWL6|2.0|An entirely adequate movie that raises a lot of hot subjects (male mid-life crises, pedophilia, voyeurism, homosexuality, murder, etc.) and  then dances rather coyly around them for two hours, and then tacks on a  nice and uplifting message about the need to see the beauty around us.   That way, the foks at the mall can feel good about having sat through a  movie featuring blackmail, murder, and (gasp) sex!!!<br />This film owes a bit  too much to other much darker films, specifically The Ice Storm and sex  lies and videotape and Lolita and Happiness and Blue Velvet.  That American  Beauty is more accessible and less interesting than these films should come  as no surprise, I suppose, considering the quite unwarranted success of the  film.  American Beauty is Independent Cinema Lite.  It takes no hard  stance, takes no chances whatsoever, at least none that have not been taken  several times before by other, far more challenging films.<br />The best thing  about American Beauty is the high quality of the acting, in particular a  splendid performance from Wes Bentley, who really should have been  Oscar-nominated.  If I see American Beauty again, it will be to watch his  work.
6301640659|5.0|Friedkin does a good job at setting up eerie urban settings and he made good use of it in this film. First off, this is a great police/detective movie that has you guessing and wondering the whole way through. Paul  Sorvino and Al Pacino hit it off great as the grizzled veteran Captain and  rookie policeman. Pacino is given the role of attracting this killer and  throughout the movie we are drawn into how his assignment is affecting him.  The brutal serial killings are shocking and prove that this type of crime  isn't just heterosexual. Real applause is deserved for this is real police  work portrayed here; trouble in the sub-communities/cultures of a big city.  I didn't feel this film mocked the gay lifestyle in any way. It merely  showed us a small segment of a group of people that don't have mainstream  tastes. This is a very graffic and powerful movie. It is not for the  squeemish or close-minded. It does delivers a stark and truthful look about  a part of life most of us know nothing about.
B00004RFCM|3.0|The sound quality on this DVD was lacking. My television has mono, and not stereo, sound, and so I get either left or right sound. Every other DVD I've played has balanced left and right sound, but when playing this one  the sound quality is terrible and very hard to hear. When played on a new  stereo system though, no problems! This is a warning for anyone with a mono  television that buys this particular DVD.
6300216543|5.0|Taken from the true story of the life of Frank Serpico, this important film stirred up controversy and showed us a side of police departments that they certainly don't want shown. Serpico plays the only honest cop who  doesn't take bribes and kickbacks. What is scary is the casual manner the  other cops in the film just view taking the graft is just part of the job  just like loading their guns. We also see a scary lesson of what happens  when one honest man takes on an entire bureaucracy that does not welcome  him and what can ultimately happen to him. How many other Serpico's are out  there past and present who never got to tell their story for one reason or  another. A powerful film that is just as relevant today as when it was  made.

B000002WUD|5.0|When people think of Elvis in the 70's, unfortunately they think a fat, pill addict.  But if you listen to this great box set, you will think &quot;excelent performer!&quot;  In the 70's, Elvis' voice became full, and  his songs became more intraspective.  Though he never wrote a song, Elvis  sang the songs like he had written them.  He stemed away from the rock  &amp; roll that he helped to create, and moved more to his country roots,  and also the folk songs (much like Dylan.) This box set is a power  exploration of his singles, albums highlights, and live shows.  Any true  Elvis fan would love this box set.
6301934229|5.0|This is probably Rutger Hauer's best known role - and *the* perfect example of how good an actor he is. His magnificent performance adds to the film's strange and surreal atmosphere and creates one of the most chilling  movie villains of all time. A mysterious modern Flying Dutchman, shadowy  and coming from nowhere, undead and cursed to roam not the sea but a desert  and kill over and over again, Rutger Hauer's &quot;John Ryder&quot; cannot  be liberated unless *he* himself is killed... and this is the favor that he  asks a young driver he meets to do. The movie is not standard,  down-to-earth thriller. It creates its own world and you can only  understand it when you watch it and have the Flying Dutchman's story in  mind. Only then will you see that what some people thought to be mistakes  and holes in the script are in fact deliberate and well-thought elements of  the plot. Watch the movie thinking of &quot;John Ryder&quot; as the Flying  Dutchman, and you will understand every comment he makes, every line he  says, and every action he takes. And, hopefully, you will appreciate the  genius of Rutger Hauer and director Bob Harmon.

6305736650|5.0|If you suspend your disbelief, Casablanca is truly one of the best films ever made.  It succeeds because the most improbable thing that the Bogart character could do was to give the letters of transit to the most beautiful  woman of all time and her husband the resistance singer.  It's simply out  of character, don't you agree?  And yet, for a moment at the end, we  believe it!  And this is a tribute to the way the movie was constructed  from the very opening shot.        But if you look at it in its context of  1943, the suspension of disbelief was in fact rather prevalant.  I'm  talking about the war movies.  The war movies of that era showed  unbelievable self-lessness: soldiers throwing themselves on hand grenades,  etc.  How could &quot;war&quot; motivate people to do such things?  Well,  people were swept by the patriotism of the time--and it was an extremely  justifiable patriotism, given the evil of Hitler.        So, what I'm  saying (and I don't know if it's been said before) is that Casablanca is,  preeminently, a war film.  It's a film about doing the right thing, not in  combat, but in an occupied territory, with nasty Nazis around.      What  was the opening shot?  Well, it was exactly the opening shot of a war  movie!  We saw Casablanca on a map.  So we are set up to think in terms of  a war movie.        Could the idea of Casablanca ever work in a non-war  context?  Woody Allen's &quot;Play it Again, Sam,&quot; is of course a  mild--and affectionate--spoof of Casablanca.  Allen is &quot;our hero&quot;  at the end of the film.  We don't quite buy it, and &quot;Sam&quot; doesn't  quite come off.  It's an interesting movie, badly edited, but I cite it  because it reinforces my main point: that to understand Casablanca, you  have to have seen some of the war films that came out at the same time.
B00000J6AG|5.0|For anyone who loves music, this CD is a must. It is not all techno as you might expect... Instead, it is a deep, passionate look at the music today. Each song on the CD is completely different, and reflects hundreds of  different moods that each person may have. I find this CD to be one of the  best buys I have ever made in my life! Listen and Love! -Raven
B000002MP2|5.0|This is a great cd with loads of songs still blaring out of alternative stations today. Who hasn't heard Longview? Or When I Come Around? Or Basket Case? Anyway, this is a classic cd that hasn't dropped off the radar and  probably won't for years to come.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I don't care what anyone says. Britney Spears is, in my humble opinion, the greatest popular musician of all time. I think she's better than The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, U2, and Elvis all  rolled into one. That being said, I think that &quot;Oops! ... I Did It  Again&quot; is even better than Spears's seminal &quot;...Baby One More  Time.&quot; That makes it, for me, the greatest album of all time.  Admittedly, I'm a little biased, but that's my opinion. And the fact that  the titles of both albums contain ellipses make them all that much better  for me. Since my favorite book of all time is Louis-Ferdinand Cline's  &quot;Death on the Installment Plan&quot; (&quot;Mort  crdit&quot;), it  goes without saying that I'm a huge fan of ellipses. So, yes - &quot;Oops!  ... I Did It Again&quot; is my favorite album of all time. Poppy. Fun.  Brilliant.
6304806418|5.0|As their third musical, Rice and Lloyd Webber tackled the then unknown saga of Eva Duarte de Peron. Thanks to the original concept recording and the London/Broadway stagings, EVITA became a world-wide hit. Who would eventually direct and star in the film version? OK...before you can say, &quot;but why Madonna?&quot; you must give the film a chance. While watching the film, I was completely mesmerized and captivated by Madonna.  Not once did I think or imagine her as the &quot;material girl&quot; (although Eva herself may have been the original material girl).   Antonio Banderas is handsome as the characher &quot;Che&quot; (not Guevara).  He, IMHO, represents the people of Argentina...their sentiments towards Eva...his kiss of the coffin in my interpretation is Argentina saying goodbye; she may have been controversial, but even the sceptical probably admired Eva Peron.  The film is epic in scope and recalls the heyday of the film musical. The orchestrations are lush and, as friend of mine would say, &quot;perfected for the screen.&quot;  And the inclusion of a new song, &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; to the score is wonderful.  EVITA on stage is a masterpiece...bold and daring and different.  EVITA the movie is a gem.   It is a remarkable piece of film-making and enhances any research on the real Evita. As it having no dialog...remember, it is an opera...and that is a story told through song. Surprise yourself and enjoy the story of one incredible woman!
014028009X|3.0|alright, so everybody says that bridget jones's diary is absolutely hilarious, so i thought i'd jump on the bandwagon and give it a read.  it was entertaining, but i must confess that i did not laugh out loud once.   sorry, y'all.  i found her observations amusing, but nothing terribly witty  that made me double over with gales of laughter.  the pride and prejudice  parallels were certainly a nice touch, but give me elizabeth bennet and mr  darcy over bridget and mark any day!
B0000024W3|5.0|Some might say that roots of this enigmatic record can be traced back to Bob Dylans days in Big Pink with the Band but in actuality some of these recordings can be traced back to a younger dylan and a younger america.  What appears to be a haphazzard mismtach of covers, originals and live  material is more of a juxtaposition of the many voices of Dylan and his  musical asthetic; and by this juxtaoposition we have the creation of the  self-portrait. Most of the cover material on this record is drawn from the  annals of forgoten pre-war american folk music; Dylans selections from this  era are, in some cases, the only surviving recordings of this songs. The  live material on this record represnt some of Dylan's most comercially  succeful  songs reworked within the dynamic of the mid 60's. These versions  are not, by any means, the cleanest, in-key, well recored surviving  versions of these songs but what they illustrate is the incredable  interplay that Dylan had created within his band at the time. Functioning  as a single unit rather than a group of indiviuals the interplay between  Dylan and Band was the realization of visions early sixties of the rock and  roll band. The remaining  tracks fill out with new studio versions of some  older obscured dylan tunes, some new originals and a few more covers from  the Golden age of Rock and roll and a then contemporary folk favorite;  Simon and garfunkles The Boxer (which serves a point of referance for  dylans abandoned role as teh folk Singer). the rest of the material finds  Dylan in various modes which, for the most part, existed only on coveted  bootleged records; Dylan as country western music, Dylan as Woddy Guthrie,  Dylan as Johnny Cash; Dyaln As Lee Hazlewood, Dylan as Dylan. This record  in my oppion, was Dylan most sincere and ambitious work of art in his post  Blonde on Blonde days. In each song is found a subtlty of Dylans musical  asthetic  which is  brought  fto the surface; this record is a must have  not only for dylan affecianados but for anyone who considers themselves a  lover of American music.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This cd is flat out awesome. People reviewing her only give her one star cause they say she is selling sex and not music. That's their opinion, but the truth is this is great pop music. If they can't recognnize good pop  music, then that's their problem. I really liked this album, every song. A+
B00004U8VN|5.0|Well most jazz fans at one point in time owned a copy of an lp, a cassette, or a cd from this famous 1963 recording, to me this particular albulm was by far the best of Stan Getz latin influenced recordings, as for  the vocal of Astrud Gilberto, just simply marvelous. And lets not forget Mr  Jobim himself on the piano, what can we say except &quot;pure magic&quot;  the music remains as fresh as 30 years ago and playing this new remastered  version is quite astounding, it is like hearing the music for the first  time, it will make every audiophile smile from ear to ear, very rarely when  buying a cd's you get such a gem  superb music coupled with a superlative  recording, this should be on every music lovers  &quot;must get list&quot;  5 stars? never, a thousand stars
B000002MG1|5.0|In 1992, 4 musicians from Athens, GA somehow managed to hit one of the highest artistic peaks in their career as a group. Subtle, Beautiful, Intelligent, Emotional, and out-right Amazing, &quot;Automatic&quot; is one  of those albums that has to be in your album collection. With the valuable  assistance of none other than Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, the  string arrangements enhance the already emotive lyrical delivery of Michael  Stipe (That is, when he's not mumbling) and sends them into orbit. The  mentioned-many-times-in-other-revues song &quot;Drive&quot; is just  mind-blowingly intense. That song, &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot;,  &quot;Find the River&quot;, and, of course, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; (a  song that I want to thank Mr. Stipe for personally) are each individually  worth the price of the entire recording. <br />Other notables include  &quot;Try Not To Breathe&quot;, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, and the Reagan  bashing &quot;Ignoreland&quot;. Without a doubt, one of R.E.M.'s best.
B00004TH83|5.0|Lara Fabian has an incredible voice. The first five songs Adagio, Part of ME, Giving up On You, and I am who I am give a preview what the cd is about.  The rest of the cd is great as well with the uptempo hit I will  love Again.  She knows how to use her vocals well without that much  screaming and hollering that goes on with the vocalists.  What really  impressed me the most was that she cowrote almost all the songs on this  album which clearly demonstrates what a talented songwriter/singer she  really is.  If you're a fan of again Celine, Barbara, Whitney or enjoy an  album with much vocals, you will enjoy this one
0783227434|5.0|Although in order to really know what is going on here, it helps to see the previous film in the Evil Dead Trilogy, this one is able to stand alone as a horror/adventure film.  Ash, this time, is back in the 14th century  and must get back to the present.  Don't ask me why, really.  I guess he  must really just like being a clerk at S-Mart.  Once again, we see the  fighter of demons, Ash, do what he does best.  But, now, unfortunately, the  average man, Ashley, has developed an attitude.  Although there are people  wiser than he, he won't listen to them.  Thus, he can't seem to get the  phrase &quot;Klaatu barrata niktu&quot; right, and winds up being the cause  of a great deal of trouble(understatement).  The images of the Army of  Darkness are great and brought back to my mind the old movie Jason and the  Argonauts.  This skeleton army does produce a really creepy image.  Once  the army is defeated, Ash(ley) once again fails to do what he is told, and  totally ruins his trip home.  But what did we expect?  The movie is left  pretty much open-ended in case there were to be a sequel, which so far the  people involved with the film say there will not.  So, for now, the Trilogy  stands as it is.  This is not a scary movie, but it is a neat little  adventure film.  And that is really all that it needs to be.
B00003Q43A|4.0|It's a very enjoyable story.  Yes, a bit hokey, but it's entertaining.  Great special effects.  I was really looking forward to getting it on DVD.  <br />After watching the original bi-plane ending on the Special Edition DVD,  while unbelievable, it made a lot more sense given certain other scenes  within the movie and, again, was fun (which is what this genre is all  about).  The 9 minutes of extra footage also allows for greater character  development and explains more of the story.  <br />However, given the great  special effects, the sound on the DVD is only mediocre - not much bass from  the subwoofer during all the tremendous explosions.  Also, with 2 discs,  too bad they couldn't find room for a Full-Screen version.  I know any  &quot;true&quot; movie lover only wants the widescreen director's edition,  but I get tired of watching only a 9 inch tall picture on my 36 inch screen  (just my preferrence).
6304712936|5.0|To begin this review, I will state that I studied classical music in high school.  I am a fan of rock and roll.  And I detest opera.  None of that matters when watching this movie.  I don't know which was better--the  performances, set design, costuming, directing--I just really don't know.   The two lead actors, F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce, were just too great  in these roles.  Why couldn't they both have been Oscar winners?  This  movie is beautiful, extravagant, and tragic all in one.  A fantastic  experience for anyone who likes movies.  I wish I'd had 6 stars to give,  but then I probably still would only have given it 5 stars because they  made me listen to opera(which, by the way, was very well done.)  I can't  say enough good things about this movie, so I'll just finish up by saying  that anyone who purchases this one wouldn't go wrong!
B00000J6AG|5.0|A friend bought this cd for me and I really did not expect to like it. I enjoy music of many kinds but am a conservative 47-year-old mother and thought Moby was going to be too &quot;techy&quot; for me. I have three  children, ages 14, 19, and 20, and a very musically-conservative  47-year-old husband who all consider &quot;Play&quot; to be their favorite  cd. We are an enthusiastic fan family and highly recommend this wonderful  cd.
0679731725|5.0|Ishiquro was born long after the events that inspired this novel passed into history.  It is amazing that a man so young -- and native to another part of the world -- could capture so richly and so well England before,  during and immediately after the war.  It is also interesting that a person  of Japanese descent would chose to examine the English reaction to the  &quot;other&quot; enemy of World War II: Germany. Ishiquro's butler is a  man without emotions and perhaps without thought.  He is unable to relate  to his father and to the nubile housekeeper.  Was he in love with her as  other reviewers have stated?  Probably not.  I think that the point that  Ishiquro may be making in his novel is that one must feel, have emotions,  if one is to think. The butler relates to no one and so is left behind, a  relic of another time and another social system.  He is an automaton in a  living museum.
B0000062GK|5.0|What an outstanding album! I'll never understand how critics could ever whine and complain about this one. It is one of his best! You see, this album came out after his self-titled, blues-heavy album, which was judged  harshly by the critics because it wasn't a shred album. Before that,  &quot;The Extremist&quot; came out, a shred album which critics loved. When  &quot;Crystal Planet&quot; came out, the critics said it sounded the same  as &quot;The Extremist.&quot; How unfair! &quot;Crystal Planet&quot; is  great in its own right and features some of his best work! The song  &quot;Love Thing&quot; made one of my friends an instant fan with its great  melody and cool bass lines. &quot;Raspberry Jam Delta-V&quot; is another  cool-sounding song that is great live. &quot;Time&quot; is a show-stopper  that begs to be played loud. &quot;A Train of Angels&quot; is one of those  loud yet touching songs he has a knack for creating and is a definite  stand-out. &quot;Ceremony&quot; has a cool tribal-type beat to it and is  very different-sounding compared to many of his songs. The title track has  a very cool ambient, deep sound to it that is hard to describe. Overall,  this is pure excellence and has a great balance of old and new to it. A  definite must-own for all Satch fans or guitar fans in general.

6303686745|3.0|The flip side of `Dr. Strangelove' - no nuclear satire here. Due to a technical error, a nuclear bomb is headed towards Moscow. This crisis unfolds with the military, the President (Henry Fonda) and a pro-war  professor played by Walter Matthau. Very talky, but a good cast, including  Fonda, Dan O'Herlihy, Fritz Weaver, Larry Hagman, and even Dom DeLuise. (!)  The choices that must be made are terrifying, to be sure, but this film's  impact has been lessened because there is no longer a Cold War. In 1964, or  even in 1984, the impact would have been different for me. Also, because  the Defense Department refused to provide aerial footage, stock footage was  used, which looks incredibly cheap. If only I could have seen this during  the Cold War...
0884271536|5.0|This is my book review, as published in the Northeast Florida Chapter of the Project Managment Institute July 200 newsletter:  &quot;I just finished reading a great book! Critical Chain is written by Eli Goldratt, previously  of the Avraham Goldratt Institute (AGI), who is now leading his own  organization.  One could refer to Eli Goldratt as the father of the Theory  of Constraints (TOC).  TOC is an overall philosophy usually applied to  running and improving an organization and readily applied to managing  projects. The TOC tools relate to problem solving (what to change from,  what to change to, and how to make that change) and daily management  (win-win conflict resolution, effective communication, team building  skills, delegation, and empowerment).  In a nutshell, critical chain (which  is a part of TOC) is a project management concept where slack is not  applied to each task, but is instead collected as a buffer at the end of a  project.  Progress is based on performance against the schedule, coupled  with calculating what portion of the buffer has been used.  I was intrigued  with the critical chain approach, so I picked up this book and am glad I  did.  While many educational books are dry reading (let's face it),  Critical Chain is both educational and entertaining.  The author provides a  fictional setting to present step-by-step instructions on how to use the  method, along with useful examples.  More importantly, he explains how each  step of the process evolved and what problems it resolves.  Critical Chain  is the latest in a series of books which discuss these solutions in detail  (the preceding books are The Goal, The Race, and It's Not Luck).  It took  me about five hours to read and was so good that I'm anxious to read the  others!&quot;
B00004RFDW|4.0|The Insider succeeds as a thriller while tackling the difficult job of a controversial news story. It is about Jeffrey Wigand, the Brown &amp; Williamson executive who wanted to tell of Big Tobacco's lies to CBS' 60  Minutes, and that network's refusal to air the story. Russell Crowe gives a  fantastic performance that not only should be remembered at Oscar time, but  should guarantee that he will become one of the top actors in the future.  Al Pacino is very good (as usual) as Lowell Bergman, the renegade producer  who fights with CBS and Wigand in order to save Wigand's story. Christopher  Plummer mimics Mike Wallace perfectly, and the rest of the cast are all  good. But most of all, it is Michael Mann's direction that makes this film  work. It moves at a frenetic pace, and pushes the audience to feel the  tension and frustration of the story. This film has not performed well  financially, and that's sad; audiences may feel that they already know this  story. That's too bad - The Insider is a terrific film which will be  remembered for years to come.

0790742314|4.0|This is a light, funny chiller about an exotic pet gone bad - a Mogwai- that becomes evil on Christmas after very specific rules are broken. There are good special effects and physical comedy - it makes the perfect dark  Christmas movie. Incidentally, this and Indiana Jones &amp; The Temple of  Doom were the films that forced the MPAA to begin the PG-13 rating. It does  seem a bit dated, though, since its 1984 release.

B00003CXDU|4.0|I didn't have high expectations for Galaxy Quest, but really enjoyed it. This film stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and Tony Shalhoub as actors from a `Star Trek' type show whose professional lives are reduced to lame  store openings and nerdy conventions. Aliens (led by the hilarious Enrico  Colantoni from TV's Just Shoot Me) need these heroes to save their planet,  since they've watched these heroes from space. The aliens, however, believe  that the show was real, (they refer to the show as the `historical  documents') and now this ragged team of hack actors is in for a fight with  some nasty space creatures. The special effects are terrific, Allen enjoys  spoofing space movies and his Buzz Lightyear persona, and Weaver, usually a  dramatic actress, lightens up well. Alan Rickman is also good as a  Shakespearean-trained actor who is constantly complaining that he is only  recognized in his alien garb. Galaxy Quest is a light comedy that is  definitely worth seeing.
B000021XS0|3.0|Scenes from a memory has a lot to stand up to. It has been compared to some of music's greatest concept albums, such as The Wall or Tommy. If you review it comparing it to these then it fails, but if you grade it on it's  own level, then it fairs better. The storyline of the album is not the  easiest to follow but it does prove highlights. You need to have the liner  notes in hand while listening so you can distinguish characters because of  the one vocalist. Musically it is all very technical and tight, and aside  from the last two tracks it seems pretty emotionless to me, like much of  DT's music. It's not that its not good, it's just to dull during most  parts, not much different from their other music. Spirit Carries on is  outstanding with the obvious Pink Floyd/ Roger Waters vocal refrence, but  overall it lacks the spirit and emotion of a great concept album.
B00000JXV7|2.0|Affleck and Bullock play mismatched travelers to Savannah, Georgia; he, to his wedding, and she, well, she has her reasons. The two have zero chemistry together; Steve Martin and John Candy had a lot more in the  similar-themed Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (1987), which was a lot  funnier as well. Even a scene where Affleck dances in a gay bar, which has  potential for laughs, falls flat. At least Steve Zahn, as Affleck's best  man, is funny. A waste of time and talent.
B000002UB3|5.0|There simply was no better a Beatles album than Abbey Road. Musically everyone was at their peak. Hell, even Ringo wrote a good tune (Octapuses Garden). It's hard to rate Beatle albums above one another. They are all 5  stars or well close to it. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't like at  least one song on this album. The Beatles without a doubt are the most  infuential and important band of all time. This is their swan song. Every  song is incredible but The second side suite is the best of all. The  harmonies on Because are incredible and the jam on Carry that Weight is  brilliant. The Beatles will never be overrated. They were simply to  important to music.
0553269631|3.0|I truly wish that we could have an 18 yrs and up review site... or perhaps a reviewing forum solely for those who were not forced to read books for assignments... anyhow...<br />Though the protagonist of &quot;The  Heart...&quot; is a pre-teen, this is not a book which will be  well-understood by kids.  I would like to give this book 3 1/2 stars, but  that is not an option- basically it is a nice read, however there are  several things which did not sit well with me.<br />From reading the other  reviews here you already see the plot.  As for the characters, I was able  to see a little of myself in almost all of them (except Jake- I couldn't  stand him).  Dr. Copeland, whose superiority and high expectations of  character and behavior in others relegate and doom him to a life of  disappointment; Mick and especially Bubber, the bright and thoughtful  children (a bit too bright- see below); Biff Brannon, the owner of the  diner; and of course, John the mute- maybe I'm nuts, but in my mind's eye I  envision John Singer exactly as I do John Galt from Atlas Shrugged!  Maybe  it's the name, perhaps the fact that neither is a man of many words, maybe  the physical description of green-grey eyes, a tall, thin build, and always  keeping his hands in his pockets, or possibly the patience and willingness  to suffer in silence for a long period of time without showing it... I wish  I was as strong as those two.<br />Isn't that the best part of literature  though?  Finding heroes who set new standards of behavior to attempt to  model oneself after?<br />Anyway, the book is not without its problems.  There  are many small errors, which, though not monumental, are flagrant in their  number and leave a bad taste.  For example, a scene will be described as  taking place in October- while later in the scene we find a reference to  &quot;the September sunshine&quot;.  The author also can never seem to  remember whether John Singer is drinking coffee or beer- in one scene she  switches2 or 3 times... annoying things like that.<br />What I found to be  the weakest point, though, was the fact that the children are given adult  attributes.  Granted, children are capable of much more complex feelings  than they are often given credit for... and we can all sympathize with kids  to some extent, having all been there.   But I was shocked when I went back  to find that Bubber was only 7 years old.  Seven?  She should have made him  ten or eleven...<br />Like I said, a nice read for when you're in a pensive  mood.  #17 novel of the century?  I don't know about that one...  Remember,  it's easy to make people cry.  What's difficult is to make them laugh.
068484267X|2.0|Simply put, this book was written for Americans.  It does not convey the hardships the Irish endured as they happened.  The authors storytelling is  repetitive babble, but the storyline was okay.  However, if you want to  read a good Irish book choose something written by an author who still  lives and always has live in Ireland. There are many other great Irish  literature works.
0812548094|4.0|Stone of Tears is the second novel in the sword of truth series, and while it is not quite as good as the first novel it is good enought to buy. Although it was a tid bit graphic, and i had to skim a few parts, this book  goes a long way to explain later book and help develop the characters.  There is so much information in this novel it's almost scary. You are so  into reading it and finding out what happened that you don't even realize  how much you've actually read.
B000021XS0|5.0|Words cannot express how good Dream Theater's latest effort, Scenes from a Memory is.  This is a rock opera so to speak, as the songs tell a story.  This isn't a casual mainstream rock CD that is meant to be fired up,  listened to a song or two and then put away.  The entire CD needs to be  listened to, to be fully appreciated. The music shifts from beautiful to  powerful in the blink of an eye.  The complex tempo and rythym shifts  happen quickly as they usually do in typical Dream Theater fashion.  Often  times the music is mindblowing as all 5 musicians are in perfect  synchronicity with each other.  This is not a small feat as the music can  jump around from a slow pace to the lightning fast rythyms paced by Mike  Portnoy's excellent drumming.<br />Dream Theater is a musician's band by far.   James Labrie has a fantastic voice, John Myung is a superb bass player,  John Petrucci is awesome on guitars, Mike Portnoy is the best drummer out  there, and newcomer Jordan Rudess is incredible on the keyboards.  These  musicians simply transcend regular rock music and play music that is above  and beyond what most of us are accustomed to listening to.  <br />Scenes from  a memory at times reminds me of old Queen music and sometimes Pink Floyd  and yet is far different and much better than both of those.  Its an  excellent CD and well worth a purchase!   <br />This CD will have you hungry  for another Dream Theater CD, so if you would like to check out some other  great Progressive Metal Bands, check out Vanden Plas, Far Off Grace or  Angra's Fireworks.  Thier work is similar to Dream Theater's and may fill  the void until DT's next fantastic release.  <br />Highly recommended!
0394583892|5.0|As an ardent Nelson DeMille fan, I think that this is one of the best.  This is a book of real intrique and it is one where the author does not allow the reader to get lost even with the story evolving around the topic  of germ warfare.  In the hands of a less gifted author, this work would not  be the page-turner that it is.
B00000DHZJ|3.0|Neophytes -- and creatures from most other planets for that matter -- will do well with this compilation -- all the best-known (and most of the best) Hendrix classics are on this disc, and there's no filler in sight (or  earshot as it were). <br />BUT (and there always is a &quot;but&quot; in this  type of review) some of the finest tracks Jimi ever recorded (and were  later released) are missing from this CD/LP/cassette: nothing from Band of  Gypsies? Pali Gap? Hey Baby (Rising Sun)? Love or Confusion? One Rainy  Wish? Valleys of Neptune? <br />Awright, maybe I'm dreaming; I wouldn't  sacrifice anything from the collection as it is, and I might not want to  release a 2-disc set. But I will kvetch softly, if it's okay with you.  <br />(&quot;Yet another Hendrix greatest-hits CD? They've been releasing them  for 30 years now and they still haven't got one right!&quot;)
B000002WYT|5.0|This is the album that will finally give credit to the Foo Fighters and hopefully force posers and cynics (is there a difference?) to let the Nirvana comparisons rest in peace along with Kurt.  This album, like its  predecessors, contains songs for everyone, whether you love hard rock  anthems, slow inspiring ballads, or just all out, plain ol' rock and roll.   Stacked Actors starts out the album with a rough sounding riff.  Breakout  and Generator are reminiscent of 70's rock, and there's nothing wrong with  that.  The song Learn to Fly is an introspective take on life set to  probably what will become the Foos most popular song along with last  album's Monkeywrench.  Aurora is a dark horse that deserves to be listened  to--the opening riff is indicative that Dave Grohl is really coming into  his own as a song writer and musician.  It may be the best song on the CD.   The song that will probably not get any airplay but may be Dave Grohl's  other best effort is the slow, country sounding Ain't it the Life.  The  song is a mesh of rock and country...with good vocals, great solo  progression and unforgettable chorus.  Dave Grohl consistently takes us  into his life, and his feelings and emotions come across through his music.   This is definitely one worth owning if you are a true rock fan...nevermind  that &quot;alternative&quot; label.  No pun on &quot;nevermind&quot;  either.  Dave is his own guy, and this album proves it.  Buy it...you won't  regret it, nor will you regret the enhanced CD-ROM section which has the  video Learn to Fly and complete lyrics.  And much like Kiss Alive II, it  comes with your own band temporary tattoo...buy it!
0312853238|4.0|Ender's Game excels in several ways, but its greatest strength may be character development. Each of the characters have depth, especially Valentine and Peter. The author was also exceptionally forward-thinking in  predicting future use of computer chat rooms, relatively unheard of when  the book was first published, as potential means of swaying public opinion  and influencing government policy. Other details of this futuristic world  are equally interesting. The story is set in a future reminiscent of  Huxley's Brave New World trimmed with Orwellian political overtones where  religious practices are discouraged and family sizes are strictly  enforced.<br />The book's only real faults are its predictability and the  unreasonably young ages of its main characters. While reading the novel I  foresaw its &quot;plot twists&quot; well ahead of their unveilings. This  book will mostly appeal to self-perceived child geniuses who will see  reflections of themselves in Ender. Readers with fond memories of being  gifted children will swallow easily the possibilty of an 8-year old trained  soldier. But all of us, even the smartest among us, have a tendancy to  exaggerate our childhood accomplishments. As a military veteran, I find the  concept of a fully trained soldier of Ender's age difficult to  accept.<br />Overall, this was still an excellent book, even for those who  don't normally read science fiction. Having said that I personally have no  desire to read any sequels to Ender's Game.

B00000ILDE|5.0|&quot;Aliens&quot; sucessfully combines action and sci-fi to create one of the best films for both genres. I was impressed with the action and the story, action films seldomly have a story. James Cameron does an  extrordinary job of maintaining the tension, once the movie gets going it  doesn't let up. Sigourney Weaver gives a tough, convincing performance as  Ellen Ripley. This film is without a doubt the best film in the  &quot;Alien&quot; series and one of the best Sci-fi/Action movies around.
0060925000|5.0|It's been several years already since I first read this book, and actually I just came across this review area and listing now, to see if Seth has  come out with anything new (that I haven't yet read), so I decided to add a  brief comment about how much I LOVED this book.  It was so rich and  engrossing (even if I skimmed over some of the historical/political  descriptive plot parts to get more quickly back to the main love story saga  plotline), I still think of this book &quot;fondly&quot; as one of my all  time favorite favorite favorite novels, and will never forget the feeling  of sadness and emptiness when I had to put the book down because it was  finished!  I'd never experienced that before, when I was approaching the  end, I couldn't stop reading, because I wanted to know 'what happened', but  at the same time, I didn't want to finish and find out, because I didn't  want the book to end and have all those characters go away.  It honestly  felt like I had lost some friends when I'd finished that book! Like a world  I had so richly and fully entered and been engrossed in had come to an end!  And it was totally random that I even originally found this book! Just a  listing in the paper about this author 'Vikam Seth' reading from his new  novel at I think it was Kroch's and Brentano's, in Chicago, before they  went out of business.  Having had a former Bangladeshi boyfriend in  college, and close Indian friends through him, I went to see what this was  about. What a joy! And his other novel out last year about the music was  enjoyable, too. (But not as deep as this!)
080017948X|5.0|This was the statement declared by Phil (Bill Murray) when he finds himself living the same day, the Groundhog Day, over and over again and becomes seemingly immortal.<br />Phil starts off as an obnoxious and  self-centred man who, during his course of repeating the same day of his  life, undergoes changes which he has never expected.  It is interesting to  see how Phil's view towards such an experience changes gradually as he  becomes more accustomed to the whole thing: first he is in real panic, then  he starts to take advantage of the situation, then he gets bored...  probably the same would be true for all of us if we go through the same  experience.  At the same time his personality is also changing.  He starts  to &quot;grow up&quot; and realises his mistakes.  All these minute changes  from one day to another (actually the same day) are not an easy job for any  actors or actresses, but has been performed superbly by Bill Murray.  Not  to mention all the laughs he managed to throw in as well.<br />Original story,  excellent performance.  I would recommend this romantic comedy to anyone.

I am a devout Christian and the references to  God and the bible and how it ties into life and having a fulfilled life was  very important in the central theme. God was the center of it all and made  a miracle come true. It was excellent.

6304613199|1.0|Having loved the first Jurassic Park film, I came to this one expecting more of the same kind of thrills.  Unfortunately, what I got was an extremely mean-spirited and poorly-written excuse for a film.  It felt as  though Spileberg had directed the film from home via satellite  communication (save the one day he made a cameo appearance in the TV  reflection at the end).<br />My biggest complaint with the film is, as I've  stated above, the large amount of sadistic, mean-spirited violence  throughout the film.  The first Jurassic Park was fairly light on  dinosaur-involved fatalities, and each time one occurred, it was treated  horrifically, intending the audience to be shocked at the grisly deaths.  In The Lost World, the deaths are treated as eye candy, at which the  viewers are meant to be in awe of.  Sometimes, deaths are protracted to  uncomfortable length (such as the man who is attacked again and again by  the tiny scavenger dinosaurs).  I decided that I didn't like the movie,  however, after my favorite character was killed by the two T-Rexes in a  particularly graphic manner.  (They make a wishbone of his body.)<br />What  burns me even more are the actions of the Vince Vaughn character.  The  animal rights wacko he plays is responsible for the deaths of many humans,  however the audience is supposed to feel that he is justified, because  after all, only the &quot;nasty corporate guys&quot; get killed (with the  exception of the death of the aforementioned favorite character, also a  result of the eco-terrorist).  Apparently, we are suppposed to believe that  the dinosaurs should be preserved at all costs (including human lives),  despite the fact that they had been selected by nature to become  extinct.<br />And then, of course, there is the horrible  T-Rex-on-the-loose-ending sequence, in which more people are killed  unnecessarily.  (Fortunately, the screenwriter, David Koepp, who also made  the abysmal adaptation of the wonderful novel A Stir of Echoes, plays one  of the victims.)  I keep wondering, though, how a T-Rex could kill everyone  on the boat without causing any damage to the cabin or the rest of the  ship, for that matter.  Yet another protracted and sadistic death takes  place (once again, it's okay, because he's a corporate jerk) before the  film is over.<br />Spielberg should be ashamed of this film.  I rather hope he  one day issues a written apology for it.plays one  of the victims.)

0385482582|4.0|Andy Grove has verbalized the mindset that we must all develop to survive in the 21st Century.  While his idea of constantly looking over your shoulder has always been applicable, the speed of the Internet economy  requires that we do it much more frequently and penalizes us much more  quickly if we do not.<br />Grove does a great job of showing how one man's  crises is another's opporuntity and uses the term strategic inflection  points to describe these periods of 10x change.<br />This book is a good  reminder for anyone who thinks that what made them successful to this point  is any guarantee that they will be successful in the future.

Each page is filled with disturbing details and mind-blowing suspense.<br />After having found a monograph called The  Navidson Record, a book based on a documentary that was written by a blind  man named Zampano, Jonny Truant's life is not the same. And after having  read House of Leaves, I, like Truant, haven't been able to forget this  incredible piece of work. Luckily, I, unlike Truant, don't have nightmares  because of it.<br />This is not a book that you can pleasantly read on the  beach; it demands your undivided attention. I marvel at Mark Z.

B0000399WI|5.0|Everyonce in a while, a movie comes along that changes the way you look at filmaking. For the Horror genre it was Psycho, for Action, Aliens and for Drama, it is the Shawshank Redemption. These films change the way we look  at movies. They raise the bar for how a film should be made. The film  queitly crept into theaters in 1994, and was overshadowed because of the  lack of blockbuster stars in the picture. But that didnt keep it from  gaining 7 academy award nominations. The film focuses on Andrew Dufresne  (played to perfection by Tim Robbins) as a convicted murder sent to prison  for the murder of his wife and her lover, a crime he did not commit. The  film takes no prisoners in delving into the hardcore realities of prison  life. At first, Andy has trouble fitting in, often resulting in him being  violated by other prison memebers and guards. But one day, he meets  &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman) who changes the way he looks at life. Red  has the ability to access things for people, and through this, the story  progresses. Morgan Freeman also does the naration along the way, which is  worth the price of the dvd by itself. The film could have easily been a  disturbing and hardcore look at prison life, and at times it is. But, the  main focus is hope, and thats what makes it so great. As you watch, the  movie starts to grow on you. No longer does this prison look to be such a  bad place. The film grows on you. Everytime you veiw it, something new is  picked up which makes it that much more enjoyable. The music and direction  of the film is remarkable. The enemies of the movie, the warden and guard  memebers, all have there own distinct personalities. In every way, this  movie is a classic. It has friendship, hardship, hope and a true message.  If you buy one dvd, not for the extras, but for an endearing story youll  come back to and enjoy everytime, make this the one you buy.
B000001DTM|5.0|The true measure of a successful band can be judged by how solid its non-radio hits on an album are. By those standards, U2 is a resounding success almost every time out. Sure, the gooey synthesizer heard on \\"Even Better than the Real Thing\\" was made to be heard on the radio by millions of ears, and yes, \\"One\\" and \\"Mysterious Ways\\" are deservedly the stuff of U2 classic-rock legend. But it's the more obscure tracks from the messily impeccable \\"Achtung Baby\\" that give the CD such depth, atmosphere and feeling. \\"So Cruel,\\" for instance, is a sparse, lovelorn ode to a former love that is painstakingly honest and true-to-life; the chiming guitar and spacey vibe heard on tunes like \\"Until the End of the World\\" and \\"Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World\\" define this album's venturing sound and feel; and the opener, \\"Zoo Station,\\" establishes the adventurous tone of the album via a beautiful Bono falsetto, tin can drums and lyrics that boldly challenge and seek out a challenge.<br /><br />Perhaps some of the best songs from U2's illustrious career occur on the album's final three tracks: \\"Ultra Violet (Light My Way),\\" \\"Acrobat\\" and \\"Love is Blindness\\" honestly speak of the myriad pitfalls and difficulties of love and life. Sometimes the words are pleading, but mostly they sound unsure and resigned. What gives the songs inspiration are The Edge's atmospheric guitar work and Bono's ultimately hopeful tone despite dark remembrances and outlooks.<br /><br />\\"Achtung Baby\\" was the album that got me interested in U2, and its technologically advanced sound and endless sonic beauty seemed more exciting than the sober [[ASIN:B000001FS3 The Joshua Tree]] (which I now regard as an excellent record). There are moments of screeching beauty on this CD, like when The Edge's axe soars and swirls on the aggressive \\"The Fly\\" and on the heartfelt \\"Acrobat.\\" And there are moments of sublime, somber reflection that put \\"Achtung Baby\\" over the top as a musical milestone, during a time -- the early 1990s -- when music by fantastic artists was burgeoning, creative and king of all entertainment for the youth culture.1990s -- when music by fantastic artists was burgeoning, creative and king of all entertainment for the youth culture.
B000000OSG|5.0|Before I get started here, I just want to say that, regardless of what you may have seen or heard on VH1 or elsewhere, that incident in Montreal was NOT GUNS N ROSES FAULT! It was Metallica's fault. Now here's my  song-by-song review of this great album.<br />01- Civil War- Their epic song  with a political message beneath the scorching guitar and bass riffs.  <br />02- 14 Years- A good song sung by Izzy, my favourite member of Guns N  Roses. The way that the piano was added in here is cool as well. Axl does a  good job with the backing vox.<br />03- Yesterdays- A catchy song. The video  is interesting; why is it all in black and white? <br />04- Knockin' On  Heavan's Door- A nice cover of an already good song; they just made it  better. Kind of like Hendrix's cover of Dylan's &quot;All Along the  Watchtower&quot;.<br />05- Get In The Ring- YES! This song ROCKS! The intro  guitars are awesome!<br />06- Shotgun Blues- Another great song<br />07-  Breakdown- One of the best songs this band ever did, I truly think that it  never got the respect it deserved...it should have been released as a  single!<br />08- Pretty Tied Up- Written by Izzy, sung by Izzy and Axl, not  really great, but still pretty good.<br />09- Locomotive- Kind of psychedelic,  an interesting song.<br />10- So Fine- I love this beautiful song.<br />11-  Estranged- Easily the best song on this album, which is really saying  something with all the great material here. The guitar solos are two of the  best I've ever heard anywhere.<br />12- You Could Be Mine- A great song, total  headbanging frenzy.<br />13- Don't Cry- The other version is slightly  better.<br />14- My World- This is the only weak link; the only Guns N Roses  song I really dislike. <br />So, overall, this remains one of the best rock  albums ever by any band from anywhere in the world and if you like rock,  metal or just music in general, you need to own this landmark masterpiece.
B000002TYK|5.0|Rarely is a debut album as strong and sparkling as the pop/punk masterpiece that Dave Grohl put out in 1995, simply entitled \\"Foo Fighters.\\" From the start, the songs hit quick, one after the other, each as catchy and headbangingly addictive as the next. Grohl showcases his musical talent by handling all the singing and instrumentation on this CD, proving it's truly a spectacular one-man show. There's a sheen to \\"Foo Fighters\\" that was somewhat foreign to many of those early 1990s  Seattle grunge groups. Clearly, Dave Grohl was not afraid to take that  exposed genre of hard rock music to another level, perhaps a more  mainstream level, that a wider group of people could enjoy.<br /><br />Like his idols Cheap Trick, Grohl plays burning, high-energy rockers with fabulously repetitive sing-a-long choruses like \\"I'll Stick Around!\\"  Occasionally, as on the great jingle \\"Big Me,\\" he gets breezy and lighthearted, actually downright pop. However, the solid majority of this record is bang-bang-bang and in your face, a nonstop assault of classic candy pop-punk rock. Each and every song on this album was capable of being a hit single.<br /><br />Like his talented buddy Kurt Cobain, Grohl has a knack for irresistable  chord patterns and melodies within songs. \\"Good Grief\\" features fuzz-busting guitar and a smooth drum kick -- hard to believe one guy (a  drummer no less!) pulled all this good stuff off. \\"Floaty\\" is as good as rock music gets, a properly named tune with a melody that glides like bubblegum pop out of your speakers and into your ears. This is actually a segment of sugarcoated rock 'n' roll that Kurt Cobain may never have  touched, but the more carefree Dave Grohl seemed to tackle it with adept  glee. Yet, Ghrol can be as equally adept at hard and distorted music, like on the amazing and indecipherable \\"Weenie Beenie.\\" Other great songs include the breezier, more mid-tempo \\"Oh, George\\"; the moments of  quietness and blistering rock on \\"For all the Cows\\"; the hazy guitars and hypnotic, lulling, well-spaced drums on \\"X-Static\\"; the pure punk energy of \\"Wattershed\\"; and the weary \\"Exhausted,\\" which may be one of Grohl's best tunes ever.<br /><br />When it came out in 1995, \\"Foo Fighters\\" was immediately scoured for signs of grand theft from Nirvana's [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]] album, of which Dave Grohl, new leader of the Foo Fighters, was very much a part of. In retrospect, it's scary to think what kind of music Nirvana might have recorded in the future with more of a Cobain/Grohl songwriting collaboration. \\"Foo Fighters\\" is a clean sounding, guitar-driven gem of an album, precise, poppy and hard rocking all at once. What's also noticeable is the expertly chosen order of the tracks, which flow together perfectly for a nonstop assault of headbanging catchiness. \\"Foo Fighters\\" is similar to \\"Nevermind\\" only in that it rocks tunefully from the first note to the last.<br /><br />Like its name suggests, the leadoff track, \\"This is a Call,\\" is an announcement by Grohl that he's arrived and ready to sing about his catharsis: \\"This is a call to all my past resignation/It's been too long!\\" As Foo Fighter fans would later find out, Grohl was not averse to polishing his material in the studio, and in that sense, his debut as a Foo also resembles the slickly produced (but not overproduced) \\"Nevermind.\\" Live, Grohl's falsetto is not quite as controlled as it is on CD, nor is the Foo's sound as tight on stage as it is on record. Still, Grohl's capacity as a musician is phenomenol. On top of singing, the man plays every catchy guitar hook, bass note and drum beat on this CD.<br /><br />Every song on \\"Foo Fighters\\" soars; there's not a dull moment or a loser in the bunch. \\"Floaty\\" is transcendent with its dreamy sound and lyrics; \\"Weenie Beenie\\" is muscular, loud and surprisingly distorted throughout; \\"For All the Cows\\" has that soft vocal/loud verse dynamic that Kurt Cobain so perfected; \\"X-Static\\" features superior drumming and a dreamy vibe; \\"Watershed\\" is pure punk rock; \\"Exhausted,\\" the album's closer, is all of the above and more: resigned, distorted, tuneful, tired.<br /><br />All in all, Dave Grohl and his ever-changing cohorts in the Foo Fighters, despite some great songs after this album, never topped this highly recommended effort.rock; \\"Exhausted,\\" the album's closer, is all of the above and more: resigned, distorted, tuneful, tired.

B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures is a giant album.  Every song is a well crafted, brilliantly produced gem of modern rock.  Moving Pictures is the soundtrack of the modern era, and its tunes are as poignant (if not more so) than wneh  it was originally released.  I think I've owned about three copies, a  staple to any fan of rock, or any type of music for that matter.
B00000K31Q|5.0|Personally, I really enjoyed this movie. It was a great way to make a modern shakespeare! I thought that the dialog was creative but kept to the plot well. You have to rent this movie... even if it is only for Patrick  singing on the bleachers!
B0000399WI|5.0|The power of man to endure and overcome all adversity. That is the story in Shawshank. Tim Robbins plays an unjustly convicted fellon who overcomes his situation using his mind and his ability to never lose hope. This is a  fantastic story told through a group of master thespians.
0767819594|4.0|I liked this movie, however, it is a bit confusing and hard to follow. Also, since it has been called a &quot;teen flick&quot; some of the lines were a bit unrealistic for teenagers to be saying. Especially in the pool  scene. I know that some people say the end (with the car, i wont say more  and ruin it...) is cheap, but personally i love it when Catherine is  &quot;torn apart&quot; by her felow classmates! I think that a broad  spectrum of people would enjoy this movie!
6305910324|5.0|What a great movie... in an age where big budget movies rule it is always nice to see a movie that is filled with great acting instead of just great special effects. Its a coming of age story about a young boy, a handbook  for parents on how to support and raise their children, and a film about  values. All in all, a great story with a great cast.
020530902X|4.0|Strunk and White are great for a quick review of crisp style. However, they are not of any help for developing a complex style, making use of metaphor, or taking advantage of the new formats used in today's essays.  The book is also not fun to read.  For a hot read and to and muscle to  Strunk and White's weaknesses see the Hoffman's book entitled Adios, Strunk  and White.
B000002OAZ|5.0|Howlin' Wolf sings his classic songs.  The Rolling Stones rhythm section of Wyman &amp; Watts.  Clapton plays lead guitar &amp; Stevie Winwood handles the keyboards.  Really, is there any way this could have gone  wrong?  Well, it didn't.  The band never would have forgiven themselves if  they'd screwed it up.<br />If you had taken Wolf out of the equation, these  guys probably could not have fit their swollen heads &amp; bloated egos  into the same room.  But they did it for Wolf, &amp; they did it the right  way.  <br />Clapton's lead lines, fills &amp; solos were creative without  getting showy -- he worked to make every song better without making it the  Eric Clapton show. Wyman &amp; Watts had it the easiest, since they always  checked their egos at the door w/the Stones while pushing the beat.   Winwood contented himself to just be a sideman for an entire album, which  may have been the biggest surprise of all.<br />So, is this a Blues album or a  Rock album?  Either or both.  In fact, it is the best evidence available of  how little difference there could be between the two, properly approached.   OK, it may be just the teensiest bit too antiseptic to be a genuine Blues  album.  That having been said, it is perfect for what it is.  The acolytes  giving props to the elder master, helping him to a late career payday that  he surely needed, and the master acknowledging that (as we say on the South  Side these days) the kids could play.  All concerned acquitted themselves  honorably.  <br />It sounded great in the '70's, &amp; still does.

0792839730|3.0|...but it ended up just being \\"the longest movie.\\"<br />To my mind, A Bridge Too Far is a sort of hybrid between the really great classic war movies, The Longest Day being the standard bearer, and the grueling intimacy of Saving Private Ryan. It doesn't really work perfectly in either way, and man, does it ever last a loooong time.<br />Take, for example, the famous scene of Robert Redford's river crossing in Bridge. We're supposed to feel the sort of gut wrenching terror we felt on Omaha beach in Ryan, but we're also meant to be having the sort of cavalcade of stars we saw in Longest Day (\\"There's Robert Mitchum!\\"). I can't really identify with Redford, and anyway the Bridge depiction of him has him practically sainted, just this side of George Washington as he says his Hail Mary thing over and over. Because we're supposed to be feeling the disorientation of the actual soldiers, a la Ryan, we lose track of the big picture/Longest Day context... it's just flawed, and I wasn't moved by it as much as confused and dissatisfied.<br />A Bridge Too Far is watchable, but it goes in too many directions at once, so it can't rate among the classics of the genre for me. I recommend you read the book instead, or at least read it first.

B000000H64|5.0|Fear Factory's 1st CD was a great CD, and now they have changed it around a little for #2.Starting up the CD is the title track &quot;Demanufacture.&quot;  Probably the best song on the CD, it crushes  everything you knew about life and spits it in your face  again.&quot;Self-Bias Resistor&quot; is a wake-up call for the world with  speedy guitar shots and drums that are breakneck hard.&quot;Zero  Signal&quot; is at first a slow rush through space until you get hit with a  hardcore riff of energy.&quot;Replica&quot; is a drumfest with a great  start.&quot;New Breed&quot; is a destructive bloodfest with a sweet techno  background.A lot of people like &quot;Dog Day Sunrise&quot; but it really  isn't that great in my eyes.Still hardcore and all, but just not as good.A  hard guitar shot from &quot;Body Hammer&quot; opens up a gun full of pure  energy upon your ears.&quot;Flashpoint&quot; is a symphony of chaos all  packed into less than 3 minutes. (H-K) Hunter-Killer is a strange blast of  guitar and hammer drums at the same time.  &quot;Pisschrist&quot; is a  buzzsaw of steel and fire.  &quot;A Therapy for Pain&quot; is a epic 9:43  airborne ride through life and death itself.  Buy this, u will NOT be  dissapointed at all.
B00004TR2G|4.0|What a good surprise to find this new and complete soundtrack of the thrilling JAWS. The remastered sound is great, with heavy and deep bass. The fear is now bigger ! But my favourite track is &quot;Father &amp;  Son&quot;. It illustrates this magical moment of complicity between Martin  Brody (sexy Roy Scheider) and his son, at diner. Only Spielberg and  Williams can make feel that !
0792833201|5.0|This movie creeped me out big time. The enormous skull, living tree, the closet that looks like that monster from the 3rd Star Wars movie (you know, the thing that had tentacles and was really big and... nevermind), and who  could forget the part that scared the bejesus out of me when I was 13! The  life-sized clown, of course. You can't go through that scene without being  the least bit scared. Some of the effects hold up well today, though the  face ripping scene, you can see how much fatter it has gotten. <br />Has to be  a classic.
B000003TAW|5.0|A very nice, polished CD that is good from beginning to end, from &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot; until &quot;Only in Dreams&quot;.  The little sticker on the front always has 3 or 4 of the hits, but all 10 songs deserve to be  on that sticker! Features catchy songs like &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; and  &quot;Undone-the Sweater Song&quot;, you'll definitely be pushing repeat on  your CD player!  A must buy for any rock fan.  I didnt know what type of  music i liked until i bought this CD, and now i know.
6305750750|4.0|Okay, disregarding the typical fact that the German version of this movie is a classic sample of incompetent translators, I do not understand why almost everyone seems to hate it across the ocean (that means YOU!). I have  to admit that SW E-1 (whose German title would translate into &quot;The  Dark Threat&quot; by the way) doesn´t spread the same, well,  &quot;magic&quot; of the other episodes, but it still remains a good piece  of family entertainment. Kids here loved that clumpsy Jar Jar guy (a weird  mixture of Indiana Jones and Inspector Clouseau if you ask me) or that  two-headed alien from the pod race, whereas older people remembered the   time THEIR fathers saw SW E-4 with them. At the bottom line, The Phantom  Menace stays a space-based fairy tale with all the necessary ingredients:  Good knights, evil sorcerers, nice and not-so-nice monsters, a beautiful  princess in distress and the certainty that there will be a happy  end.<br />P.S.: The only thing that angers me is the fact that there is no DVD  version of this movie, as I would like to see the US-version, too.
B000002HPT|5.0|This album is an adventure from start to finish.  Dream Theater's first (and last) full length studio album with Keyboardist Derek Sherinnnian and 6th LP/EP is a romp through all kinds of musical stylings.  Mainly, I feel  the songs fall into two broad categories Ballads &quot;Peruvian Skies&quot;  (kinda), &quot;Hollow Years&quot;, &quot;Take Away My Pain&quot; and  &quot;Anna Lee&quot; and Rockers (Every thing else). But,what's great about  this album is that almost every song has a totally different feel to it so  labels need not apply. All tracks stand out with &quot;Hollow Years&quot;  &quot;Peruvian Skies&quot; &quot;Burning My Soul&quot; and &quot;Just Let  Me Breathe&quot; being the crown jewels.  Falling has John Myung's 6 string  out in front a little bit more than in previous albums which gives some  tracks a bit more of a funky feel. Overall, the musicianship is what you've  come to expect form Dream Theater, 4 virtuosos playing mind boggeling  melodies while compelling lyrics are gracefully delivered from a singer who  has one of the greatest vocal ranges I've ever heard. Another thing is that  all of the lyrics make you think and at times (chorus of Hollow Years  verses of Take Away My Pain and all of Anna Lee) almost bring you to tears,  which most bands are quite uncapable of doing. Doug Pinnick of King' X  makes a guest vocal appearance on &quot;Lines In The Sand&quot; adding  another level to that song. Again, Overall this is a very rewarding musical  experiances which makes 80 minutes fly by in no time. You cannot explain  the power of DT's music in words you, just have to hear it for yourself.  P.S. If you listen to the break in &quot;Take Away My Pain&quot; about  three mintues into the song, you can hear almost a prelude to Scenes From a  Memory.
B00003RQNJ|1.0|There are at least two chapters to definitely skip in this DVD; one is a music-video sequence of flower-child-y clowning around between Newman and Ross; the other is a music-video photo-collage sort of thing intended to  depict the trio's passage through New York.  The period photos are  interesting, but the sequence is long and slow and contains no plot  development.<br />Long and slow pretty much covers the rest of the film too.   Paul Newman is occasionally charming as Butch Cassidy, but Redford's   Sundance is brutal and inaccessible, and Katharine Ross as the third side  of the love triangle is like a character from one of those creepy old  sex-ed videos you watched in grade school.<br />There is no greatness in this  movie, no matter what anyone says or how many people have seen it.  Sitting  thru it was excruciating, a big waste of time and money.
0884271536|4.0|I received this book for an executive MBA operations management course. I found it particularly easy to read and interesting, since I had worked in project management for ten years, but in services rather than  manufacturing. A most interesting concept discussed is &quot;padding&quot;,  or protecting particular steps in a project. The book discusses elevating  the essential steps of a project (hence &quot;critical chain&quot;) and  removing that padding that is placed around non-essentials that can waste  time and money. It also talks about realistically planning/estimating time,  and how during projects we tend to over-estimate time to plan for unforseen  problems (again, padding). Key take aways were the chapters about getting  vendor buy in to critical chain stuff, convincing our outsourcing companies  to buy in to how maximizing critical efforts can save resources and earn  them additional profit. Four stars were given because of two reasons-the  author assumes that we all have the inherent ability to get the higher ups  unconditional buy ins that will be needed to apply this theory. The second  reason was the authors sometimes patronizing portrayal of women and holier  than thou professor characters.
B000002U84|5.0|Beth Bessmer is mistaken to criticize John Taylor's bass for being high in the mix.  That was part of the idea: Roxy Music meets Chic.  The bass is a crucial part of the record.  Without it the Chic part would be missing.   And the record wouldn't be funky.
B000002H33|5.0|Simply put, Metallica's best album and one of the finest hard rock albums ever made.  From start to finish, Master of Puppets is high energy, melodic, lyrically complex, and well produced. There is not a throw away  song anywhere on this CD. The songs tend to be very long (although they  never seem that way), so they aren't radio friendly. If the fact that  you've never heard any of these songs on the radio is holding you back,  don't let it!  Buy the CD, you will not be disappointed.
B00004HYLF|5.0|After producing the funky 'No Mystery', it seems that Corea's boys spent some time listening to ELP's 'Tarkus' or Yes's 'Topographic Oceans'.  Whatever the influences, the result was a masterpiece.  The utter tragedy  was that soon after producing this, one of my top ten albums of all time,  the band broke up and Corea produced the utterly dire 'Musicmagic'.
B000002H2H|4.0|On Kill 'Em All Metallica was trying to find their sound, on Ride the Lightning they found it. This album combined the energy and rape fire guitar and drum licks with something thrash never really had-melodic guitar  riffs and, dare I say, catchy vocals.  Metallica also took a quantum leap  lyrically on this record, exploring topics like suicide, war, and death.   Songs like &quot;Creeping Death&quot;, &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, and  especially &quot;For Whom the Bells Toll&quot; show how well the  combination worked.  To be sure this record has a few not so inspired  moments (Fight Fire With Fire for example), but it remains an absolutely  essential record for any hard rock fan. A true classic of the genre.
B000002KIT|4.0|I like my live albums to be truly 'live', mistakes and all. Live and Dangerous is a great album for any hard-rock fan, but many parts are not live at all. The band did extensive dubbing in the studio, thus ruining the  truly live feel of this album. Still, all of the major Lizzy hits are  here;The band plays great, and the production is good enough so you  actually do feel you are at a Lizzy concert at times. A must-have for fans  of classic hard rock.

B00004TR2G|5.0|Finally, after years of waiting, John Williams soberb score for one of Steven Spielbergs great films is presented as it always should be: complete and uncut. It is much more music from the first edition, and one  of the best things in this anniversary album is the fact that the music is  taken directly from the master tapes.    The music composed by John for  &quot;Jaws&quot; is one of the rare moments in film music history that a  score is elevated on an art level. Since Bernard Herrmann, there has never  been such a great composer, that could understand a film and capture all  its essence. Thats what John Williams does in every work he puts his hands  on, but &quot;Jaws&quot; is probably the summit of his creativity, sense of  humor and talent.    An exceptionally illustrated and carefully colorful  blue booklet comes with the CD, presenting us some exclusive stills from  the film plus a wonderful photograph of a recording session at the time of  the making of the film.    The best of John Williams, the film composer of  our time; an experience, as Laurent Bouzereau puts it on the text of the  booklet, that should make your own jaw drop!
0440224764|5.0|I have read every Grisham book and this is my favorite.  The story has  quite a bit of action which makes the book very difficult to put down.
0380788624|3.0|I had lukewarm expectations for this book and wasn't let down. Unlike his earlier books, which I think will remain timeless, imaginative, inspiring, and thoughtful (the Mouse Army in Diamond Age is one of the most inspiring  and meaningful concepts I've read and made me believe again that computers  may do something good and revolutionary for this world), this one reeks of  second hand knowledge, macho robotic characters, and cliches. The writing  is also not great, reading more or less like some casual email (too many  paragraphs starting with &quot;Anyways,&quot; among other  things.)<br />Stephenson was trying too hard and some of his examples sound  clever but are very one dimensional in that especially irritating geeky  way; the self-righteous geek arguments in this book (IE the  &quot;information highway&quot; vs TCP/IP [a transport protocol that is  irrelevant when considering the effects of the net]) contrast poorly with  Stephenson's earlier wide vision views and is along the lines of pointless  techno name-dropping. And while I'm hardly an expert on history or  cryptography, some of the information presented in the book is wrong  (Turing did not invent the Bombes) or even laughable (excuse me, I have to  boot up BeOS now so I can view some JPEGS.. yeah right). <br />If you glorify  geeks and don't have that much technical knowledge then perhaps you will  really enjoy this book but otherwise I think it is simply a sign that  Stephenson is no longer a inspired writer and must now move on to the  &quot;career&quot; stage where he is compelled by publishers to write the  equivilant of current events mini series/travelogues full of content  dictated by his fans. Not the end of the world because I'm sure he still  has lots to say but I hope he finds a way to move in a different direction  or at least drops the geek romanticism because he can be truly an inspiring  writer.
0783219733|4.0|First, I gotta admit to my partiality towards St. Bernards in particular and big dogs in general.  So, naturally, my review of this film is somewhat skewed in that direction.  Still, I think it's a wonderful film, even in  the context of &quot;family movies.&quot;  And like the title of this  review says, it's a wonderful oasis from all the other movies out there  that seek to anthropomorphize animals, rather it just portrays a dog  being...well...a dog.  Refreshing.  Grodin does a good job, I'd rank it  somewhere between &quot;Midnight Run&quot; and &quot;The Great Muppet  Caper.&quot;  And whoever trained the big lug that was Beethoven deserves  due credit, too!
B00004THAY|4.0|Let's get something straight.  I have never listened to BB King before.  I kinda like Eric Clapton, but, eh, his new stuff has been lacking something from his days with Cream.  So I picked up this album not expecting to be  very impressed.  I slipped it in on the way back from work and...I couldn't  believe it!  I could not change the CD.  I had with me 60 other CDs, yet, I  couldn't stop listening.  The music captivated me.  The CD starts out great  with &quot;Riding With the King&quot; to set the mood, then, it seamlessly  goes in and out from blues song to blues song.  I thought that some of a  few of the songs could have taken a little snip-snip, especially the ones  that were seven or eight minutes, but they were tolerable.  The interaction  between Eric Clapton and BB King is what the whole album is about.  The way  their guitars and voices bounce off each other is just sweet nectar to the  ears.  They also avoid the trap that many blues artists fall into: all the  tracks do not sound the same.  Each track is an individual, yet the whole  album, confluent.  The only criticism I have of the CD is that I think that  some of the songs could have been shorter, and a few could have used a  little bit more originality.  Beyond that, there is the fact that you will  probably not want to listen to this CD all the time.  It is an experience  to listen to, that much is true, but it is not an experience to be repeated  each day on the way to work; it's just too rich to be taken in that many  times.  Bravo to Eric Clapton and BB King, for combining talents in a way  that any other artists would not have been able to acomplish.

If you haven't seen it,  you are missing more than an experience... you are missing a new top  standard against whick compare other movies... The Matrix is imple THE  BEST!
B00001NFCY|1.0|This has got to be Pearl Jam's worst ever album...no, wait.  This is &quot;Creed&quot;.  Oh no.  First there was Milli Vanilli, now this. Whereis music going to these days when a lame  band can steal a sound  pioneered by another and all of a sudden get their videos played  on TV and  sell millions of albums?  I mean, has anyone ever actually seen the video  for &quot;Higher&quot; and actually not laughed? This band are the biggest  bunches of poseurs. Totally unoriginal and nauseating, please save<br />your  money for an Alice in Chains or  Mudhoney CD.
0679409920|5.0|The New York Times called this the best espionage novel ever.  I agree wholeheartedly.  In fact, this is one of the best novels I've ever read, period.  A great strength of this book is that you really care about the  protaganist.  He's very much your average, decent guy with a wife, step-kid  and dog.  He puts in his hours at the office each day, then goes home to  them every night, just as millions of us do.  There are no fancy gadgets or  outlandish threats to the solar system in this story.  Thus, the drama,  centering on believable characters, is all the more palpable.  Once the  story takes off you can feel the tension and anticipation buidling up all  around you.<br />The plot is both simple and ingenious.  British intelligence  suspects a mole is passing info on sourthern Africa to the Soviets and  moves to eliminate the suspect, leading to a great plot twist.  Throw in  what is for my money some of the best dialogue ever put on paper (e.g. the  hilarious conversation about malteazers candy) and the result is an  absolute classic.  I've read several of Greene's novels including the  renowned The Heart of the Matter, and The Human Factor tops my list.  If  you crave a novel that you just can't put down, this is surely it.

B000005ITX|5.0|It is a real shame that Forever Changes never achieved the notoriety it deserves.  But most rock critics and fans who have heard this album deem it among the best ever recorded.  Forever Changes evokes the dark side of L.A.  psychedelia with drug-induced lyrics, haunting melodies, lush orchestration  (on some songs) and heavy use of acoustic guitars. But this album also  rocks hard in places.  The best song is &quot;The Red Telephone&quot;, the  lyrics of which suggest that Love's leader, Arthur Lee, either took too  many drugs or suffered some sort of emotional disturbance or was so  talented a lyricist that he was able to describe the mindset of such a  person.  The next song, &quot; ... between Clark and Hilldale,&quot; jumps  out at you with horns and punchy playing as Lee employs creative phrasing  in singing about life on the Sunset Strip, telling his buddies not to wait  for him if he does not return from a night on the town, where they  &quot;always play my songs.&quot;   Not much has been said about the  musicianship on this album, but the playing is real tight and some of the  best drumming in rock history is here.  <br />I reccommend this album to  anyone who likes the psychedelic-era Beatles (Sgt. Pepper, &quot;I am the  Walrus&quot;), the first Pink Floyd album, late-60's Beach Boys or the  first Doors album.  There is as much variety on this album than any Beatles  record.  I have owned this album for 16 years and I always hear something  new when I play it.
068484267X|4.0|Obviously, and rather slyly, Frank McCourt informs us that reading about a happy childhood isn't worth our time. Geez, with all the hype about the misery portrayed in the book, I would have expected the majority of McCourt  children to be have been wiped out. Instead, the grim reaper gets only 3  out of 7, and the reader feels cheated. Okay, maybe not that cheated.<br />So,  McCourt's memoir treats us to 360+ pages of misery. Starvation.  Desperation. Drunkenness. Classism. It would all be pretty unbearable,  except that there's the sly humour poking out here and there. Can we really  trust Frank? He knows that the more miserable he can make his life the more  credibility he has.<br />He treats us to a variety of scenes, many of which  we've seen before, in, oh, Oliver Twist, Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It  All, Rachel and Her Children. It's all very fresh though. I'm willing to  give him the benefit of the doubt -- either his life was appallingly  miserable, with enough Irish charm and humour to make up for the lack of  nutritious sustenance; or McCourt himself has enough charm and humour to  repackage a few dozen literary cliches as a tragic but uplifting  memoir.<br />Either way, I'm never touching a Guiness ever again. And I'll  probably finish 'Tis pretty soon. And I'll still dock McCourt for failing  to use quotation marks -- an annoying device that fails to communicate  anything worth the reading confusion it causes.
B000002UD1|2.0|Mind Games is far from Lennon's best.  Plastic Ono Band and Imagine tower above Mind Games like the Empire State Building.  By 1973, Lennon, like much of his generation, was burning out, and Beatles fans know he was not  in the best frame of mind at this point.  The title track is good but it  sounds like the little brother of &quot;Imagine,&quot; one of Lennon's best  songs.  Another song, &quot;You are here&quot; is an undiscovered gem, but  the album as a whole is poorly-produced and the rockers sound tired.  Buy  this CD if you can find it used for a few bucks.
630349255X|4.0|I worry sometimes about films like this . . . it seems to just fuel the fire of those that would like nothing better than to return to the primitive times and live in a jungle. Then they complain about the lousy  DVD transfer! :)<br />Hrrm. This film has many beautiful and startling images,  and the soundtrack is superior to any of the others in the genre. There is  even order and serenity in the seemingly chaotic urban centers. It's a very  settling film -- not really lulling anyone into complacency, just  acceptance of the complexity of our world.<br />I can't give it five stars  because video, no matter how expertly transferred, can not do it justice.  And for the fact that it couldn't keep me from falling asleep (it may have  been doomed there, I was exhausted; it did do better than Microcosmos,  though).
B00000K19E|3.0|&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a movie about the well worn science fiction concept of virtual reality. Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) plays a leader of a rebellion in search of someone he calls &quot;The One&quot;.(This person  possesses the knowledge necessary to understand how to crack the  programming code for The Matrix) Reality as we know it is depicted as a  machine controlled artificial world where all that is experienced is  controlled and programmed by living machines that have human beings in pods  that are all connected to the central mainframe by a series of  interconnected materials.(What ever might be capable of sending  information) Life is an illusion that is presented by the Matrix. Morpheus  and a group of rebels that have escaped the Matrix, in a ship of some kind,  have pinpointed the location of Neo(Keanu Reeves) whom they believe is  &quot;The One&quot; with the knowledge. They eject him from The Matrix and  bring him aboard their ship. Morpheus begins to train Neo as to how to  fight The Matrix. While the concept for &quot;The Matrix&quot; is  interesting to an extent there are logical flaws that hurt the thought  provoking aspect of the film. One aspect has me completely stumped. In  order for virtual reality to really work wouldn't a subject(a person) need  to be unaware that they were in a &quot;virtual&quot; world. In &quot;The  Matrix&quot; there are members of the group of rebels killed while they are  in The Matrix when they voluntarily return to The Matrix. The problem is  that they are aware that they are in The Matrix. How can computer  controlled bullets and such harm you if you are aware that everything  around you is all just artificially created? As purely entertainment  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is pretty excellent but to provoke any kind of  thought process it doesn't make much sense. For entertainment value there  is a pretty great antagonistic cat and mouse battle between Neo and Agent  Smith, a virus in The Matrix out to kill Neo andsteal the mainframe access  code from Morpheus for the last human city outside of the clutches of The  Matrix. Agent Smith says his life is empty and that secret information  would let him cease to exist.(Its worth the price of admission to watch  them battle it out) All in all &quot;The Matrix&quot; needs its harddrive  to be defragmented. The various pieces don't fit that well together and  should have at least been coherent enough to fit together. The ending is  very disappointing. Watch out for the &quot;I love you&quot; so you can now  wake from the dead Neo and Trinity moment.(Trinity, an important part of  the rebel squad, a take charge woman, falls in love with Neo for no  particular reason than it was destined by the Oracle, and pulls off a  reverse &quot;Snow White&quot;) What the heck was that?(I thought when I  saw it)Ask yourself, what is &quot;The Matrix&quot;? Love it, like it as I  did, or hate it, but realize it doesn't make much sense.

0140288503|5.0|&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is one of the best examples of investigative journalism I have ever read.  I picked up the book in a bookstore and read the first few pages while I stood there.  I then grabbed a chair and read  the first three chapters.  That was it.  I was hooked.  I bought the book  and took it home.   <br />The author tells as complete a story about war as I  have ever read.  He tells of many events from two, three, or more  perspectives.  One might assume that such a tactic might wear thin, but  each perspective is so unique and offers a more complete image of the  entire battle.  I never tired of the multiple POVs, and in fact, I was  disappointed when alternative POVs were not offered for a scene.<br />I was  completely hooked on this book, reading it in the morning before work,  during my lunch break, and at night before bed.  It is that engrossing.   Many times, I found myself saying &quot;wow, that happened?&quot;, or  pumping my fist in the air and saying &quot;Yeah!&quot;, or shaking my head  and saying &quot;boy, that had to hurt&quot;.  It was all so realistically  captured, I felt I was there with the soldiers.  More than once, I was  brought to tears as I read.<br />Bowden would have been remiss to omit the  Somalians' POV, and I would be remiss to omit the fact that he handled that  task masterfully.  He didn't devote nearly the amount of time to the  Somalian point of view, but I commend him for giving me a clearer  understanding of the factors that compelled them to civil war, and battle  with American troops.<br />This is the best book I've read this year.  It's  going to be hard to top this one on my best of the year list.
014028009X|3.0|I found this a very amusing comic novel. Bridget Jones strikes a chord  with every 20-something woman I know in England and the US.

B00003CXDU|4.0|Many skits and comedians have tried to poke fun at  the finest science fiction show ever made, but this is by far the best I have seen. It is easy to make fun of something bad, but not nearly as easy to make fun of  something good, but this film was able to do that. Tim Allen was a fine  choice for the Shatner role as an egomaniac actor caught up in himself.  Alan Rickman plays a thespian who has been locked into an alien role and he  cringes whenever he hears his famous line. There was a short story from the  book Star Trek the new voyages called Visit to a weird planet revisited and  it Shatner, Nimoy and De Kelly being beamed from the enterprise set to the  real ship where they tried to play out their characters. This film is  similar to that story and just as funny. It pokes fun at not just Star Trek  fans, but all rabid fans and actors who are typecast and sometimes cannot  escape a role. Star Trek fans will get more of the in jokes, but I think  this film is funny enough that you do not have to be a fan to appreciate  it.

0451524985|5.0|This book is simply a marvellous example of true love between two persons. <br />The marriage of Sir Clifford and Constance was doomed, brought on not by  the paralysis or abstinence of sex between the two parties but that their  characters and personalities were incompatible right from the beginning.  <br />The romantic part is of course with Mellors. According to me, he was a  fine man, more cultured and deep-rooted in character and that he possessed  that unusual male strength, much more a man than Sir Clifford, with all his  riches and wealth of knowledge. WIth Clifford, it is like a show, a facade  performed and worn to please others but deep inside, it is rotten bones and  a great failure to appreciate life values. But with Mellors, he represent  fresh air and beauty that will never cease with time and age.<br />To be  frank, one has to admit that the best part of the story is Lawrence's bold  and candid descriptions of the sexual exploits of the star crossed lovers.  It's just so very beautiful to celebrate love in this fashion.<br />Whew!   What a timeless classic...
B00001U0GQ|4.0|Mix of testosterone-filled hand-to-hand combat battles and chick-flick romance... what more could one ask for in a movie perfect to watch on a first date?<br />Daniel Day-Lewis is convincing as the last of the Mohican people, despite the Irish accent that sneaks in on an occasional syllable. Wes Studi perfectly plays the malevolent and proud Magua who is a ruthless and merciless warrior.<br />The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful and the music is perfectly married to the scenes... sometimes upbeat, sometimes sanguine. The story is one of hope, virtue, legacy, jealousy and sacrifice. Sometimes violent and sometimes tender, the story is acted well enough that you often forget you're watching a film. Subtle accents such as hair that's out of place just enough to be believable make the film feel more like a voyeuristic experience in the lives of real people, even though this is a fictional story. Highly entertaining and moving, filled with a number of scenes that are simply unforgettable.<br />Not everything is tied up in a neat little bow... characters you think will (or should) die end up harder to kill than cockroaches... other characters end up dying and making you think that no major character is safe from elimination. I never read the book, so I was on the edge of my seat during most of the film.  The most memorable scenes are those containing actual Native American actors... they are fantastic and I wish more movies would have roles for this awesome group of people.

0780623134|5.0|This movie is a real masterpiece: the poetic dialogues, the protagonists' intense performance, the human values of dignity and solidarity. Andy is symbol of the concept the ancient Romans called &quot;gutta cavat  lapidem&quot; (&quot;drop digs stone&quot;). In other words, Andy waits for  the right moment to be free: he knows his innocence and is aware that it is  necessary to be careful and wisely strategic. He is like Ulysses, who  disguises himself as a sheep, in order to escape from Polyphemus' cave,  without hesitating to renounce strategically his leader demeanour, making  himself mistaken instead of a sheep. In modern culture the metaphor of  sheep resists as an idiom defining a condition of passive subjection.  Andy's condition of frustration and slavery in prison is the same.  Polyphemus (as well as the director of prison, in this movie), feels the  backs of all his sheeps, without being sharp enough to find out that  Ulysses and his friends are underneath their bellies. Ulysses' &quot;eyes  of mind&quot; are always open and allow him to save his own life.  Similarly, Andy's &quot;eyes of hope&quot; are always open, as well,  nevertheless the other prisoners provoke him fiercely and try to discourage  him. Equally, once he returned to Ithaca, Ulysses pretends to be an old  beggar, in order to enter his home without being immediately eliminated by  the suitors who tried to replace him during his absence (just as in this  movie it could happen to a prisoner who tried to escape during a moment of  desperation). He pretends to be weak and poor while actually he did not  lose his strength: he is waiting for the right moment to reveal himself and  assert his power again. The same happens to Andy, who demonstrates the  courage of the wait and the strategic attitude of a champion of chess  (another fascinating metaphor recurring in the movie). Using the last verse  of The Police's song &quot;Wrapped around your finger&quot;, &quot;Devil  and the deep blue sea behind me vanish in the air you'll never find me, I  will turn your face to alabaster, then you'll find your servant is your  master. And you'll be wrapped around my finger&quot;. It is the upright  man's redemption. Hope, intelligence, self-control and patience at last  win. A great lesson of life for all of us.
6305126062|4.0|Have you ever wanted to escape? Leave the hustle and bustle of city life behind? And do you believe things, even tragic things, happen for a reason? If so, you should truly be enthralled with &quot;The Horse  Whisperer&quot;.<br />When my younger sister first told me how she cried and  cried throughout this film and that she related to the horse....I had to  wonder! After viewing an horrific accident in the icy snow between a truck  and two young girls on their beloved horses, I saw an insight into my  sister's life I had not known. As &quot;Pilgrim&quot; ( Graces horse ) did,  my sister also felt scarred, disliked , and rebellious. See, she too had an  auto accident which left physical scars on her face and apparently in her  own psyche. This film was her catharsis.<br />This a beautifully shot  meandering journey to find oneself again. Whether you are the young girl,  the confused yet strong mother, the displaced father, the hallowed horse or  even the magically patient horse whisperer himself.<br />The crazier this  techno world gets...the more I say, &quot;Life is calling, but why can't  she whisper?&quot; Enjoy!<br />Thanks for your interest in my comments--CDS
0793927501|4.0|Seriously, I felt sorry for the bear anytime anything bad happened to it, or it got poked with a stick and hurt. Hey, the big bear was just cranky from being hungry and wanted a little snack.<br />Yes, I know I sound like a  moron. He was so cute, though. I know if I were ever confronted with a real  bear when I was not at the zoo or Northwest Trek I would either soil  myself, run like hell, or pass out, but I rented this movie to see the  bear. Seriously, I thought I would be rooting for the bear the whole movie,  but I did start to really feel sorry for the characters (though it was  funny when they were trying to climb along that log and the bear  thoughtfully decided to start jumping up and down on it trying to make them  fall off) because the script and director did such a good job of making  them likeable. Well, Alec Baldwin played a jerk, but I felt so sorry for  Anthony Hopkins' character who was trying to hold it together, and I REALLY  felt sorry for the poor injured man who got cornered by the bear and shook  around by it like he was a Beanie  baby (tm) being shook around by a  hyper-active child. Yikes!<br />Overall, this movie was quite a bit better  than I thought it would be though, and I thought it would be predictable  but it wasn't. A few twists and turns actually surprised me. Tony Hopkins  is great as usual, and Alec Baldwin shows he is still the most talented of  any of the Baldwin Bros.<br />Might want to steer clear of it if you're  already scared of bears in the first place, though.

B000002C2E|5.0|Seen the writing on the wallboard: this man is possessed.  Far away from acoustic tunes, his voice worn, weary, and depressed.  This music tumbles slowly, riding slow on the heavy words, the rhythm's snarky, jagged, and  torn down, like the best blues we've never heard.  <br />Dylan is mysterious,  slight, and curious, barely moving, moaning, or free.  He's weighed down,  seeing things unseen, going places the rest of us have never been.  Deep  voice, no market, no help.  He can't stop and take time to cry, can't sit  on the beach in the sun and fry, can't walk away and take days from the  shelf, even as it gets dark out there, because he knows there's not even  space enough to be anywhere.   <br />Is this his best?

B0000214F3|5.0|Yes, Brad Pitt's appearance in this remade version of &quot;Death Takes A Holiday&quot; drew me into this film as...well... as heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter did to Joe Black! <br />You see, &quot;Death&quot; as a person,  had never allowed himself to experience such pleasures. But when he takes  over the body of an anonymous accident victim, &quot;Death&quot; is  introduced into the lushly privileged world of Anthony Hopkins' wealthy  character including his beguilling daughter.<br />Texturally woven and  beautifully filmed, &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; allows us to see Death as a  person. As someone who doesn't like what he does, he just has to do it. And  even he has his moments of remorse.<br />Want to hear a confession?

6300182266|5.0|Well, I'm not going to boo-hoo about the lack of DVD quality or the mono sound or whatever.  I'll talk about the movie itself.  The only thing that compares to it is Star Wars itself, which admittedly opened the way for  Galactica to be put on the air, updated from a 1960s Glen Larson script  called Adam's Ark (Adam...Adama...get it?).<br />Galactica in many ways  surpasses Star Wars and certainly surpasses Return of the Jedi.  It should  be brought back as either a movie or a series, which I hear the Sci-Fi  Channel is considering a possibility.  Hopefully the powers that be will  check the reviews here at Amazon.  There are nearly 50 reviews here for  this twenty-year-old &quot;failed&quot; series!  This should have been dead  and forgotten about by 1983.  But it isn't.  There is money to be made  here, powers that be!  Isn't that incentive enough for you?  See it  dangling right there in front of you?  Go on, reach out for it.  Take it.   Mmmm...money, money, money.
B00000ILE7|1.0|I have a problem with any film that sets up as its backdrop a universe where life is cheap and said universe is ruled by corporations. This is quite obvious in the Aliens environment where it is painfully clear that  people mean nothing in light of corporate profits. In Alien and Aliens the  Wayland Yutani corporation ignored risk to life and limb so that it could  recover the alien species for their bio-weapons division. With that in mind  take a look at Alien 3, which has prison worlds. If life is so cheap in  this universe, why would anyone bother with the expense of running a prison  planet where there is no profit to be made?<br /> Alien 3 is a pretty lame  film overall, and basically a shallow reconstruction of the first film by  placing the protagonists in a more helpless position, such as being on a  starship without weapons or trapped on a prison planet without weapons, and  faced with the lurking alien menace. It opens aboard the Space Battleshup  Sulaco where, somehow, another alien has managed to secret itself on board  and damages the hypersleep capsules so that they are ejected to crash land  on the prison world, killing Hicks, Newt and destroying the android Bishop  in the crash leaving Ripley as the only survivor yet again. Oh, bravo,  guys; kill some of the best characters introduced in the series thus far.  Oh, I forgot to mention that _somehow_ Ripley is impregnated and now  carries not just a regular old alien, but one that will eventually become a  queen.<br /> The film does present some interesting features about the  creatures' biology, such as they tend to mimic features of the creatures  they impregnate. In this case a German Shepherd plays host and so the  resultant alien has decidedly canine features. However, a lot of this has  already been postulated by Dark Horse comics which capitalized on the  franchise well before this movie came out, and Aliens director James  Cameron also commented on such things in subsequent interviews after therelease of Aliens in 1986. What was most galling to me, however, was the  fact that William Gibson had been slated to write the Alien 3 screenplay,  but was dropped by Fox after he had written the a first draft. Having since  read his draft, I can't understand why. I would have figured that Fox would  have been hot to give Gibson's script a chance giving his star was rising  in 1992.<br /> Lastly we come to David Fincher the director whose only  claim to fame thus far had been music videos. Fincher suffers from the same  problems that Michael Bay (D. Armageddon) suffers from in that he shoots  his movies like they were 3 minute rock music videos, meaning he has  liberal use of people walking in slow motion and montage sequences as  though he is trying to encapsulate scenes so that they can stand alone.  Whatever. The end result as it completely fails to build suspense to little  more than the shape lurking behind the curtain. But done with cool colored  lighting and slow music.<br /> In the theater I could only breathe a sigh  of relief when, at the end, the chest burster erupts from Ripley's chest  just as she falls into the pool of molten metal. Relieved because I had  assumed that Fox wouldn't continue the franchise and leaving it dead at #3.  I was wrong, of course, but at least `Resurrection' was an apology for  their previous blunder. Makes me glad I have a lot of the Dark Horse  comics, titles like `Tribes' and subsequent Ripley/Hicks/Newt team ups take  the series in a much better direction. This film stinks on ice.

B0000065PD|1.0|You would think this hunk of barn yard droppings would have been enough to have had Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich chased out of Hollywood by quality directors and producers. But then, I just said the magic word, `Hollywood',  which means so long as the film's plot can be understood by studio  executives it is therefore suitable for consumption by the flat-line  encephalograph movie-going public. The fact that movies like Stargate get  made is proof positive that people really will watch anything. These are  also the same people who like to call movies like this `intelligent science  fiction'. Let me explain things to you: There hasn't been an intelligent  science fiction movie made since `RoboCop'.<br /> Stargate deals with the  unearthing of an large stone circle in Egypt during the 1930s, and it's  immediately shipped back the States where, after almost seventy years of  examination, the brain trust assembled to study can't tell us anything more  than it's a big stone ring. Along comes James Spader and his big brain and  figures it out in, like, five minutes. That is except for the last symbol,  which he finds on the back of a news paper that he snatches out of the hand  of a confused guard. The symbols correspond to stars, hence the first part  of the title. They quickly figure out how to open the Stargate and send a  military mission led by Kurt Russel.<br /> Okay, I worship Kurt Russel.  Sure he's short, but he's also been Snake Plisken and Jack Burton! Here he  plays his future roll from Soldier, only with more dialogue. I swear, give  Russel another six inches in height and he'd be a shoe in for Nick Fury.<br />  Spader, Russel, and his nuke-equipped, tough-as-nails, dumb-as-fence-post  soldiers step out into, well, Egypt. Well, another planet that looks  exactly like Egypt, there's even pyramids. Only they find they are now  trapped because Spader can't figure out how to reopen the gate on this end.  I also want to know when writers will come to understanda simple fact (are  you paying attention Mr. Lucas?): large deserts preclude the existence of  large desert dwelling creatures. Large creatures need gallons of water and  tons of food each day to sustain themselves, and do not run wild where the  only thing to eat for miles is sand. Aside from large sand dwelling  creatures, we also find out that all those nuts who preach pyramid power  and ancient astronauts were right! The pyramids of Egypt were built by  aliens. Really DUMB aliens, but aliens nonetheless.<br /> Why would a  culture so technologically advanced that they can build galaxy-spanning  devices like Stargates, pyramid sized space craft, energy weapons and cool  morphing armor, why would such a culture keep slaves? Societies that can do  all that usually have funky equipment to build all of their things, but I  guess monuments mean more when 20,000 sweating slaves lug thousands of tons  of stone to build your pyramid. I guess Devlin and Emmerich would assume  that the audience wouldn't pay attention to things like that, or how 20 US  Marines can be killed by two Chip n' Dale dancers in Horus head gear.<br />  Suffice it to say this movie stinks worse than a Celine Dion cover version  of Led Zepplin's `Whole Lot of Love'. It presents the characters with  unsolvable plot twists, only to have them resolved by unconvincing means  such as newspapers and graffiti on pyramid walls. The really weird part is,  the movie is now a TV show: Stargate SG-1, starring Richard Dean Anderson,  and it takes the basic premise then throws out everything else, improving  it immensely. The TV series IS intelligent science fiction, the movie  should be used to prop up your couch.
B000002NE4|5.0|For years I didn't understand Nick Cave.  This is very hard for me to admit considering how much he means to me now, but unfortunately it is the truth.  I bought several of his earlier albums over the years, and the  howling vocal assault, the crashing pianos and gothic affectations were all  lost on me, yet I could never bear to sell them.  Thankfully some part of  my subconscious kept my rash capitalistic impulses in check, because when  this record came out everything fell into place.<br />Some how this beautiful  collection of dour love songs enabled me to make sense of the earlier works  filled with a gloomy obsession with God, murder, the southern mystique.  So  this album is a world changer for me, it is filled with passionate songs  about love, faith, and uncertainty that often make me cry. It remains one  of my favorite records of recent memory, and so I am compelled lend my  voice to the choir and give this already well-reviewed record my  unassailable praise.
6304233639|4.0|Of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's three feature films, (Stargate, Godzilla, &amp; Independence Day), I hated Independence Day the least. Sure it's a colossally stupid film, but it's entertaining in much the same way  as console video games are entertaining. Turn your brain off for this one,  because you won't be using it.<br /> First, I am a self-professed fan of  Jeff Goldblum and have been since 1984's `Into the Night'. As always,  Goldblum seems to be in an entirely different movie than the one you  watching, and you wish you watching the other film instead. Second, I like  Will Smith, but I guess that's due to the fact that I think I have seen  every episode of Fresh Prince ever aired. I really like Smith's stripper  girl friend, played by Vivica Fox and mourn the fact that the film only had  a PG-13 rating. So, on to the plot (the author takes five minutes to  recover from his laughing fit).<br /> Aliens show up to Earth and dispatch  dozens of city-sized saucers down to the planet and they hover menacingly  over the major cities of the world. It is very nice to note, however, that  they completely ignore Canada, and when they finally turn Washington DC,  New York, LA, Moscow, etc. into craters, guess who's in charge, boys!  You'll be eating beaver tails and drinking Canadian beer before you can say  `Tom Green'! Anyway, Goldblum discovers that the aliens are using a binary  signal to transmit around the globe to synchronize their attack. He decides  he has to get his dad, (Judd Hirsch), and drive to DC and save his wife  and, oh, maybe warn the President (Bill Pullman), so he can tell the rest  of the US to panic.<br /> We then meet Marine Captain Stephen Hiller (Will  Smith) and his girlfriend, Jasmine (Vivica Fox) who live in LA and who also  have an alien ship hovering above their city. This would be a bad idea  under any circumstance given the total whack jobs that live in that town.  Hiller gets called back to his base and asks Jasmine to join him there  later, ensuring that she will not be turned into a charcoal brickette when  the evil aliens attack. Well, the aliens do attack, embarking on a urban  renewal campaign by leveling New York, LA, and Washington. It is at this  point that they should have rolled the credits, because races that can do  that sort of thing do not, repeat, DO NOT get defeated by primitive screw  heads like us.<br /> Nor do they get defeated by Mackintosh Power Books,  even if it is used by Jeff Goldblum. This movie makes leaps in logic that  would confound Oppenheimer. Cable TV station managers can write computer  viruses that cause the alien ships to drop their shields thereby rendering  them susceptible to missile attacks, US Marine Corps pilots can fly alien  spacecraft, and very quickly this film becomes fantasy. However, all of  that aside, it is one heck of a good romp and has its fair share of laughs.  Sure the story is plot holes big enough to drive a very large starship  through, but I expect that sort of thing from Emmerich and Devlin. It does  entertain, has great special effects and a terrific musical score by David  Arnold, so I can forgive a story that could have been written by any five  year old.
0425129608|5.0|I liked this book. I have seen the movie as well. I still found the book  to be interesting even though I have seen the movie already.
B000001IPP|5.0|Is it their best? Who knows, they all rock punx worldwide. It's .R. so it has to get 5 stars. Some insightful lyrics, Tim's background etc. Radio is in my top three .R. songs of all time. As always the various talents in the  band work together to give the best offering punk has. If you like Rancid,  OP Ivy, then you have to try Bombshell Rocks. They do rock (clever name  huh) LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
0553328255|5.0|I have read and re-read many of the stories in the book. After a while,  I'd forget what happened with the stories so it is always very fun to read  them again. It is easy to read and suspenseful. I especially liked the long  stories in there. They had some quite twisty and unexpected characters and  endings. I'd recommend this to anyone that enjoys detective type of  stories.
B000023X9W|5.0|It's like this...Neil's found another room in his voice and he's checking out the view from all the windows. Most compare this album to &quot;After the Goldrush&quot;, but I hear a little &quot;Hawks and Doves&quot; and the  faint suggestion of &quot;American Stars and Bars&quot;. &quot;Without  Rings&quot; is by far one of Young's finest new works: intoned, gravelly  and uncharacteristically baritone. The lyrics are unstrained and  unfettered. Young's guitar playing is equally unstrained, at times bright  and inventive. It's the kind of album where you can hear the wood, smell  the dust and taste the salt on Neil's fingers.
B00003CWL5|5.0|Impossible to put into words how I feel about this modren masterpiece.  The first time I saw it at a friends house,I was completely blown away.It had a profound effect on me,which is rare,beause being jaded and  cynial,nothing can really stir me up.  This movie did.The stars all  shine,putting on a marvelous show,that for better or for worse,you may  never forget.  See it tonight,and by dawn tommarrow you'll probably either  come away feeling moved,or like you just spent two hours in a blast  furnace.Wathing Lester and Carolyn bait each other ala &quot;Who's Afraid  of Virginia Woolf&quot; is a treat!Each of them deliver their lines with  gusto,and leave us laughing.Of course there's nothing funny about the  bittersweet finale...  In short,this is worth your time,especially if  you're a fan of great movies.
6305127638|4.0|Following the trail of reviews already written will give you an accurate portrait of this movie. I would like to re-emphasize that there are no extras. Trailers are not extras, they are mandatory. First Contact needed  extras to push the disc above rental status.
B000002B7O|5.0|I'm not a metalhead by nature, but when I heard &quot;Flying High Again&quot; recently on the radio, I decided to pick up the &quot;Diary&quot; CD.  Damnation, what a treat!  Not a dud track in the  whole bunch!  My faves are &quot;Flying High Again&quot; and the  mind-blowing &quot;Diary of a Madman.&quot;  That title track alone is  worth the price of admission.  Randy Rhoads' guitar playing on &quot;Diary  of a Madman&quot; is practically a religious experience.  Also, the  re-master quality is mighty fine!
B00004W19V|4.0|&quot;Short Circuit&quot; is classic memory in my mind. The film is all about the funny cute robot known as, Johnny 5. Also known as #5, the film takes place with #5 getting hit by lightning and escaping a military show  of new army robotics. While #5 stumbles on the homely Stephanie (Ally  Sheedy) she believes he is a alien, but when she see's his trademark on his  back she calls the company, then everything breaks loose as this top-secret  military machine with a lovable personality may be Public Enemy #1. Also  Starring - Steve Guttenburg and Fisher Stevens. Conatins - Some Violence  and Language.
B000002897|5.0|Had this album since it came out, can't believe that it didn't taken off but I sort of like the &quot;specialness&quot; that the lack of recognition adds. Needless to say this is a really, REALLY good album, a real warm  'laxed out feel, an alternate reality within which one finds oneself lost.  A sort of progression and improvement on &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;,  anyway - Highly Recommended.
B00000J7J4|3.0|Smooth is a nice salsa-rock song.  Put Your Lights On is a good rap-blues song.  Maria Maria is a beautiful R&amp;B song.  The Dave Matthews Band does whatever they do on this CD. <br /> Put together, this album doesn't make  much sense.  It's like a movie soundtrack to an over-budgeted over-exposed  movie.  Oh wait, it is an over-exposed media-hyped CD.  Yes, Santana is  good, yes, he deserves credit for being a great guitar player.  This album  doesn't deserve to be his masterpiece, though.  Still, his guitar can't  make a song go completely south, even if his intentions should have made  the album go south.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The DVD version of the movie is outstanding.  The packaging it comes in is really one of the best and suits the movie very well. The 2 DVDs are packed with extras, and lots of fun to browse through. Image and sound quality are  both excellent, so if you like the movie, you'll love the DVD version.  Don't miss the third 'Warning' screen when the DVD starts playing, it's  really funny - although it doesn't give you much time to read it. If you  have a DVD-ROM, take a snapshot and read it.
0671027344|5.0|Being a reader of Coupland-ish novels this book spoke to me in a multitude of ways challenging my view of the people around me. I can only tell you that this book changed the way I talk and treat those around me.  Recomended.
B000009HF2|5.0|THE BAND: Peter Frampton (vocals, guitar, talkbox), John Siomos (drums), Bob Mayo (guitar, piano/organ), Stanley Sheldon (bass).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1976) 14 songs clocking in at approximately 77 minutes. The original release was on two discs. This digitally remastered version has all tracks on one disc. Included with the disc is a 6-page foldout with a brief into by Cameron Crowe, song credits, band pictures and thank you's (no song lyrics). Recorded from a series of concerts - San Franciso, CA; San Rafael, CA; Commack, NY; and Plattsburgh, NY. All original material except for a cover of the Rolling Stones \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\". Label - A&M Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" is perhaps one of the best 'live' rock recordings... ever. This release is a testiment to the man in his natural habitat - the stage. Frampton had enjoyed only mild success with prior bands (2 albums with the Herd, and 5 albums with Humble Pie), and with his solo albums (\\"Wind Of Change\\", \\"Frampton's Camel\\", \\"Something's Happening\\", and \\"Frampton\\"). However, this live album changed everything. The 1970's were filled with some classic live releases (UFO, Kiss, Rush, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Who, Deep Purple, etc)... and I think I have to put \\"Frampton's at the top. Frampton pulled truly his best material and turned them into a legendary recording. From the opening \\"Something's Happening\\", the ballad \\"All I want To Be (Is By Your Side)\\", to the guitar solo \\"Penny For Your Thought\\" followed by the hard rocker \\"(I'll Give) You Money\\", to the 14 minute voice box marathon \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\"... there is absolutely no filler. Great sound production. A forever classic disc.
0345350499|5.0|There are very few books that I liked as much as this one.  I've tried to  read another Arthurian legend book and found it so unappealing that I  didn't even make it halfway through, and that's why I did not want to read  The Mists of Avalon when the option first came to me.  But I found it so  incredibally compelling that I could not stop reading it.  The characters  seemed so real,I felt strongly about all of them, as if I knew them.  For  instance, I found myself really understanding Morgaine and loathing  Gwenhwyfar. This book also contained all the elements of a story that  people find intriguing in life and in fantasy.  I could really feel the  characters' pain, happiness, love, and their anguish.  I never read another  book that made me feel as many emotions as that one, and I reccommend it to  anyone who ever doubted their religion or felt alone.
B000021Y74|5.0|I have seen this movie at 3 times now and I am not tired of it yet. I enjoy foreign films and alternative camera work. I especially liked the snapshots depicting the &quot;and then&quot; lives of the passerbys that  Lola encounters. The fact that this film is in German should not be a  deterrent in any way from viewing it. Most of the action is universal in  any language and dubbing is frankly very annoying. You don't want anything  to distract you from the great soundtrack  either which is also worth a  buy.
B000006TRV|5.0|There is not enough to be said about this CD. It is the soundtrack to not only a movie for the ages but also to the world that surrounds us. The songs meld together in such a way you would think the CD has only one song  with different sections. All in all it is possibly the best CD set you can  get for your money. Your senses will twirl and your head may spin but it  will all be worth to hear the wonderful sound that Pink Floyd.
B00000K31Q|5.0|When I first saw previews for this movie, I thought that it looked alright, and that it was just another movie like Can't Hardly Wait and She's All That.  Since I found those movies entertaining, I decided to  watch it.  When I finished the movie, I was completly blown away.  The  movie was nothing as I had expected it would be.  The plot was so much  better than all of those other teenage movies.  This movie has everything:  a good script, hysterical jokes, great acting, even a good soundtrack.   Heath Ledger played Patrick Verona, a typical tough guy, and it's so fun to  watch his tough exterior dissapear to reveal a sensitive loving guy.  Julia  Stiles does a wonderful portrayal of Kat Stratford, a sarcastic teenage  girl trying her hardest not to fit in.  Her sister Bianca is also well  cast, played by Larissa Olyenick.  The contrast between these two sisters  is hysterical. Cameron, a sweet guy, is played by Joesph Gordon-Levitt, and  you can't help but smile at his innocence (&quot;She kissed me!  &lt;where?&gt; ...In the car!&quot;)This movie follows the lives of these  wonderful characters, and you will come to love each of them.  Even all of  the smaller parts are well acted and funny, such as the Stratford sisters  uptight father, the hysterical guidance counselor Ms. Perky, and all of the  other high school students.  One of the best things about this movie is how  true it is.  Walk into any high school, and you will feel like you have  just walked into Padua, their school.  (&quot;Those are your basic  beautiful people...don't talk to them unless they talk to you first.&quot;)   It is very rare to find a movie that has so much humor.  Give this movie a  chance, I'm glad I did...I could probably recite the whole movie by heart.
B00003XACV|5.0|This is the first CD i have bought with music by Thomas Newman and it will certainly not be the last. I always get a little misty when I watch the end scene where everything's in black and white and the song that they  play(track 18) goes along perfectly. Buy this CD and see the movie NOW.
6300263673|5.0|I grew up with this movie it was one of the first and one of the best movies that Patrick Swayze has ever done.  People who were old enough to remember when it came out will always remember it.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is just another example of Maiden talent...no band has put out so many amazing albums as Maiden.Bruce is simply amazing hiting every high note great,all the other band members are as energetic as ever.There live  show is still simply amazing...UP THE IRONS!
B00000J7RZ|4.0|Jennifer Lopez disc is great. The best song is IF YOU HAD MY LOVE. Waiting for tonight is the english version of Una noche mas.Amar es para siempre is for the people that fell in love.No me ames with Marc Anthony is  pretty.Should've never is good and very romanyic. Es amor is beautiful in  the words.We can't forget Let's get loud a party song. Too late is good at  the same than Is not that serious.El deseo de tu amor is in Mexico the  latin version of Open off my love. Talk about us and Could this be love are  great and slow.These two are very romantic. Promise me you'll try is the  english version of Amar es para siempre. With this information we know yhat  JENNIFER LOPEZ IS JUST THE BEST.
0441003257|5.0|This may not be the best book I've ever read but it certainly is the funniest. I rarely read novels a second time, let alone more than that, but with the authors making so much fun of everything, I'd never have been able  to catch it all with just one reading. They take pokes at everything, from  fad diets to computer warranties to the self-righteous. Pratchett and  Gaiman are an inspired duo, sort of like a really warped version of Fred  and Ginger. The characters are terrific, and howling funny, and who hasn't  suspected there may be angels and demons like Aziraphale and Crowley,  perfect English gentlemen that they are, helpfully bollixing things up? If  you don't `get' English humour, or the irreverent, crazy, strange,  sardonic, or ridiculous, give it a pass. (By the way, even though I love  this book, I've never been able to finish a Douglas Adams one, and I'm not  sure what that means.)
6305546797|5.0|If you are into horror, go rent &quot;Scream&quot; But if you want a real post-modern materialistic 1970s view of small town America, see &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; If these two titles are out at the video store, I  guess you could see &quot;Halloween&quot;<br />It's Ok
B000002UZ1|5.0|first, let it be said that I feel that mentally challenged people should NOT be allowed to review albums on amozon!(review dated july 11 is a prime example). now then, this is simply a outstanding collection of incredible  music by the most incredible musical force this planet has ever known! hey  jude, a day in the life, come together, get back... every song a  masterpiece. I'd give it 100 stars if I could!
B00004RGUU|5.0|A masterful film that helped shape my view on friendship while growing up.  You can't imagine a better buddy team to play the roles of Butch and Sundance.  Newman adds his own brand of humor to the role.  This was the  movie that launched Redford into superstardom.  Redford and Newman are  super cool outlaws on the run in a non-stop cross continent chase.  The DVD  also is packed with interviews and a production feature.  The interviews  and feature give a better understanding of the many challenges the cast and  crew faced in the making of this classic film.  I especially liked Newman's  thoughts on accuracy of memories.  It is a good film for fathers and sons  or best of friends to watch.  And my fiancee said she loved watching the  very young Redford charm his way across the screen.  It is one of those  rare films that has something for everyone.  A lot of action and a lot of  heart.
B000002UDB|5.0|another classic from the masters, this one contains the fool on the hill, penny lane, hello goodbye, all you need is love, strawberry fields forever... a perfect companion piece to the also incredible sergeant pepper  that came out just prior to this. anybody who doesn't dig this just has not  got a CLUE!
0783225199|5.0|...that's what I think, and I'm sure I don't stand alone with my opinion. &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; is an absolute cult movie, its anarchic charme providing it with a fixed place in film history. John Belushi and Dan  Aykroyd as the protagonists are simply cool, their band members are  extraordinary musicians (e.g. Steve Cropper, guitar, and Donald Dunn, bass,  were members of 60's instrumental combo Booker T. &amp; The M.G.'s) and you  will meet lots of well-known actors as well. What you also get is the  probably best car-chase in film history, the total destruction of a huge  shopping mall and outstanding musical performances with appearances by John  Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway and many more. This  movie guarantees sheer delight for its audience; so if you want to have a  great time, there's no way than to watch &quot;Blues Brothers&quot;.
B00004TH83|5.0|Fabulous new star!  Really a treat to the ears.  I am so impressed with her and dare not compare her, as so many have.  She is a star in her own and has a great future.  I look forward to hearing her progress with time.   Splendid technique to her art.  I highly recommend her.  Buy it!
6304578482|5.0|Since I am a child of the 80's, I have embraced the culture of it.  I love the music, I love to laugh at the styles that were popular then, and I love to laugh at pictures of myself with mile-high hair.  <br />&quot;Romy &amp;  Michele's High School Reunion&quot; brought back a lot of those memories.   From the music to the clothes to the &quot;high-school mentality,&quot; I  laughed continuously through it.  Even my boyfriend got a kick out of it.   He doesn't normally like &quot;chick flick&quot; movies - he steers clear  of them.  However, I found him laughing right along with me.<br />This movie  also struck a nerve with me:  high school pettiness.  References to the  &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; crowd made me practically  nod my head in agreement.  <br />Romy and Michele's desperate effort to fit in  can mirror many people's experience when it comes to being liked by the  &quot;in&quot; crowd.  Their attempts to fit in and appear successful are  laughed at and announced to the whole school (this is where the old high  school pettiness comes in, even after 10 years) and Romy is devestated.   All she ever wanted was to fit in, to have others like her.  <br />Michele is  quick to remind Romy that when it came right down to it, their high school  years weren't all that bad.  She had FUN.  So, why not do at the reunion  what they should have come for in the first place?  Be themselves!  Stop  trying to impress people!  Who cares what other people think?<br />Overall,  this movie is a fun romp to liven the spirits.  The 80's soundtrack is a  must, and the 80's kitsch will bring back many a fond memory.
B00003CX5A|5.0|At first I thought this movie was going to be really stupid because I usually don't like anything Tim Burton does (I hated Edward Scissorhands), but I ended up seeing it because I do love Johnny Depp!  My friends and I  saw this in the theatre, which really adds to the spookiness of the film.  The graphics are great in this movie - the headless horseman running around  trying to kill everyone - and especially at the ending at the church scene.  I thought the movie was scary - had a hard time falling to sleep that  night - but then again horror isn't really my favorite.  In any  consolation, Sleepy Hollow is a great movie.
0312965788|5.0|You have probably heard that Herriot is heart-warming, enjoyable, and all that.  (It's all true.)  But how so? And what is so instructive about it?<br />Herriot was a small-town veterinarian who practiced for over half a  century in Yorkshire, Great Britain.  He took notes and remembered stories.  He did such a good job of it that he was able to put together half a dozen  books of his recollections.  The accumulated stories are a delightful  account of his efforts to get started in the practice, the whole gamut of  farmers and pet owners in his area, and all the little details you normally  wouldn't hear about.  What a man he must have been to have for a  grandfather.<br />The great unheralded benefit of Herriot's writing, in my  view, is for the small businessperson who has a limited number of potential  clients and who must win them over to succeed.  By seeing how Herriot  handled a certain type of customer, one can improve the way one deals with  one's own customers.  The excellent results he ultimately got while dealing  with some very tough customers in difficult situations can show the way and  inspire you to greater patience and effort.  This, in my view, is the  hidden value of Herriot.
0451169514|2.0|The original concept of the novel is quite exciting: a group of adults return to their hometown, where the nightmare of their childhood haunts their dreams once again. This idea is enriched with all of King's standard  schemes: '50s &amp; rock'n'roll, the misery of the countrylife in Maine,  children with supernatural powers and a lot of magic. This story could  occupy no more than 200 pages. Instead, the novel is unecessarily long and  boring, with imcomprehensibly extended descriptions. Some parts of it  (especially the final encounter with &quot;It&quot;) are almost silly. I  think that the author attached various pieces he had written in other  circumstances, for other works - some sort of his &quot;relics&quot;.  That's how I explain the apparent lack of cohesion. I don't say it's  uninspried, but it's certainly uninspiring. Only for King's fanatics...
6305903182|5.0|It explained what happen in Scream 1 &amp; 2 by going back in the past, and revealing the true motive. It was a great trilogy and a must have for scream fans.
B000002BUY|5.0|Incubus's first full-length effort is, without a doubt, one of the most musically accomplished releases of the decade. Incubus successfully melds the diverse sounds of metal, rock, jazz, funk, blues, and DJ scratching  into one not-easily accessible, but highly intriguing listen. The opening  &quot;Redefine&quot; sets the metal pace, but the album really picks up  with the wonderful blends that are &quot;Vitamin,&quot; &quot;New  Skin,&quot; &quot;Idiot Box,&quot; and &quot;Glass.&quot; &quot;Different  Shade of Green&quot; is one of the funnest, most radio-friendly tracks,  while &quot;Favorite Things&quot; uses multiple hooks along with tough-love  lyrics to make an attractive package. The closing tracks are a treat as  well. &quot;Summer Romance&quot; is a jazzy crooner with a surprisingly  catchy saxophone solo. &quot;Nebula&quot; mixes hard hits with trippy  interludes to keep the listener hooked, while &quot;Deep Inside&quot;  reminds fans of the very funk-rock fusion that made their EP, &quot;Enjoy  Incubus,&quot; such a listening treat. The album closes with  &quot;Calgone,&quot; that mixes just about every style of music, and this  is followed by almost 20 minutes of various sonic experiments that seems  overwhelming at first. Brandon Boyd croons and screams with authority while  Mike Eizenger squeaks away some very inventive, Morello-esque sounds out of  his guitars. Overall, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is a thouroughly enjoyable listen, and  a must for anyone that even has an inkling of interest in inventive,  progressive, and catchy music.
B00000J7S8|3.0|I appreciate Ms. Krall's efforts to continue the legacy of a jazz vocalist.  As a pianist, she soars.  Meanwhile, her voice leave room for improvement.  Her phrasing is quite bland, lacking Vaughan/Fitzgerald  vibrato and melodic exploration.  Her song choice had me longing for  variety, while her song stylings did not ameliorate this situation.  I  found myself thinking that I had listened to each song already during it's  first rotation in my player.<br />Too bad such great songs seemed  monochromatic under the light of her pale voice.  Buy if you are in the  mood for standard jazz club singer accompanied by great pianist.
6305807086|5.0|1999 was the best year in movies I can remember. granted I'm only 23 and don't have that many years to go by, but 1999 was incredible. Sixth Sense, 3 Kings, Fight Club, American Beauty, Blair Witch, etc etc. And the most  original of them all, Being John Malkovich. This movie is strange, just  plain strange. <br />A puppeteer (John Cusak) is working for a filing company  on the 7 1/2 floor of a building (yes, you read that right). He finds a  door that goes into the mind of John Malkovich. After 15 minutes, he's shot  out of John's head onto the side of the NJ Turnpike. Makes perfect sense  right? In order to enjoy this movie, you better check your rational thought  at the door.<br />Oh man, what a ride. This movie challenges everything we've  come to expect from cute little cookie cutter movies that come out of  hollywood. Thank god some people out there still have the courage to make  something completely different. I applaud everyone involved in the making  of this movie, you all rock.<br />The DVD is even stranger than the movie. The  extras here are bizarre at best, including a page with nothing on it.  There's isolated versions of the movies shown in the movie(strange), an  interview with the director(stranger), and a 15 minute car ride with an  &quot;extra&quot; as she rambles on and comes across as a complete  psycho(strangest).<br />Whew man... This package is really beyond rational  words, so buy it and see for yourself
B000021Y77|5.0|1.  The most original directing I have seen in years.  Oliver Stone tried to make this kind of movie when he made Natural Born Killers, but failed miserably.  Tom Tykwer succeeds triumphantly.  <br />2.  One of the best  soundtracks in film history.  The next time you watch this (and believe me,  you will want to watch it over and over), just listen to the music, and  watch the visuals - don't pay attention to the dialogue.  Amazing, isn't  it?<br />3.  Franka Potente is one of the most mezmerizing women I have ever  seen on screen.  You could watch this movie over and over and only look at  her face the whole time.<br />4.  This movie has the unique ability to make  things that you might normally perceive as boring so hypnotic that you  can't take your eyes off of it.  For example, who would have that a running  woman could be so interesting?  In the hands of Franka Potente and Tom  Tykwer, it is absolutely riveting.<br />For all these reasons and more, see  this movie.  I love this movie so much, and I've probably seen it well over  10 times, but at the same time it's hard to describe WHY I love it.  I've  tried to do that here, but I really can't.  You are just going to have to  see it to believe it.
B00000JCB3|5.0|I believe this is one of the best rock cds of the decade. It's lyrics make sense and you can understand what they're saying. All of the songs are great espescially Nookie, Break Stuff N Together Now and all of them.
B00003CX6P|5.0|I have to admit, I wasn't such a fan of Minghella's &quot;English Patient&quot; so I didn't expect much from &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;. But after seeing this movie four times, I have to say it's  nothing short of a masterpiece. Outstanding performances by Matt Damon,  Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, James Rebhorn, Philip S. Hoffman and Cate  Blanchett. Gorgeous Locations. A very good story and a musical swing. If  you get the chance to watch the director's commentary on your DVD, I  strongly suggest you do so, because Minghella proves that he really knew  what he was doing. It's one of the most insightful commentaries I've ever  heard.  For some it might be hard to accept Ripley as the hero or see a  homoerotic Film at all, but it's sure worth it. And it's not about  Homsexuality, it's about being someone else - &quot;being a fake somebody  instead of a real nobody&quot;. From the fantastic beginning, over the  murder of Dicky to the last shot of Tom reflecting in the mirrors:  Masterful.<br />(Take a close look at how Marge changes in the film from sunny  &amp; young to sorrowful &amp; old - and witness Paltrows best performance.  Plus: Carefully study Matt Damons expressions and wordless reactions -  they're worth buying this alone)
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns 'N' Roses burst onto the music scene like a hurricane with the release of Appetite For Destruction.  The band members were in constant turmoil with one another and it's this combustible atmosphere that help  create some of the most aggressive, angry, unapolegetic music ever made.  With it's driving guitar riff and pounding drums, &quot;Welcome To The  Jungle&quot; opens the album and sets the overall tone.  &quot;Nightrain&quot; &amp; &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; deal with the band's  alcohol and drug addictions.  &quot;Out Ta Get Me&quot; deals with their  paranoia and &quot;My Michelle&quot;, &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; &amp;  &quot;You're Crazy&quot; sum up their feelings toward women.  &quot;Sweet  Child O' Mine&quot; and &quot;Paradise City&quot; are my two favorites on  the album and they show glipses of the band's softer side.  The former is  suprisingly a beautiful ode to the love of a woman and the latter is a  about going to a utopian like community.  In the 13 years since it's debut,  there hasn't been an album released that has rocked harder than this one.
B000002I77|4.0|I PUT OFF GETTING THIS CD FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS AFTER I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M NOT A BIG JAZZ FAN, BUT I RUN A CD STORE AND ONE DAY I DECIDED TO POP IT OPEN AND LET ONE OF THE OTHER EMPLOYEES HEAR ONE OF THE CUTS FROM  THE TOMMY BOLIN BOX SET (QUADRANT 4) THERE WERE ABOUT THREE CUSTOMERS IN  THE STORE, AFTER THE THIRD CUT A GIRL IN HER 20'S CAME UP AND WANTED TO  KNOW WHAT WE WERE PLAYING AND BOUGHT OUR ONLY COPY, THE ONE WE WERE  PLAYING, BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE TO HEAR THE ENTIRE ALBUM. SO I HAD TO WAIT  ABOUT A WEEK TO HEAR THE REST OF IT AND I PURCHASED IT SOON AFTER.  GREAT  DRUMS, KEYBOARD AND OF COURSE THE BEST GUITAR PLAYING FROM TOMMY BOLIN.  HE  SMOKES ON THE SOLOS AND TRADES OFF WITH COBHAM ON DRUMS TO PRODUCE A TRUE  JAZZ/ROCK FUSION EFFECT.  I'M STILL NOT MUCH OF A JAZZ FAN, BUT THIS IS ONE  ALBUM THAT WILL NEVER LEAVE MY COLLECTION.   NOW IF ONLY I COULD GET MY  HANDS ON A COPY OF &quot;MIND TRANSPLANT&quot; AND &quot;MOXY&quot; MY  TOMMY BOLIN COLLECTION WOULD BE COMPLETE.  ENJOY!
B00003CWPR|4.0|Let me first complain. How in the name of god are we the only country in the world who had to watch a CENSORED version of this movie? Does that make sense to anyone else here? And we're not even trusted enough to handle the  uncensored version on DVD. I would give it 5 stars had I been given the  credit to handle a little nudity. Movie aside, these are the reasons I hate  the MPAA. Before I get on with my review, let me say it again. WE, IN  AMERICA, LAND OF FREE SPEECH, ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHO HAVE TO  WATCH A CENSORED VERSION OF EYES WIDE SHUT.<br />This movie was incredible,  strange, but incredible. After I saw it, I knew it would flop, because the  public at large is too busy watching Armageddon and Godzilla type  movies(Not that they're not fun to watch, but they're not good  movies).<br />Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman both do excellent jobs here, and as  usual Kubrick is on top of his game. This movie is though to watch,  uncomfortable, and that's exactly how it should be. It's a 5 star movie, no  doubt about it. If I didn't like the movie so much I'd give it less stars  because of the censorship, that really bothers me, and I'm suprised it  doesn't bother more people.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I noticed some people on here saying that this movie lacked the soul of the other trilogy.  Let me just say: that was a TRILOGY.  The last time you watched Star Wars IV, did you watch Empire and Jedi soon after that?  Since  we can't see the other two films of this trilogy, all we can do is assume  what's going to happen: Palpatine's rise to Emporer, the Clone Wars, the  marraige of Anakin and Padmé, Anakin's fall to the dark side, and the birth  of Luke and Leia.  Aside from what we know of the story, we can't truly see  the spirit until the entire trilogy is released (probably 2005 or 2006) and  we can watch them all together, as a trilogy.  I still like Jedi the most  out of the trilogy, then Phantom Menace, then A New Hope.  I liked Empire  the least.  If you're a Star Wars fan at all, I think you'll enjoy it.  It  just didn't live up to all the media hype.<br />Now, a trilogy of the story  after Jedi would be good; The Truce at Bakura (a book), Grand Admiral  Thrawn in the Heir to the Empire trilogy (by Tim Zahn), and the Jedi  Acadamy Trilogy.  They should make those into movies.  Maybe by 2010.
0812550706|5.0|I would rate this as one of the best of hundreds, or thousands,of sci-fi books I have read. Start it on a Friday night as you will not put it down until done, really. The more you reread it, the more you see in the book.  The  personalities, philosophies and feelings of the characters are  superbly created and Card lets them grow.  This book is right up there with  'Stranger in a Strange Land'. Enjoy.
B000001Y79|5.0|No Doubt came from out of nowhere to reach the top of the charts with this ska-tinged cd.  The album is a therapy session for lead singer and main songwriter, Gwen Stefani.  She and bassist Tony Kanal were a long time  couple and just prior to starting work on the album they broke up.  Gwen  wrote many the songs about the demise of their relationship.  &quot;Excuse  Me Mr.&quot;, &quot;Hey You&quot;, &quot;End It On This&quot;, &quot;Happy  Now?&quot;, &quot;Don't Speak&quot; &amp; &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; all  deal with Gwen's hurt over the break up. In songs like  &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Just A Girl&quot;, &quot;The Climb&quot; and  &quot;You Can Do It&quot;, Gwen is trying to cope with life after the  breakup and her anger towards Tony. Matthew Wilder, who was a one hit  wonder in the 80's, tempers the heavy ska music the band played with a more  accessable sound. The songs are about the hurt and anger of a broken  relationship, but the music has a bright and sunny feel to it.  In the  tradition of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, the tensions between former lovers  create great music.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Although still not QUITE approaching the absolute greatness of Bruce Dickinson's &quot;Accident of Birth&quot; and &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot;, Maiden's &quot;Brave New World&quot; is an amazing album.  Surprisingly, Bruce's voice and Adrian Smith's guitar are less  &quot;perfect&quot; here than in Bruce's solo albums, and the music sounds  more like &quot;Virtual XI&quot; (but much better) than like  &quot;Powerslave&quot; or &quot;7th Son&quot; (Bruce solo sounds much more  like that, by the way).<br />Also, like other reviewers have said, this album  is a breath of fresh air amongst all the music-for-teenage-girls (from boys  bands to Britney Spears to Marylin Manson) CRUD that is played on the  radios for 99% of the time.<br />Finally, I have seen Maiden live in Vilar de  Mouros, Portugal, 3 days ago (16 July 2000) and it was one of the most  amazing experiences I've ever had. The band has a lot more energy than in  the 2 times I've seen them with Blaze, and Bruce &quot;Scream for me,  Portugal!&quot; Dickinson is possibly the greatest frontman of all time.
B000005HBI|5.0|This album makes a deep impression. It is a very memorable listen. I have never heard a singer dig so deeply into relatively simple Delta blues melodies and find such riches. She has made the cover tunes her own, which  is what a fine jazz artist does. Sit back and focus on the album. It is not  the type of album that makes an impression if repeatedly listened to as  background noise for one's activity. The thoughtfulness and richness of her  interpretation leads one to easily see the reverence she has for the music.  What is amazing is how she blends reverence with her contemporary  inclinations so that her interpretations don't render these tunes dusty  museum pieces.<br />I would like to say something critical about Wilson  however. When I saw her live (only once however. could've been a bad  night), she failed to make an impression on me and, I felt, the bulk of the  audience.  I find that she is too laid back in a live setting and, as a  result, she comes across bland and lacking intensity. The studio picks up  on her vocal and interpretive intensity and nuance far better than the live  stage does.<br />However, listen closely to this album the very first time you  listen to it and you will be moved. Thanks
B000002UJQ|5.0|Simply put, 'OK Computer' is a masterpiece. It certainly does not come easily. It is a painstakingly produced and carefully formed work of art. Lead singer and primary songwriter Thom Yorke has described it as a series  of &quot;polaroids of my brain&quot; - a telling analogy when you consider  the extremist views being projected in the complex lyrics. Most people  don't seem to understand the lyrics on first - or even tenth - listen. Like  the music, they must be given time. The words, which paint a picture  vividly described in the thinly veiled visions of an apocalypse brought  about by technology, make perfect sense in an inexplicable way. As anyone  who has read interviews with (or even seen the website of) this truly  remarkable band can see, they have strong opinions which express a  tiredness with society's inability to fulfill.<br />The album is kickstarted  by the huge-sounding guitar riff of 'Airbag', an undescribable that even  includes an Egyptian-sounding instrumental section. It is followed by what  is inarguably one of the best songs ever written - a 6-and-a-half minute  epic in three parts that recalls Queen's earlier 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.  Through the strange 'Subterranean Homesick Alien' and heartfelt ballad  'Exit Music', the groundwork is laid. 'Let Down' and 'Karma Police' are a  duo of excellent songs; 'Karma Police' being the standout, with its  beautiful piano and haunting melody. 'Electioneering' is a pointed hard  rock song, while 'Climbing Up The Walls' is a terrifying (yet beautiful)  nightmare that is soon relieved by the calm 'No Surprises', the first song  from the last trio of slower songs. These should not be ignored, however:  some of the most melodic music on the album is in these last three. The  lyrics of the last song, 'The Tourist', become a circle with the lyrics to  'Airbag', thus linking the album in a unique way.<br />Radiohead is truly a  once-in-a-lifetime band, and this is their masterpiece. It's doubtful they  can top this with their next, the questionably named 'Kid A'. But who knows  what Yorke, Greenwood and co. have in store for the unsuspecting public...
B00004RFDW|5.0|This film is one of the most compelling, breath-taking, intense films I've seen in a long while.          The film the Insider revolves around a scientist who had been formerly working for the &quot;big tobacco&quot;  industry but quit; and although the tobacco company he worked for allowed  him to quit they did force him to take a vow of secrecy to remain silent  about anything going on within the tobacco industry that he might know  about. However, Wigand opts to put himself and his family on the line in  order to expose the sick truths behind &quot;Big Tobacco.&quot; <br />   In  order to be able to expose &quot;Big Tobacco&quot; Wigand is contacted by a  journalist working for  60 Minutes named Lowell Bergman, who is willing to  set up an interview between Wigand and 60 Minutes alum Mike Wallace (played  believably by Christopher Plummer). However &quot;Big Tobacco&quot; will  stop at nothing to stop Wigand and Bergman. <br />   The performances in The  Insider are nothing less then stellar. Crowe gives a fantastic performance  as Wigand, which in my opinion was a performance very worthy of an oscar.          Al Pacino gives an excellent oscar worthy performace as well as  journalist Lowell Bergman, and another excellent performance by Christopher  Plummer as Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes, (he was very believable).      So if  you're looking for an intense thriller, The Insider won't dissapoint.
0393317552|4.0|Why did Europe conquer the New World so easily?  Why didn't the older populations Africa dominate the world?  Why did some civilizations advance quickly and some remained &quot;primitive&quot;?  Why did the Europeans  develop the printing press instead of the more civilized Chinese?<br />This  outstanding book answers the questions that nag us about why the world is  the way it is.  Diamond backs his opinions with clear data on why and when  advances became available.  <br />This is a must-read book for anyone with any  interest in anthropology and why things are the way we are.
6304712936|5.0|Easily the best movie of 1984, it is difficult to put your finger on just one word to describe your emotions as you watch it. That is probably the reason for it being such a powerful movie.<br />The character Salieri is an  Italian composer in the court of the Emperor of Austria. All is well until  Mozart appears. It is obvious to Salieri that Mozart has been given great  musical gifts. Salieri is filled with rage, envy, and at the same time,  admiration for Mozart. &quot;Amadeus&quot; is as much about Salieri as it  is the more famous composer.<br />This being a movie about Mozart, there is of  course going to be an excellent soundtrack accompanying the movie.  Especially well done is the splicing of Mozart's death requiem into the  scenes when Salieri is driving Mozart to his death.<br />This movie is  guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat. How could that nice old  man who tried to kill himself be so mean?
B00000J7JO|4.0|The CD is excellent, but I spent about 20 minutes crawling all over my stereo system looking for loose wires and such until I moved the CD and realized that some of the songs are not recorded as cleanly as they might  be.  This isn't enough to prevent me from enjoying the CD, but be fore  warned when you crank it up!
0688062334|5.0|Not being much of a fantasy fan, I definitely recommend this book.  It is well written, incorporating humour, adventure, mystery, and a good dose of a very talented writer with the knack of making her charaters come to life.   I discovered this book in the library in 4th grade and immediately I fell  in love with the characters. Years later, not remembering the title or the  author, I went on a hunt.  And found it!   I was pleasently surprised to  discover that it held the same majic that it did when I was a child.  To  any one reading this: this is a special book that I will always treasure.
0440219078|4.0|I thought the book was pretty good it was unique and veryinteresting.The plot was good to because it was perfect for thestory.The characters were so interesting and so not like the people of today.The whole story to me was the making you feel thankful for what you have and if things were always perfect it doesn't mean it would be a good thing.Over all it was an amazingly interestibg book.
006016848X|5.0|Some people just don't get that books like _Men are from Mars_ AREN'T for everyone.  It even SAYS so in the introduction to the book!  However, for those people that can glean information from a chapter without thinking  that everything MUST apply to them, this is a must-read.  I'd recommend  going to the library and skimming first, then purchasing for a deeper read.  Not everything in this book applied to my girlfriend and I, but enough did  to help our relationship GROW beyond what I ever expected.
B000002NC4|4.0|judging their last work as a template to this album is like taking a raw block of marble and setting it next to any of Michellangelo's fantastic sculptures.<br />that's not saying that 'There's nothing wrong with love'  (their last album for those not too knowledgeable about the band) is any  less beautiful than this album is - they're just different beasts.<br />TNWWL  is an indie pop lover's delight - insanely catchy hooks with enough low-fi  aesthetics to keep a never-ending smile on your face. PFNO is the viscal  opposite - harsher, darker, more abrasive and, here's the kicker -  ambient.<br />imagine taking their best 2 minute pop songs and adding about 4  minutes of subdued guitar theatrics on it and you've got 'Perfect From Now  On'. it's their answer to the ego-driven prog-rock movement - albeit with a  more psychedelic twist.<br />your milage might vary with this record. the  genius behind it is undeniable - it's up to you whether to accept it  though.
B000004286|5.0|It's funny how such a mediocre movie can have such a great musical score.  Fortunately the music in Braveheart makes it bearable to watch.  <br />This soundtrack is simply amazing.  If you're into movie scores, go and buy this  right now; otherwise you will be missing out on some of the best movie  music ever.  I have always been more into action musical scores such as  those of Hans Zimmer, and yet I still find this traditional soundtrack by  Horner amazing and captivating.  The main theme is repeated many times, but  it never gets boring.  <br />Horner also has two other great scores: those of  Titanic (I guess he's got a thing for making great music for stupid movies)  and Glory.  Of the three, however, Braveheart is my favorite (although my  favorite movie of the three is Glory).
B00003CWL6|5.0|When I first saw this movie- I hated it!  Over and over; I appoligized to my mom for taking her to see it.  It was my treat. It intriqued me that the so call &quot;typical American culture&quot; gave this movie so many rewards and dared to call its content &quot;beautiful&quot;.  The movie was  well done and portrayed a reality often disguised in this society:  What  really goes on in our minds and what has the typical American family  become? I like this movie because it shows a truth that is often ignored  and rarely mentioned.  SEX.   True, today we are more open to talk about  it.  However, we do not dare to share the gross and unaccepted thoughts  that linger in our minds. This movie gives an example of what may happen if  those thoughts were played out.  It doesn't surprise me what does happen.   What surprises me and horrifies me is that people would look at this movie  and venture to follow it. A sollution movie needs to be done.  This movie  tells us what happens if we dwell on the sins the mind chooses to capture  enough to live them out.  American Beauty warns us what ugliness looks  like.  The only beauty in this movie is that it brings the truth of the  mind out into the light. I'd recommend this movie not as entertainment, for  it is quite distrubing to watch, but as a piece for serious discussion on  some of the key issues that plague our society today. This movie is  inappropriate for those under 13 and needs a parent for those under 18 or  those who are not married.  If you are addicted to sex, the sexual content  may cloud the real issues of this movie and I'd advise you not to see it.   Men: be careful to guard yourself while seeing this film- it is quite  intense.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This is a great cd. It has incredible beats and amazing lyrics. She has definately grown as an artist without straying from her pop beginnings. My personal favorite song is Lucky the story of a famous actress who has  everything but love. It does sound cheesy I know but it really shows people  that you can have so much money and fame but you can still be lonely. I  think Britney is a great influence for girls today because she went for  what she wanted but she still stayed close to her family and is a humble  small town girl. Here's to you Britney!
0425173895|5.0|This is my favorite Agatha Christie book because in most her books, the first chapter is a bit confusing-not in this one!  This is a perfect murder mystery.  there are so many twists in this book.  The reader really gets to  know the killer.  I ended up feeling sorry for the killer at the end of the  story.  The ending is totally unexpected as well.  This is a really  gripping book.  I recommend it to everyone.
B00001XT76|5.0|There've been some great ones, but to me, nothing can surpass &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; as the sweetest love story of the century.  The theme is age-old, a depiction of a maturing college-bound young woman, Frances  &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman (Jennifer Grey), who falls seriously in love with  her dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze).  So, what makes this  film so different?<br />First released in the eighties, I loved it, but didn't  fully appreciate what Grey had gone through to pull it off.  Professional  dancers, instructors, recently told me that at the start of film  production, she was a good dancer --- but that's all.  However, through  intensive daily training and mind numbing determination, she became, in a  matter of months, a world class dancer --- a near impossibility.<br />   It's  Grey's personal attributes that come shining through as Baby depicts a  beginner who has exactly one week to master the elusive Mambo.  The scenes,  some hilariously funny, others poignant and touching, are accurate and  wonderfully portrayed.  I mean, it's not just the script that makes a great  film: where would Casablanca be without Bogart ---- or The African Queen  without Hepburn?<br />  You can't help falling in love with Baby, she's so  fresh, so vivacious, and, in the finale, dances so beautifully that your  heart is captured forever.  Everyone I've met who's seen the film loves it  and all own both the DVD and the CD soundtracks.<br />   If you haven't seen  it, do so now --- you won't regret it.  It's a film you'll watch over and  over, one love story that will never grow old.  (DVD)
B000002KZ6|5.0|...they're all brilliant. <br />Though am I the only one to notice that this is a completely different record from the 1983 vinyl release? Every song is longer and more fleshed out than the original release (as if it's a  director's cut of a film), so those who have this on vinyl or tape only  from the '80s are in for a surprise with this on disc. Weirdest part is  there's no reference to it being re-mixed, etc. Oh, David.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD AND EVERY SONG ON IT.I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE OF THE SONG &quot;ARMS WIDE OPEN&quot;
B00000J8EK|4.0|As a fan of electronic music, I shy away from Dance Happy &quot;techno.&quot;  I prefer musicians like Autechre and orbital who are concerned with composition instead of booty shakin'. However, my booty  needs to rock occasionally,and I'll be happy to shake it to Surrender.        A lot of this album reminds me of Daft Punk(under the influence,  surrender..) but it also has some more complicated songs like Sunshine  Underground.  In fact, the variety of songs is probably what I love about  this album. Despite this variety, most of the songs also share a uniting  feeling of glittery euphoria.  The cover art portrays this feeling  perfectly.  However, several songs, &quot;out of control&quot;  specifically, seem to stray from this focus, and keep the album from being  5 star material.  &quot;Out of Control&quot; is not a bad song, it just  seems out of place.  Still, there are some 5 star songs here.  I don't care  what anyone says, &quot;Let forever Be&quot; is an amazingly uplifting  song.  It may sound sort of like setting sun, but It seems completely  different in its overall effect.  &quot;Sunshine Underground&quot; is also  remarkable.  People seem to loathe &quot;Asleep from Day&quot; but I think  it works very well in this album.      THis is my first Chemical Brothers  album and perhaps this is the reason I enjoyed it.  The people who dislike  it seem to constantly be comparing it to the other albums.  This always  seems to lead to dissapointment. GOing into this album without any  expectations worked out for me, so if you are looking for an introduction  to the chemical brothers, I would recommend this.       So basically this  is an excellent album that is only flawed by an occasional lack of focus.
6305903182|2.0|Ok.. let me lay this down for you <br />Scream 1- Great... orginal, funny, suspenseful and one of the best movie twist in the past decade.<br />Scream 2- Not bad... Being released after movies like Urban Legend, I know what you  did... this movie takes second chair to teh genre. Its hard to scare people  once again with the same old tricks. Ending had somewhat of a nice twist.  Saddened by the loss of Randy.<br />Scream 3- Not good... OK i will give them  some points here. One, i like the fact that they gave the killer more of a  variety of killing methods.. the chasing with the knife is old. Two, It was  nice to see that people in this movie are using those things you hear so  muc habout...what are they called..OH YEAH guns. Three, I liked the idea of  the voice changer but the conception that someone could get a hold of  something like that or that something like that could exist at all is  stupid. Me being a audio editor can tell you that for that to work it would  have to be Scream 3000. and Four, i enjoyed the jay and silent bob  part.<br />But the ending was stupid as all hell. For a killer premise to work  as shocking you have to build up something with that. The first killers  were great... you loved them.. you were shocked that it was them. The  seconds killers, yes one being very predictable, but the second a nice  added touch. You see so little of the killer out of mask in this movie that  when he takes of the mask you go. &quot;Who that hell is this looser&quot;  Then the story behind him just seems to pop out of mid-air.<br />I have to  give the Scream movies something. They remain a constant. Getting worse as  they go on. I am gald that there will be no more. Its a disgrace to the  first movie to have such bad sequels.<br />I am sorry i have yet to see a  scary slasher film in my entire life. There is a difference between scared  and shocked. And Scream one was the only one to shock me.

B00000BKDX|5.0|So few compilation albums choose the good songs, and with a catalogue as extensive as Maiden's it is a very difficult task.  They have done an excellent job here.  The best, most high energy songs from their first five  albums are all here as performed during their '84-'85 &quot;World Slavery  Tour.&quot;  Albums like this are supposed to have 2 functions: 1.A best of  compilition to hook new fans into their music (for some reason i still  prefer to start listening to any band by gettting a normal, studio album,  and i recommend number of the beast for potential MaidenHeads).  2.To  showcase the musicians energy live, with songs that fit for the big, arena  feel (and they have done one hell of a job with that,) which by the way,  acomplishes a third feet for Maiden: their frist two albums featured Paul  d'anno on vocals, now they have bruce dickinson, so: 3:Bruce upstages Paul  with his own old songs...the comparison is like Lucionno Pavorotti vs. a  man with lung cancer.  Bruce should get his lungs insured.  Best songs: all  of them.

B00000BKDZ|4.0|All of the songs on this album are connected to form one main story (that's called a concept album for all of you alterna-dorks out there) about a man with supernatural powers.  Supposedly it was based on a story  set in colonial America but I've never actually heard of it.  That's  besides the point, we love Iron Maiden for all of their pomp and pretense,  and this is the album that pushes those limits.  Some of the songs here are  among my personal maiden favorites, such as &quot;the evil that men  do&quot; and &quot;moonchild,&quot; but as a whole it wears you out a bit  too much.  Trust me, this is an awesome album, but it is...well, so  awesome, that you really won't want to listen to it everyday.  Also, the  songs have a more than usual continuity in sound, which makes for a good  concept album, but does kind of blend many excellent songs into a seemingly  blur of one hour of high key Maiden Madness.  For those just getting into  Maiden, GET NUMBER OF THE BEAST FIRST, if you start with this one you might  be intimidated...but for anyone who becomes a Maiden lover, you have to  have this album.
B000001IMX|5.0|this band sounds great. if you like nofx's 1984 debut then this is the cd for you. i only wanted a pepsi.
B00000G6TL|5.0|This album has an amazing collection of studio songs sung by Deep Purple for the past 30 years.Starting with 'Hush' - from their 1st album through 'Any Fule Kno That' - from their latest album Abandon released in 1998.It  features almost all of their popular songs Highway Star,Burn,Child In  Time,Smoke On The Water,Perfect Strangers.Well now the only minus point is  the version of Child In Time ,after listening to the live version this  would appear too short.But this is not going to stop me from giving 5 *s  .....Its a must buy for any Deep Purple fan .....
0792840461|5.0|I have been a fan of Steve McQueen since I saw The Great Escape, and this is one of the best caper films i ever saw. The split screen effect adds a new dimension to the film. And the romantic chess scene is now a  classic(Mike Myers spoofed it in Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me). The  combination of McQueen and Dunaway is perfect for this film. This is a must  see for all McQueen fans. And the recent remake with Pirece Brosnan is as  good as the original.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have just read the following on DVDTalk: &quot;Talk about making an impact! We just received news that Disney has put the DVD release of Princess Mononoke on hold &quot;in anticipation of the availability of the  original Japanese language track and possible additional bonus  materials.&quot; We did it!  Together we influenced one of the biggest  studios in Hollywood! Congrats DVD talkers!&quot;  I hope this information  is exact and that Princess Mononoke will finally be released with the  original japanese track and english subtitles in addition to the dubbed  version. I have already preordered my copy at Amazon. If this information  is false, I can always cancel my order, but there really still seems to be  hope for anime fans...
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was an overall great book. I have read it three times over and for me that is a big deal because i can't read any book over. It totally keeps my attention and i think it is a great  reference for anyone starting High School. Ther story of Charlie and his  friends is simply incredible and it shows how you still can have fun and  enjoy life even if you're not in the &quot;popular&quot; crowd. I would  recommnend this book to anyone.
0790751240|3.0|Eastwood stars in the watchable comedy about a bounty hunter who is sent to bring in a woman who is on the run from her husband and his band of racists. This is a poor attempt at comedy for Eastwood. Watch for Jim  Carrey in his second Eastwood film(the other being The Dead Pool) he plays  the Vegas Comic.
6305470464|2.0|A good cast in a waste of a story. Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart and Gillian Anderson, Ryan Phillipe and Angelina Jolie, Anthony Edwards and Madeline Stowe are all couples with their own stories, Jay Mohr  is a dying son and Ellen Burstyn is his mother, and Dennis Quaid is ?.  These characters and their stories all come together, but it takes so long  to get to the narrative's ending that I didn't care less what happened to  anybody. Stewart and Anderson are bright spots, and Jolie is promising.  Mostly though, a waste of time.
0375707972|3.0|I thought The Reader from Bernard Schlink has a great narrative quality  although and as one of the other reviewers mentioned it is not just a story  it is a man growing to accept life, love and himself. I thought it was a  bit too short and not as in depth as I usually like but all over a great  read espeacially if your introducing yourself to Holocast and German  Novels.
6303367518|3.0|Meryl Streep does an action heroine turn as Gail, a river guide in an unhappy marriage to David Sraithairn. For a change of pace, they hit the waters, where the family is forced to aid two runaway criminals (Kevin  Bacon and John C. Reilly). This is a very different role for Streep, and  she manages to make it fit and seems very believable. Bacon is somewhat  threatening, and the river action scenes are all very good. BUT, this movie  gets bogged down by the hokey plot contrivances (their dog who happens to  magically appear at precise moments, Ranger Johnny (Benjamin Bratt, before  Law &amp; Order) and other plot holes. Good, but could have been a much  better story.
B00004VVNE|5.0|I sat my wife down to watch this film. She was kinda interested because I was - she was being polite. For the first 10 minutes she was bored, the next 10 minutes mildly interested. For the final hour or so it was  impossible to pry her off the couch.<br />This thirty-something year old  classic has suspense the way it should be done. <br />Without spoiling the  film, it is mid-Cold War and the Americans have had a mishap - a squadron  of bombers are on their way to Moscow.<br />Originally done live, the  performances are electric - Peter Fonda as the President and a VERY YOUNG  Larry Hagman as his Russian Translator show the stress of the  situation.<br />If you know people who are too young to have had the fear of  Nuclear War show them this film. Buy it - it is emotional no matter how  often you see it.
B00000IO4I|4.0|Charming film about L.V. (Little Voice), a meek-voiced, shy British woman who enjoys singing the music of Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and others. Her mother, a sex-crazed record store owner, and the agent Ray Say (a  terrific Michael Caine)both attempt to manipulate her into stardom. This is  an interesting, charming, and funny movie which takes some interesting  turns along the way. Jane Horrocks, as the title character, is terrific,  and sings her own songs beautifully. She is incredibly talented, and the  movie is a charmer. Look for a nice performance by Ewan McGregor as L.V.'s  wanna-be beau.
6305897786|4.0|I have just viewed the film ,&quot;The ninth gate&quot; and I thought it was great.  I bet you're wondering why I only gave it three stars if it was so great. Well, it really was great.  There some were strengths and  weaknesses.  Let me explain.<br />        To begin with, The Ninth Gate had  its strengths.  1. It had a very original and creative plot.  2. Fun,  entertaining, and suspensfull.  3. just flat out GREAT!and thrilling<br />       In addition to The Ninth Gate's strengths, there were weaknesses.  1. Not  a concluding ending.  2. A character's role was unexplained.  3. Did not  xplain how the ninth page was missing.<br />   Well, from these 6  descriptions, it may not explain what you wanted to know or find out.  But  there is a good way to find out what I am talking about.  Maybe.....See the  movie!  I hope that this review was of some help to you or inspired you to  see the film.  And believe me, thi film is a great way to spend 2 hours and  3 minutes.  Take my word for it.
B00003CX95|5.0|This movie was great.  I've watched my VHS copy so much its worn out(cant wait for the DVD). As far as the Historical &quot;inaccuracy's&quot; go, it was accurate enough for me to base my Senior paper on, and who watches a  movie of historical facts anyway? In closing -- BUY IT! WATCH IT!.  Peace
B000002L6P|5.0|Frankly, this album could be renamed 'greatest hits' or something along that line. This was the second album Madonna put out and contains 9 songs that are just as pop-rific today as the day they were released.  Case in  point, I was listening to this Cd when I took my nieces to their dance  class. Afterward, at dinner I heard my niece humming 'Shoo-Bee-Doo'. The  songs on here are catchy, witty and just plain fun. Along with the title  track, you have the Madonna standards the 1980's inspired 'MATERIAL GIRL',  the sugary sweet 'ANGEL', the sexy, swank 'DRESS YOU UP' and the power  ballad 'LOVE DONT LIVE HERE ANYMORE&quot;. You also get the perky,  motovational 'OVER AND OVER' and my personal fave, the somber,  introspective 'SHOO-BEE-DOO'. As you know, this is classic Madonna. Even  the pictures for his album are timeless. The cover art is simple black and  white, yet utterly sexy beyond belief. This is Madonnas best work as the  Queen Of Pop.
015650300X|5.0|than seeing this book in the children's section at the store!  Even Amazon recommends this story for &quot;9 to 12 year-olds&quot;.  What nonsense.<br />A beautifully moving story to illustrate a sound and healthy  philosophy.  A friend of mine, who enjoys philosophy, recommended that I  read &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;... OK, a little  convoluted, but OK... I, in turn, recommended Le Petit Prince, which can be  read in an hour and is far less taxing on the brain.<br />If you have already  perfected the simple way of life put forth in this book, then you have  every right to condemn my previous statement- but I don't think that very  many people have attained that level of &quot;Zen&quot;- or whatever you  want to call it.<br />A l'elite restreinte
B00001NFCY|1.0|Unfortunately for Creed's musical maturity...they won't experience it.<br />A far better version of this album exists...it is called Ten, and it is by a humble little seattle quintet known as Pearl Jam...<br />The problems with  this release are numerous. The catchy guitar hooks and repetitive choruses  serve to irritate true fans of grunge. Stapp's voice was pleasant on My Own  Prison; he had a rich baritone, which has since become hoarse and grating  as he valiantly attempts to imitate Eddie Vedder. With Arms Wide Open is a  blatant rip-off of PJ's Release, but what makes the rip-off all the more  sad is that, while Release was a spontaneous jam session by the PJ boys,  Stapp et. al. had to really sit down and THINK about their song before they  &quot;created&quot; it. And of course, lacking Mike McCready's spontaneous  giutar noodling, this album's gitars sound engineered, at best. My advice?  Go buy Pearl Jam, STP, and Alice In Chains.
B00003CXAR|5.0|Jaws is a movie that should have been relegated to the scrap heap of movie history.  It should have been just another bloodlust movie for horror freaks.  But it wasn't.  Jaws has to go down as one of the best films ever  made.  The casting is masterful. The script is simple and superb. The  dialogue is right on target. Characters are well thought out and well  difined. The cinematography, that gets pretty dated if done poorly, like  fine wine gets better with age.  Mr. Spielberg is at his best dierecting a  cast at their best with a story from a writer at his best.  A required  addition to any DVD collection.
B00003ZA0T|5.0|this is the best cd i own and it gets better every tie i listen to it
B000002H33|5.0|very very very satisfying to my ears. Every bit and second of this album is awesome. I have to say this is the best one yet. Buy this if you want well put together Metallica songs.
0553269631|4.0|Carson McCuller's THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER provides an insightful view of the 4 main characters: a young girl, a black doctor, a restaurant owner, and an alcoholic. It shows how they are able to deal with the struggles in  their lives by talking to a deaf mute, who has troubles of his own. The  story echoes Marxism, the feeling of being alone, and describes the  hardships of living in the South during the late 1930's. I enjoyed reading  the book except for its length of 306 pages. The ending was a surprise to  me.
079073463X|4.0|Much has been said already about the beauty of Michelle Pfeiffer, the rugged good looks and realistic portrayal of Rutger Hauer, and the comic relief provided by our &quot;guide&quot; through this wonderful bit of  escapism, Matthew Broderick, and I second the motion!  Additionally, watch  for some well-crafted portrayals of evil by both John Wood as the truly  despicable Bishop, and by Ken Hutchison as Hauer's &quot;replacement&quot;  among the home troops, and as the Bishop's personal right-hand man.  Wood's  use of the perfect facial expressions and his acid tongue really shape the  character of the Bishop into a true force of evil to be reckoned with.  And, Hutchison in particular is an excellent villain here, combining the  physical fierceness required along with a menacing attitude that's a wonder  to behold!  The final fight scene between he and Hauer is believably  realistic, physically fierce and brutal, and draining to watch!  Also,  enough cannot be said about Leo McKern's turn as Imperius, whose portrayal  of the self-exiled priest with a haunted past is a pure cinematic delight.  McKern has the uncanny ability to slowly steal every scene in which he  appears, while at the same time raising the level of the acting ability of  all of his fellow performers.  He is an absolute gem!  Additionally, watch  for a truly remarkable scene that takes places between Rutger Hauer's  character Etienne Navarre and Matthew Broderick's Phillipe: Navarre, in a  fit of anger and exasperation, throws his sword at a tree beside Phillipe.  Watch for the absolutely startled and shocked look in Broderick's eyes as  he turns around after the sword comes within about a half-inch of him!  The  sword comes much closer to him in the final take of this scene than it did  in rehearsal, and it's a wonder Broderick was able to intelligently recite  his lines!  Excellent acting in the face of near-disaster!<br />Yes, the  music may seem slightly inappropriate at certain times, and the use of  modern languange at times can be a little distracting, but these are minor  things.  Excellent portrayals, perfect casting, great fantasy storyline,  and absolutely stunning use of physical locals, both inside and out, make  this a highly entertaining and enjoyable bit of escapism.  Kudos to those  responsible for choosing the locations in which this film was shot.  Watch  this beauty the next time you're in the mood for some great entertainment.
0451169514|2.0|this book was way to long, I found many places in the book where King could of finished, this is not one of my favorite books.
0385493800|5.0|I am an avid John Grisham reader as well a member of the legal profession.  I find that although Mr. Grisham adds a little more salt than the everyday legal experience, I have also found that truth is stranger than fiction.   What is truly striking is that at the center of a gripping plot that will  not quit, Mr. Graham explores the struggles of a man with life itself.   This is likely to be the masterpiece of a good, solid writer's career.  I  will confess that I am a christian.  I am surprised that even though up to  one third of the US population has &quot;found religion&quot;, so few books  even broach the subject and almost never in a positive light.  Throughout  his books truths of the human spirit have been woven.  This is the mark of  timeless literature.  As cultures and issues rise and fade, human nature is  constant from the beginning of time until the end.  Thus literature that  records the nature of man accurately rings true to a soul regardless of  time and place.  Such a record written today will only prove true when  someone in the year 2300 will pick up this book and find their experience  on its' pages.  I believe Mr. Grisham will accomplish that.
0553266306|5.0|Frederick Forsyth has written this book in sucha wonderful manner that it seems that the operation is happening in front of your eyes.

B00000JJQK|5.0|This is an album that is totally unforgetable.  I think Pet Sounds gives inspiration to a lot of young musicians out there who want to write something that is relaxing, happy, and that has a great harmony to it like  all music should.  Brian Wilson is my inspiration to play music.  Frank  Sinatra is my inspiration to sing.  I can go on forever telling you why Pet  Sounds is the greatest album ever.  Instead, I'm going to make my review  shorter, and hopefully you will go out and buy this album.  Once you hear  &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;, your taste in music will change forever.  My favorite one on hear is &quot;Caroline No&quot; that describes Brian  Wlson's brillance in music.  Which is better?  The Beatles or The Beach  Boys?  Answer:  The Beach Boys!   Why?  They lasted longer than The  Beatles.  They had more writing ability than The Beatles.  So right now,  buy this album.  Listen to this music from above and then you will finally  see what I'm talking about.
B00004U45G|4.0|This cd is friggin great. I friggin loved it. Smoke a bowl and listen to it
0385486804|5.0|There is little suspense (in the traditional sense of the word) in Krakauer's Into the Wild, as anyone who reads the synopsis or picks up the book instantly learns that it is the story of a young man, Chris  McCandless, who ventures into the Alaskan Wilderness and who never gets  out.  Chris' body is found in an abandoned bus used by moose hunters as a  makeshift lodge, and Krakauer skillfully attempts to retrace his steps in  an effort both to understand what went wrong, and to figure out what made  McCandless give away his money, his car, and head off into Denali National  Forest in the first place.<br />His book was one of the most haunting,  unforgettable reads in recent years for me.  I was mezmerized by passages  in the author's other best-selling masterpiece Into Thin Air, such as the  passage involving stranded and doomed guide Rob Hall, near the Everest  summit, talking to his pregnant wife via satellite phone to discuss names  for their unborn child. However, I was unprepared for the depths of emotion  felt in reading Into the Wild - it literally kept me up at nights, not just  reading but thinking about the book in the dark.<br />Some reviewers  criticized the book because they thought McCandless demonstrated a naive  and unhealthy lack of respect for the Alaskan wilderness. This is no hike  on the Appalachian Trail - Chris was literally dropped off by a trucker  into the middle of nowhere, with no provision stores, guides, or means of  assistance nearby at his disposal. He had a big bag of rice and a book  about native plants,  designed to tell him which plants and berries he  could eat. &quot;How could he have been so stupid?&quot;, they ask.<br />Well,  I certainly didn't feel compelled to give away my belongings, pack some  rice and a Tolstoy novel and walk into the woods after reading the book,  but the author does a remarkable job of exploring McCandless the person,  including passages derived from interviews with the many poeple whose lives  he touched in his odyssey as he drove and then hitch-hiked cross country  from his well-to-do suburban home. Some of the more touching parts of the  book involved tearful reminisces by some of these old aquaintances when  they learned he had perished.<br />Krakauer also throws in for good measure an  illuminating passage about a similar death-defying climb that he foolishly  attempted at about the same age as McCandless, with little training and  preparation, providing insight into what makes a person attempt a dangerous  climb or hike. He even tells several fascinating tales, all of them true,  of other recreational hikers who were stranded in the wilderness.<br />By the  end of the book, I thought I understood McCandless' character, and I  thought Krakauer was probably right in putting his finger on exactly what  caused his death. I was moved by his plight regardless of his possible  foolishness in venturing into Denali, and the final scenes involving Chris'  family were emotionally devastating.  You need not be an outdoorsman to  appreciate it, and in fact unlike Into Thin Air the book is completely  accessible to those who know nothing about the subject. I think this book  is destined to become a classic.
B000002H92|5.0|&quot;Absolutely Live&quot;, &quot;Live At Hollywood Bowl&quot; and &quot;Alive She Cried&quot;--to be exact. If you've got those in vinyl, this set gives you all those plus a couple of extra numbers. They give you  the longer of the two &quot;Light My Fires&quot;. One number that didn't  make it was &quot;Spanish Caravan&quot; from either &quot;Bowl&quot; or  &quot;Cried&quot; (I forget which). That's just as well, because the  original only gives you part of the song anyway--the electric last verse.  The only real weak point is a live &quot;The End&quot;, which would be nice  for the fact that no live version of that number has been available until  now--that is if Morrison didn't spend the first couple of minutes bitching  at the light man to lower the lights--and all the time, Robby, John and Ray  are playing along waiting for him to start the first verse. And so are we.  But really, since that's a freebie anyway, this set still gets my 5 stars.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is RHCP best album ever. There is a great variety of tunes and it is nice to have John back in the fold. Some people might say they have sold out and gone to 'pop', but one listen to this CD and they should change  their minds.Songs like 'Parallel Universe' with Flea's hammering bass, and  the great ballad 'Road Trip' solidify this band as one of rock's greatest  legacies.......GO get this CD now! ....the stand out cuts are:  Around  The World, Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue, Otherside<br />,Californication,I  Like Dirt, Road Trippin'
0316920045|4.0|I knew this was a great book when, with about three hundred pages left, I started to feel sad.  Like when you're on vacation, and you realize that you only have a few days of R&amp;R left.  <br />This book truly becomes part  of your life.  The characters are so unforgettably human, with real faults  and foibles that will endear them to you.  I think that's what I liked best  about the book - the sense of entering another world inhabited by  wonderfully complex (and often hilariously entertaining) people.<br />Yes,  this book is long and it's not for the faint of heart.  But it's also not  one of those dry, academic-type books that feels like an insufferable  chore.  IJ is lively and entertaining.  You will literally laugh out loud,  which, if you read this book in public, may cause others to get the  &quot;howling fantods&quot;.  Ignore them, and all the naysayers.  IJ  rewards patient and careful readers with a dense, multi-layered plot (yes,  there is a plot - it's just not linear!).  It's sad, funny, sweet,  horrifying, cruel, wickedly smart, and, very often, quite wonderful.  I  highly recommend it.  <br />FYI, I gave a four (as opposed to five) star  review simply because of what I felt were some major plot points and  critical info buried deep within the footnotes.  Get out your magnifying  glass!
B00004T8RK|3.0|I was very disappointed with this album after loving their last effort 'Yield&quot;. I tried to let this cd grow on me, but unfortunately the songs on the album are just not very good. Pearl Jam has been known as a  great 'song' band and with Binaural they tried to stretch this ability. I  think the main problem was the lack of Mike Mcready's participation, he  needs to get more involved in the song writing. There are a couple decent  songs on the album but overall it is their worst album by a long shot. Here  are the few songs I do think are good, lets hope their next one is better  than this.....and oh yes the cover is awesome (one star for it).......  Evacuation, Light Years,Nothing As It Seems,Thin Air,Of The  Girl...........I warned You!
076790382X|3.0|After reading A Walk in the Woods, I picked this book up expecting much of  the traveling commentary that was in it and books by Bryson made in the  past.  Boy, was I wrong.  What the book really is, is a compilation of two  years' worth of articles written by Bryson, about living in America again.   These articles were meant for a British audience and so they do get a bit  irritating, things being generalized to the reader that, in America, are  well known.  These articles may be entertaining, on a weekly basis as they  were released, but as a complete read, do get a bit tiresome.  This could  be said for any article though: try reading a year's worth of Larry King  articles, let alone two.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I am not big on bands using their music as a vehicle to voice their political views, but hey if the turn out music like RATM then GO 4 IT! ......this album rocks, it continues RATM's legacy as one of rocks  premier bands, in what is now a dying genre (NSYNC, Hanson, etc.) If you  liked either of the first two albums get this one now!  It has great riffs,  killer raps, hoppin' drums, and slammin' bass......and the songs are great  too, here are the better tunes of the bunch......ROCK ON! ........  Testify,Guerrilla Radio, Calm Like A Bomb,Mic Check,Sleep Now In the  Fire,Born Of A Broken Man
076790382X|3.0|After reading A Walk in the Woods, I picked this book up expecting much of  the traveling commentary that was in it and books by Bryson made in the  past.  Boy, was I wrong.  What the book really is, is a compilation of two  years' worth of articles written by Bryson, about living in America again.   These articles were meant for a British audience and so they do get a bit  irritating, things being generalized to the reader that, in America, are  well known.  These articles may be entertaining, on a weekly basis as they  were released, but as a complete read, do get a bit tiresome.  This could  be said for any article though: try reading a year's worth of Larry King  articles, let alone two.
B000020617|4.0|This is not as good of an album as their last 'Colour' but it is a decent effort, and maintains their legacy after they were supposed to have not made it past one album (Nirvana). THe only bad thing about the album is  there are nto enough rock songs, songs like 'Stacked Actors' and 'Breakout'  are awesome and hopefully their next effort will focus on tunes like this  rather than going in the mellow pop rock direction. IF you like the other  two albums you will liek this after a couple listens, and if you take out  the Nirvana shadow, the Foo Fighters will stay around for a long time,  thank goodness......the best tunes are:1. Stacked Actors 2. Breakout 3.  Learn To Fly 5. Generator 6. Aurora 9. Headwires
B000002TYK|4.0|I pretty much enjoyed this delicate piece of work and it is a great effort by Dave Grohl. He wrote this pretty much while he was touring with &quot;That other band&quot; so it's not exceptional but it does pack a  punch and its fun to listen to. The coolest songs in my opinion are  &quot;Big Me&quot; &quot;For All The Cows&quot; &quot;Good Grief&quot;  &quot;I'll stick around&quot; and &quot;Alone + Easy Target&quot; <br />There  are alot of good songs and it's a wonderful listen. I give it *carves a 4  into a tree* FOUR STARS!
B0000256VK|5.0|The reunification of Roxy Music produced such a brilliant album which is never outdated. Bryan Ferry was a really real gentleman to write such pretty good melody to make you can never forget. &quot;Avalon&quot; is the  forever classics and &quot;True to life&quot; is life-long romance. Music  &quot;India&quot; and &quot;Tara&quot; were composed with a tropical taste.  &quot;More than this&quot; is a sentimentel poem and &quot;While my heart  heart is beating&quot; is a heartbroken story. Please remember to sing  &quot;Take a chance with me&quot; if you ask her to marry you! Anyway, you  are strongly recommended to listen to this album with your darling/girl  friend/wife together in the Valentine's day, happy wedding  anniversary...whenever both of you need the sounds with really romantic  atmosphere. Enjoy yourself, cheers!
B000001EUN|3.0|This album does have some good tunes, but by far not their greatest effort.  I had the priviledge of seeing the Scorps live many times in the 80's, and always felt that the show was cheapened by &quot;The Zoo.&quot;   What about the old gems i.e. In Trance, Speedy's Coming, Hell Cat?  Those  tunes, to me, personify The Scorps are their metal best!
0064400018|5.0|I thought, there were not many people in my country know aboutLaura Ingalls Wilder. But recently, I read a group discussion of manyIndonesian talking cheerfully about Laura's books. Most of them found it difficult to find a complete series of Laura's books in Indonesia at the moment, especially for Rose years, even none for Martha and Caroline years. It reminds me again of how I read this Little House series in not particular order because I hardly found it in bookstores.  Well, I really like this book because of Laura's childhood and the family activities in those days.  The book always makes me hungry as it describes various kind of food in details.
0553213105|5.0|I am 16 years old and was scared about reading this book because I have heard that it is hard and boring.  I however find those to be lies.  Although it took me a while to read, i was perfectly able to understand it  and any girls that like romance should read it.  It's a true treasure!
B000006OAM|5.0|I am aware of the disc's shortcomings but still I can't help enjoying it. I feel a bit weird - a big man (see my photo) writing of his infatuation with that womanly soul-caressing stuff. And I am a bit allergic to the  singer - I own the Ophellia concert DVD and hate Natalie's mannerisms and  her body language, all that barefooted hippieish &quot;dancing&quot;. But  as an opera fan I have ho problem with separating a voice from a  personality.  I was amused listening to the Russian phrases in the title  song - they were included as the World Music-style weird language cameos  but I understood.  The CD package is better to be thrown away - to get the  disc out you have to be very careful avoiding putting your fingerprints on  the surface. And this idiotic narcissist's photo-gallery imposing on you  much more Ms.Merchant's images that you care to see! So I put the disc in a  standard unmarked package and listen to it more often than I am ready to  admit.
B000021XR5|5.0|While &quot;rock&quot; radio stations are trying to stay on the air playing Old Ozzy staples or the new Rock/Rap mush, there are a few bands still making good hard rock. For those of us in our mid-late 20's, there is  a real absence of the early 90's type grunge/hard rock.  STP's No.4 will  satisfy that craving.  Others have compared it to CORE but I would call it  Bizarro CORE. It's like CORE but modernized.  Like &quot;Wicked  Garden&quot;? You'll love the first few songs of No.4. Even the more mellow  songs are pure thoroughbred STP.
B000002KON|5.0|Come on empty 68, show yourself! Who are you, what do you eat, how does your garden grow-and why is &quot;Arthur&quot; odd and bloated? Explain yourself! It contains, by any measure, rock's greatest outing in  &quot;Shangri-La&quot; and several other songs which go beyond The Beatles  and nearly everyone else.<br />Think about what Ray Davies was doing-it's  essentially a musical, and all great musicals have emotional highs and  interludes so that the audience can adjust their bums and whisper their  approvals or otherwise. Some of these songs-&quot;Yes Sir, No Sir&quot; for  example-are interludes between the great peaks.<br />It's a musical about  war-not the Germans at war or the Americans at war, but an English working  class man called Arthur and his whole generation, his countrymen. In  England, we study the war poets, particularly Wilfred Owen. Owen's language  has the directness of a bullet-it accuses point blank. Davies has borrowed  this language for &quot;Some Mother's Son&quot; and written the only great  anti-war pop song to come out of England. Listen to the last verse-the  words are pure Owen: this is the companion piece to Bob Dylan's  &quot;Masters of War,&quot; and miles away from the hippy romanticism of  John Lennon's &quot;Imagine.&quot;<br />Now listen to &quot;Drivin'&quot;-the  only example in English pop of a song trying to emulate the sound and gay  abandon of people enjoying a new kind of transport-the car. Between the  wars, people called this motoring-they used to pack their cars with picnics  and drive for miles: it gave them a false sense of security against  impending catastrophe-the Second World War-and allowed the time and privacy  to forget. Listen to the guitars and the arrangement-it actually sounds  like a family in an old banger driving out of London for the thrills and  spills of the countryside.<br />Go back to where we came  in-&quot;Shangri-La.&quot; This starts with one of the most beautiful  folksy tunes ever written-butcrashes into the hard rock chorus. Folk-rock  is often used as a category in rock criticism, but this is its perfect  realistion in song. It starts off in sympathy with the working man and his  lot, but-after a massive riff on the guitars-Davies attacks the sleeping  masses in surburbia in a way that no English rock writer has done before or  since. He admonishes their insecurities, their sameness, their gossip,  their uniformity, their dullness. This viciousness was part of The Kinks'  lifestyle, but here it burst out as never before. It's unattractive and  gut-wrenching, but in context you realise what he's doing: he's an  idealist, and longs for the working class-Arthur-to do better. By chiding  them, he hopes to wake them from their historical slumber. There are two  other things about &quot;Shangri-La&quot;: it's the only rock song which  becomes so overwhelming that the players actually try to slow it  down-listen to the extraordinary drumming towards the end which sounds like  a heavily-laden lorry breaking on a motorway. Then there's the demonic  &quot;Shangri-La&quot; chant towards the end of the piece in which the band  musically mocks the song-it's very reminiscent of parts of Vaughan  Williams' &quot;Job, a Masque for Dancing.&quot;   <br />There isn't space to  dwell on the other songs, but you have to realise that The Kinks represent  the high point of English pop music-just as Dylan represents the high point  of American music. The music is bound to our cities and countryside like  the quintessential maps and guide-books which we use to find our way in  this country. This is the only pop album we have in which a great song  writer tries to come to terms with world wars which, even in the glory of  victory, left the role of members of his English, working class family  anonymous. Listen to &quot;Arthur&quot; carefully, and you'll cry.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This is DEFINITELY not my forte' of music, but I'm always willing to give everything a chance before I judge it; unfortunately, it's albums like this that make me want to disregard that last statement.  Let's face  it...Britney just isn't musically inclined.  All of her so-called  &quot;SMASH HITS&quot; are all composed around that same beat over and over  again - all it is is the beat to &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot; but  re-mixed and re-arranged.  When I got to track 3, I was pretty much at my  breaking point where I wanted to take the CD out and break it, but it's  okay because now I know that her next &quot;big hit&quot; is going to be  the beat to &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot; but backwards.  THIS  ALBUM WAS GARBAGE.
0671775308|5.0|If you are serious about changing your financial status and are willing to play by the rules, you find this book very helpful.  It makes you realize what is important and changes your mind about how you should be spending  your money.  If gives great ideas.  However, if you are materialistic, you  may find it boring.  You have to be willing to change you're thinking and  not be so tied up in status items that are just a waste of money.  I  recently turned over a new leaf and decided to start a debt elimination  program, this was recommended reading material and was a great compliment  to &quot;Debt Free and Prosperous Living&quot; by John Cummuta,the program  I am following.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I'll admit I'm a fanatic when it comes to Roswell, but I've been anticipating this CD since the very first episode way back in September '99. Bits of the theme song, Here with Me, were played at the beginning of  every episode, but I got my full satisfaction when the rest of the song was  aired when Max &amp; Liz broke up during the season finale. <br />Mistaking  her name with Dildo, I obviously got obsene results on amazon.com.  Correcting myself, I have bought one of the most influentional,  inspirational, complete and satisfactory CDs ever created by the hands of  those jolly Irish folks way back in wee Ireland. I was extreamly surprised  to learn that no one in Europe has even heard of her, and that she's  gaining popularity in the US...isn't it usually the other way around?<br />But  anyhoo...her music, which is mostly written by herself and her brother,  perfectly describes my past relationship with my first love. She sings of  hurtfulness, sin, losing her love, being empty and as she puts it, being  unable to go, sleep, breathe or rest. It seems that's she singing about my  life, down to every detail. Being a drummer/percussionist, I was way  impressed by the drum grooves and programming, mixed in with various  instruments, some played by Dido herself.<br />Her voice seems a mixture of  Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan and Chantal Kreviazuk, all who'm are all  extreamly talented, but not as much as the debuting songstress, Dido.<br />So  wherever you may live, US or UK (I love your country by the way), you're  sure to love Dido's voice of pure silk. Make sure to tune into song  numbers: #1...Here with Me, #2...All you Want, &amp; #3...Thankyou.<br />And  thankyou.<br />PS...would anyone happen to know when the Roswell Soundtrack  will be coming out? There's one for Dawson's Creek...so why not Roswell?
B000002KC5|5.0|I'm biased as this was an anthem album in my frat house days at LSU , but that said I think first to last this is his best album.  A Randy Newman album is an acquired taste but like fine wine well worth the effort. Few  have written  more funny , inciteful, whitty, beautiful lyrics for years  than he.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is the best CD! Every song is da bomb!  I would recommend this CD to everyone. This CD is full of really kikin songs, Oops...I did it again is only one of the CD's great songs. GET THIS CD!
B000025171|4.0|This album may not have the emotion or melancholia that Pacific Age or Crush had but it still has great melodies mixed with catchy beats.  &quot;Tesla Girls&quot;, &quot;Talking Loud And Clear&quot; and  &quot;Locomotion&quot; are the hits from this album, but the real gems are  &quot;Never Turn Away&quot; and &quot;Love And Violence&quot;.  &quot;Never  Turn Away&quot; is beautiful and erotic and sounds like no other ballad  around. &quot;Love and Violence&quot; has blasts of brass mixed with  playful vocals. &quot;Hard Day&quot; has the emotions of a blues song, but  is written in a major key ala Enola Gay. &quot;All Wrapped Up&quot; makes  you want to take a vacation to Jamaica with its island feel.  This is a  solid album, not spectacular, but solid.
B000005J56|5.0|Great music. I heard this CD in an after-hours joint in Udine, Italy and have been hooked since. My favorites are Chan Chan, Candela and El Carreto. The Afro-Cuban beats are strong and intense. The video is also a great peak  inside the lives of simply great musicians. Pick them both up.
6303014100|4.0|There are numerous problems with this movie, but I still have watched it 50 times and never get sick of it. Despite some of the near-fatal flaws with the film, it still is riveting in sections and is always an emotional  viewing experience.<br />What are the some of the problems? First, the make-up  department needs to have their heads examined with the plethora of terribly  cheap, fake beards in the movie. Longstreet's beard, in particular, looks  like a rabid Chia pet on steroids. The real James Longstreet never had a  beard that approached the ample levels of this beard. Tom Chamberlain's  chin whiskers are also very phony looking, as is Sheen's beard as Robert E.  Lee. Jeff Daniels' mustache, as JL Chamberlain, bears a great resemblance  to Yosemite Sam. You may think this criticism is trivial, but the movie  would have been strengthened considerably by a decent make-up department.  They also need to remove the wedding rings on the major actors. The only  Civil War general who wore a wedding ring was Ulysses S. Grant and he  wasn't at Gettysburg.<br />Another weakness is the sheer length of the movie.  Where was the editor? There are many scenes which beg to be cut: all of the  scenes with British Colonel Freemantle are superfluous, as is the later  scenes with Confederate spy Harrison. Lee's dressing down of Stuart and  Trimble are also overly long. A good hour needs to be lopped off the  film.<br />The uniforms of the major participants are also laughable. Even  after a day's battle, there is never a scratch, splotch or blood stain on  any garment. This is unrealistic. The lack of carnage and blood in all the  battles is also unrealistic.<br />Another criticism is the age and weight of  the reenactors in the film. Most seem to be in their 40's and almost all  are 100 pounds too heavy to be accurate in their bit roles. The average  Confederate soldier at Gettysburg was 20 years old and weighed 140 pounds,  some of these extra's are Orson Welles look alikes!<br />But... and this is a  *big* &quot;but...&quot; Jeff Daniels performance as Chamberlain is  outstanding, he carries the first half of the film. The scene at Little  Round Top is superlative and moving. Tom Berenger as Longstreet carries the  second half of the movie, even with his grotesque Chia-pet fake beard.  Berenger is thoughful and excellent in his role. Martin Sheen makes a  ridiculous and too-short Robert E. Lee and his accent is hardly that of a  Patrician Virginian, more like a Georgia dirt farmer.<br />The two highlights  of the movie are the Little Round Top and Pickett's charge scenes, both are  magnificent. If you want accurate civil war history, this is an uneven  treatment, but if you want an entertaining introduction into the American  civil war, this is it./>But... and this is a  *big* &quot;but...&quot; Jeff Daniels performance as Chamberlain is  outstanding, he carries the first half of the film.

0688156819|5.0|This book is probably one of my all time favorites.  Theillustrations and stories are creative and 100% Tim Burton.  If youlike his films, enjoy just looking at him, or have some amusement with anything Burtonish, then buy it! Its worth it!  The stories are great and amusing, and some will give you a great laugh.  Recommendation (my favorite of the stories) Mummy Boy, Page 77.  Even if you haven't even heard of Tim, his movies, ect, you should still get this book!  Its great, you won't be disappointed!
630170648X|5.0|Though generally known as a radio and television superstar, this movie shows that Jack Benny was also a fine film actor. Everything about this movie is top flight: the acting, script, supporting performances and even  the sets. Though designed as an anti-Nazi propaganda movie, the film is not  dated and has held up remarkably well considering it's 60 years  old.<br />Benny's performance as the Polish actor Joseph Tura is hilarious and  his scenes with &quot;Gestapo Mueller&quot; are memorable and beautifully  acted. Carole Lombard and a young Robert Stack support Benny admirably, but  this is Benny's show all the way. As always, he did not disappoint.

B00004SCX6|5.0|&quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; is one of Britney's finest works.  In it she blends fast paced, dancing songs(such as: &quot;Stronger&quot; and &quot;What U See(Is What U Get&quot;) with beautiful ballads(such as:  &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; and &quot;Dear Diary&quot;). Even her own  version/remake of &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is a song that I can't stop  listening to.  This album shows the real Britney, and how much she has  changed.  I love this CD and every song on it.  If you already love  Britney, or have yet to buy one of her albums, this is the best! (Don't get  me wrong, I love her other album too) This CD is always in my CD player, so  if you want an album you can listen to all the time, without ever having to  skip over a song, get Britney's &quot;Oops...I Did It Again&quot; and see  how you like it.  Who knows, maybe you'll be writing a review for this CD  similar to this one after you listen to it.  Britney...she really DID do it  again.
6305907145|3.0|If you happen to be a die-hard Jane Austin fan, please read as many reviews of this movie as you can before you watch it, but definitely watch it!  This movie shows just enough resemblance to the book to be able to  recognize Jane Austin as it's mother, but that's as far as it goes.  You  will not recognize Fanny Price.  They call her Fanny Price in the movie,  but her self-assured mannerisms and self-confidence bear no resemblance to  the book.  Fanny's older brother has been completely written out of the  movie.  And I can't quite put my finger on it, but there seems to be an  overall attempt to make all the characters seem black and white, good or  bad, which I found frustrating and annoying.  This black/white thing is  particularly annoying since Jane Austin had very few completely bad people  in her novels.  We, of course, interpret their actions as bad, but she  always suggested that there was something redeeming in everyone whether  they chose that path or not. I have a number of issues with this  interpretation, but if you approach it as just another period movie, it can  be quite enjoyable.  Nice cinematography, nice locations, the pacing is  good, and there are a handful of amusing conventions within it.  I usually  don't care for a movie whose characters talk directly to the viewers  (except, of course, for Woody Allen movies) because it tends to distroy the  viewers' suspension of disbelief, and that isn't a good way of presenting a  dramatic story line.  So, in summation, I was disappointed with this  adaptation.  I am one of those people who wish film makers could interpret  a book faithfully to the author's intent, instead of putting their own  interpretive mark on the project.  But, as long as you understand that this  movie will not actually be the Mansfield Park with which you are familiar,  it is an enjoyable experience.  As for the lesbian thing, I interpreted  that as another in the many little details that the director used to  attempt to makecertain characters appear good, and others appear bad.   It's disappointing that this film maker chose to make a character look bad  by suggesting she might have lesbian tendancies (that sort of comment  doesn't help our society get beyond stereotypes).  She should have saved  her social commentary for her own material, instead of tacking it onto a  Jane Austin story!  For those of you who have not read any of Jane Austin's  writing, there are few references to sex, and none to lesbian  relationships.  Definitely rent it before you buy it!
B000002KHY|3.0|This is one example where a greatest hits CD is in dire need of an update.  Any James Taylor fan knows that he cranked out some more good songs after this compilation.  If you are willing to spend a lot more money, you can  get the far better import(!) compilation 'Classics', which does include  most of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; along with &quot;Handyman&quot;,  &quot;Your Smiling Face&quot;, &quot;Her Town Too&quot; plus other hits and  good album tracks.  They mercifully deleted the lame  &quot;Steamroller&quot;.  My advice is to wait until the record company  wakes up and updates this collection, much like the very successful upgrade  of Simon and Garfunkel's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. If you just have to  have this collection, you can easily find it at most used CD stores fairly  cheap.
0553471325|5.0|Sad Cypress  Come Away, come away, death,  And in sad cypress let me be laid;  Fly away, fly away, breath;  I am slain by a fair cruel maid.<br />The words above are sung on the tape, giving  it an eerie old fashion feel. It also had an actor for each part, along  with sound effects.<br />It begins with Elinor and Roddy receiving an  anonymous letter telling them another person has moved in on their aunt's  affections and they could lose their inheritance if they don't come visit  soon. First auntie comes up dead while they are visiting. And later another  person is murdered when Elinor comes to visit a second time. Elinor is  charged with murder. And Hercule Poirt is hired to find out the truth. With  a little investigating and even some courtroom drama, Hercule solves the  case of whodunit. I have always enjoyed how Poirt explains the solved  mystery at the end. It has helped me as a reader to pay more attention when  reading a mystery.<br />The BBC is known for their ability to produce a good  audio mystery. I would recommend any you should come across as  entertaining. They can break the monotony of those long walks or drives.
0060283122|4.0|The Bad Beginning is about the three Baudelaire children named Violet, the eldest, Klaus, the middle child, and Sunny, the baby.The Baudelaire children are very bright children. Their family is very rich, but they are not spoiled. They are very nice people. Unfortunately, their parents die, and ever since that day, they have had a very unfortunate time.<br />After  their parents died, the Baudelaire children, now orphans, moved in to live  with their relative Count Olaf, who they never met before. <br />Count Olaf is  a scary man... This is a book full of  sad and unfortunate events but Lemony Snicket is able to make it humorous,  by his writing style. It is a strange book, but is really funny and witty,  as odd as that might be for a book about sad things.

6305878323|5.0|Everyone knows this film, right?  It's essential watching for children of all ages.  Mary Poppins is the quinessential magical nanny, and Julie Andrews has become so identified with her performance in this film that  most people will always see her as Mary Poppins.<br />Anyways, I recently  purchased the Gold Collection DVD of this classic movie.  It is essentially  the same as the previous Disney release except for a few points.  First,  this one actually *has* a few extras, which most of the early Disney DVDs  lacked (shame on Disney!).  The transfer is the same, but in addition, we  now have a documentary on the film, a trailer, a short premiere featurette,  and a trivia game. It's still pretty sparse as far as extras go and nothing  spectacular, but it's an improvement for Disney.  Oh yes, and there are  those annoying trailers at the beginning of the DVD that Disney likes to  put on all its DVDs.  Oh well.<br />If you have the DVD already, don't bother  buying this one.  If you don't have the DVD, by all means purchase the Gold  collection Mary Poppins.  It's a classic film that can be enjoyed by the  family over and over again.
B000002MJ0|5.0|My Bloody Valentine are undoubtably one of the most important bands in the history of indie music and, although 'Isn't Anything' doesn't quite measure up to the immense standards of 'Loveless', it still serves as a unique  sign-post to where music was (or is) going. <br />Basically this is a stepping  stone between 'Loveless' and the early work of The Jesus and Mary Chain.  Echoes of The Velvet Underground pervade, yet the sheer sonic ingenuity of  Kevin Shields takes this already avant garde template to an entirely  original plain. However, this is not to suggest that the songs are somehow  lacking.  The last four songs, particularly 'You Never Should', are a  arguably the pick of the bunch- all mangled guitars and pretty, lo-fi  melodies- yet there is much to enjoy elsewhere. Brutal riffing comes to the  fore on the single, 'Feed me with your kiss', while the brilliantly  off-kilter double-tracked vocals of 'Sueisfine' lead to the sonic  equivalent of inertia- which is really rather good.<br />With its mixture of  great tunes and twisted experimentation, it is clear why 'Isn't Anything'  is held in such high esteem by many musicians. The sound of garage-rock on  E and LSD instead of Speed, the really strange thing about 'Isn't Anything'  is that My Bloody Valentine could go any further.
B00003CX95|5.0|Yes, as has been pointed out, there are a number of inaccuracies in this film.  However, it is still one of the most breathtaking pictures I have ever seen.  It captures the true spirit of both an individual's, as well as  a Nation's quest for freedom and independence.  Moreover, the  cinematography is absolutely stunning.<br />As a historian, I always hope for  authenticity.  However, sometimes one must settle for a blend a fact and  fiction to make a film profitable.<br />Here are a few of the facts left  out.<br />No, he did not have an affair with Isabella.<br />Yes, he would have  spoken many languages including French &amp; Latin.  He was well educated  at the moestary at Kennebeckskenneth(sp, Been a few years since I  researched this topic)<br />The old man, his uncle, was the abbot at said  monestary.<br />Yes, it has been speculated that Edward II was gay.  However,  there is no real proof.  Different cultures respond differently to this  topic.<br />Isabella and her real lover, Mortimer, assasinated Edward II.   Edward III had Mortimer executed when he assended the throne, and his  mother locked in a tower!  So there was no love lost between ED II &amp;  Isabella.<br />The greatest omission is during the battle of Stirling.  (The  one with the spears)  Wallace used a covert attack to take out the bridge  so the infantry and archers could not support the calvary.   BRILLIANT!<br />This film shows what an educated man can do when fighting for  his freedom.  Few pictures can capture this as well as Braveheart.<br />Exodus  I; BA. History EWU

Roy has written about issues that most people (in India or in America) will NOT talk about regarding the heirarchies we create between people.  And she  does this in an extremely beautiful way, telling an elegant story about the  emotions of a family demonized in India, and in the West, for who they are,  while still giving into that system.  Roy's use of language is incredible,  indeed, she has outdone Joyce himself.  She is poetic and insightful.  This  is one of my favorite books!
B000021Y74|5.0|... Run Lola Run is an AMAZING movie - amazing! It virtually embodies the metaphysical concept of &quot;eternal recurrence&quot; within the SAME ONE LIFETIME, and within the same 20 minutes of time OF that  SAME ONE  LIFETIME!... Whew!... INTENSE is an understatement!<br />... I wonder if the  creators of this film ever studied the writings of Gurdjieff, Ouspensky,  Orage, or John Godolphin Bennett - because it is right out of the  &quot;eternal return&quot; concept that is talked about by people involved  in &quot;4TH Way Work&quot;. The mythic and archetypal meanings hit you  right in the face: POW! ... There is no escape from the contemplation of  the &quot;ultimate questions of our lives&quot; when watching this movie.  The synchronicity is UNBELIEVABLE!<br />... It is a living legominism of  higher art, embodying the three octaves of the enneagram in a way that  REALLY makes you see how one - with extra effort - can actually CHANGE THE  FUTURE! ... The scenes where Lola and her boyfriend are relaxing in bed,  intimately discussing their relationship, are very moving. The viewer  instanly realizes just how much these two people truly love and care for  one another. I was moved in a big way.<br />... I watched this film THREE  times. Each time I watched it, I learned more not only about the film  itself, but about the deeper meaning of life as well. It will teach you a  good lesson: NEVER succumb to the sleeping negativity of negative emotions  or actions - even for a second - if you want to stay awake and have your  life stay buzzing in the more centered and finer vibrations of &quot;the  higher octave.&quot; ... This one is a true classic! And - by all means -  watch the original one in the German language with English subtitles.  There's nothing like the real thing! - The Aeolian Kid
0792844882|5.0|The perfect `T&amp;A' movie!  The movie America deserved, not desired.  After twenty minutes, the nudity and sexuality is rendered banal, and the film is a stylized interpretation of America's obsession with sex and a  metaphor for women's self-degradation while harnessing sexual `power'.   Nomi is a victim who sees herself as a survivor while the men in charge  absent-mindedly exploit her and then dump her at will.  You have to be  incredibly insensitive to find this movie exclusively erotic and not  disturbing.  Bad acting?  Yep.  Gratuitous violence? Yep. Did Berkley  realize what she was getting into?  Probably not.  Still, worth seeing  along with \\"Starship Troopers,\\" Verhoven's masterpiece of war culture.   Seen together, the brilliance of `Showgirls' shines through.
B00003CWQ2|5.0|I didn't bother seeing this when it first came out since I thought it was another stupid fighting movie. That's what the previews and TV ads lead you to believe. While it may be about Fight Club it is not a fighting movie!  It's pretty strange but very good. I won't say any more so I don't spoil  anything, but if you haven't seen it already I highly recommend it!
B00004SCX6|1.0|I feel sorry for all of those who have fallen victim to this record label creation. Britney Spears has no talent, her songs have no meaning, and she does not play any instruments. She defys all regular meanings of the word  'singer' Like all of the bubblegum pop singers before her, including the  Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, Christina Aguilera, and others, her songs are  over-played, over-hyped, and totally unintelligible from the rest of the  bad music that plagues our air waves. Let's start listening to bands with  talent, whose music inspires us or sends a message, and who actually do  more than dance as poorly as they sing.
6304078102|5.0|Few movies have touched me as much as this one. It is about how priorities get in the way of dreams. Eventually with time, those dreams become unattainible. This is the heart of the movie.<br />Mr. Holland (magnificently  played by Richard Dreyfuss) yearns to be a composer, but get's stuck  teaching music at a local high school. Like most of us he gets trapped  there, in a place where he doesn't want to be. Once more, his son is deaf,  leaving Mr. Holland to believe that his own son will never understand his  passion: music. Mr. Holland eventually grows to love his job. He influences  and inspires quite a few people there. Unfortunately, the music program is  cancelled because of budget cuts. Mr. Holland, left jobless believes his  efforts were futile, and his life wasted.He soon learns that he achieved a  sucess far beyond his wildest dreams.
1570428654|4.0|After having read a friend's hardcover copy, and listening to the author on NPR, I decided to make my first audio book purchase.  His unique voice adds another dimension to the humor.<br />I'm told that audio books are  usually abridged, but there are six chapters not included.  They are as  follows:  Big Boy; You Can't Kill The Rooster; The Great Leap Forward;  Genetic Engineering; Smart Guy; The Late Show.<br />Regardless of the  omissions, I highly recommend the audio version of this book.
6305426651|5.0|I have seen many holocaust movies, what makes this one stand apart is that it is a comedy( Yes, you heard me) The story doesn't lose screen time devoting the movie to horrific hardships of the holocaust. Instead it stays  on target, and focuses on the relationship of a father and his son in a  concentration camp. The father convinces his son that it is all a game, and  he must stay hidden(at all times) in order to win first prize. Could this  really have happenned? No, but you need to take this movie with a grain of  salt. It is simply terrific. I would never have thought that I would laugh,  cry, or feel so good about myself after watching a holocaust movie.
B0000296SI|5.0|Blink Rocks. Seen them in concert and they were hilarious and completely rocked. Buy the CD!  You won't regret it! Buy &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; and &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; to while your at it. All three are great CDs.
0783235968|5.0|Troubled farmer Ray Kinsella(Kevin Costner..who has never been better) keeps hearing voices telling him, of all things, to build a baseball field in his back yard! Far-fetched? sure, but few movies combine fantasy and  emotion as well as this one. The voices and visions continue until Kinsella  takes a field trip to team up with a well known author(wonderfully  portrayed by James Earl Jones) the skepticism resides and the two take a  magical journey that will change their lives forever. I will tell no more,  it would be a sin. Grown men be warned however, if any movie is sure to  bring a tear to your eye, it's this one.

B0000025BL|1.0|Largely a one shot gimmick from the late 70's that rebounded during a brief 70's revival in the early 80's.  This stuff isn't even good enough to qualify as camp.  It was mildly amusing at the time, but why there is any  interest in it at the dawn of the 21st century is amazing.
B00004U2HK|5.0|This is a great movie. It is based on the life of Maria Von Trapp, and has a lot of historical value. The Music is very heartwarming and you will be singing the songs for days after you watch this movie. Julie Andrews is  great in this. If you like Musicals, this film is for you! I especially  like the Lonely Gotherd sequence of this film. Be sure to get the DVD!
B00003CXAR|5.0|I remember watching (or rather listening to, as I spent most of the time hiding behind the sofa) Jaws when I was about 9 and I don't think I could sleep a wink for 6 months afterwards.  13 years later I didn't think the  film could still give me a fright but I still hit the roof a few times even  when I knew what was coming.  This is one of my favourite films, I don't  believe it has an equal in its genre.  I had to buy it on DVD as soon as it  became available and so should you.
B00000JCB2|3.0|I feel that this album definatley could've been better. I mean it has its sweet spots, but there is also some sour in here. Some examples of the bright spots are &quot; Just Like This&quot;, &quot;Nookie&quot;, Break  Stuff&quot;, &amp;&quot;Re-arranged&quot;. It's no wonder that these were  the singles because they're what keeps this album alive. It all kinda goes  downhill from track 6, though. Somehow it almost seems like Limp was tryin'  to hard this time. The best stuff they have is the stuff they wrote on the  backs of napkens not the stuff they where sat down and said &quot;Ok, I'm  gonna write a song now.&quot; This album just doesn't flow right. For more  all around stuff, maybe try KoRn's latest, but for more loud fun and some  decent songs  &quot;...Other&quot; is good enough.  I'm glad I bought the  CD, but I do wish I had gotten a little more.
B00004TL21|5.0|First off, if you're a huge Deftones fan like I am, let me give you a word of warning: If you think you know the Deftones, I garrantee this album will suprise, mabye even shock, you.  I know it suprised me when I first slipped  it into my CD player used to playing &quot;Adrenaline&quot; and  &quot;Around The Fur&quot; on almost a daily basis.  But give it some time,  and before too long, not only will it start to make more sense compaired to  Deftones' other two albums, but you may even start to like it more than the  other two.  And to the rest of you reading this, if you're not a huge  Deftones fan, after listening to this a couple times, you will be.  <br />     The first thing you'll notice thats different about this than the Deftones  you once knew is that there's less screaming than before.  You'll also  notice that Chino's lyrics are a lot less self-involved than on the other  albums.  Mabye it's because now every &quot;nu-metal&quot; band is  singing/screaming about how miserable they are, and Deftones wanted break  away from the pack, but in any case, the changes have resulted in what I  consider Deftones' greatest, most original statement yet.<br />    The  lead-off track, the oddly titled &quot;feiticeira&quot; is pretty mush  standard Deftones, with a massive, heavy wall of guitar, bass, and drums  (and supposedly a DJ, though I honestly cannot hear one on the entire  album)backing Chino's Beutiful, haunting vocals, which, like most tracks on  the album, are noticably lacking in the scream department.  The lyrics to  this one are quite eerie, the story of someone being kidnapped in a car  sang, like all the songs, in the first person.     It's on &quot;digital  bath&quot;, the second song on the album, that things start to get really  weird.   For most of the song, its just drums, Chino's vocals, and a kinda  jazzy keyboard thing, before it gets typically Deftones heavy at the end.   The lyrics to this song are particuraly cryptic, kinda soothing yet kinda  creepy at the same time, and the vocals are beautiful.     Chino must have  been saving up all his screaming for the third song on the album,  &quot;elite&quot;, which is heavier than anything Deftones have done  before.  This track is a non-stop mosh-fest that never lets up in intensity  for one second, and is definitly the best song on the album for rocking out  to.  The lyrics are appropriatly nasty, if still somewhat cryptic, to match  the forociousness of the music.    Things mellow out a little on the next  track, &quot;rx queen&quot;, which seems like sort of an odd love song.   Personally, its my favorite song on the album, because it perfectly  balances the heaviness of the Deftones we've come to know and love with  their newfound sense of beauty and assecability.     the next track,  &quot;street carp&quot; is a bit heavier, although not as heavy as  &quot;elite&quot;.  It's pretty much straight-forward Deftones with a  little bit of a nasty touch on the lyrics, which are as cryptic as always,  mabye even a little weirder than usual.     after &quot;street carp&quot;  comes &quot;teenager&quot;, the mellowist, most beautiful Deftones song  yet.  Actually, it's the most beautiful song I've ever heard, from Deftones  or anyone else for that matter!  Of course the usual Deftones musical  backdrop of heavy, distorted guitar, bass, and drums could never produce  music this beautiful, so instead we get Chino's gorgeous crooning over a  techno-ish drum beat and some odd-sounding piano.  The lyrics to this song  are slightly less cryptic than the rest of the album, and are extremely  heartfelt and heartbroken, kinda like The Cure at their absolute best  (think &quot;Pictures of You&quot; or &quot;Letter To Elise&quot;).  They  (the lyrics)sound like they're about a lover moving away.  Great, great  stuff.     Following &quot;teenager&quot; is &quot;knife prty&quot;, which  neatly balances the beauty and melody of the previous track and  &quot;digital bath&quot; with the heaviness of &quot;elite&quot;.  The  lyrics, like all of the Deftones' lyrics, are still pretty cryptic, but I  can at least gather that the song has something to do with knives (no  kidding).     Next up is &quot;korea&quot; which is definitly one of the  heavier tracks, and while it's still quite good (as everything Deftones do  is) it's probably my least favorite song on the album, simply because it  lacks the overt uniqueness of the other tracks.  The lyrics, like always,  are, you guessed it, quite cryptic, and have a darker element to them not  found elsewhere on the album.  Although the imagery is very abstract, you  get the impression that whatever it is Chino's singing about, it's  something unpleasent.  I guess this song is the album's centerpiece, of  sorts, since it makes sort-of a half reference to the &quot;White  Pony&quot;.     after &quot;korea&quot; comes the awsome, powerful,  haunting &quot;passenger&quot;, a duet with Tool/A Perfect Circle frontman  Maynard James Keenan, who sings a majority of the lyrics and who's powerful  presence easily upstages Chino's more subdued vocals.  Two of my all-time  favorite vocalists sharing vocal duties? What could possibly be better?  obviosly nothing, making this one of &quot;White Pony&quot;'s definite  stand-out tracks.  The lyrics are a little bit more straight forward on  this song, which seems to be about someone in a car just &quot;enjoying the  moment&quot;, if you will, to the fullest extent. Next up is &quot;change  (in the house of flies)&quot;, which is the first single from the album,  and probably the most &quot;Deftones-ish&quot; song on here, sounding a lot  like their first big hit &quot;My Own Summer (Shove It)&quot;, but with  more melodic vocals.  The song is very pretty, but kind of spooky at the  same time, and definitly has the best chorus on the album, very easy to  sing along with.  I'm sure the lyrics are metaphorical, but in the song  Chino sings about watching someone turn into a fly, taking them home,  pulling of their wings, laughing, and ultimatly paying the price for it. In  one word, Great.    The last song on the album is &quot;pink maggit&quot;,  which is pretty long and drawn out.  It starts out slow and kinda spacey,  but picks up at the end and gets really good, if a bit repetitive.  The  lyrics to this one are really out-there, so I'm not even gonna try to  analyse them.  Oh, and the heartbeat at the end is pretty cool, reminds me  a little of Pink Floyd.<br />    All and all, this, &quot;White Pony&quot;,  Deftones' third and most original, emotional, beautiful, and yes, heavy,  single thing I have ever heard, and wholeheartedly encourage anyone who is  interested, not to mention anyone who loves Deftones, to check this  masterpiece out RIGHT NOW!
B00004T9UF|5.0|Woah!  Its been a long time since I bought an album on spec but this one really paid off. Eminem is sooooo witty and he says all the stuff that half the time I wish I had the balls to say, not only this he does to the tune  of catchy riffs and cool samples.  Every time I listen to it I hear a  line  that I missed before.  Luckily, having a sense of humour, I know better  than to take half the stuff too seriously but I would worry that there are  looneys out there who will take it to heart and do the kinda stuff that he  sings about.  This is going to be playing on a loop on my stereo for a long  time yet.  He the man!
B00003W8NM|3.0|first off, let me establish that i admire fincher as a director, (SEVEN was excellent), this film is well shot, and as usual edward norton is excellent, along with brad pitt... but please, if i have to listen once  more to spoiled, rich actors decrying the capitalist system that they  themselves have exploited... and the &quot;provocative&quot; ideas explored  here? let me sum up-- &quot;material possesions are bad, there's more to  life than your things, find your own truth&quot;-- gee, thanks for that  guys... one last thing, the ending, far from being clever, cheapens all  that has proceeded it, and is akin to an &quot;it was all a dream&quot;  episode from countless sitcoms... all concerned could have done far better
B00004T9UF|5.0|WOW! That's all I have to say. This boy can RAP! I used to only listen to black rappers like MC Hammer and Will Smith, but Eminem showed me that white people can rap, too. He cusses up a storm, and seems angry at a lot  of people (he even &quot;disses&quot; Britney Spears, my favorite singer,  but I can forgive him since he's so good at rapping), but what really  shines through for me is his ability to RAP. Yes, that's what the album is  all about - RAPPING. As a child I beatboxed and freestyled in the  playground, and later I even bought a mixer, a 303, and two Technics 1200  turntables, but I was never a RAPPER the way Eminem is. (Actually, the  purpose of the electronics purchases I referred to was to &quot;DJ,&quot;  but that's another story. Suffice it to say I wasn't very good at that  either.) Yes, Eminem is a very good RAPPER, and that's why he sells so many  records. He may say some wild and crazy stuff, and even get rude and cuss,  like when he talks about his mom or his wife, and how he want to kill both  of them, but his RAPPING makes it all sound pretty darned good if you ask  me.
B000009ED0|5.0|Kid Rock Rules! I say that in all honesty. I'm really not into the new trend in rap and rock, but for some reason I think Kid Rock's amazing. I think it's really cool that he's been around this long. He's also an  amazing musician which he really doesn't get credit for. Devil Without A  Cause is a true masterpiece. Kid Rock blends many styles on this album such  as metal, rap, and country. He's very public about his influences but Kid  Rock's sound is all his own. <br />The album starts with the song that  launched him into superstardom, Bawitdaba. The next song is also another  one of his huge hits Cowboy. That song is totally different than Bawitdaba.  It has kind of a country vibe to it with some honky tonk piano in the  middle. The title track is one of the best songs on the whole album. It  features a rap by Kid Rock's vertically challenged sidekick Joe C. I am the  Bullgod was the first single from Devil w/o a Cause. Roving Gangster is a  dtraight forward rap rocker. In my opinion the only person who could pull  this off is Kid. The next song Wasting Time is kind of a mellow song with  Kid Rock rapping and a pretty cool chorus. Welcome 2 the Party is without a  doubt the best song on the album. It's totally old school rap in the style  of Run DMC. It's an amazing song. I Got One for Ya is another mellow type  rap songs. Somebody's Gotta Feel This is a straight forward metal song.  Which features Kid Rock rapping (as usual)The big radio hit and mellow  ballad type song, Only God Knows Why is one of the strong points on the  album. There is also a duet (if you will) with another white rapper from  Detroit, Eminem. While I'm not a fan of Em he sounds good rapping on quite  possibly the heaviest song on the album F**k Off. The last two songs on  Devil w/o A Cause are totally different form each other. Where U at Rock is  a heavy rap song in the style of F**k Off. This is also one of the best  songs on the album. The closing track Black Chick, White Guy is a songabout an interracial couple. It is also said to be autobiographical but I  don't know for sure. Either way this is an amazing album. I think everyone  should own it. Weather you're into rap rock or not.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are back with one of their best albums and without a doubt their most diverse. Californication also marks the return of original replacement guitarist John Fruschiante. This is the first Red  Hot Chili Peppers album since 1995's amazing One Hot Minute.  Californication begins with upbeat funky rocker Around the World. Flea's  bass playing is truly amazing. The next song Parallel Universe is one of  the finest songs on the album. Scar Tissue the album's first single and  first hit is next. The music is amazing. John Fruschiante's slide playing  is excellent. The other big hit form the album Otherside is next. That song  like the rest of the album is amazing. This album unlike every other Chili  Peppers album is filled with slow ballad type songs such as Porcelain, Scar  Tissue, This Velvet Glove Road Trippin, Otherside, Parallel Universe, and  the title track. Long time Pepper fans need not worry, there's plenty of  old school funk rockers on here such as Get On Top, Right On Time, Purple  Stain, I Like Dirt, and Savior. One of if not the best song on the album  Easily is nothing like they've ever done before. It's not a ballad and it's  not a funk rock song. It's just pure rock. It also features an amazing  guitar solo. Californication is an amazing cd and I strongly suggest that  everyone get it. Also first time listeners be sure to get One Hot Minute,  Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Mothers Milk, and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan.
B00000I8NC|5.0|This record is quite simply amazing.  3 guitars, 2 basses, violin, cello and 2 percussionists take the listener on a journey through empty highways, lost loves and hard times, yet always the music drives forward...a dreary  picture with an optimistic theme.  Masterful melodies, astounding dynamics,  and brilliantly composed music, this is something you will listen to over  and over again, and contrary to another review Godspeed You Black Emperor  sounds absolutely nothing like Mogwai.  I don't recall Mogwai having a  strings section, 20 minute pieces, or creating anything that even remotely  resembles this.  I suppose the biggest difference is that this is really  good.
B000021XR5|5.0|In 1996 when STP released Tiny Music... I bought it and it was my favorite album by them. So after 3 years when I heard that No.4 was going to be released I naturally set very high standards for it. I must say it blew me  away. I didn't think they had the time to actually write and record a full  album with Scott's problems but they once again shocked everyone and  delivered the best album of their career. If you're expecting a polished  studio album this is not the one. No.4 is plain and simply a raw rock album  from the beginning of Down to the end of Atlanta the album blends straight  forward guitar rock with trippy delicate ballads such as Sour Girl and  Atlanta the latter features Scott sounding almost identical to Jim Morrison  on a song that could have been an outtake from Strange Days by the Doors.  The definate strong point of the album are the rockers such as Down, No Way  Out, Sex &amp; Violence, MC5, Heaven &amp; Hot Rods, and Pruno. There is  not a bad song on the entire cd. Another great song is Church on Tuesday  which doesn't quite qualify as a ballad or a rocker it's somewhere in  between. This album is a classic which I reccomend to anyone who likes good  music and for first time listeners pick up the other 3 albums because they  are amazing as well. STP=Great Music
0446525537|3.0|Of his three books thus far, I found this to be the one I least recommend.  The story is touching, but not really &quot;believable&quot; enough to capture me emotionally.  I still would recommend reading it if you are a  Sparks fan, but of the three, it comes in last place.
B000002MTR|5.0|One Hot Minute is an essential album for any music fan. It features guitarist Dave Navarro formerly from the alt metal band Jane's Addiction. His style of guitar playing gave the Peppers a heavier edge. Warped, the  albums first single and possibly the heaviest RHCP song kicks off the  album. The pop rocker &quot;hit&quot; off the album Aeroplane follows. That  song is great. Deep Kick features lead singer Anthony Kiedis speaking about  his youth in California before the song kicks in to rockin' mode. It also  features Flea singing in the outro about his childhood. My Friends, the  ballad, the hit is next. It features a cool guitar solo by Dave Navarro.  Coffee Shop is pure funk rock which is what the Red Hot Chili Peppers do  best. The short Flea &quot;solo song&quot; Pea is next. It is apparent that  he has an amazing sense of humor. The heavy sing along One Big Mob follows.  This is one of the coolest songs they did when I saw them on the OHM tour.  It got the crowd going. Walkabout is an amazing mellow funk rocker.  Tearjerker is another ballad. The song works very well for them. The title  track is another rocker. It's also one of the best songs on the album.  Falling into Grace is pure funk. The guitar playing is amazing. This  another one of the best songs on the album. Shallow Be Thy Game features  Flea's amazing bass playing then kicks into yet another rocker. The album  closer Transcending is an upbeat ballad which gets heavy halfway through  the song and stays that way until the end of the song. One Hot Minute is an  amazing album. It's just a shame that Dave Navarro left before they were  able to make another album together. I'm sure it would have been great.  Anyway I think that everyone should own this album.
6305750750|4.0|I know that I have to be very careful when I say this, so here it goes.  I have loved star wars all of my life and for me to say anything else would be a lie.  That being said the original trillogy has had over 20 years to become popular and familliar with fans.  EVERYBODY takes these movies  completely for granted. Like I said I love star wars, but it's like fans  all over the world have been brainwashed into believing that they are the  most important movies ever. How can any movie live up to expectations that  high?  The answer is it won't.  Episode 1 is a good movie that follows in  the spirit of the original. I'd write a review,  but would you care? REALLY THE PHANTOM MENACE IS GOOD.
B00004TJTQ|5.0|&quot;My Dog Skip&quot; is a very touching film based on a true story.Willie Morris(Frankie Muniz:Malcolm In The Middle)receives a Jack Russell Terrier by the name of Skip for his ninth birthday.The film gives  you a glimpse into life during World War 2.But that's beside the point.It's  hard to make a movie that brings tears to my eyes.This one did that and  alot more.Not everything in this movie was realistic.BIG WHOOP!Was Star  Wars realistic? I DON'T THINK SO! No doubt someone complained about that  not being realistic,but since when do movies have to be realistic? Mike  Phillips,it's people like yourself that ruin a good movie like &quot;My Dog  Skip&quot; for all those people who have not seen the movie yet.I bought  this movie at Wal-Mart without bothering to rent it first or see it at the  theater.I read the review on the back and I knew I had picked out a  winner.I'm not going to give away the ending seeing how an editorial  reviewer already did that.I will tell you,however,that this movie will send  you through all of your emotions from extreme happiness to some of the  worst heartache you will ever experience from watching a movie.I recommend  this movie to anyone who can watch a movie and forget about what fictional  events were in the movie.Your rating system does not allow me to give this  movie the number of stars it deserves.THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY  LIFE!
B00003CX5A|4.0|I really wanted to see this film on the big screen while it was playing in theatres, but unfortunately I never got the chance, but I do think the DVD version is about as close as you can get. <br />Since I was a kid I had always  loved the story of the Headless Horseman and Ichabod Crane. I remember  sitting in front of the television around Holloween watching the cartoon  version featuring the voice of Bing Crosby. Tim Burton however brings a  very different look and feel to the story of \\"Sleepy Hollow\\". As with all  of his films \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is a very dark ( i.e. Batman &amp; Batman  Returns) and visually rich film. In this version Ichabod Crane is a  constable from New York instead of a schoolteacher, and he has been sent to  the village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the decapitations of two of  villages residents. At its core \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is a murder mystery.  Admittedly not your typical mystery, but it really works. <br />Johnny Depp  stars as the reluctant hero trying debunk the legend of the Horseman by  explaining things through scientific techniques. He falls in love with the  daughter of the towns' leaders, and soon enlists her help in getting to the  bottom of the grizzly murders. Though Depp has made a career of playing the  offbeat character, he really comes through with a terrific performance as  the young detective struggling with what he sees and what he thinks to be  true. The supporting cast around Depp is wonderful, and full of people you  recognize but don't really know. I love Burton's use of color, and the way  he makes everything look so dreary. His depiction of turn of the century  New England is fascinating and the look and costumes of the townspeople are  also top notch. I also applaud the casting of Christopher Walken in the  role of the Horseman with a head. Walken always brings some little  something extra to any character he plays, especially the evil ones. The  scenes in which the Horseman reeks havoc on the town are really exciting  and well choreographed. The headless black figure on the enormous black  stallion is quite a site, and looks real enough.<br />At times \\"Sleepy Hollow\\"  tends to be a bit too gory, and spills a bit more blood than needed to make  it's point, but it is usually essential to the story. I found myself  wanting to like this movie, and maybe that's why I did, but I think this  version of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow is definitely worth a look. The  visual and special effects alone are really worth watching the film for. I  don't know that this is a movie I would watch over and over, but I wouldn't  mind having it to watch around Holloween, though it's a far cry from the  Bing Crosby version.
6305903182|3.0|Enough already! I will admit that I loved the original \\"Scream\\" and I was interested in \\"Scream 2\\" to see what happened next, but \\"Scream 3\\"? I think I wasted my time. I know that I am probably in the minority here, but I  think that everything that the original movie did to restore the slasher  film to its glory this movie undid.<br />The opening scene does reach out a  grab you, and gets the action rolling, but eventually you find yourself  hoping these characters would die a little faster. The three remaining main  characters once again find themselves the target of a serial killer. Only  this time it is obvious that the writers were straining to come up with a  reason for this killer to terrorize his victims, (oh by the way, several  years ago...this happened...and then...) and when you do finally get the climax  of the picture, it is a major disappointment. <br />The action takes place in  Hollywood, as each of the cast members (inlcuding Jenny McCarthy) in the  \\"Stab 3\\" (the movie within the movie) begin to tun up dead; murdered by a  sadistic killer that leaves messages for the police in the form of old  photographs of Sidney Prescott's dead mother. Dewey (David Arquette), Gale  (Courtney Cox) and Sidney (Neve Campbell) start to help the police track  down this killer. I guess the problem I have with this film is this:<br />In  the first film we established the \\"rules\\" for a horror movie, but in this  film everyone seems to have forgotten them. Sidney walks onto a dark movie  set alone, knowing that a murder has already been committed there.  Characters wonder off into a large dark mansion and decide to split up. We  see people who should know better say things like \\"Wait here.\\" Or \\"I'll be  right back.\\" Then out of the blue Randy the video store geek who died in  \\"Scream 2\\" shows up in the form of a video he recorded before he died, just  in case the gang ever came up against a killer a third time and needed his  help. Excuse me! How stupid are we supposed to be!  Although his little  monologue is hilarious, it is so totally unbelievable that I have trouble  coming up with the right words.  <br />Wes Craven also returns to direct and  does a decent job directing some very good actors in a very bad script.  There were none of the \\"Man I didn't see that coming!\\" moments in this  movie, and that's what I have come to expect from the \\"Scream\\" series.  Personally I saw the ending coming a mile away. I didn't get the person  right, but I nailed the circumstances leading up to it all. It's not that  I'm that smart, but trust me you don't have to be a genius to figure this  lame plot twist out.One of the few bright spots is Parker Posey. She plays  the \\"Stab 3\\" version of Gale Weathers and is absolutely hilarious playing  her to the hilt. There is also a very brief cameo by Carrie Fisher that is  mildly amusing. Over all the movie was huge disappointment, and had it not  been for the outtakes and deleted scenes on the DVD I would have really  felt cheated. <br />Given the state of the Scream plot line, I guess there was  only so much you could do with, but making a movie for the sake of making a  movie is not the way to go. And it really is a shame, because they could  have done some great things with the cast they assembled. If you need this  movie to complete the trilogy, then by all means buy it. But if you're  thinking of buying it, I'd rent it first.
B000001FTD|5.0|As many reviewers have already pointed out, this classic album is a must.  If you have any interest in thrash-style heavy metal, then you simply have to own this record.  &quot;Among the Living&quot; came out in 1987, right  in the middle of what is, in my opinion, heavy metal's best period  (1985-1989).  It stands out as one of the best metal records of that  period, and as one of the most influential.<br />It's hard to decide which is  the best aspect of this record: the songwriting; Scott Ian's brilliant,  revolutionary guitar riffs; or Charlie Benante's drumming.  Obviously,  without any one of these elements, this record would not be as incredible  as it is, but I think the most essential element has to be Scott Ian's  guitar work.  There has never been a better writer or player of metal riffs  (witness &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; by S.O.D.).<br />I could go on and  on, but I'll stop here.  If you do not own this record, I envy you the  incredible experience of discovering &quot;Among the Living.&quot;
B00000J7JO|5.0|The Chili Peppers own sound takes center stage in their newest album &quot;Californication&quot;.  You could really take about 6 songs on this album and make them all singles.  The best song on the album in my opinion  is &quot;Otherside&quot; in which lead singer Anthony's voice is  unmistakable and Flea's guitar to back that up makes a deadly combo for  great music.  All of RHCP's albums are great but in  &quot;Californication&quot; they returned to their roots of California.  a  friend of mine Pat Peenwah says he gets chills when he listens to this  album.  Pick it up now!
158234082X|3.0|I bought this book because I thought reading about the behind the scenes type stories of such restaurants would be insightful.  The author does give some information, but the book is mostly an autobiography of someone few of  us care to learn more about.  I learned far more than I needed, or would  ever want to know about Anthony Bourdain, and what I did learn, led me to  the conclusion that he is an arrorant, self-centered, euro-trash urbanite,  who can probably cook quite well, but is WAY too full of himself.  I  leanred very little about the inner workings of the 5 star restsurant  kitchen,  Save your money
B00003XB8K|1.0|OK, in ten years, Creatu and company have gone from interesting enthic bending dance/trance to numbing workout muzak with frigteningly big brother-esque overtones (Push The Limits). Not that self help muzak doesn't  have it's place in the universe, but let's not give it massive airplay  (judging by sales, it's not getting it!). It's fine for the stair-stepper,  but once you get off, what's really here that you can't find in your  average elevator? Buy a dance music disc to workout, or some Brian Eno to  chill, but skip this waste of plastic.
6303921248|5.0|I am practically speechless after watching this brilliant series. Once I started, I couldn't stop. I watched 4 hours in a row and never noticed the passage of time. The actors so completely convince you of their intentions  and emotions, you'll think you know them all personally. The rapid-fire  delivery of the complex, 18th century-style dialogue is positively amazing.  Miss Ehle and Mr. Firth, in the lead roles, give performances that can only  be described as perfect. I don't normally purchase videos, but I'll make an  exception here. I must own this!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I bought this DVD without have seen this movie, only because my friends said it was soo cool. And they were right, this is one of those &quot;I've got to see this again&quot; movies... Even if violence is strong here, it's  not the purpouse... it's just the path to show you something. The DVD has a  really great presentation, I'd like all my DVDs to have this kind of case.  They're using two DVDs, one for the Movie and the other for the extras...  that's great. So, if you are not sure if you should buy this or not, don't  hesitate and buy it right now.
6302797535|5.0|A great spoof on the detectives,Charlie Chan played by  Peter Sellers,Hercule Poirot played by James Coco,Miss Marple played by Elsa Lanchester,and Humphrey Bogart played by Peter Falk.There is also Eilene  Brennan,Nancy Wlaker,David Niven,Maggie Smith,Truman Capote,Alec  Guiness,and Estelle Winwood.The Comedy is first rate.An excellent  spoof.This will make you laugh.
B000002KYB|5.0|This is beautiful music. Mark Knopfler is an excellent song writer and his music transcends any category you place on it. I would have to call this symphonic rock for its wide open space, orchestral style arrangements. This  album demonstrates excellent use of dynamics (volume), harmony, melody and  counter-melody. The musicians on this album are superb. I find this album  really touches something in me. The lyrics are beautiful as well. For some  people the weakness on this album may be Mark's voice, very gravelly and  untrained but I personally find it part of the charm. He still is able to  communicate great emotion with his voice which is most important. The songs  are long, but means that they have more room to develop and a more complete  form. The influences here are blues, latin, classical  and rock. The song  arrangements and structure have some similarities to Pink Floyd, but there  is more focus on melody rather than just ambient sound scapes. This is an  album for people who love beautiful melancholic music of any sort and  serious music appreciators.

0140277447|2.0|I have been in Japan for three years. I have just read so many postings from us that are not mere reviews to promote our understanding of the Japanese history; they are actually one-sided attacks on Japan and  Japanese--and what's worse, typical racial-discrimination with strong bias.  In fact Iris Chang's expertness and knowledge of Japanese language and  history are too little to write such a book as she did. Besides Japanese  are well-aware of dark side of their history. What's more it is true that  they haven't repeated the mistake for more than a half century since 1945.  However, so many of us are making critiques based only on what we know to  be true at home. Let me put it in this way. If we started to condemn  Europeans about their atrocities in days past, they would laugh at us--  &quot; Go back to the cowboys and Indians time, and see what you did!&quot;  --Europeans don't want to hear &quot;preach&quot; on their history,  particularly from us, Americans. But every one of us loves to talk about  how our country is better, how things we do are the best way and how the  world we percieve is true. So I suggest the Americans who carelessly blame  Japan stay for a while in Japan. Then they will notice how humbly and  sincerely Japanese are feeling guilty about the war crimes. Without konwing  it, unfortunately, we tend to become a watchdog, ready to bark at their  flaws we supposedly find. However, it is an issue that is supposedly left  for Japanese, not for us, Americans, to judge how far the Japanese owe  China an apologize for the incident during WWII. I would rather say that  attacking only Japanese as many of us did here, is hurting sincere  Japanese--and in fact it's a sly racism. I am afraid it helps nothing but  raises their hostility against Americans. For them I would like to  apologize.

6305910103|5.0|Okay, I will.  Star Trek II is the best of the movies.  It's better than three quarters of the original series episodes.  It's better than 90% of the Next Generation and Deep Space Nine episodes.  Don't even get me  started on Voyager, that blight on the good name of Star Trek.<br />This film  has all the Star Trek elements that made Trek good and the ones that made  it fun too.  Yes, Shatner and Montalban overact but admit it, you wouldn't  have it any other way.
B000002HH2|4.0|A friend of mine introduced me to the sounds of Bjork one day, and I have not been the same since.  My first outing with Bjork was the incredible &quot;Homogenic&quot;, her very last album.  Then, I was introduced to this  album, &quot;Post.&quot; The album is nothing short of incredible.  The  only reason I give it 4 stars vs. 5 is due to the fact that two of the  songs I do not particularly care for, and I believe &quot;Homogenic&quot;  to be the best album she has released thus far.  &quot;Post&quot; is an  album of wonderful melody and imagination.  It is an album that, in my  opinion, is the best album to throw at someone who has never heard of  Bjork.  Although &quot;Homogenic&quot; is a better album, it's a bit tough  to listen to if you are not open to such sounds.  &quot;Post&quot; is a bit  more accessible and melodic.  The standouts in my opinion are  &quot;Isobel&quot;, &quot;All These Modern Things&quot;, and the absolutely  beautiful &quot;Hyper-Ballad.&quot; &quot;Hyper-Ballad&quot; alone is a  song which should be heard by everyone.  It truly shows how amazing music  can be sometimes.  The video for it is also beautiful to watch.  Listening  to music like this reminds you what music can do for people, and for the  world in general.  Bjork captures all that is good in music, and challenges  us to imagine more.  I am glad she became a part of my life.
0783219172|5.0|In one sentence, &quot;The Frighteners&quot; is like &quot;Dead Alive&quot; without gore. Instead of zombies, we've got the ghosts of the deceased (mostly friendly) and Michael J Fox as their ghostbuster. Peter  Jackson again lets his very special kind of humour run loose, and this is  what makes this flick so wonderful. Fox and some cool ghosts make a team -  the supernatural guys haunt a house, Fox is called on and  &quot;exterminates&quot; them. Then he encounters sweet  Andie-MacDowell-lookalike Alvarado whose husband has deceased recently (and  now finds himself in a new existence) and a murderous eerie scythe-wielding  ghost who, in fact, once was a maniacal killer who wrought slaughter in a  hospital several years ago and now is back for more bloodbath. Well, Fox  feels it's his duty to stop this guy... I don't want to tell too much about  the story as it holds many surprises you should discover yourself. The  performances are very good, and there are lots of supporting actors like  Jeffrey Combs (nearly hadn't recognized the former  &quot;Re-Animator&quot;), Gary Busey (who fought against murderous giant  bugs in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;) or Dee Wallace Stone (once the  mother of &quot;E.T.&quot;'s best friend Elliot)... This film's a must for  everyone in fancy of a good horror comedy - not to mention everyone  worshipping Jackson and his works!
6302994063|4.0|Strictly Ballroom is a great little movie, lively and shot through with warmth despite some truly crazed, broad, caricaturish minor performances. If this were a novel I'd describe it as having a distinctively funny,  charming, idiosyncratic voice, and recommend it to friends who need a kick  in the pants to cheer up a little.<br />The dance contest plot of the movie  drags a lot of disparate stuff along in its wake. You have your extremely  winning ungainly-girl-whose-spirit-makes-her-lovely story, and your  immigrants-in-a-new-country side, and your redemption-after-many-years  moments... None of that is new material, but it all comes together with  total assurance in ways you wouldn't have been especially prepared for. All  the elements are snappily handled, lively and enjoyable, and in some cases  they're really pretty poignant too. Several of the minor characterizations  are surprising and memorable. That's always a good sign, isn't it?<br />Along  the way, too, you get a bunch of infectiously funny situations and some  wryly delightful direction. (The choreography doesn't stop on the dance  floor, but it's great there too.)<br />I wouldn't describe Strictly Ballroom  as displaying any &quot;new steps,&quot; cinematically; I'd just say it  dances the familiar ones extremely well in new, lively combinations. Watch  it and dance in the living room afterward.
0399142533|4.0|I have to say, as debut novels go, Lee Child reached out and  grabbed my full attention with this one.  From beginning to end, there wasn't one part of this book that didn't keep me wondering what was going to happen next.   Despite being a little graphic in a couple of places (which is to be  expected in this type of book), I immensely appreciate an author who can  write a book like this that holds your interest and attention and not once  felt compelled to the 'f' word (or some of the other vulgarities that some  authors feel the need to use).  I have already started his second Jack  Reacher novel, and so far it promises to be as good as this one.

While My Guitar Gently weeps, i dont have to say  anything about this...they boys are with Clapton what could be better?  Martha My Dear, this song posses another kind of easing power that only  Your Mother Should Know, Shes Leaving Home, and You've Got To Hide Your  Love Away, a truely awsome peice of work. Blackbird...the best acoustic  song ever, congratulations paul you pulled of the best song on the album,  it is truely poetic.

B00003CX59|5.0|Totaly amazing. With excelent special effects, and great acting, this movie goes strait to the top of my list.  The plot was well layed out, and organized. The movie itself was almost in black and white with just enough  color to realize that it's not. Some may think this is a lame effect, but  it really adds to the scenes. There was plenty of suspence, and horror.  There was barily any dull scenes. The actors were really belevable in their  roles. You almost feel as if you are there in 1790 with them. A great movie  if your looking for something to keep you on the edge of your seat. I would  recomend this to anyone above 13-14 years old. There's really not that much  to make it rated R.

B000002G87|5.0|This album is the defining moment of Eric Clapton's career. Now, that's not to discount Duane Allman's excellent contribution (especially on slide guitar), or the other musicians. Indeed, Jim Gordon's drumming is great  throughout, especially on the cover of Little Wing. Bobby Whitlock handles  easily his multitude of keyboards, and Carl Radle is steady as ever on  bass. But it's Clapton who really shines, these are his most inspired  performances ever. Just listen to Bell Bottom Blues, Tell The Truth, and  Have You Ever Loved A Woman. The songs just ring out with emotion. The  aforementioned cover of Hendrix's Little Wing is great as well, and I would  say even better than the original. And, of course, who could forget the  title track? It is, in my opinion, one of the best songs ever recorded. The  riff is impeccable, and Duane's slide playing is phenomenal. And the piano  coda at the end is beyond amazing. A must-own album indeed.
B000001Y5X|5.0|Okay, most people will probably think I'm exaggerating, but if I were going to be stuck somewhere with a CD player and I was only allowed to bring one CD, this would be my CD of choice. <br />I know what you're thinking  &quot;Why not Antichrist Superstar?&quot;. Well, I'm the wrong person to  ask because I don't even like ACS. As far as I'm concerned the band reached  its peak with this album and then sunk afterwords.<br />Why is this album so  great? I'll give you two reasons. 1)Manson wasn't making any money so he  was at his creative peak and 2)Daisy Berkowitz, my personal favorite  guitarist. His amazingly creative/innovative guitar lines and Manson's  spooky childish lyrics mix wonderfully. This is creative rock n' roll at  its best. It never tries to be anythign more than spooky kids rock (unlike  Manson's later attempts at goth/industrial/glam).<br />Stick with the original  band (Manson/Berkowitz/Gein/Gacy/Lucas). Stick with the best. Marilyn  Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids forever.
B000002VMD|5.0|This soundtrack holds one of the best and longest lasting #1 singles of all time and that is of course &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; The single alone is a good reason to purchase this soundtrack. &quot;I'm Every  Woman&quot; is another great song which makes this soundtrack worth while.  It is definately the second best Whitney Houston CDs. The first being her  timeless debut album. Her others are only so-so. This is the #1 soundtrack  of all time and no wonder! Every music fan should have it in their  collection whether you're a Whitney fan or not. There are also a couple  okay songs by other artists such as Kenny G. and the SOUL SYSTEM. You gotta  have it!
0790733897|4.0|You have to watch this movie for the car chase if for no other reason.  And it is the car chase between McQueen's Mustang and the Dodge Charger that most people remember this movie for... But, there is more to it than  that. Steve McQueen is just about perfect as the world weary but dedicated  police Lt. Frank Bullitt. Out to get the killer who shot one of the police  officers assigned to his detail to protect a mob informer.  When politics  and self-interest on the part of Bullitt's bosses in the department, gets  in his way, he goes right ahead, bucking authority.  Jacqueline Bisset is  lovely as usual and is a fine plot point as well.  Setting us up for some  soul searching and to ask just what is the cost for dealing with killers  and victims day after day. The soundtrack is very good. Never getting in  the way of the story and propelling us along with it.  The bass line at the  beginning of the car chase gets you in the proper mood very well. A fair  piece of the credit for this film has to go to Don Gordon as Frank's  partner, Delgetti.  Perfectly played in udertones. He looks more like a  police detective than McQueen does. Also, this movie started a trend for  turtle neck sweaters with blazers... After this movie came out, if you  looked up &quot;Cool&quot; in the dictonairy, you saw McQueen's picture and  a note to watch this movie.
B000002MUW|4.0|This CD definately has some catchy songs,but I wouldn't say it's better than Like a Prayer or Ray of Light. &quot;Secret&quot; is a catchy,soft-rock tune. The title track &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; is weird  (no wonder,it was written by Bjork!) but I guess it's okay. &quot;Human  Nature&quot; has a lot of cursing (I'm not your b**ch,don't hang your s**t  on me!),but it's still a great song. My favorite has to be the the #1  single &quot;Take a Bow.&quot; It's perhaps Madonna's best ballad. All 'n  all,if you are a Madonna fan,you gotta have this one.
6305776369|4.0|If you like fun, wacky movies that just take you away, this could be the film for you.  It has a lot of great one liners and some great physical comedy.<br />Molly Shannon gives a great comedic performance in the role of  Mary Katherine Gallagher.  She has some great monolouges, especially when  she recites famous movie dialouge from &quot;Sybil&quot; and &quot;Portrait  of a Teenage Centerfold&quot;.  <br />The only irritating thing is this movie  is Will Ferrel.  His portrayl of Mary's concious, or &quot;God&quot; is a  little grating.<br />Elaine Hendrix is great as &quot;Evian&quot;.<br />If you  want a good laugh, and are a fan of wacky comedy, you'll enjoy this movie!
B000002U82|5.0|This album changed my perception of music and took me to higher levels of musical enjoyment.  Pink Floyd's music contains so much that you can't take it all in at once.  This album represents the peak of all music, a  masterpiece of lyricism and imagery that will take you to another world,  inside the music.  The clockchimes of Time, the cashregister of Money, and  the extremely trippy organ solo named Any Colour You Like have become the  songs of my life.

I'm in my early teens and the is the best book i think i will ever read! The fact that it's set back  in medevil japan makes the author have to do alot of research and even the  use of japanese words must have been a challange! I lerned so much about  medeviel japan from this book! I am personally a huge fan of everything  japanese, especially Anime(japanese Animation).

B00004BZ0N|5.0|There may be albums as good as London Calling but none are better.  The Clash were way ahead of their time and this album was their peak.  I remember hearing it when it first came out.  I was 14 years old and I  remember thinking, &quot;This is what a rock and roll band should sound  like!&quot;<br />The Clash were inventive, creative and took risks by playing  types of music (here, reggae and ska; later, rap and funk)that were foreign  to most rock fans.  They refused to be pigeonholed and stretched the  boundaries of what &quot;rock&quot; bands could play.  Most current bands  are deeply indebted to them; Most current bands couldn't come close to  matching their awesome fury and power.<br />This album is an absolute  necessity for any fan of rock music.  If you don't already own it, there is  something very wrong with your taste in music.

With a great sound by th BPO, a good conduction from Abbado (the best complement of Pollini) with a glorious playing of Maurizio Pollini. Hear him in the three  moods of the 4th concerto, or the spirit in &quot;emperor&quot; and the  misterius touch in the 3th. With profundity and plenitude these artist  joined the best of them and give us an excellent recording. One but: Why  them dont record th choral fantasy?. Listen them. The best: 4th concerto.  Listen it
6303394000|5.0|I just watched this movie after hearing about it for a while, I loved it! It was errie the way Joe's life ended and the way Fosse's life ended further down the line. It's almost like hw perdicted his own death.<br />As  everyone sles I loved the line &quot;It's show time Folks.&quot; but even  more then that I loved the seans themselves the process that it takes for  Joe to get to showtime. This movie is for any brodway fan, but I recomend  it to hard core Fosse fans
0671042858|3.0|This was definitely not King's greatest work. As a mother of an almost-9-year-old, I found King's description of Trisha's thoughts too far off base.  Additionally, I didn't buy that a 9-year-old would do the things  King has her doing.  Nevertheless, I was intrigued with finding out how it  ended.
0553213105|5.0|This is certainly a great love story and will survive for generations.<br />I would like to point out something.  Perhaps some  British peope or people familiar with British society will be able to give me a satisfactory  answer.  While Mr Darcy abhored people who are ill-bred, unsophisticated  and mediocre it is diffcult to see how he could put up with people like  Lady Catherine, Caroline Bingley and Louisa Hurst who are just as bad as  Mrs Bennet, Kitty Bennet and Lydia Bennet.  The latter group had less money  and social status.  Is this the reason ?
0784010528|3.0|This movie only shows one side of Jim Morrison and includes some false information.  In any event it is a movie worth seeing if you are interested in Morrison and good music.  Just don't be mislead.
1559408898|4.0|Despite its simplistic and quite-laughable title, Robocop is a wonderful piece of satirical science-fiction.  In the Criterion edition, the amount of &quot;excessively violent&quot; added footage amounts to less than a  couple of minutes but helps to make the story whole.  This violence isn't  there just for kicks; it actually fits the overall context of the  particular scenes and further defines the story.  Despite the MPAA's  decision to give the added scenes a rating of &quot;X&quot; (remember, this  was in 1987, well before the NC-17 rating existed), I can honestly say that  I've seen worse violence in other R-rated films.  In any case, the movie is  now restored to its entirety and one aspect of Murphy's execution scene  suddenly makes a lot more sense.  The Criterion edition includes many  extras, only a few of which are excellent.  Most, however, are for ardent  movie fans only.  The audio commentary by director Verhoeven, executive  producer Jon Davison, and co-writer Neumeier is very interesting but  uneven: some passages are quite enlightening while others are awfully  banal.  The film-to-storyboard comparison is mildly interesting, for once  you've seen it, it's enough.  The two storyboards showing unfilmed scenes  are rather unremarkable novelties, although the cemetary scene would have  been a great touch to add in the movie.  The illustrated essay on the  making of the movie is very lengthy and sometimes overly detailed.  The  amount of time devoted to the design/production/animation of the ED 209  robot is excessive and goes on ad nauseam.  An index feature within this  essay would have been helpful because if you exit at any time before  reaching the end, you must start all over again.  The two trailers are  surprising in that they somehow made the movie look like a low-budget  snorefest.  Fortunately for us, it's exactly the opposite.  I would have  given 5 stars for the restored movie alone, but some of the Criterion  extras being what they are, Isubtracted one star.  Still worth getting,  however.

B00000IPAX|2.0|Although I do not own this recording, I have heard most (if not all) of the songs in one place or another. From hearing Adam's Song, I actually thought this CD might be worthwhile to buy. Then I listened to some of the  other ones, and realized it was a waste of money. First off, they purposly  make their voices sound whiny, which really turned me off. Second, the  songs have an annoying theme. They have a bass &amp; snare drum loop with a  guitar chord that occasionally changes,and in comes whiny voices. Most of  you are probably thinking this kid doesn't have a clue what he's talking  about, but I like some alternative but I have come to not enjoy Blink 182.  The only reason someone might buy this CD would probably be for attention.  Other than that, I can't find a good reason why. If you want to like them  but just can't stand listening to them, here's a tip: Find a TV channel  that has the &quot;All the small things&quot; video playing, turn the  volume down, and enjoy the boy band bashing.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad is the first financial advice book that didn't put me to sleep.  The rich dad's advice to &quot;mine your own business&quot; really hit home with both my husband and me.  How many years we have spent  minding other peoples businesses and making them rich and keeping ourselves  on the rat race track (just like we were so carefully taught.) I bought  this book for both my sons and have at least 6 friends who have purchased  this book.  Too bad we didn't have this basic eye opening information many  years ago. Even though some of this information we &quot;kind of knew or  suspected&quot; it had a mind changing, impact to see it actually admitted  in print.
6305903182|5.0|I wanted to see this despite the discouraging reports I had heard about Williamson not being involved and Kruger taking over.  In my opinion it was a wonderful ending to one of the best trilogies I've ever seen.  It really  stayed true to the same actors portraying the characters,  Campbell,  Arquette, and Cox, and even the original dad of Sidney's was there.  It was  a stroke of genious to have Parker Posey and Patrick Dempsey in this movie  also.  Parker was hilarious!  I saw that a lot of people didn't like the  audio commentary, I loved it!  It was so interesting to hear Wes and the  others commenting on their work and what their vision was.  Kudos to  everyone involved with this movie!
B00004SYWZ|4.0|WEA must be shooting themselves in the foot with lack of support for this album (review from UK base).  I never really rated this Norweigan lot highly but you cannot deny that this is filled with tracks from the top  drawer. Best album this year by a significant margin. Leave your  preconceptions of the funny leather wristbands and the funny 80's pop -  albeit not bad pop - behind and purchase this. I'm glad to hear the album  is doing well in Europe and only hope that the next single gets the  promotion and airplay it deserves to get this this very excellent album  bounding back up to charts. I'm off to buy Memorial Beach...working in  reverse order you see....
B0000025RQ|5.0|THE BAND: Rob Halford (vocals), Glenn Tipton (guitars), K.K. Downing (guitars), Ian Hill (bass), Dave Holland (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1982) 10 songs originally clocking in at approximately 39 minutes. This newly digitally remastered edition (2001) contains 2 bonus tracks extending the listen to approximately 51 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet containing band photos, song titles, credits and lyrics. Recorded at Ibiza Sound Studios, Ibiza, Spain. All songs written by Halford, Tipton and Downing (except \\"Take These Chains\\" by unknown writer to me, R.Halligan). Label - Columbia/Sony.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Rob Halford & Co delivery an incredible album with \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\". They hit their commercial top with this '82 release. Thanks to other British hard rock and metal acts like Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, and Ozzy (solo)... Judas Priest and their brand of music were hugely popular. They gained momentum early on with several of their 70's albums (\\"Hell Bent For Leather\\", \\"Stained Glass\\", and a killer live album \\"Unleashed In The East\\"). If not at the top of their careers with 1980's \\"British Steel\\" (then they were damn near close)...they maintained their high with \\"Point of Entry\\" (1981). And, they capped off their heavy metal motorcycle joyride with \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\". They really fell off the boat after that - slower record sales, Rob lost his hair, more commercial metal than hard core metal (with the exception of \\"Painkiller\\"), innocent children killing themselves while cranking up Judas Priest tunes, Court TV, sub-par solo projects, etc. This record established JP as a global heavy metal band and for good reason. Not a weak tune on the entire album. \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\" was a huge hit and remains their highest charting single to date. The other songs that didn't make it to the radio are classic British metal that hold this record together. \\"Riding On The Wind\\", \\"Bloodstone\\" and \\"Fever\\" are just plain awesome metal tunes. Start your Judas Priest collection with this one or \\"British Steel\\". This is the band's last great classic album (5-stars).unes.

B000001FI7|5.0|The different songs on this album are somewhat diverse.  They range from Jazzy &quot;lounge-type music&quot; to  melancholic electronic musical poems.  A must have for any and every music collector!
B000002GF8|5.0|&quot;Syncronicity&quot; is more than just the best overall album by the Police, it is one of the very best albums of the entire decade of the eighties. The Police always had incredible chops with their instruments,  and by now Sting had reached a more consistent songwriting maturity. This  is the ultimate headphones album, as fascinating discordant background  noises help create real atmosphere in addition to the elegant, spare use of  instrumentation - the one-handed piano part on &quot;Every Breath You  Take&quot; being one fine example of how they used exactly what was needed,  nothing more or less. There are great ideas, a unified vision, great song  sequencing (the way one song follows the next), superb production values on  the recordings, and as always, excellent playing by a great band.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I love this Cd. It has awesome songs like Criminal,The Real Slim Shady,Stan,and Marshall Mathers. This is one of my favorite Cds. So I reccomend you go out and buy this awesome Rappers Cd.
0140277447|5.0|This is a great and courageous work that tells it like it was. Whatever ludicrous and vicious  lies the Japanese may tell to distort the truth and no matter how hard they try to attack  this book, there's no escaping from  the truth.
B00004RD54|3.0|Here Reed does a wonderful job of transforming some of his classic songs into dull, generic 70's arena rock.  Most of the songs are still great, but they are really hard to appreciate in this format 25 years on and Reed's  vocals are really unconvincing.  The remaster sounds fantastic,  though.<br />If you are new to Reed, I don't think this is a good place to  start.  His best music has a timeless quality to it, whereas this record  sounds hopelessly stuck in the 70's.  Out of what's in print domestically,  I'd recommend &quot;The Blue Mask&quot; or &quot;New York&quot; as good  starting points for exploring his solo career.
6304383827|5.0|Ah, this is a fun movie!<br />A relatively faithful adaptation of the Jane Austen novel is a bigscreen treat (the recent &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; was a disaster). Even looking at the cover is nice.<br />An unusually good  Gwyneth Paltrow plays the well-intentioned but inept Emma, a pretty, witty  aristocrat who believes that &quot;the most beautiful thing in the world is  a match well made!&quot; Having married off her ex-governess to a family  friend, she decides to take a poor friend of hers under her wing and find  Harriet Smith a husband, but royally botches it in the process. Amid the  tangle of loves, infatuations, and deceptions, Emma discovers that her own  true love has been standing off to the side...<br />Paltrow is genuinely  enjoyable-she practically glows. Ewan McGregor is totally convincing as the  two-faced charmer Frank Churchill (despite his own claims, he does a good  job). The actors playing Mr. Knightly, Harriet Smith, and the usual smarmy  pastor and his creep of a wife are jewels.<br />It doesn't have quite the  emotional resonance of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, the BBC  &quot;Mansfield Park,&quot; or &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; but  &quot;Emma&quot; is something of a lightweight story--there isn't much in  the way of scandals. It's a nice bit of G-rated fun and comedy, enjoyable  but not too heavy.

0451167716|4.0|Great literature this aint.  But Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a lot of fun.  The imagery alone is breathtaking - an injured mobster in a white suit running in the streets, holding his hat to catch the blood flowing  from his neck...a bloated, bearish Godfather suffering a heart attack among  the plump tomatoes in his garden.  This is luscious stuff. Before reading  the novel, I thought Coppola was a genius. Puzo is the genius. I'm  convinced any director could turn this novel into a great film.  OK, well  maybe Coppola is a genius, but he couldn't ask for better material.  Take  this one to the beach this summer!
B00000K2SC|5.0|How could anyone not like this movie!  &quot;The Matrix&quot; has the most spectacular special effects ever seen in a motion picture, the acting is flawless by both Reeves and Fishburne, it never gets boring, has a  fantastic story line and plot and always keeps you on the edge of your  seat. What else can you ask for? My favorite part is the helicopter scene.  If you've not seen it yet go check it out! It will completly blow you  away!
B0000214F3|5.0|Well, glancing through the reveiws it looked like just about everyone either really really loved it or really really hated it, which i can understand. i thought it was a wnderful, attention-grabbing, interesting,  thought-provking movie, but if you aren't into anything like that it would  be a drag.<br />Meet Joe Black is about, well, Joe Black. Who is death. And,  unfortunatley, arrives near the beginning of the movie to take one of the  main characters. Both Brad Pitt and Anthony hopkins do an excellent job  throughout the movie. They were well casted and truly did superbly with  their parts.<br />Not only was this movie interesting and very serious, it  also had parts that, yes, had me laughing out loud. <br />So just take good,  multiply it by infinity, take that to the power of forever and you may have  the faintest idea of what I'm talking about (I know if don't have the quote  right, but is it close enough for those of you who have seen the movie? Oh  well, if you see it you will understand what I'm talking about)
B00003CXA6|5.0|I am a re-enactor and know some people who participated as re-enacting extras in this movie...they all agree that the film makers spent a lot of time to get this on right.  Besides being a great movie, it is fairly  historically accurate for being based on a fiction book by Michael Shaara.   I hope this movie will soon be available for DVD, so help me by voting that  this movie should go DVD.

No. Im shocked  by this being such a bad movie, disconected, unpleasant to watch due to bad  direction.

B0000024LN|5.0|This albums is defintly one of the best of it's genre's. This album is Redman at his best. The album kicks off with the song &quot;Iz he 4 real&quot;, which is an unbelievable track. I have never in my life  experienced an album where every song on the album is great. I would have  to honestly say that the album &quot;Muddy Waters&quot; has, AT THE MOST, 2  songs that aren't incredible. But, all other songs on this album are  incredible. There is something on this album for everyone. If you are an  intelligent rap fan, and understand what the whole game is all about. Than  you will appreciate this album. I suggest you buy it, you will not go  wrong.

I like every song on the CD,  but my favorite song is Calm Like A Bomb.  It has awesome guitar playing by  Tom Morello.  I hope Rage Against The Machine keeps releasing great albums  like this one.
0440539811|5.0|Alright, I don't even like to read.  I am a product of television and movies... I would rather watch reruns of Full House then read Dickens, but THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT.  After the first 100 pages I didn't see what all  the hype was about, but by the time I was finished with the first part of  the trilogy I was hooked.  I never put this book down.  I never stopped  thinking about it.  I never wanted to read anything else ever again.  All I  can say is, if you like history, comedy, fantasy, and just plain odd and  original stories...  I can't imagine finding  a more entertaining book.                                      -MGT
B000002HMH|4.0|Some say that Load is Metallica's most disappointing CD.  I do not agree that it is their worst CD but I will say it is not their best.  In Load, most of the songs aren't as powerful as ones on Kill Em All, Master of  Puppets, or their self-titled album, but they are still very good songs.  I  think that the most powerful song on the CD would have to be track 5.  The  guitars in that song sound just plain awesome.  Track 5 also has a really  cool video too.  And another track Metallica fans should check out is No.  1.  I do not believe that Metallica has ever made a song like that before.   It has a very fast beat.  My favorite tracks on the CD are 1, 3, 5, 6, 10.   So I suggest buying this CD.
B00000J7JO|5.0|When I first listened to Scar Tissue, the music actually  seeped through me for a while. The song is unique and with the strong vocal of Anthony Kiedis, I started to like the song even more. And with their good  coordination between the bassist, guitarist, drummer and the lead, they are  just perfect!<br />When Otherside is being played in the radio, I just knew  that  I have to get the CD. While Scar Tissue is unique to its  own style,  the latter has that catchy tune to it that just makes  me want to sing  along. You know ... &quot; How long, how long  will I slide Separate my  side I don't...&quot;<br />Besides these two songs that are deeply affiliated  to me,  Californication, Porcelain and Road Trippin' are notable  tracks to  look out for. Porcelain is a slow number that is mellow that makes you  wanna to drift away to sleep. <br />For funky/heavy tracks, try listen to  Around the World,  Parallel Universe, Easily and Savior. In my opinion,  they are the best tracks you can get in this album. <br />If this CD is a  delicacy, I'm sure you'll crave for more after the 1st helping! Try this  out today.

B000007OY0|5.0|When this film first came out back in the early '90s, I resisted all praise and acclamations. I was not a big fan of Stephen King back then nor prison movies. How wrong I was.<br />&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is  now one my all time favorite movies. This powerful yet exquisitely  addicting flick shimmers with a lyrical quality unmatched in any book of  prose. Morgan Freeman, as &quot;Red&quot;, narrates the complex story of  one intelligent man, Andy, who is wrongly imprisoned for murder. Andy, an  ex-banker, played perfectly by Tim Robbins, quietly lives his life behind  bars and in the sand-yard. But is he resigned to this life? No. He subtly  works his magical patience and resolve over a span of many years and  delivers to other memorable characters and to us, the one thing we all need  to know exists....hope.<br />One of my first favorite scenes is when Andy  outwits a guard on a blazing hot rooftop for a few icy cold beers for  himself and other prisoners. As I am writing this review, I am smiling.  There is so much to this tale....<br />Beautifully shot, well adapted, and  perfectly casted, &quot;Shawshank&quot; will forever be a shimmering wave  of emotion....rolling, thundering, smashing and slowly ebbing to the  shore.<br />Thanks for your interest &amp; comments--CDS
B0000041Z6|4.0|The Chicago Symphony Orchestra would have to be the best Mahler orchestra imaginable. However, Sir Georg Solti, the famous multi-grammy award winning conductor of the CSO, ruins some aspects of Mahler's most important symphonies.<br />For an instance, pay attention to a couple of the first few  movements of Symphony No. 1. Weak right? Then we arrive at the beginning of  the fourth movement. BOOM BOOM BOOM! One can obviously tell, in listening  to Solti's interpretations, that he really doesn't seem to pay enough  attention to the sensitive more emotional themes. When it comes to anger or  some dark form of behavior, Solti takes advantage and plays his part with  his powerful orchestra. <br />Some other aspects are way too obvious to  include. Listen for yourself as an experimental experience. The best here  is Symphony No. 8. I am glad Solti took major advantage over this piece. He  could've done better with Symphony No. 3, but it's one of the best out  there, I love it. Symphony No. 7 is perfect. The rest you find out for  yourself. Give this box set a try at the bargain price so worthy of  purchase.

B00004TRD8|5.0|This movie is one of the best Sci-fi/ Drama action movies to drop since the day it came out. This and the matrix. I saw the first terminator and was hooked but I never expected to see a sequel. This almost makes the  first one look like nothing. They even made a 3-d ride out of it in florida  which is just as good as the movie. Anyone who hasen't had the cahnce to  check it out needs to go see what i'm talking about because it is  action-packed from beginning to end. Getting back to the movie I have to  say if u have a home system don't hesitate cranking up the volume and  watching this. It will make it like your seeing this for the first time if  you haven't seen it already. The plot, action, and ending was all on point  and it's nothing I can really say I didn't like. It really made you think  about the future and what would happen when it came out. Even wathcing it  now makes you wonder. Overall, the creators out-did themselves with this.  The only question I have is will there be a part 3?  I guess we just have  to wait and see.
B00003CX6P|5.0|&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; makes for very intense and rousing entertainment, proving that Hollywood still has its charms and charisma when it wants to possess it. Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley, a  not-so-well-known man who comes across the oppurtunity of a lifetime when  he meets up with shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf, who asks Tom to  venture to Italy in order to convince his son to come back to America. Tom  soon arrives in Italy, meeting up with Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett),  then making his way to greet Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) and his fiancee,  Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). The more time Tom spends in the company of his  new-found friends, the more he becomes obsessed with tagging along on their  boating trips, hoping that they will take him with them wherever they go.  About the first hour into the film, the tension between Dickie and Tom  grows, as Dickie begins to become tiresome of Tom's incessant company.  While on a small side trip to Rome, the two begin a heated fight that ends  in violence, and Dickie's death. Tom rids himself of the body and of his  guilt, and takes over the role of Dickie Greenleaf, wearing his clothes,  taking care of his business, lying this wayand that about Dickie's  whereabouts to anyone that knows the both of them. From this point on,  there is nothing but a constant amount of growing tension as Tom's secrets  come close to being revealed. <br />Set and costume design on this piece are  breathtaking, and truly make the setting of 1950's Italy a genuine one.  Damon is terrific as Ripley; Law stands out in one of his best roles since  &quot;Gattaca;&quot; Paltrow is superb in her role, which changes in tone  during the second half of the film; Blanchett plays her role out with a  certain amount of annoyance, which is perfect for a character who seems to  always pop into Tom's life at the most innoppurtune times. The plot is  nothing short of a masterpiece, and has been well adapted from the novel.  The underlying themes of homosexuality and bisexuality are excellently  brought to light in certain aspects of the movie, and it seems to be the  master explanation for Tom's wanting to be a permanent part of Dickie's  life. To sum it up, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; is a breathtaking  period piece that will sweep its viewers into a uncontrollable frenzy of  mystery, suspense, and the need for love and acceptance.
B00004W5UA|5.0|Fight Club, for many reasons, was one of the best films of 1999, and disappointingly overlooked. The author of the book on which this film is based (Chuck Palahniuk) introduces us to the main characters in a horifying  scene in which Brad Pitt is about to blow Edward Norton's head off at close  range, with the gun in Norton's mouth. Confused, the audience is lured into  the story which roams through the recent history that explains the opening  scene's situation.<br />The lead characters, played by Edward Norton, Brad  Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter, are all quirky, neurotic archetypes of the  20th century - each personality clearly nurtured and twisted by the  materialism and violence and dissatisfaction of urban American life. Their  roles are woven together incestuously as their characters are developed and  unfolded through Fight Club.<br />The club that emerges in the movie becomes  more than just a support gathering, and seems to take on a life of it's  own, like some computer system gone awry - like HAL in 2001. At last, no  one is the leader, and all are bound to be led, to be destroyed. <br />Does  this at all make you curious? Are you intrigued by the film at all? Have I  successfully avoided giving away the important bits of action and  revelation?<br />The most significant thing about Fight Club is how shakingly  close to home the subject matter hits. While we drug ourselves into  indifference with chemicals and furniture and busy-ness, we lose sense of  life itself. We lose power over our environment and over our own individual  existence. Let go - find out what else there is down deep below the surface  of your perfect shimmering facade.<br />See Fight Club
0767803434|4.0|I know that special effects are supposed to make a story better, but this is one case where they ruin the film to a certain extent. &quot;Air Force One&quot; contains a terrific storyline, along with a great cast of stars.  Harrison Ford plays the President who, along with his family and Cabinet  members, are beginning a return journey from Russia, where they have  kidnapped the self=proclaimed leader of a small country on the brink of  rebellion. Before take-off, a camera crew boards the plane, headed by Gary  Oldman. Soon, the camera crew is revealed as being a group of terrorists  who begin killing at random and hold the remaining survivors hostage in  return for the release of their leader. Ford makes the president a true  hero as he tries to stop the plane and the terrorists, and the story never  stops moving as things unfold. However, the special effects are not  believable in all places, and while the majority of the shots look honestly  true, there is always something to give away the computer wizardry. This  movie is a good movie, and I reccommend watching it on DVD instead of VHS  for better experiencing of this film.
0790749998|5.0|&quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; is a great martial arts film starring the highly talented Jet Li.  His style of fighting cannot be compared to, by any means.  Also starring in this movie are Aaliyah, Delroy Lindo, and  Russel Wong (another talented martial artist).  With great action  sequences, a great plot, and cute humor, you're sure to enjoy this movie.   I have owned this movie since it's theater release, and have watched it  nearly every day...and have not gotten tired of it.
B00003CWRX|5.0|This was one of the year's best films.  The cinematography is awesome, and the acting was fantastic.  Al Pacino played a devoted journalist who stumbles onto perhaps the century's biggest and most costliest scandals  (with regard to human life.)  Russell Crowe (Jeffrey Wigand) is a  downtrodden businessman/scientist who's life seemingly spins out of control  when he is fired from Brown &amp; Williamson.<br />To regain his integrity and  make some sense out of his life he decides to tell the truth about what the  tobacco companies really knew about their deadly and addictive product.  From there his life becomes a hellish torture of slander and subliminal  messages (bullet in the mailbox.)  Somehow Wigand manages to keep his  sanity and he brings down big tobacco by revealing all in a courtroom.<br />This film was perhaps Crowe's best work.  After seeing Gladiator (Crowe  was great in that too) I was impressed to witness Crowe's character range.  He went from a aging businessman/scientist to a war scarred Roman army  general.  Wow, very good work I must say.<br />Watch this film and see a  defining point in American history.
1573221562|5.0|Ms. Waters has created a novel that is a curiously satisfying mixture of Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens, and Toni Morrison. The narrative style and empathetic female characters are of Bronte; the description and  carefully drawn settings and character names are truly Dickensian; and the  craftwork of the plot and language are reminiscent of Morrison.  The  story's framework, told by the journals of both Selina and Margaret, is  skillful and well-suited to the plot.  I felt immersed in the life of  Millbank and the inner turmoil of Margaret.  As soon as I finished this  book, I recommended it to friends and began to read it again, looking for  subtle clues and shadings that were adeptly woven into the story, leading  to its conclusion.  This book was, without a doubt, the best current  fiction I have read in quite some time.
B000001DQI|5.0|The year was 1973.  I was a young pup of 13.  This double album had so many great songs that Elton John became my favorite singer  (aside from Elvis Presley, whom I say  in concert that year!).  It has so many great songs on it!  It rose to my  top 100 list in 1981, when at the age of 21, my best friend was  accidentally killed by a shot gun blast.  Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies  Bleeding is one pop tune I've never been able to forget.
B000002LIX|5.0|Look Ritual De La Habitual is a period peice,  made during a the time of the Gulf War and economic recession it is reflextive of how people wanted to escape.  It came out just before &quot;alternative&quot; music was  popular and is a combination of suicidal tendencies, motley crue, and  Slayer.  Ritual is a very exciting record and is very energetic!  Anyone  who was a teenager in the late eightees or 90's as i was can appreciate  Ritual!
6302732875|5.0|Usually, when a film features a cast this good, it never lives up to its promise.  Not this time.  The movie features Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin and Alec Balwin (who is only on screen for  five minutes, but they are easily the best five minutes of his entire  career).  How good is it?  Well it can be ranked at or very near the top of  all of those fine actors resumes.  David Mamet's screenplay gives them all  a chance to interact by shouting and cursing each other out in ways that  are almost musical.  Pacino and Spacey, Lemon and Spacey, Pacino and  Harris, those are just some of the more memorable verbal altrications.  And  the bleak and cutting portrayals of a salesman's existence gives the film a  sense of desperation that makes the performances even more powerful.  This  is one of the best films of the 1990s.
B00004UFYU|5.0|Great music...The more you listen to it the more you like it.Any news on Era 3!
0786882212|5.0|Trainspotting the movie was full of great details and funny dialogue that has to be tasted and thought about which like good wine gets better with age. <br />The companion interview with Irvine Welsh is a real treat. The man  is articulate, funny, and has a lot to say. It is seldom one can get inside  the author and his feelings on a movie that is made.<br />There is also a  preface written by John Hodge himself that details his process of from  writing Shallow Grave and how that movie got made and then how the others  convinced him to make trainspotting although he was terrible reluctant.  That in itself was an amazing story.<br />I loved his note to the readers  about how he was sorry he didn't put our favourite bits of the book in the  movie and how he didn't get to put his own favorites bits himself. He also  comments about the liberty he took with the text, and explained some of  them. As an Irvine Welsh fan I felt placated and had a new respect for  Hodge. <br />As for the screen play itself. You can read about Sick Boy's  ideas about Sean Connery, personal thoughts of renton, his relationship  with Diane, in detail. Everything in the movie is amplified. A small detail  and a big scene takes the same importance on the page.<br />I love picking it  up and reading my favourite bits. As an avid Irvine Welsh fan I could  really take the time to see what John Hodge added to the film and apreciate  it. <br />Watching the movie again takes about two hours of your time, and  replaying your favorite bits is never the same. This screen play allow you  to do just that without much effort. It is short and easy to read, and hey  to be honest, I didn't hear what was said in the film because of the  accents. Here I can read exactly what was said. If you love the book and/or  the movie god this is a great companion to go with it.
0316777722|5.0|What can I say about this author's new book that hasn't been said already?  It's a wonderful and wickedly funny book.  David really knows how to write and is probably the funniest author around today.  The first part of the  book begins with his North Carolina childhood and the second half moves to  Paris.  What a wonderful collection of essays.  I especially enjoyed  \\"Today's Special\\" and \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster.\\"  But really all of the  essays are so funny, and true to life.  To be able to put these everyday  events into words that are simple yet so funny, is truly a gift.   <br />Believe it or not I haven't read his previous book \\"Naked\\", but now its  being pulled off my library shelf to be read immediately.   When you start  to read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" you will want to sit and read it right  through, forget about dinner and everything else.  This book deserves more  than 5 stars.  David, we await your next collection with eagerness.
B000002P86|5.0|I like this CD!  B. B. King is accessible to everybody, even if you don't have a clue as to what the Blues, and this CD is proof!  I like hearing B. B. playing some of his greatest hits, as well as some new (for him)  material in duets with some of today's finest pop performers; Van Morrison,  Tracy Chapman, Eric Clapton, Mick Hucknall, Bonnie Raitt, Dr. John, Joe  Cocker, Marty Stuart, the Rolling Stones, and Willie Nelson (to name a  few).<br />For a look at B. B. doing what he does best (playing and singing  the Blues), check out the 1998's Greatest Hits compilation and Blues On The  Bayou.
B000002AP1|4.0|This album sounds so much harder than anything i've ever heard.  I'm only 16, and picked up this album on recommendation, and i have to say it's amazing.  The whole band is like an explosion and Iggy Pop is right with  them with all his yells and screams.  Under all the chaos you can still  find melody, and through all the fuzz the bass drums and guitar are all so  locked tight and thrashing like it's the last performance they will ever  make.  Who thought that snobby hard rock could be intelligent art?
0553108034|3.0|The first book introduced a very detailed world and the rather &quot;earthy&quot; tone of the writing was refreshing.  My question is whether this is really simply a narrative of some role-playing group's  campaign?  It seems that the author by some random means--perhaps  dice?--decides every hundred or so pages to kill of what one thought to be  a main character.   <br />        Also, for the amount of pages you would hope  there would actually be more movement in the story rather than introducing  yet another mildly interesting character for no apparent reason.  <br />         I truly hope that Martin hasn't bought into the Jordanesque &quot;let's  see how much I can milk this for&quot; style of writing.  It would be a  shame, because the story line shows some very good flashes.
B00004SCX6|5.0|(IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ABOUT MY THOUGHTS ON BRITNEY , THEN SKIP TO THE BOTTOM TO READ MY REVIEW ON HER CD)Yes you heard me correctly. Britney is only 18 ,and I it is amazing hearing about all the records she has broken!  Who sold 12 million albums on their debut album- BRITNEY!  And who just  broke the female record with most albums sold in a week-BRITNEY.I am so  tired of hear that people just buy Brit's CD for her sexy pics and her  dancing. first of all people don't buy Cds for dancing (if you don't  understand then you need some brain cells). Ans second of all there are no  sexy pics of Brit on ither albums, all she does is show her belly? That  isn't sexy. I am also sick of hearing that what she wears is astounding!   Gimme me a break!  Okay so sometimes she does expose herself, but she is a  teenager who is still deciding who she wants to be and how she wants to  dress. Beside all you mothers w/daughters who worry about what Brit wears  have got bigger problems to obsess about such as rapers who teach the  lesson of violence in their music! Last but not least I want to talk  about the on-line competion b/t Christina and Britney. First of all you  must realize that Britney is the one who blazed an easy path for all those  female blondes to follow. She was constantly getting all the rumors thrown  at her and being put down while Christina,Mandy and Jessica troted joyfully  along their way following AND COPYING Brit.The only thing that really  annoys me is the fact that Christina won Brits Grammy for best new artist.  but..... (it is about time that Christina won something ).Britney worked  much,much harder than Christina and yet Christina's stuck up attitude  toward adults got her the grammy! And I think that it is so funny how  people say that Brit can't keep up w/Christina!  HELLO!  IT IS THE  OTHER WAY AROUND!   Christina has only sold 5 million albums Britney has  sold that in 2 months with her new album. WELL NOW THAT I GOT THAT OFF MY  CHEST LETS TALKABOUT BRITNEY's new album. I just got it the other day and  it is fantastic!  It is so completly different from her first. All the  songs could be singles and each have their own unique sound. You can tell  that Brit can relate to the whole album form Opps... to Lucky...... to Dear  Diary( written by Brit herself).Please give this album a chance with an  open mind while listening. Britney has definitely matured and her vocals  and lyrics are great!  And don't let the rumors,or her looks or cuz she  didn't win the grammy, prevent you form buying this wonderful CD!  IT IS SO  GREAT!  AND DON'T LET THESE MORONS WHO COME IN HERE AND WASTE THEIR TIME  WRITING BAD REVIEWS CUZ THEY HATE HER CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT BRIT! She  really is a fun, honest goofball( in a good way) kind of girl!  So go and  buy Brit's new album &quot;OPPS!... I DID IT AGAIN&quot;!  BEST ALBUM OF  2000!
6305313687|4.0|Before its release a lot of dirty laundry was being voiced about the production of American History X. I had been anticapating this film for quite sometime and was disappointed to hear the director disparaging his  own film. After viewing this movie I was conflicted. Without a doubt it is  very distrubing and powerful. On the other hand some elements of the movie,  technically speaky, are not perfect. I got to thinking does that matter.  American History X hit me brutally with its message and I have returned to  watch it more then few times. It works and thats what should count.<br />Your  New Line DVD was surprisingly devoid of extras. Standard trailers, and then  some deleted scenes. Thanks to the aforementioned production squabbles  American History X should have had some choice extras. Hopefully it will be  revisited. Good movie, sparse extras.
B00000018N|5.0|I did something recently I hadn't done in about 20 years. After hearing an interview with Ian Anderson and his playing cuts from his new solo release, The Secret Language of Birds, while driving home from work. I pulled into  the first record (are they still called that?) store I passed and bought  the CD. At the ripe age of 40, I usually don't just buy any recording on  impulse, I either replace old favorites, or carefully consider my spending.  Hearing new Ian Anderson music on the radio reminded me of just how much I  loved Jethro Tull when I was in high school. My two favorite Jethro Tull  albums are Aqualung and Thick As A Brick. I chose the former to include on  my top 100 list because it has such great music on it and it really holds  together as one of the first &quot;concept&quot; albums of the Rock Era. ~  I recommend the Gold Cd release of this classic, even though it costs a lot  more. Reason? It doesn't include the unnecessary extra tracks included on  the much cheaper re-release from EMI/Chrysalis of 1999. GET THE ORIGINAL!  And if you're new to Jethro Tull, check out the 2-CD sampler Best of Jethro  Tull.
B00003CWN2|4.0|This movie made me sick. I mean,,, I felt like throwing up and I had the shakes for a long time afterwards. Extremely violent &lt;towards the end&gt;, graphic and disturbing. You can hardly imagine scenes more  barbaric.<br />Based on the life of Teena Brandon, a woman, who in a sexual  crisis dresses up as a man and actually pulls it off (for a little while)  even falls in love with a girl and all that entails. Unfortunately Teena  got mixed up in the wrong crowd, though it is hard to imagine an  understanding right crowd for her. &lt;I do not know how much of the movie  holds true to her real life&gt; Flawless performance by Hillary Swank. In  fact the movie is outstanding!  as far as the acting goes. A gruesome,  tragic story. A chilling movie with not much to feel good about in the end.
6305905401|4.0|Empty your mind of all preconceived ideas about this film before viewing, and it will be a very worthwhile experience.  It is not a horror film.  It is definitely an occult film that takes a fresh look at the old theme of  His Unholiness making an appearance on earth.  The Ninth Gate has a  superior cast who perform their parts well under the direction of a  director with a worldwide reputation for genius, especially when it comes  to depicting the darker matters of the mind.  The film is what you would  expect from such a combination of human talent.  The strictly human  characters display themselves in such a way that it becomes possible to  read their minds and feel their motives.  In so doing, the necessity  of  the one supernatural character becomes abundantly clear.<br />Johnny Depp  plays Curso, a dealer in and locator of rare books who, as Balkan  (Langella's character) points out, is worthy of trust because his loyalty  can be bought.  Balkan pays the right price to have Depp travel from New  York to Lisbon and Paris in search of the two other copies of a rare book  Balkan has recently acquired--one that was supposedly co-authored by the  Devil and one of his most loyal disciples, the latter of whom was burned at  the stake in the 1600's for his own loyalty.  Balkan insists that he thinks  only one copy of the book is genuine, and he wants to make sure his copy is  the one.<br />It is obvious that Depp has no idea what he is getting himself  into, but for all his cynical disregard of humanity, he becomes the  &quot;innocent&quot; in this story, because he is the one person who  becomes aware and admits early on that he has no idea what he has gotten  into.  Balkan says he obtained his copy of the book in a true sale from the  owner just before the owner committed suicide.  However, the former owner's  widow insists that the book is hers and becomes the first person trying to  kill Curso in an effort to get it back--after the best of feminine wiles  don't get the job done.  At this point Curso's &quot;guardian angel&quot;,  whom he calls Green Eyes, enters the picture in the guise of a wandering  college student whose appearances at first inspire distrust and  apprehension until she begins the rather pleasant habit of repeatedly  saving Curso's life.<br />The mysterious &quot;keys&quot; that will open the  Ninth Gate and let the Devil break through are contained in the set of nine  woodcuts within each book.  The woodcuts each contain interesting jumbled  adaptations of various images from the Tarot's Major Arcana--combinations  that give a clue to anyone familiar with the cards and their meanings that  everyone's traditional ideas regarding the occult were either dead wrong  all along or they are about to undergo--forgive the expression--one hell of  a change. Curso notes that there are significant variations in the woodcuts  in each volume of the three existing copies of the book.  Apparaently some  were drawn by the Devil himself and some by his advocate.<br />Curso also  notes that he is now being hounded not only by the avaricious widow and her  hit man, but also by Balkan, who seems to know his every move, not to  mention having knowledge about the  violent deaths of the owners of the  other two manuscripts.   Finally it is revealed that Balkan and the widow  are involved in a literal battle to the death to become the Master who  controls the Ninth Gate and the group of Devil worshippers who are this  century's congregation of those who have been waiting for that Master since  the book was first printed 350 years earlier.<br />There is humor throughout  this film, providing necessary comic relief at some very tense moments.   That humor is nowhere more evident than in the scene in which the widow  (who has managed to temporarily regain Balkan's copy of the book) is  leading the gathering of pathetic self-styled Satanists in an even more  pathetic, sterotypical black mass.  The scene at its opening is so mundane,you want to groan.   Then as it progresses, you realize that is part of the  director's intentional imagery to show how stupid the theories about  conjuring up and dealing with Old Scratch have always been.<br />This guy is  supposed to be the all powerful Prince of Darkness, right?  This is the guy  who can take your soul into hell for all eternity if you agree to the  arrangement.  And yet throughout history it is believed that if you draw a  circle around a pentagram on the ground or floor and stand in it, then  mutter a few incantations, the Devil will appear with his forked tail  between his legs and do whatever you ask.  This is the powerful adversary  of the Almighty?  Polanski has a very refreshing spin on that idea.  <br />In  The Ninth Gate we see Satan as a stronger contender--one perfectly capable  of appointing his &quot;chosen one&quot; among men.  Tired, evidently, of  insulting requests to preside as Master of Ceremonies at orgies and to give  individual megalomaniacs the power to rule the world, the Devil has decided  to run the show himself and to confer the honors of being his Commander in  Chief on a person who has proven himself a champion on the battlefield of  mundane evil.  <br />As for that &quot;obscure&quot; ending, we see Curso  walking alone toward the last eerie combination of Tarot symbols--The Star  (hope) imposed over the twin towers of The Moon (a card generally having to  do with the deepest and sometimes most sinister elements of the occult).   One tower is behind the other, giving the appearance of the two merging  into one Tower (symbol of total destruction).  Evidently the party games  are over.<br />A richly textured, beautifully filmed and well-acted modern  gothic tale.  I highly recommend it.

Distancing myself I could understand how this may appear to be a novelty.  But I assure you, it is not. Through Pooh Hoff explains the tenets of  Taosim. I was impressed with the philosophical and practical points  presented. Though I felt, and this was probably be design, that there is  more. That Taoism demands further study. In any event, an excellant  introductory. Pooh just it.

B00004T9UF|5.0|This album truly is a work of art by Eminem. His hard hitting up-front lyrics have caused a lot of bother recently in the press, and in several of these songs he is simply trying to make his point that there is nothing  wrong with him, and half of his lyrics are not serious. He does this  intelligently in his original and innovative style of rap. The rest of the  songs on the album are either his usual up-beat amusing raps (the real slim  shady, criminal) or his hard and explicit messages (kim, drug ballad,  stan). All in all, I believe that is is the best album of a single artist  that I have ever bought, and my advice is to order it from Amazon.com right  now.
6305165912|5.0|How to characterize such a film? Frankly it is impossible. Lebowski captures the nuances of life, while adding a tinge of outrageousness. For some reason unexplainable by myself, upon completion of a first viewing of  Lebowski many find it rather inane, myself included. If you are in that  contengent, encourage yourself to spend the necessary time to watch  Lebowski again. The DVD provides widescreen and fullscreen viewing  capabilities alongside a thirty minute promotional documentary of no real  merit. Though, the movie compensates for the lack of extra content.
B000002U3P|5.0|I only saw the movie recently, only hearing that it was one of the strangest, most obscene, and overall one of the most important films ever to come out of the U.K. Indie scene. &quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; is what I  thought. I'm a fan of indie films, but something about the concept of  heroin junkies didn't strike me. I finally saw the film, and I was taken  aback by just how lewd and oddly humorous the film was. I loved it  immediately! Part of the reason was because of the music. This soundtrack  is one of the must frantic collections for a film I've ever heard.  So-called Old-timers like Iggy Pop and Lou Reed on the same album with  '90's techno beat masters Underworld and alt. rockers like Blur, Pulp, and  Elastica, thrown in with some '80's dance music from New Order's classic  &quot;Temptation,&quot; and Sleeper's cover of Blondie's  &quot;Atomic.&quot; Sounds like an odd mix, but it worked. Somehow all of  these songs interspersed with each other (in the same order in which they  appeared in the film no less...I checked) work perfectly to convey the  emotions of sonic daydreaming and intoxicated ecstasy the film had. Iggy  Pop's &quot;Lust for Life&quot; is a wonderfully fast-paced anthem that  kicks off Trainspotting with a bang that shows just how much of a punch a  &quot;sincere honest drug habit&quot; can give the brain before shorting  out. &quot;Nightclubbing,&quot; also by Pop, is also a wonderful slow pump  that one could get high to, but also gives '90's music fans an idea of  where the beat to Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Closer&quot; might have been  inspired. Only one of the two Underworld songs from the film was put on  this CD, while the other had to be put on the dreadful second soundtrack.  Nonetheless, &quot;Born Slippy&quot; is a great song that starts out slow  and sad until kicking into a heavy pounding bass techno beat. Brian Eno's  song, &quot;Deep Blue Day,&quot; to me was unnecessary in both the movie  and the soundtrack, but...hey. &quot;A Perfect Day&quot; by Lou Reed is  also a bit of a sad song, sending chills down the listener's spine.  Leftfield's &quot;A Final Hit,&quot; Bedrock's &quot;For What You Dream  Of,&quot; and Primal Scream's ten-minute title track are also welcome  excursions into '90's techno and electronica, while Elastica, Blur, and  Pulp provide some sombre alt. rock moods, all of which give a sense of  fading Generation-X angst. The lounge feel of Pulp band member Damon  Albarn's &quot;Closet Romantic&quot; provides the humor to close the album  out. The album is upbeat and danceable, but amidst the pulsing beats is a  misery that compliments the film's characters' drug habits and the dreary  excuses of lives they lead. Great stuff! Get this album!
B00000J7JO|5.0|the chili peppers just seem to have their own magical style it's great. I love their music and this is their best cd yet. Otherside has a great almost depressing sound which really grabs you. Their music, lyrics, and  style are wonderful.

Zig Ziglar says that this book is &quot;common sense and market savvy for your financial future.&quot;  I  am hoping that this book will open up your mind and help you in the future.   I reccomend that you read his other two books entitled,&quot;The Cashflow  Quadrant&quot; and &quot;Rich Dad's Guide to Investing&quot; for further  increase in your financial intelligence.  As for me, I loved this book and  give it 5 big stars!
B00004RFFI|4.0|When I bought my Sony DVD-S360 a few weeks back, I didn't know if I would need the DTS feature or not.  However, after watching this movie, I am now a true believer in the power of DTS.  I don't have my DVD player hooked up  to a home sound system; it is &quot;just&quot; connected to my Sony  Trinitron TV.  With just the TV stereo speakers alone though, my sofa was  literally shaking . . . and the sound was only turned up one-quarter of the  way!<br />So, this movie is worth purchasing simply because of the awesome  sound, but the video effects ain't too shabby either.  I keep scratching my  head over and over each time I watch this flick.  How do they make the  &quot;sister&quot; tornadoes?  How do they drive through the house?  I  think my favorite part (and this is where the great Sony remote control  comes in handy) is watching the cow fly across the screen, and then pushing  the remote to make it go backwards.  A total hoot!<br />Um, there is a slight  problem with the ridiculous and often painfully bad moments of dialogue  that you have to sit through.  Fortunately, the DVD is equipped with a  scene selection screen; so you can jump right to the action scenes of  flying cows or exploding trucks.  I mean, really, what kind of man would  pick Helen Hunt over Jami Gertz?<br />I am a native of Iowa, and I now live in  the Central Valley of Northern California; and, I never see tornadoes out  here, let alone even a good thunderstorm.  So, whenever I feel like taking  a two-hour trip back to the Midwest, I just pop this movie in the DVD  player, and the memories of hiding in the basement with a blanket over my  head while the storm sirens wail all come back to me.
0060920084|3.0|One could accuse the book's subtitle - Travels in Small Town America - of being misleading: Bryson spends as much time in major cities (Philadelphia, New York) and national parks, or simply driving down the Interstate  listening to radio stations, as he does exploring the smaller settlements  of his homeland. Even when he does get out of the car (or his motel room),  he can hardly be said to 'explore': he speaks briefly with waitresses,  shopkeepers and other tourists but scarcely engages with any deeper stratum  of local life. One of the book's ironies, it could be said, is that Bryson  sticks as religiously to the conventional tourist agenda (museums,  battlefields and other 'places of interest') as the consumerist  day-trippers and backpackers he ritually scorns. But then the book does not  set out to be a serious travelogue. Indeed that is much of its point. It is  an antidote to worthy travel literature - and, by extension, a rebuke to  those who take such things too seriously. America exists for Bryson to make  jokes about, deplore, occasionally appreciate and then make more jokes  about. The Lost Continent reads like a cross between a good piece of travel  journalism and a first-class stand-up comedy routine: it is fast-paced,  relentlessly witty, shallow and eminently readable.

B00001U0DP|5.0|Before I watched this movie, I thought that it was set in a very bleak environment. But I never expected that I could be that wrong! <br />The movie began with cheers and laughter, showing viewers how Guido met his  &quot;princess&quot;.  It could be said that it for 'love at first sight'  for him.  His funny and romantic nature won the love of his  &quot;princess&quot;.<br />When they were married and had a little boy,  Joshua.  But good things never stay for long.  Guido and Joshua was sent to  the concentration camp.  When his wife learnt of this, she volunteered to  go to the camp with them.  Out of the love for his family, Guido hid the  truth of the ugliness of the war from his son by telling him that they were  on a holiday and playing a game in the camp.<br />This touching movie will  move the hearts of many, showing all that &quot; Life is Beautiful&quot; if  one allows it to be.
0684800713|5.0|Hemingway captures the disillusionment of a generation jilted by the Great War. He captures the nuances, feel, and attitude of this &quot;Lost Generation.&quot;        This is a piece which captures the mind set of a  people after the most signifigant event in modern history. But this is not  just a chronicle.        Hemingway's sentences are so simple yet when  deciphered (even blurbs of dialouge that don't play with the scene or  theme) we come to realize earthly truths from every color of the spectrum  of life.
6303160344|5.0|In &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; Virginia Woolf wrote, &quot;This late age of the world's experience had bred in them all, all men and women, a well of tears. Tears and sorrows; courage and endurance; a perfectly upright and  stoical bearing.&quot; In a way, Julie's story is a sort of theft of these  lines. In &quot;this late age of the world's experience,&quot; with all  moral and social certainty removed, Julie must make her way through a world  violently liberated from her family. Her aimless, nihilistic, and anonymous  lifestyle in a Paris flat after her tragic loss is not so much an attempt  to bring meaning back into her life, as it is an attempt to discover how to  live in a world without meaning.

B000007OTH|4.0|Like most classical musicians, I knew Max Bruch primarily for his music for solo violin, and did not think of him as a symphonist.  This set proves that Bruch was at home in both worlds. I wasn't sure what to expect, but  I've long been addicted to the symphonic tradition -- I'll listen to  anyone's symphony just to see what they'll do with the form.  The Op. 28,  first on the disc, struck me as being partway between Mendelssohn and  Brahms (would that be Schumann?), and the style is more or less the same  throughout the other two symphonies.  The most striking work in this  collection is &quot;In Memoriam,&quot; Op. 68, which is clearly influenced  by later ideas (or perhaps by the moodiness of Brahms' *younger* years, I  can't decide which).  Unlike some of the other lesser-known German  romantics, Bruch the symphonist seems to have had something to say and the  talent to say it.  This music is unjustly neglected and Masur and the  incomparable Gewandhausorchester give a fabulous reading.
B00004S6GL|5.0|I admit that i wasn't around before XO, or even before Figure 8, so i'm not really a 'purist' elliott smith fan...then again, i got into elliott smith because i knew he was once in a band with the lead  singer/instrumentalist in another band, much less well known than Smith  now, or even before-Quasi. So needless to say, i'm not coming from the  'mainstream' side. Anyhow, i love this album, and upon buying XO, i had  similar feelings. Go buy this record, and ignore anyone stupid enough to  give up elliott smith just cause he appeared on MTV (which does by the way  make me wanna smoke crack-MTV in general, that is) a couple times. You  _won't_ be disapointed.
630588255X|5.0|A lot of great movies have been poorly digitized or otherwise transfered to DVD without sufficient care and attention, but I was pleasantl surprised by the quality of this one. They found (or restored) a very clean and clear  original print of the film and then digitally captured it beautifully. The  soundtrack has also been enhanced with a remix of the Cat Stevens songs to  take advantage of the stereo front speakers and the subwoofer. A wonderful  movie, well presented.
B00004RFCM|5.0|This is one of the most intelligent series of all time.  Sarah Jessica Parker and her pals talk about things that would normally make me quiver, until I realize that I talk like them.  The characters in this show are  fab.  They are smart and sexy.  Two qualities I most look for in a man.   Carrie's sexcapades in New York City are certainly worth paying to see.   This show will appeal to average modern day women, and gay men.  Believe  me, this is something every fag hag can enjoy with her pals of both sexes.
0790729989|3.0|While the movie itself is a mind-bending experience not to be missed, stay away from this DVD.<br />Considering how long I waited for Seven to be released in this format, you would think they could have done a better job  with the extraordinary features of DVD.  Not only is the opening menu bland  and unoriginal, there are no special features of merit, and they didn't  even fit the entire film on one side of the DVD!  This is the *ONLY* film  in my DVD collection that I have to flip over to see the second half.   Compare this to &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; which has such great  features as a commentary soundtrack by the director, and your choice of  full screen or widescreen depending on the side of the disc you  play.<br />Lets just say it's fortunate I don't often show my  &quot;wrath&quot; because I'll admit this disc may be headed for a grusome  demise.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is one of those things you don't really compare (or shouldn't) because it CAN'T be compared.  Many people have commented to me 'well, it was ok, I like Comfortably numb and Run Like Hell'.  These people make me  crazy!  They say the story is pretentious, its gloomy, blah blah blah!    Maybe if they tried to understand the pure emotion and thoughts that fueled  this Waters (yes, WATERS, don't try to give David Gilmour a lot of  credit! ) genius they wouldn't feel this way.  The music is amazing, the  guitar is 100%, without a doubt my fav., everything about the music is  great.  All the things, the guitar, the hidden messages, the soft (and  loud) sound effects, the maniacal laughter, everything, just come together  and create a powerful mood, which sets the stage for the insightful,  beautiful, gloomy, realistic, lyrics, which I believe are what really bring  the Wall  its fame.  The lyrics convey such emotion that I really wonder,  sometimes, if Waters is human (well, thats sort of exaggerating) but  really!  If you really listen, then actually use your brain to figure their  meaning (well, the meaning that they convey to you) you become (at least I  do) caught up in a new world of thinking, I believe they bring something  new out in you.  In closing, i just want to say, if you listen to the wall,  decide you like Comfortably Numb, Run Like Hell, and maybe Another Brick in  The Wall Pt. 2, but could do without the rest, then you should return it!   The Wall is not meant to be just sort of listened to in pieces, and without  much attention, it is meant as one whole package and to be listened with  much attention! Attention to detail! Attention to lyrics!  Attention to the  very feelings that fuel it! If you do not feel this way about the Wall,  then you do not deserve to have it.  The Wall is a masterpiece, not a few  Master-PIECES, mixed with other &quot;filler&quot; songs.  Those who are  worthly, be happy! Those who are not, I feel sorry.
B000005843|5.0|Bolt Thrower, despite their name which had evoked so much mockery (i.e., &quot;Nut Chucker&quot;), did manage over four albums to evolve into a superior band in the underground/independant metal scene. For the  uninitated, their music can be classified simply as death metal, but this  album makes a strong appeal to the early '90's subgenre known as  &quot;grindcore&quot; (the name says it all). Death metal bands in the  early '90's tended to focus a lot on developing a distinct sound to set  them apart, since, admittingly, the genre of metal places many limitations  on itself as to what is acceptable and unacceptable songwriting-wise. Bolt  Thrower accomplished not just a distinctive sound, but a vastly effective  one with this album, which affords it an exceptional rating. The songs  themselves are of high mark as far death metal goes; true, many of the  songs will sound similar to some listeners--demarcation among songs of this  style of music is made by lyrics (although sung in a near non-dynamic  gutteral growl), tempo, and accents within guitar and drum parts.  Nevertheless, their success was to create a very true-to-spirit atomsphere  of aggression, war, and, um, aggression. It's a classic album that stands  on it own among a metal scene swamped, both then and now, by wannabe  imitators.<br />I damaged my first copy of this CD a couple years ago, and  hadn't listened to it again until recently, when I finally broke down and  got a new copy. It's just as enthralling now as it was when I first heard  it. Play this CD loudly on your stereo, and it feels like a fleet of tanks  juggernauting into combat at 50 MPH. What could be more fun?
B000002MM8|4.0|Oddly enough, if this album was made by any other artist that's even similar to Dead Can Dance it would have received five stars. But I couldn't help but feel something was missing here, something missing from Dead Can  Dance. This is not their best album, not by a long shot. And upon finishing  &quot;Into The Labyrinth&quot; my initial reaction was somewhat  disheartening. One of my favorite bands has made a great album (for the  non-Dead Can Dance fan, great doesn't measure up to their usual standard of  perfection). Great isn't a bad thing though, and this album has it's  moments, but something is definitely missing. It starts off with  &quot;Yulunga (Spirit Dance)&quot;, it has an arabic feel to it and sets  the flow of the album. The follow up, &quot;The Ubiquitous Mr.  Lovegrove&quot; is along the same vein of &quot;Yulunga&quot;. Those are  two great songs, but still, their Arabic/Egyptian feel is not as uplifting  as a Dead Can Dance fan would hope. Thankfully, what might be the best song  here, &quot;The Wind That Shakes The Barley&quot; left me in awe. The  beauty and power of Lisa Gerrard's voice is something not of this realm.  And &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; lives up to that as well thanks to  Brendan Perry and his crystal-clear voice. Sadly, the album takes a dip.  &quot;Ariadne&quot; is great, and &quot;Towards The Within&quot; isn't bad,  but &quot;Saldek&quot; is complete filler in my opinion. &quot;Tell Me  About The Forest (You Once Called Home)&quot; is breathtaking, yet another  highlight. It drops the Arabic/Egyptian feel for a more Gothic/Arcane one.  Very nice. During the middle of the song little Asian chimes come in, and  with horns and poetry lyrics, it stands up with &quot;The Wind That Shakes  The Barley&quot; and &quot;Tell Me About The Forest (You Once Called  Home)&quot;. &quot;The Spider's Stratagem&quot; is missing the usual magic  displayed in Dead Can Dance's songs. But &quot;Into The Labyrinth&quot;  closes wth two songs that definitely contain that magic.  &quot;Emmelia&quot; is a mesmerizing vocal performance. &quot;How Fortunate  The Man With None&quot; is Perry's best on the album. The piano notes near  the end are almost haunting. If you look at the better songs here, there is  a pretty strong line-up. But not up to the usual. The Arabic/Egyptian  influence is enough for me to break out my Ankh, but little else. I would  recommend &quot;Aion&quot; or &quot;Within The Realm Of A Dying Sun&quot;  before this, they're much better. But you may enjoy this for the very same  reason I didn't, I've talked to people who do. Still, it is Dead Can  Dance.......
B00001OH7Y|5.0|So-called 'true' Bowie fans like to think this is Bowie's last great album of his career.  How this is possible, I do not know, but this still one of my all time favorite albums.  Finally moving back from Berlin, and making  more and more public appearances since his &quot;Heroes&quot; tour, Bowie  seemed to have taken himself out of self-exile.  Although Bowie had ditched  his isolated and solemn attitude that flourishes on Low, Bowie still  refuses to be optimistic on his albums with the follow up to &quot;Space  Oddity.&quot;  The album starts up quite abruptly and with a sudden  surprise of &quot;It's No Game Pt. 1.&quot;  The listener hears a Japanese  'singer' screaming Bowie lyrics at the top of her lungs.  Suddenly Bowie  storms in attempting but failing to match up to the Japanese lady's high  and extremely loud voice.  It's still a great song and a clever idea!   Bowie's fascination with Japanese culture has popped up in many of his  previous albums.  Albums like &quot;Heroes,&quot; where, in a lyric to the  song &quot;Blackout,&quot; Bowie talks of &quot;becoming under Japanese  influence.&quot;  Also on &quot;Heroes,&quot; Bowie and Eno provide a  creative and fun instrumental named after the Japanese &quot;Moss  Garden.&quot;  On &quot;Up The Hill Backwards,&quot; Bowie seems to almost  endorse the infamous wisdom quote of &quot;What you don't know can't hurt  you.&quot;  In my opinion, Bowie is discussing the issue of people worrying  about problems and subjects that is either out of their hands or not of any  importance.  Without any doubt the title track &quot;Scary Monsters (And  Super Creeps)&quot; is written directly to Bowie's ex-wife Angie.  The line  &quot;She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do&quot;  completely gives it away (if it hadn't already).  In the song, Bowie seems  to think there is still a little hope to work out the marriage, and at  least seems to still love Angie.  Unfortunately, 12 years after Scary  Monsters' release, Bowie married his second wife, Iman.  As I have  mentioned before, Bowie is shown on Scary Monsters as little more down to  earth, yet still above normal with his creative and dramatic sequel to the  song &quot;Space Oddity.&quot;  In Bowie's 1969 single &quot;Space  Oddity,&quot; Bowie talks of Major Tom as being a hero and idol.  A role  model for millions of kids around the world.  Unexpectedly, Major Tom seems  to take a turn for the worst in &quot;Ashes To Ashes.&quot;  Major Tom  turns into a junky and is no longer that hero.  He wants to stop and  permanently end his addiction, but he just can't.  Does this look like an  autobiography to anyone else besides me?  The next track I cannot get  enough of.  I suspect Bowie thought up the idea of &quot;Fashion&quot;  after RCA Record Executives got on his case after hearing clips of Low.   Bowie describes a world where fashion and outer-beauty mean more anything  else.  People copy one another, and there is no room for creativity and  individuality.  What a horrid world!  What else can be said about  &quot;Teenage Wildlife&quot;!  Everything about the song I love!  Reminding  me of the song &quot;Sons Of The Silent Age,&quot; Bowie scolds the younger  generation.  While they plead with him in hallways to write them a hit  song.  Bowie gets upset and impatient in this song, and perhaps a bit  cocky.  Bowie is probably the best songwriter in modern times, and is  capable of writing a number 1 hit song at anytime of the day.  He seems to  resent the fact that he is now the veteran of rock music, and that other  musicians come to him for advice.  In Bowie's mind I'm sure he still feels  that he is still that young kid coming to John Lennon for advice on how to  break away from MainMan and Tony DeFries.  With one glance at the lyrics of  &quot;Scream Like A Baby&quot; and you'll know exactly what the song is  about.  This certain song has been the center of many lawsuits filed by  Bowie against people using&quot;Scream Like A Baby&quot; in public events  without his or his record company's permission.  Certainly not as personal  as &quot;Word On a Wing,&quot; &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; describes a slave's  point of view on life.  He faces the devil, and spits in his face.  Now he  turns to the Lord.  It is a happy ending story, where the slave &quot;won't  be breaking no rocks&quot; once he reaches heaven.  Bowie himself has  stated over and over that &quot;Because You're Young&quot; is song written  by a loving and caring father to his son.  It appears to be nothing more  than that, so I will leave it at that.  &quot;It's No Game Pt. 2&quot;  shows Bowie as strong as ever vocally.  He seems patient, confident,  dedicated, and strong singing the last track of the album.
B0000073YB|1.0|After listening to the entire cd I threw it away.Now I know why they were a one hit wonder.Tainted Love is the only redeeming point of the entire album.The rest is alot of droning, shrieking and obvoius attempts to sound  either anguished or in heat.
B00000J6AG|5.0|A friend of mine recommended that I purchase this CD and I am glad that I did. Being an X-Files fan, I recognized some of the tunes right away which were used in Season 7. (I think there was as least one song used in Harsh  Realm too, not sure)  Moby is a mixture of Seal and Jan Hammer. His music  is soothing and upbeat.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Even one star is a lot for this overrated pop artist who would be no where without her looks and sexy wardrobe. I bought this album thinking it would be worthy of my listening. Think Again. Poor Rolling Stones must be falling  to their graves kicking themselves for allowing the slaughtering of their  song. I'm sorry to all you fans who think this girl can sing, but I'm  giving my opinion on this album and for those of you who are uncertain of  purchasing it, go to the Christina Aguilera or Celine Dion section. They  CAN SING.
B00004T9UF|4.0|this disc reminds me of a scene in pulp fiction.  the scene when john travolta turns around in the car and asks marvin if he really thinks god stopped the bullets from hitting him and jules.  then accidentally shoots  marvin in the face.  when it happens, you might find yourself laughing,  then realize that your laughing at someone dying.  thats the attitude this  entire album puts off.  fuuny as hell, but with extremely sick and dark  subject matters.  if your into things like that, this is for you.
B000002H97|5.0|This Metallica album is the first one of their's that I bought and it is the best CD in my collection. I listen to it over and over hearing something new every time. It is incredible. Every song on this album is  incredible though my favorites are &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;The  Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot;, Nothing Else  Matters&quot;, &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot;, and &quot;My Friend Of  Misery&quot;. The guitar on all of these is incredible especially  &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot;. Over all any metal fan needs this album.  And though it is over ten years old it is still somewhere around a million  copies a year, that makes a classic CD.
6305212139|5.0|I have had this tape for 2 years now and I have watched it almost every day since. I know ever thing in thw whole movie by heart. All the songs and dances are great. If your a Spice Girls fan you HAVE TO GET IT!  If your  not... its still so great that will enjoy it!  ~THE # 1 SPICE GIRLS FAN  IN THE WORLD KAITLIN~
B00004T8RK|4.0|Pearl Jam seems obsessed with evolving musically rather than staying in the same place.  This philosophy explains their decline in record sales, but is preferable to having this talented band churn our albums with  re-hashed arena anthems from Ten.  Who would have thought when the band  debuted that these grunge rockers would turn to such experimental music.   The album is hit and miss, but most experiments are.  Nothing is really  bad, except perhaps the disjointed &quot;Sleight of Hand.&quot;  &quot;Thin  Air,&quot; &quot;Insignificance,&quot; and &quot;Rival&quot; mark the best  tracks on the album.  Pearl Jam fans should definately make the purchase,  as well as anyone yearning for a good rock album, which you will be hard  pressed to find elsewhere.
6305897786|5.0|Excellent movie, intelligent and new. If you are an intelligent, literate person this movie should have tons of appeal for you. However if you are a brainwashed commercial consumer, you will hate because it often forces you  to think.
0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller has created something amazing in Catch-22.  It is a modern classic.  The novel will spend 400 pages dragging the reader through the mud, only to to conclude with one of the most satisfying endings I have  found in literature.  The tone will oscillate between ironic and morose,  jubilant and melancholy, and Heller makes no apologies for doing so.  The  novel ultimately questions the validity of war and so-called camraderie,  loyalty, and patriotism.  This is a wonderful book with a message that will  resonate with the reader for a long time after the story comes to an end.
B00000JPHF|4.0|Well, how to begin ....? Being probably the most influental horror movie of all time (besides Tod Browning`s &quot;Dracula&quot;), this first grand essay of the immortal story by Mary Wollstonecraft-Shelley is not really as  genuine as it could have been and therefore is actually surpassed in terms  of excitement not only by it`s own follow-up &quot;The Bride of  Frankenstein&quot; (by which this movie is sadly overshadowed) but also by  the horror-movie rivals of 1930-1932 like Paramounts &quot;Dr.Jekyll and  Mr.Hyde&quot; or MGM´s &quot;Freaks&quot;. The reasons for this may be  varying, one is probably the film`s short running time, the others the  obvious lack of any soundtrack, the stiff acting by many of the players and  it´s very slow developing plot. In fact, the movie is far too tame to even  evoke the same experience the audience felt when seeing the movie back in  1931. This also must be said for the pre-credits monologue by Edward Van  Sloen, which is certainly ridiculous for today`s audiences.<br />Since however  the plotline was sensation enough in those days James Whale and Universal  probably didn`t spend too much time  on it`s production and the movie has a  certain &quot;rushed&quot; feeling to it as if Boris Karloff`s legendary  appearance as the monster would be enough to justify everything about the  movie. To be fair, however, the stagebound style of early talkies doesn`t  hurt the film in the same way as it did in other movies. So much for  criticism ..... on the other hand it is a beautiful film to look at and  it`s set design and some camera movements as well as Clive`s mad  Dr.Frankenstein and Karloff´s creature are certainly an eye-filler for fans  of vintage movies as well as  for classic horror-movie buffs. Especially  the art direction in which Whale was very much involved, represents one of  the finest moments in Hollywood`s era of Germanic-influented atmospheric  film-architecture(drawing back even to &quot;The Cabinet of Dr.  Caligari&quot;).  As for the performances the film is quite mixed. While  Colin Clive and Dwight Frye are right on target as Henry Frankenstein and  his assistent respectively, the other players seem to overact in  stereotypes like in so many films of the time. Especially Edward Van Sloen  is largely wasted in a part that hasn`t the brilliance of his performance  in &quot;Dracula&quot;. Also Mae Clark, though very handsome, isn´t really  the most fitting for her part. Adressing Karloff`s monster you may be a bit  disappointed since the actor isn`t seen very much onscreen eventually and  film history has long been active to cover most of the inadequances of the  performance (and Karloff did a lot of parts better than this one). So,  besides being the horror-movie milestone it deserves to be it just doesn`t  have the creepiness of it´s Universal twin brother &quot;Dracula&quot; with  Bela Lugosi, since this movie is far more lively than Whale`s Frankenstein.  Still, horror fans must consider this restored and pristine-clear copy of  stately gothic horror as a must-have of their collection though considering  it`s legendary status it could have been far more grand-scale and bizarre  than it really is.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Wow.  &quot;Play&quot; is one of those albums which begins to creep in quietly and slowly gets under the listener's skin and into their head.  After listening to the album once through, you can't help but start back at  the beginning and cycle through the tracks again and again.  And again.   Re-&quot;Play&quot; value is through the roof on this album; the music in  &quot;Play&quot; is so rich and complex, you can hear new aspects of each  track after listening dozens of times.  Conversely, the premise of the  album is deceptively simple.  Moby takes his famed beats and runs archived  vocals of blues musicians over them.  The result is astounding.   &quot;Play&quot; is one of the best albums released in years.  For an album  featuring decades-old vocals, it is unbelievably refreshing and  invigorating.
014028009X|5.0|Helen Fielding's &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; is an hilarious example of the modern 'singleton' in London, although the storyline is universal.  Bridget Jones is single,and obsessed about weight, smoking, men, and life  in general.  We meet her friends: Jude, Shazzer, Magda, and Tom -- along  with their significant and not-so-significant others, including  &quot;Vile&quot; Richard and Daniel Cleaver, with whom Bridget flirts and  sleeps with obsessively and compulsively.  To top off the list of  characters, the dominant force in Bridget's life is her mother, who not  only lives in her own little world, but drags her unwilling husband and  daughter with her.  In between Bridget's trysts and trials, such elements  as television, literature, May-December romances, 'Smug Marrieds', and  trendy fashions and bars are skewered in the 'diary' Bridget keeps.  The  end is satisfying and throughout are constant references to the &quot;Pride  and Prejudice&quot; miniseries with Colin Firth, another obsession of  Bridget and her friends.  This strange homage to Jane Austen is  encapsulated by Bridget's own &quot;Mr. Darcy&quot; with whom her parents  attempt to fix her up. The quick pace and witty dialogue will leave you  begging for more; a great read.
0385334206|5.0|I find Kurt Vonnegut's Kilgore Trout novels to be his best, and this one belongs at the top of the heap.  Vonnegut wrote this book as a gift to himself upon his 50th birthday, but it is better suited as a gift to the  world, which could benefit by listening to the advice given by the author  on humanity, the environment, and a host of other topics.  Part novel, part  sketch book, part essay- &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; is a sweet  package of all things Vonnegut- and an absolute must-read.
6303965415|5.0|This is one of the most perfect movies I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.  The script is a jewel, incorporating the gist of Jane Austen's novel without getting bogged down in the details.  A satisfying story about second chances that is also intentionally hilarious at times.        The acting is superb  and subtle.  Especially, check out Walter Elliot's almost-over-the-top characterization (and his wardrobe) as an  egotistical, foppish, and ultimately useless, aristocrat.  Watch him check his reflection in the back of a spoon at dinner, or betray his narcissism by entirely forgetting the name of the family his daughter married into.  He's a poodle in a waistcoat, but with half the brains.    Pat close attention to one of the finest of Austen's many hypochondriacs:  sister Mary.  Observe how many times she's cramming food in her mouth while complaining how \\"very, very ill she is.\\"      Also, have fun counting the scenes where Mary clinches the snob-of-the-century trophy.  She epitomizes Austen's genius at \\"regulated hatred.\\"  This is sly stuff -- I find myself paraphrasing Mary when I'm whiney.  \\"It's vexing to be connected to such low relations,\\" is a line I find useful when I have to visit my in-laws, for instance.  (Has anyone yet written a Ph.D. thesis on Austen's hypochondriacs?  What a literary gold mine that would be.)    I can't  recommend this version of \\"Persuasion\\" enough for Jane Austen fans and anyone else who likes well-crafted, intelligent films. Each time I see it, I find something new in it that makes me laugh or admire it even  more.
0440180295|4.0|Vonnegut's command of his narrative in this novel is commendable.  The story seemlessly moves through time and setting almost too logically for the absurdist universe Vonnegut has created.  Not one of Vonnegut's  funniest books, but he does justice to the war he never thought he could  put in writing.  The philosophy of the Tralfamadorian aliens is very  powerful and desirable to a tragic hero like Billy Pilgrim, as well as the  reader and Vonnegut himself.  However, I think even Vonnegut rejects the  notion that free will does not exist, or he rather wishes to believe in a  world where we are free to escape our misery by our own actions.
B00000IAU3|3.0|This is never going to be one of my favorite albums (I mean, come on, the woman's got over fifty pictures of herself plastered all over the booklet and jewel case), but it's not too bad, either. It's a fun little disc, not  too deep, good for listening to at parties or when background noise is  needed. Dido has a great voice, and it's best put to use on songs like  Isobel and Here With Me. Nothing to get too excited about, but nothing to  hate violently, either.
B00004T9UF|4.0|....  Coupled with Dr. Dre, who happens to be the most  gifted producer in rap and an outstanding musician in his own right, Eminem  proves to be the best lyricist around, and proves himself to be a commodity  not just because he's &quot;W-H-I . . . T-E, cause MTV was so friendly to  me . . .&quot;  but because he's damn good.  <br />And his music works on so  many levels.  He rips into Puffy, N'SYNC, Britney Spears, and Christina  Aguilera, and leaves enough scar tissue to destroy their pristine images.   His rants about boy bands and bad rappers and stupid politicians are  intensely satisfying and witty.  On &quot;Stan,&quot; he takes his music to  a higher level, by rapping from the perspective of an obsessed fan.  Eminem  innovates on tracks like &quot;The Way I Am,&quot; by rapping in aggressive  shouts, rather than the now-standard mellow lyrical flow in most current  rap songs.  His vocals are as intense as his lyrics in that track, as well  as &quot;Kim,&quot; a disturbing track which blurs the line between his  music and his life.  Nonetheless, it's powerful music with a voyeuristic  element which will astonish listeners.<br />Weak points mostly fall on tracks  Eminem produced himself.  &quot;Drug Ballad&quot; belongs as a B-Side to  one of &quot;The Slim Shady LPs&quot; more sophomoric tracks.  &quot;Under  the influence&quot; is even worse.  Still, a tremendous follow-up effort  from one of rap's top talents.  Here's hoping he can get his life in order  and continue to top the charts in the coming years.
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors are great, This CD is one that they could only create,<br />Masters of music, Better than Seinfeld's lobster bisk.<br />Thanks you.  <br />This cd is phenomanal.  Buy it immediately.  And then a smashing pumpkins cd.  Peace.
B00004THAY|4.0|This is music best listened to in the car, driving down an empty back road with the windows or the top down.  This album is a joy to listen to from start to finish.  The upbeat and slow tracks are well placed in the track  arrangement, allowing both blues musicians to take the listener on a  wonderful ride.  The music has a great soundstage, with Clapton's vocals  and guitars feeding out the left channel, and B.B.'s contributions playing  out the right channel.  The effect is enhanced in a car, with bass guitars  and drums coming from the rear speakers, and the vocals and guitars up  front.  B.B. King steals the show on the album, particularly on &quot;10  years,&quot; a track about the King's former lover, and &quot;3 a.m.,&quot;  which features an extended jam session from both Clapton and King.  Any  music fan will relish the chance to hear these two greats play such  wonderful music together.
B000000W5P|4.0|A couple of clunkers thankfully don't drag this album from its position as the Stones' indisputable last cohesive--and great--album.  The listener is more than compensated for the price of admission upon hearing Richards  wheeze his way through &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot; which contains  the immortal line, &quot;I wasn't lookin' too good/But I was feelin' real  well&quot;.  God Bless ya, Keef.
B000003TAW|5.0|I got this CD and had high hopes about what it could be, considering the reputation it has from my friends calling it &quot;the best disc ever.&quot;  But I was very disappointed...that there weren't MORE songs!   This CD rocks!   There isn't a weak track on this CD.  From the high energy  of My Name Is Jonas to the sad The World Has Turned And Left Me Here to the  upbeat Surf Wax America to the raging angst of Say It Ain't So (one of the  most heartfelt and meaningful songs on the disc) to the universal In The  Garage (he talks about the safe and comfortable atmosphere of his garage  where &quot;No one cares about my ways,&quot; which everyone can relate to,  we all have our own private place where we can sing, dance, or act stupid  and no one knows).  My favorite out of all these amazing songs though is  Only In Dreams.  This songs caps off this masterpiece of a CD with mystical  cords and beautiful vocals.  <br />If you can't feel the awesome power of this  CD when you buy it, you forgot to hit the play button on your CD player.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I have been an Enigma fan for about four years and being that as  it is, I have all of their albums, including one import CD that  Mr. Cretu put out in 1990(Cretu and Thiers:Bell Epoche). With The Screen Behind the Mirror,  Micheal Cretu continues with  the Enigma tradition and standard, while  raising it a couple  notches higher. Although it took me a few spins to get  into this  CD, after it grew on me, it quickly became one of my alltime   favorites in my collection.  I strongly recommend this album to anyone who  is a fan of Enigma and their beautiful music.
B000002LBH|5.0|The Smiths are one of the most original of Rock bands and most unimitatable and because of this, like The Doors, requires a few listens to truly appriciate them. Like The Doors, The Smiths are a philosophy as well  as a music, a between philosphy, a philosphy that is neither good or evil,  but in the &quot;Nietzschian&quot; sense, beyond it - nihilistic.  Shoplifters of the world Unite is one my favorites, but do shoplifters  really have the moral fortitude to unite, would they trust each other, I  doubt beyond the mayhem of a day. Although shoplifting can be fun,  especially for smokes or alchohol. The lyrics are beautifully sung and  contain double meanings and much inuendo as Morrissey's vocals hover over a  second rate band trying to find it's voice. It doesn't matter that they are  second rate, like The Doors, the singer's ego is something of a puppet  master over a seeking sound.
6305910103|5.0|This Star Trek movie is still and will probably always be my favorite movie.  It should still appeal to both the true &quot;trekkies&quot; and people who aren't.<br />The only complaint I have is that the quality of the  picture isn't that great -- or at least as great at modern movies on DVD.  I'm not sure if that was just the original film presentation or just the  DVD transfer process.<br />Regardless, you'll going to enjoy this action  sci-fi.
B000004756|5.0|I have both CD's. Three extremely virtuous guitarists giving the very best of themselves. What musical conversations, what interplaying! You are so impressed and motivated you end up on the roof! And it sure takes a while  for you to return to mother earth, that's for sure. Each guitarist gives  the best he has to offer, it's plain guitar-jamming! I wish nothing ever  happens to those hands and 'golden fingers'. And please give us another one  of those, before you plan to retire!
630575067X|1.0|A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME! This film was a complete waste of time. For these 2 1/2 hours i could have washed my teeth, called my boring old grandma and watched the beginning 'Gone With The Wind' fot 153th time and  still i would have had more fun.  First I should say that i would have  given this film -5 stars if that was possible. The characters are flat  likea blackboard. Jar-Jar Binks is stupid. Anakin shows an IQ of 50 points  or less. The two good Jedis walkedaround like two boredcops tryingtofind  someoneto knock down. They were so dumb, that inthe end i sympathised Darth  Maul. He was the only guy inthe film who, despite being stupid, won my  sympathy.  On the whole this film is not worth watching if you want to see  a logical film or at least something which has some kind ofa normal  storyline.
0688171664|5.0|It did to our narrator.  But what a tale he tells!  It seems that most of the reviews of this book revolve around the obvious lessons.  But like Allen Bloom's &quot;Closing of the American Mind,&quot;  if you are not  grounded in classic education you will wind up like me, wondering what this  book is really about.  The motorcycle analogy, like parables, tells a story  with a hidden message that portends to be spiritual.  While the meaning of  our lives from an eternal perspective is danced around, it is not the  central message of the tome, which I find it's weakness.  I feel the author  is looking for answers in the intellect, but they are only available in the  soul.  The quest for quality in life is a worthwhile journey that we all  will account for someday, and this book will benefit all those who care to  ponder the journey.
0195073401|3.0|Microeconomic Theory - known simply as 'Mas-Colell' to affectionate graduate students - is a difficult text on which to impossible a single &quot;star&quot; rating.  The text is divided into several sections.  The  first of which introduces the reader to choice theory and the theory of the  firm.  This section is easily the worst treatment I have read in an  educational work in any field.  Useless diagrammatical references,  pathological exercises, and absurd notation typify the first section.  This  section of the text is preferred by specialized theoretical microconomists  and by predominantly non-American first year graduate students who have  already been introduced to the material in a tractable text (such as  Varian).  This section gets 1 star for its comprehensive references.   Conversely, the general equilibrium section is excellent.  The author  actually introduces concepts and explains their relevance.  This section is  still dense, complicated, and comprehensive: sufficiently  &quot;graduate&quot; enough for any program.  Overall, the text book is  comprehensive, and makes a fairly good reference source.  Nevertheless,  learning from this book is akin to learning medicine from the Physicians  Desk Reference; I suspect the book retains popularity across academia  solely as a fraternal rite of passage:  &quot;I survived this ridiculous  book!
B0000004WM|3.0|Back when &quot;touch me&quot; came out in 86 I really loved the song.  I was living in Europe at the time and it was a huge hit over there.  When I discovered the album by the same title I bought it right away in order to  start my collection of Samantha fox.  Browsing through the other albums I  heard the samples for &quot;Just one night&quot; and thought, I have to get  this one next. I didn't know about the album until I got onto the net and  discovered Amazon.com (yes my life is nothing without Amazon.com)  the  samples hooked me so I ordered it.  On the first listen, I thought, Give me  a break, can't the woman do anything more then moan and groan her way  through a song?  I liked Hurt me Hurt me but knew right away it would not  be a favorite of mine.  &quot;Love to love you&quot; is much better though  she goes overboard with the moaning.  for me the best track on the album is  &quot;Another woman&quot; &quot;Spirit of America&quot; grew on me and so  did &quot;pleasure zone.&quot;  I can see however with this album why  Samantha's career suddenly dried up.  I mean you've done it once with the  sex thing, move on; Madonna did.  this is the kind of CD that you will play  once in a while and only if you feel like listening to something different.   It certainly is not going in my top CD rack.  I do however like the spoken  word aspects of the album and would love it if Samantha released such a CD  for a laugh.  She sounds like a really nice woman, funny and sexy but her  problem from day one has been that she has put her sexuality above her  music and it cost her in the end.
B000005J56|5.0|After years of neglect, some of the greatest musicians of Cuban music were brought together by Ry Cooder and Juan de Marcos to create magic.  This album is a rare treat to fans of Cuban music, specifically, and for fans of  great music of all varieties.  These songs, performed by by a variety of  greats such as Ruben Gonzalez (one of the great son pianists: son is the  name for the uniquely Cuban rhythm), Compay Segundo (who is currently 93),  and Ibrahim Ferrer, are poetic in verse and hypnotic in rhythm.  How can  you listen to Chan Chan without feeling yourself floating along the avenues  of Havana or the streets of Santa Clara.<br />My mother, who like my father  was born in Cuba (from Pinar de Rios, a town near Havana), had heard some  of these great musicians many years ago in their youth.  How wonderful that  they are here again to give the world the beautiful music of Cuba.<br />Please  do your soul a favor and purchase this album. And don't stop there.  Many  of the band members have formed as the Afro-Cuban All Stars and there are  also wonderful albums of Ibrahim Ferrer and Reuben Gonzalez.  Absolutely  perfect!  <br />Just sit back and sail away on the sounds of Reuben Gonzalez'  piano in &quot;Murmullo&quot; (and yes, that is a Hawaiian riff in the  song) or dance the night away with your loved one as you croon along with  Ferrer in &quot;Dos Gardenias&quot; or marvel at Eliades Ochoa's guitar in  El Cuarto de Tula.
B000002UAU|5.0|First off, I am considerably younger than the majority of the reviewers of this album.  I was born almost 15 years after its release.  While I will obviously never be able to understand the full cultural impact of the  Beatles because I wasn't there, the album still has something about it that  separates it from all others.<br />Everything heard in any music today and  anything I grew up listening to owes EVRYTHING to the Beatles, and this is  where they really pushed the envelope.  The amazing thing about the Beatles  was that they remained on the cutting edge throughout their entire career.   The only group that comes close to that nowadays is Radiohead.<br />With Sgt.  Pepper, the Beatles single handedly reinvented rock n' roll.  They took the  best simple musicianship and songwriting skills and combined them with what  &quot;you couldn't do&quot; on a rock album.  Nothing since its release has  changed music more.<br />Although I am young, I recognize a classic when I  hear one, and when it comes to rock n' roll, this is THE classic among  classics.
6305903182|4.0|Williamson's style may be missing, but it is not entirely missed. Instead Scream 3 is scripted by Ehren Kruger, who brought us Arlington Road.  Scream 3 has all the main survivors and a cameo by Randy via videotape,  which is a welcome one.  Stab 3 is the movie that is in production in  Scream 3 with all the characters meeting their counterparts.  The  interaction between Courtney Cox, who plays the &quot;real&quot; Gale  Weathers, and Parker Posey, who plays Gale Weathers in Stab 3, is always  funny and refreshing.  Parker Posey is highly energetic and seems to be  having a great time making the movie.  <br />Anyway, after a couple murders  everyone realizes the people are dying in order that they were to die in  the script of Stab 3.  Unfortunately, four scripts were created and no one  is sure which one the killer is following.   Shortly after, the killer  decides to create his own script to keep them guessing.  Scream 3 does not  have much in the way of scares and can be predictable, but it is still a  welcome end to the trilogy.  GRADE: B<br />-&quot;Here's how I see it: I've  got no house, no bodyguard, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants  to kill me? No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I  go where you go. That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you.   And since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill  you.  Make sense?&quot; -quote from Parker Posey talking to Courtney Cox in  Scream 3
B00004SCX6|5.0|Well @ first I thought dat the name of her CD was dumb. oops!... I did it again doesn't quite right. Well anyways. Since I LOVE BS I wanted to buy her CD! it's GREAT!  Although I REALLY REALLY wish dat it was another ECD.  I have tried to watch the music video but uh... it doesn't work on my comp.  So I have only seen parts of it. GET THIS CD! It doesn't have all the  lyrics though. Mine doesn't atleast but you can find the lyrics @  lyrics.com ok?     BUY IT!
B00004RFCM|5.0|Let me say, to start with, I did not want to like Sex and the City. I am NOT a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker (sorry!). Then, late at night during a bout with insomnia, I switched on HBO and found myself watching an episode  of Sex and the City and was completely surprised to catch myself laughing  out loud at 3 in the morning! So, I rented (and recently bought) the Sex  and the City first season on DVD and what a treat it was!  I'm telling you,  you will not be sorry. It is one of the most well-written and witty  programs on television now. Thank you HBO!
0684800713|3.0|This book with its austere prose style is good read, and it's clear to me that Hemmingway, then 27 years old, shows tremendous talent.  The scenes involving the fishing and the bullfighting are very evocative, and the  dialogue interesting.  The understatement or non-statement (Hemmingway's  iceberg approach to writing) works very well in this, his first book that  brought him to national attention.  In that regard, the horrors of World  War I constitute those parts of the iceberg that lie beneath the water, and  influence the emptiness of the social life that is  above.  The &quot;what  might have been&quot; conversation between Jake and Brett (who both love  each other, but who both know the hopelessness of that love) at the end of  the book is particularly touching. <br />Notwithstanding the above, none of  the characters have much for the reader to be attracted to. A constant  never-ending stream of alcohol seems to flow through the book.  It's  incredible that people can drink as much as the principal characters in the  book do.  Then there's Brett, the 34 year old woman, who has Jake loving  her (and she loves him), is engaged to Mike, has an affair with Robert Cohn  (who also loves her), and in the end, seemingly out of the blue, takes off  and seduces the 19 year old bullfighter, Pedro Romero.  Try to figure that  out. <br />Also, I want to comment on what I consider to be an  uncomfortable  excess of anti-semitic sentiment in this book.  Consider this exchange  between Jake and Bill about Brett on p. 230 of the paperback Scribner  edition (1954).  <br />--&quot;She hasn't any money with her?&quot;  I asked  --&quot;I shouldn't think so.  She never has any money.  She gets five  hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to  Jews.&quot;   --&quot;I supppose they get it at the source,&quot; said  Bill.  --&quot;Quite.  They're not really Jews.  We just call them Jews.   They're Scotsmen, I believe.&quot;  <br />Of course, the heartof the  anti-semitism in this book is the way the characters relate to Robert Cohn.   Some of it can be chalked up to jealousy, particularly as Cohn had had an  affair with Brett, and Jake, who loves Brett, is sexually crippled because  of his war injuries.  But almost all of the principal characters, not just  Jake, take pleasure in continually deriding Cohn's Jewishness to his face,  to each other, or just in their mental, often alcohol-induced lucubrations.   The references occur all too often throughout the book, e.g., there's  Jake, saying  that Cohn had a &quot;hard, Jewish, stubborn streak,&quot;   p. 10, Bill [on Cohn] at p. 162, &quot;[h]e's got this Jewish superiority  so strong that he thinks the only emotion he'll get out of the fight will  be being bored&quot; and Mike, &quot;Take that sad Jewish face away, p. 177  . . . etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.  I realize that times change.  I don't  believe we should judge books from an earlier generation by today's  standards of political correctness.  Nonetheless, the characters in this  book are often mean-spirited, and excessively anti-semetic without, in my  view, an adequately compensating literary justification (which in the  context of the holocaust to come a mere decade latter, should give pause).   For whatever it's worth, in A Moveable Feast (a description of his life in  Paris in the 1920s), the most generous portrait in that book is to the  renowned poet (though fascist sympathizer) Ezra Pound.   <br />Perhaps, World  War I had gutted the soul, and that explains the Gertrude Stein quote, that  Hemmingway uses to preface the book, &quot;You are all a lost  generation.&quot;  But maybe the excuse is too easy.
0767827716|4.0|Christine is the right movie to watch to be relaxed.Because it is so easy to understand and watch.Everything on this movie going on expected.You can understand all the next steps of it.Also every scene of this film taste  like mixed pop corn.Sometimes salty , sometimes oiled and sometimes  sweet.Lastly you should own one cause it is really fresh to watch.
0684874350|1.0|Rarely do I stop reading a book before I finish, but after I had read about a third of Angela's Ashes, I couldn't take it any more.<br />Up to that point, I thought, &quot;This Frank McCourt fellow must be the smartest man  who ever lived&quot; because of his detailed descriptions of what happened  to him when he was two, three or five years old.<br />But when I got to the  part about his carrying a hog head around for about 10 pages, I  stoppped.<br />If the man had said in the introduction that he embellished   some and relied on what others told him, that would have been fine; instead  he presents everything as fact. Think about your childhood.  Can you  remember 1/100th of the details that McCourt apparently has at the tip of  his tongue -- or fingers?<br />Give me a break.  If this book is worthy of the  Pulitzer Prize, we all are in trouble.
B000031WD9|5.0|Ohh my God what type of movie is that how can be a movie like this.Would you belive when I firstly watch this film on cinema I stoped myself so hardly not to pee my short.It is the most entertainig film I have ever  watched.What a brain I would like to celebrate the writer of this movie.It  was so funny I remember that after the movie ended I ran to to buy tickets  of the next hour to watch it again.I belive that everybody who watched this  film are laughing when they saw a picture of this movie anywhere any  time.Strictly Recomended.
B000020617|5.0|This is a great album. Each soing feels like a rock instrumental because every song has a guitars that you feel that are lyrics and the guitar is Dave Grohl's voice. But because of that, the album is made for the better.  I reccomend this to any fan of rock or just guitars!
B00003Q438|3.0|I cannot watch this movie more than 3 times however the first sight was impressive all I can say about this movie : it is a well designed and directed movie , besides its sfx are very orginal and well.

B00002E233|5.0|I watch this movie firstly in cinema.It looked perfectly to me its sfx were wonderful.Also the sharks are designed perfectly and their moves and behaviors are so real.It makes me crazy.However when I watched this movie  again on dvd I liked it 5 times more and I can watched the sfx so clearly  also I felt the sphere of the movie more than I watched it on cinema.About  the movie I can lastly say that you sould own one strictly.Besides Thomas  Jane was acting wonderful.
0802130208|5.0|It's so sad to lose such a great author without knowing what could have been.  I have talked with people who have read this book and (myself included) cannot get Ignasis J. Reily out of our heads!  I find myself  walking down the streets of Manhattan scowling at &quot;offensive&quot;  people who remind me of the abundant man.  This is definitely one of those  books you'll never get sick of and laugh (or even cringe) when you think of  our pal Reily.
B00000K19E|5.0|Matrix is the most enjoying movie that I have ever watched.Its theme is so different and impressive.I want to celebrate Wachowski Brothers cause they write such a senario however I found something wrong on this senario it may  be a mistake or a secret which will be explained in the second movie but I  wont tell it because I want people to watch this movie carefully cause it  is the most impressive science fiction movie ever.About the movie I can say  that you should watch this because it is a classic.
055321263X|4.0|I read The Woman in White with some trepidation.  I feared that it might contain the starchy language often used in mid-19th century novels, or be some sugar-coated romantic drivel (eg, damesels in distress looking for Mr.  Darcy or Heathcliff).  I am relieved to report The Woman in White, as other  reviewers before me have reported, is actually a very tight, unpredictable  suspense novel.  It's story is a bit complex, but Collins unravels it  rather nicely. And its language is very easy to follow, without archaic  local expressions found in other novels (eg, by Hardy or Eliott) of that  time.<br />I found most of The Woman in White to be utterly delightful.  The  story is fascinating, and I found myself continually trying to read just a  few extra pages to see what happens next.  However the book eventually runs  out of steam, to the extent it only becomes fairly interesting (versus  thoroughly engaging).  Part of this is due simply to its length (600+  pages, which is long for a suspense novel).<br />Bottom line:  The Woman in  White is a fine read for most readers (&gt; 16 years of age).  And it  should appeal equally to both men and women.  I will certainly look to read  other novels by Wilkie Collins.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is a very odd movie, but a great one. The DVD is loaded with extras which would make you very busy for days. The audio is excellent. When the fight scenes appear, you hear the cheering all around you, and the punches  bring in alot of bass. The Video transfer is also not a dissapointment,  with a very clear picture throughout the whole movie. Great acting by Ed  Norton, and Brad Pitt too. Highly Recommended!
B00000K2SE|5.0|In a summer that was supposed to be dominated by the new Star Wars movie, The Matrix took everyone by surprise.  The trailers that I saw for it promised some cool looking effects and possibly a pop  philosophy/existentialist subtext.<br />Never before have I gone into a movie  with expectations that were at a level so far below the level of the movie  as I did for this one.  This is one of the best movies to come out in a  long time.<br />I'll begin with the effects.  Bluntly put, this movie  represents the biggest jump in effects since a blue screen was first used.   The creation of 'bullet time' allowed the 360 degree filming of stilled  subjects.  This is the greatest effect that I have seen in a long time.   It's possibilities are endless.  The movie's use of it in fight sequences  made the fights better than most any I've ever seen.  The only ones that  are better are for sentimental reasons or pure skill, but the sequences in  the Matrix look better than anything.<br />This movie is also very full of  style.  Everyone is got up in black and wears sunglasses.  You might think  that this would seem gimmicky, but it works.  Black trenchcoats have never  looked better.<br />As for the movie itself, the plot and subtext is  phenomenal.  You could teach a Philosophy 101 course based on the themes  brought up in this movie.  It has everything ranging from Utilitarianism  and Hedonism to Nietzsche and the basic questions of metaphysical  exploration.  Even if you ignore all of this, on the surface it's a great  Sci-fi/Action movie.  The gunfights are great and Keanu is actually a good  cast.  Laurence Fishburne was a perfect cast for Morpheus and Carri-Ann  Moss was great.<br />If you get this, go for the Widescreen version.   Otherwise, you miss so much.  Definitely get this movie.
0767849493|1.0|Sorry. Im just a stupid person, and unfortunately I coudl not see the so-called &quot;greatness&quot; of this &quot;Movie&quot;. It doesnt offends Catolhics at all, it doenst offend Protestants at all... It only  offends the intelligence of the public, forced to watch the horrible duo of  Affleck and Damon performing the worst characters of their movie carrer,  and forced to watch a ridiculous blonde guy using bad language all movie  long, and forced to watch the unshameful commercial appearance by Alanis  Morrissete, as a totally unconvincing God. For a person to think this  garbage is &quot;polemic&quot;, he really must have his head closed to  daily life...
0805062971|5.0|I bought the book thru Amazon last week after having seen the movie the previous week.  I must say, rarely has a story connected with me on such a level.  Not to say I'm a raving lunatic with a split personality, nor am I  into making soap with human fat, but the very raw emotion of the characters  in &quot;Fight Club&quot; appeal to me on some sort of primal level.  It's  the place in your soul where you know that the world is slowly choking  itself, and that there are many bad things in the world, and that you  should probably do something about it, but don't.<br />I loved the way it was  written, from start to finish, and unlike the movie, which was great too,  the book gives you so much more insight into the lives of the Unnamed main  character and his counterpart Tyler Durden.  And also into Marla's...<br />It  is similar to Palahniuk's newer book &quot;Survivor&quot;, in that the main  caharcter is slowly destroying themselves without knowing it, and at the  same time, needing to do so in order to continue at all.<br />Anyway, looking  forward to much more brilliance penned by the hand of Palahniuk.
B000009RC2|5.0|Contrary to what some other reviewers think, each one of the five members is featured prominently on this album.  Much like the members of Cream, each musician here is a virtuoso and each solos at the same time.  The best  part is that all of these simultaneous solos build each song into a  multi-layered masterpiece.  At no point during the album does the sound  become cluttered or annoying.  If you like the music here, I highly  recommend Weather Report, Led Zeppelin(Page actually took some guitar  lessons from McLaughlin in 1967), Cream, and Jimi Hendrix.  Each of those  bands also featured virtuoso musicians and used jazz as the base form for  many of their songs.  This is an amazing album that still sounds fresh and  influences new artists 30 years after its original release.  Do yourself a  favor and buy this now.

0767830555|5.0|Many will tell you Raging Bull is Scorsese's best film.  That critical opinion, I believe, is due to the fact that you can look at Jake LaMotta and abhor his behavior, making it easier to objectively examine the film's  traits.  But Travis Bickle is a character that is so well drawn by the  three collaborators scorsese, schrader, and deniro, that we as an audience  are terrified that all of us might actually bear something in common with  him.  This is not watered down entertainment, as scorsese explores the  corners of the mind  most people rarely will deny. And he does so with  virtuosity, lovingly crafting every shot and sequence, building mood and  tension like few others can.  Dismissed by many as mindless violence, this  is a film with a message that unites us all, and a protagonist so real you  can imagine a conversation with him, two things most all films cannot give.
B00003Q43G|4.0|The Abyss is an entertaining underwater adventure with non-stop action.  Forty percent of the action footage was shot underwater. The actors actually had to become certified divers.<br />In the film, an oil rig crew is  hired to conduct a search-and-rescue mission when a nuclear submarine sinks  to the ocean floor during a fierce hurricane.  Throw in a few alien  creatures and some mysterious forces, and you have one heck of an exciting  film.<br />The acting is above good, as Ed Harris delivers a remarkable  performance as Bud, the leader of the civilan oil rig.  Mary Elizabeth  Mastrantonio plays his separated wife who designed the rig, and equals him  with her own superb acting.<br />The movie is loaded with action, conflicts,  determination, and a love story in the overall background.  The special  effects involving the water creatures were outright phenominal.  This film  keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is an outright heart-stopping  thriller.
0790729687|4.0|All right, I won't bore you with a lot of technical details about the DVD edition of this movie. Yes, the sound and picture are great. Here's the important thing, however: It has a French language track. Let's face it,  this was just about a perfect film except for the fact that Brad Pitt  mumbled and Tom Cruise sounded like ... Tom Cruise. They both looked great  in their roles, but they sounded really bad. Also, why was everybody  speaking English? Dude, they're in late 18th-century New Orleans and Paris.  These freaks would have all spoken French, right? Well, now the movie's  perfect. All you have to do is crank up the French-language track on the  DVD, sit back, and watch the sparks fly. BOOM! What a great movie now that  it's in French! (Okay, fine. So their lips don't quite match the French  dialogue coming out of their mouths. Be that way. It's close enough. That's  why I gave if four stars instead of five, since it's maybe still not  totally perfect.) For those of you who haven't seen the movie, it's  opulent, gorgeous, lush, sexy, a little scary, and all that other good  stuff. See it if you haven't, then watch it again on DVD in French and see  how much better it is! Unless of course you're French, in which case you  can skip the first part and just watch it in French right off the bat. This  movie is good.
0060931671|5.0|If you've always heard the term postmodern and wondered what it meant this book is for you. But, this book is definately not for everyone, the plot is unique to say the least, and the characters are not what you will find in  most novels, but then again, neither is the intellectual stimulation. In  only a little over 100 pages, Thomas Pynchon has written an accessibly  managable intro. to postmodern literature. Although this book is rather  dense, and is filled with obscure facts and information from seemingly  every conceivable specialty of knowledge, it is a great introduction to one  of the most misunderstood genres of modern literature. Just be sure to keep  a dictionary and encyclopedia handy.    The plot revolves around the  exciting and often bizarre experiences and travels of Oedipa Maas, after  she is named executor of an ex-lovers will. In her adventures she uncovers  a surrealistic world where everything that she has ever learned seems to  fall into question. It is a world where nazi doctors, secret societies,  papal misdeeds, anarchist dreams, and deranged outcasts all come out of the  shadows to invade the &quot;typical&quot; suburban landscape of an average  American housewife.    This book is about uncovering the realities, or lack  thereof, that most people would want to stay hidden, or at the least  forgotton. It is about questioning the assumptions that we all hold dear,  even if it means coming to terms with a world that is without meaning,  without order, and most of all without a coherent design.     This is a  book with many questions to be answered, so if you would like an  envigorating intellectual challenge this book will not dissappoint.
6305750750|1.0|So I buy this video because it looks pretty awesome, right? I never got to see this movie in the theater because I was in the hospital last summer with a broken back and eight cracked ribs after a little car accident that  was probably my fault even though I don't remember anything leading up to  it. Anyway, long story short: I never got to see this ballyhoo-boo-boo when  it was out in the theaters. Now, I'm a big fans of the &quot;Star  Wars&quot; series (the movies, not the books - only mad freaks who don't  get any play read those wack paperbacks), so I was pretty depressed, laid  up in the hospital, reading &quot;Death on the Installment Plan&quot; for  the umpteenth time, knowing that there was a whole nation of movie-goers  out there who were getting to see &quot;Star Wars: The Phantom  Menace,&quot; and that I wasn't one of them. Boy, should I have been  worrying about something else. When I finally buy the video, thinking it'll  be one of those movies that I watch over and over again - like &quot;Star  Wars,&quot; &quot;The Empire Strikes Back,&quot; &quot;Return of the  Jedi,&quot; and &quot;The Ewok Adventure&quot; - I discover that this movie  stinks BIG TIME! I'm watching it, it starts out pretty good, with Obi-Wan  Kenobi (looking like he's really pulled himself together since Darth Vader  greased him in the first movie) and some other Jedi dude who looks like  Oskar Schindler running around this space station fighting rolling robots  with laser guns and out-crafting some evil Asian businessmen who've made  some pretty weird fashion choices, if you ask me. Anyway, I already have no  idea what's going on, but at least there's some action, right? However, 20  minutes down the line and I'm scratching my head and saying &quot;What?  This ain't 'Star Wars!' What is this? It said 'Star Wars' on the box, but  this ain't 'Star Wars,' no way no how!&quot; I don't know what else to say.  That's about the long and the short of it. Even though this weird movie has&quot;Star Wars&quot; in its title, it's not a &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie  by any stretch of the imagination. That pretty little girl from &quot;The  Professional&quot; is in it, but I couldn't figure out it she was playing  one character or two. Doesn't matter. She looks hot either way. There's  also some tall freaky gay guy with a weird face and floppy ears. Also, the  little blond kid from that Smuckers commercial plays Jesus Christ or  somebody. The Devil is in it, too. I figured that the Devil would fight  that little Jesus kid, but he ended up fighting Obi-Wan and the other Jedi  guy, so maybe they're saving the fight between the Devil and the Jesus kid  for another movie. That &quot;Shaft&quot; guy is in it, too. The new Shaft,  not the old one. If the old Shaft is in this movie I didn't see him.  Anyway, I found this movie pretty confusing, to tell the truth. I really  didn't understand anything that happened in it. I don't know why Yoda  stooped to appearing in this film, either. I thought he was loyal to the  &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, but I guess he's just in it for the money  like every other Jedi nowadays.
B000002NHN|5.0|I came across this album after hearing &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; on the radio one day.  After about a minute of the song, I knew I had to have this album.  I picked it up the next day and have cherished it ever since.   McKennitt's vocals are haunting and sweet.  The melodies are mysterious and  exotic, yet relaxing as well.  My favorite track is &quot;The  Highwayman.&quot;  The best time to listen to this CD is when you've had a  long day and need some relaxation time.  Close your eyes and let it  surround you.  My favorite way to relax to this album is in the bath tub  with lots of candles!

0553275976|4.0|The first thing that struck me, after reading a synopsis of Bonfire, is that its impetus is similar to the climax of The Great Gatsby.  Given this connection, we can look at these two novels in the context in which they  are written.  The Great Gatsby is considered by some to be &quot;the great  American novel,&quot; trying to encapsulate a time in the country's  history.  Jay Gatsby creates a wealthy identity for himself, appearing out  of nowhere to claim his love, Daisy.  Vehicular manslaugther ends their  love.  Sherman McCoy, in contrast, is born wealthy.  Vehicular manslaughter  ends his fun, which I hesitate to call love.  Lust is probably more  appropriate.  This is only the beginning of the novel, and we watch his  entire downfall unfold.        So the two main contrasting ideas are what  Jay and Sherman's motivations are (love versus lust) and what the focus of  their lives in the novels are (love versus downfall).  These are important  things to think about when reading these novels and considering what each  author might be trying to say about the period they are writing in.             I also want to comment briefly on a few reasons some readers really  dislike this novel.  First, none of the main characters are admirable.   There is definetly no one to latch on to as a moral center.  Don't read on  in hope of finding someone, but do read on anyway.  Second, the entire  society we are viewing is corrupt.  There is no way to place blame on any  single person or group in the novel.  Be careful while reading and I hope  that at the end, you are satisfied that everyone is equally at fault.  I  don't think Wolfe intended for his novel to place blame.
B000005J56|5.0|What a great piece of musical work - this album is a tribute to human ingenuity, and our ability to constantly find fresh, new sounds in the old-fashioned framework of great melodies and simple thoughts.<br />This album  stands apart from everything I have ever heard - deep, merry, evocative,  melodious, completely unaffected. I hope we get to hear more of this great  ensemble in the years to come
0783242808|2.0|I find it pretty frightening that people actually think this movie has merit.  I only gave 2 stars for some mildly funny scenes.  What is it with people saying this had a moral ending?  Yeah, the lacrosse guy seemed  sensitive and all, but they all went ahead and had sex, didn't they?  The  film would have redeemed its explicitness it they hadn't.  With kids having  sex younger and younger these days, normalizing sex is not a good idea.   While they may be physically ready, they are not emotionally ready.  This  movie totally takes for granted, that while teen sex is real today, it does  not need to be made light of.  Parents like Jim's father are helping make  sure their kids do have sex by acting like their pals, not their parent.  I  am only in my twenties, but waited for the person that I eventually  married.  After witnessing my friends many broken relationships, I have  seen that having sex early results in a &quot;cheapening&quot; of the  intimacy that should accompany sex.  Eventually they just end up sleeping  with many people and never really have the close relationship they are  looking for.  Some of the reviewers praised this movie for being realistic.   THAT is truly concerning.  Someone actually said this had family values in  it!  And people wonder why we have all kinds of problems with teens today!  Wise up people!
6305807043|3.0|First, a note of explanation on the title to this review: it is my impression that we live in something of a dark age of filmmaking, in which the merely mediocre is exalted as \\"original\\" and \\"compelling.\\" That is not to say that \\"Being John Malkovich\\" is simply mediocre, but rather that it isn't nearly as \\"great\\" as the critics' cavalcade (or most of the reviews on this site) might lead you to believe. It is nevertheless worthwhile.<br />To begin, the central gimmick is that a small, hidden doorway on the 7 1/2th floor of a New York City highrise leads to a portal to the brain, or the consciousness, of John Malkovich, and that after fifteen minutes (or more, for one possessing the John Cusack character's puppeteering skills) spits the subject out somewhere on the side of the New Jersey turnpike. The geography is meaningless (and I have to ask, just how does Cusack's character manage to make it from NYC to the NJ Turnpike in under 15 minutes when he needs to pick somebody up?), but it shouldn't be hard to see the possibilities inherent in the concept--they are, after all, touted in the ad copy for the film and in most of the glowing reviews (\\"screwball comedy, a meditation on the nature of existence, of the soul\\" blah blah blah).<br />Few of those possibilities are realized. Rather than a heady stew on the nature of existence, the eventual explanation for the portal is more like a thin gruel of possession and transference in a quest for immortality. To be fair, the questions are posed by some of the characters, but they are never really addressed by the film itself, except in a fashion as superficial as the characters themselves. As for these characters, with the exception of Malkovich himself (and there mostly by way of pathos) there is no one deserving of sympathy or empathy.<br />The movie succeeds best as a very black sort of comedy--if you enjoy the spectacle of uniformly reprehensible characters enacting a series of escapades winding down to an ending with no sense of justice, of anyone getting their due (and I often do), you might enjoy this film.<br />One final postscript: some sort of award should be due John Malkovich, who--regardless of the truth or falsity of the aspects of his life \\"revealed\\" in this film--exposes himself to an enormous potential for ridicule here. More minor kudos to Cameron Diaz, who--in what passes for courage among Hollywood A-list actors and actresses--is difficult to recognize as something other than the blonde smile on sticks she's been in her other films. Final kudos to whoever came up with the idea of high-concept puppetry as a public-TV-pledge-week fad in the same vein as \\"Riverdance,\\" which was hilarious.
6305165912|5.0|What makes a great movie in my book is more than just a well-acted good story, it's the script and how the it is interpreted by the characters. The Big Lebowski combines an excellent story with some of the most amazing  characters ever, especially John Goodman. Goodman plays the role of a  Vietnam Vet., and does it so well. Jeff Bridges to me has his best  performance to date on this movie, all I reccomend is that you enjoy this  in a &quot;relaxed&quot; state....simply fantastic.
B00000JCOV|5.0|...cause it almost ruined it for me. I knew about this band a long time ago and I got this the day it was released because I had never heard a band before with so many members and I was curious as to how it would turn out.  I was impressed, but I didn't give it too much thought at the time, because  so many other cd's were coming out at the time, and I kind of put it away.  Months later, I started hearing about these guys non-stop. They were on  every magazine cover, and people were just talking about these nine guys in  masks who play this super violent music and are just incredible. I didn't  remember this much about them when I first heard the cd, so I just quit  caring about them. Then, I was like, you know what, I've got this cd, let  me see if what these people are talking about is true. Sure enough, the  hype didn't come from nowhere. It really is excellent, I see these guys as  sort of a Slayer for the new millenium. The music is just non stop  intensity from the start, and having so many different members can help  because they were able to add several extra layers of sound to the music to  give it a much more rounded out attack. This is one of the better cd's Ross  Robinson has done, as he was able to bring much more out of these guys than  he has with anyone else, excluding Korn and Amen. He did an excellent job  making sure all of the instruments are heard and that the band didn't hold  back at all. I haven't seen them live, but if the live performances are  better than this, than I will have to check them out very soon. I have only  two complaints about this cd: 1. They didnt take full advantage of having  three drummers. I think the percussion could have been used WAY more. It  would have sounded a lot cooler. 2. The intensity sort of dies down after  the first seven tracks, and though there are some cool tracks after that  (especially &quot;Liberate&quot;), it just doesn't have the same impact  that the first half of the cd did. Hopefully they will fix that next time.  Otherwise, highly recommended.
B000001FS6|5.0|Leaving aside the movie, leaving aside all the criticism over the band's overblown ego, Rattle and hum stands as a very valuable album that demonstrates in a very powerfull way why U2 is the rock and roll monster  that it is. The live performances are just fantastic: anyone that has the  guts to perform such gigantic classics as &quot;Helter skelter&quot; or  &quot;All along the watchtower&quot; and record them in an album deserves  recognition. But U2 doesn't just performs the songs, but they actually give  such emotional renditions that they can very well rank high up there along  with the classic versions. &quot;Pride&quot; had never listened so  powerfull either, as well as &quot;Bullet the blues sky&quot;. &quot;I  still have'nt found what i'm looking for&quot; may not sound as good as the  classic version, but is very interesting either way. To me, the only  regretable thing about the live songs is that they left aside two of their  most cherished &quot;live favorites&quot;: &quot;Where the streets have no  name&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;. As for the new songs, there are also some  really great moments:  the powerfull and haunting &quot;Hawkmoon 269&quot;,  the beautyfull Edge-ballad &quot;Van Diemen's land&quot;, the emotional  &quot;God part: II&quot;, the nostalgic &quot;Angel of harlem&quot; and, of  course, the memorable duo with BB King in the bluesy &quot;When love comes  to town&quot; are truly some of U2's all-time highlights (of course, theres  a veeeery large list). However, the best song of the album,which bythe way  also stands as a very powerfull reason why you should buy this album, comes  at the very ending of the album. Of course, i'm talking about the majestic  and gorgeous love ballad &quot;All i want is you&quot;, which contends only  with &quot;One&quot; and &quot;With or without you&quot; as U2's best work  so far. Anyway, forget about all the criticism this album's received: this  is U2 at it's best, and it's definitely worht buying.
B00004W5UA|5.0|&quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of those rare movies that appears only when the right combination of forces behind it give everything they've got to the cause. It takes a gutsy director, a clever screenwriter, a brilliant  cast, and one hell of a production crew to get a film of this power and  importance made and made well. It's about a desperate disenfranchised man  who unconsciously desires a way out of the life he is in now. He craves  something other than his condo life, his (mentally and spiritually) numbing  work, and his lack of love.  Because of this, we are strapped into a  dizzying ride through the pristine psuedo-secure modern world and the dark,  grimy and often disturbing land of &quot;hunter/gatherer&quot; human  nature. But &quot;Fight Club&quot; is also about every one of us - it makes  us examine our pathetic lives and forces us to look closely at the choices  we have made and reminds us that it isn't too late to change our paths in  life while at the same time warning us to watch our step and not fall into  mindlessness. This has to be one of the best most underrated movies ever  made. Every detail in it has been scrutinized, every motion done naturally  deliberate.  It is funny, it is frightening, and if this movie doesn't make  you think about your life, then you are one of those most in need of a  Tyler Durden.
0440234743|5.0|I guess, like everyone, I picked up this book expecting a typical John Grisham super thriller.  I was pleasantly suprised to find out I was wrong.  This is a book about a man and the life changing experiences he has with  the people he meets while he's on his little legal mission.  This is also a  book that speaks a lot about Faith in a very real manner and I applaud  Grisham for including it.  It seems to pull it off without being  &quot;preachy&quot;.<br />The legal stuff with the family in the book is fun  reading, Grisham certainly knows how to keep the reader's intrest when it  comes to matters of the law.  That's why he's paid the big bucks. But it is  Nate O'Reilly and his journey that gives the book it's life. This is a guy  who's about had it when he meets this extroidinary missionary and how it  makes him question every thing he's ever known.  Perhaps there is something  better out there for him.<br />I really don't know what else to say.  There's  really no edge of your seat Grisham stuff here, just great characters.   It's a book that when I finished reading, I feel there is still hope for  people.  They just have to choose to change, choose their faith in God, and  that's what this book is all about.
0805062971|5.0|It's difficult to summon up words, or for that matter, confusing and difficult to delve deep enough into the levels in which Fight Club willingly takes you to describe how this book will make you feel and how it  will effect you, and why it will effect you through simplistic review.  In  fact, trying to describe something I've yet to get a firm grip on is a  uniquely strenuous task.<br />  Chuck Palahniuk, in genius form constructs  excitingly compacted high energy driven concepts intertwined with  originally materialized ideas in powerfully overflowed and provocative  fashion that leads Fight Club to insightfully empowering narrative, and  overwhelmingly creepy nature, seeming as if to almost make it live and  breath in a certain depth that can't be easily described.  It's a book full  of lies and truths wherein the paradoxical arena of meaning, ugliness and  beauty rear their controversial heads.         Fight Club tells the story  of the everyday man who is what the narrator is in the book: a young man  dying and suffering, piece by piece, minute by minute, second by second,  (tick tick tick) who's not what he seems.  The narrator, who doesn't have a  name but does, is literally depressed with his day to day grind of life,  uncured with insomnia and working a greed infested job that he loves to  hate with a hilarious passion.  Our narrator has a flowing tone in his  voice that sounds subliminal of all his doings which makes his particular  character realistically complex in subtle sort of way.  It's in the second  chapter of the book when the narrator starts attending self help support  groups to try and cure his insomnia, and, to cry.  The narrator says,  &quot;This is when I'd cry because right now, your life comes down to  nothing, and not even nothing, oblivion.&quot;  It's at the Remaining Men  Together support group where the narrator meets the bummed out chain  smoking Marla Singer, a she devil whom he despises because she's a tourist,  a faker who crashesthe support groups when she really doesn't have reason  to be there, or so he thinks.  Marla really doesn't have any disease or  isn't suffering of cancer, just like the narrator; but when Marla's lie  reflects our narrators lie it turns out, he can't sleep, therefore, he  can't get any relief.        Enter the charismatic soap  salesman/movieprojectionist/ banquet waiter, Tyler Durdern, who our  narrator meets on a beach.  What Tyler's doing is, making the shadow of a  human hand out of wood drowned up from the beach.  Tyler stands the wood up  at a certain angel, so the sun will shine on it at a precise moment of the  day to form the shape of a human hand in shadow, so Tyler can, &quot;lie in  the palm of perfection that he created himself,&quot; as only the narrator  can say it.  The narrator finds a demented form of comfort and self  importance in Tyler, something he's obviously never seemed to find in  himself.  Soon after, Tyler and the narrator become best friends and start  an underground cult that entitles itself &quot;Fight Club,&quot; where  young men form together in dark basements to take out violent aggressions  by beating each other to a bloody pulp.  But Fight Club isn't what it  seems.  Then the story's taken up a notch by Marla meeting Tyler, and as  the three progress in their relationship Tyler and the narrator decide to  take Fight Club up a notch, calling it &quot;Project Mayhem,&quot; where  the underground society of Fight Club form together to start what they  call, &quot;The end of civilization;&quot; where human beings will be  ancient, living in zoos wearing animal skin, as animals roam freely and the  human species become hunted &amp; wild, living in cages made for animals.   Now along with the creation of Fight Club and Project Mayhem Tyler displays  some unusually frightening behavior such as, making his soap out of human  fat, ( I suppose being reminiscent of Nazi's) splicing single frames of  X-rated pornography into kiddy flicks while working his movie projectionist  job and tainting and contaminating peoples food with, you don't want to  know, as a banquet waiter.      Now as the story progresses, the plot  thickens even deeper with enormously evolved complexities of textured  character analysis, and the story starts weaving in and out of a  mesmerizing crafted structure of visually exhilarating realities, and  stimulating dreams and discoveries for the narrator.  The story and  characters start becoming awkward through the creepy nature of the story  that seems to be nightmarishly real and delusionaly authentic making the  intense visuality of the film seem paranoid and keeps Palahniuks narrative  urgent and intensely metaphoric in relating back to the characters that  form it brilliantly.<br />  The story as a whole is exceptionally crafted with  passion, and through all of this, something lurks underneath Palahniuks  original novel that makes it feel compelling, moving, unheard of &amp;  profoundly deep; and in truthfully artistic levels too.  Tip of the iceberg  subliminal messaging, strongly described visual textured painting, dream  like worded codes and zombie like exact narrative displayed in almost slow  motion that has a knack for humor seem to awake your senses to intuition  while making you aware that what your reading might have some significance  in your own life.  And amazingly, Fight Club is never a distortion through  the many orderly levels of the inventively abrasive aspects it flawlessly  creates.       Fight Club seems to choose in making no crystal clear  statement about anything; yet it seems to run so deep, so full of thought  and ideas in it's excessive telling, that you grasping something  meaningful, important or quite interesting, to say the least, is completely  and totally unavoidable.  Fight Club has an energy filled significant deja  ve feeling about it that seems to give you a mentally sustained high, thus  making the reading of the book seem like a dream inand of itself; and  through this fascinating element comes exhilaration in a higher form of  satisfaction.<br />  Fight Club is dark and at times, very unsettling.  It's  also thickly atmospheric and a subliminally charged psychological  enterprise with odd visual overtone, creepy surrealism and witty humor.   Ugly, menacing, beautiful, truthful, involving, paradoxical, humorous,  significant and meaningful for our times, Fight Club is beyond interesting,  and artificially real in it's dream like state.  If you read it, your going  to feel as if your head's in the clouds.  I once heard an author say,  &quot;I don't write a book, I get written...&quot;  Well, be prepared  because you don't read Fight Club, Fight Club reads you.
6305078491|5.0|I can't improve on the fine reviews of the movie itself, but there are two major factors connected with the making of the film that may have been overlooked.<br />If by &quot;poor quality,&quot; the reference is to the  washed out, somewhat spotty look of the print, please be aware that this  was deliberate.  Cinematographer Matt&eacute; had accidently opened a can of  exposed film, and when Dreyer saw the result, he was delighted.  It was  just the effect he had been looking for.<br />This film was originally shot as  a silent.  It was only later half-dubbed with voice-overs.  Again, however,  like the fortuitous &quot;damage&quot; to the print, the sparse and  somewhat vague, even incoherent, dialogue contributes to the sense of  dislocation which, I believe, is one of the great virtues of this genre  masterpiece.
B000004712|4.0|This album sizzles as it moves and grooves and shakes and bakes.  There may be some 'stupid arranging tricks' but the blowin' is fine and that is where it is at.  Herbie is finally free on this after so many outings where  he wasn't goin' Up-Town like he used to.<br />Can you digIt?
0451198670|5.0|I truly loved this book.  The intrigue of Helen finding the love letter and not knowing who wrote it is wonderful.  Her affair with Johnny can make you feel young again.The book is wonderful but you must read it before you  see the movie or you will never want to read the book after seeing the  movie. The movie goes way off the mark and turns the story into a comedy  but it is really a romantic drama.
0393314804|5.0|I had heard about the movie and decided to read the book first (only to find myself vastly disappointed with the cinema version).  Irvine Welsh delves into the lives of these junkies and the pages seem to come alive.   One finds himself disgusted, charmed and saddened by this lifestyle in  Scotland.  All in all I couldn't put the book down, reading it while on a  bus tour through Europe.  The vernacular style of the book was a bit  difficult, at first, but once I got used to it I was off and running.  I  have read Welsh's other novels, as well, and found Ecstasy to be equal in  entertainment quality.
6305657939|4.0|THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is one movie that boasts just the right mix of effervescent chemistry to save the movie from sinking into a Bond flick. Rene Russo is Catherine Benett, an insurance investigator is sent to  incriminate Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) for his theft of a famous  painting. The movie is done in a seductively opulent manner, where Thomas  Crown engages in hedonism in the lifestyle of the rich and famous - while  viewers are unwittingly engaged in dreamy escapism. There are exciting  moments too - the theft like the re-enactment of Trojan Horse trick is a  parody; the mounting tension between Catherine and Thomas is simply a  pleasure to watch. <br />Rene Russo is delightful and proves herself to be one  sexy momma. She is bold, passionate and her acting is top-notch. She  handles the sexy scene with sass and the emotional scenes with finesse.  Pierce Brosnan tries hard to leave behind the shadows of Bond, and is  successful being the astute businessman. Their chemistry is altogether  smouldering. John McTiernan (Die Hard, The 13th warrior) has altogether  piece up a picture with good pacing and most importantly one fraught with  genuine chemistry. Though the plot may lack substance or sink into a fluffy  dream with a predictable ending, THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is buoyant and  uplifting. It is simply seductive pleasure at its best with the nostalgic  tune Windmill of Your mind locked in your head as you try to figure out the  magic behind AFFAIR.
B000002LK1|5.0|Violator is Depeche Mode's Achtung Baby; their Automatic For The People; in short the one Depeche Mode album most likely to be owned by non-Depeche mode fans.  This record, with its use of guitars and crisp dance beats, simultaneously hurled Depeche Mode's career toward another new direction and ushered in a new wave of fans.  Having broken through to the American market with \\"Music For The Masses\\" Depeche Mode felt confident and comfortable, and this is reflected in \\"Violator\\". It is their biggest selling album to date, and its release caused riots in parts of America.    The first single from this album was \\"Personal Jesus\\"; with sensuality and relgion as its subject (a trademark Gore fascination) and an infectious, blues riff it quickly became a hit.  It would be \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" however that would give Depeche Mode their biggest ever hit single; this song was originally conceived as a ballad, but upon the insistence of Alan Wilder, was set to dance beats.  \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" is a slow, dark number sung by Gore, a departure from the softer, more sensitive ballads we have come to expect from him. \\"Blue Dress\\", also sung by Gore, is a dark and sensual song about voyeurism, with overt references to Lynch's Blue Velvet.  It now seems rather ironic to hear Gahan sing \\"Clean/The cleanest I've been\\" on the closing track, considering it was after this album that he developed a drug addiction, which was to very nearly cost him his life.  Other singles include \\"World In My Eyes\\" and \\"Policy Of Truth\\". The highlight of the album though is \\"Halo\\", perhaps one of the best songs of their career.    With only nine songs, four of which became hit singles world-wide, it is probably a bit too short, however, if there is such a thing as a definitive Depeche Mode album then \\"Violator\\" may just well be it.
6305537798|5.0|I love this movie! I have watched it so many times I can't keep track anymore. Ms. Perky, Mr. Morgan and Mr. Stratford were scene stealers and truely three of the funniest characters in the film.  <br />Heath ledger and  julia stiles were excellent in this film.  Julia and heath can really act.   Joseph Gordon-levitt is also a good actor. but I already knew that before  seeing this film.<br />this film is the best teen film I have scene ever.  the  casting of it was superb, the story was interesting and the script was  hilarious! if you haven't scene it already see it and then you will see why  I like it so much :)
6305807086|5.0|Talk to people about this movie and they will tell you that it is weird, and others that it is brilliant. Every time this happens, I know I HAVE to see a movie.<br /> In this case, I sided with those who thought it was  brilliant. At times, during the beginning I thought I was in front of a  version of the exceptional movie &quot;Brazil,&quot; but I was proved  wrong. In fact, I'd dare to say that this movie is just as good (if not  better than Brazil).<br /> A production has to be brilliant in order to allow  you to laugh through some of the delicate topics this movie addresses.<br />  Some of the brilliant points of the movie: the 7 1/2 floor (yes,  seven-and-a-half!); the tunnel leading into JM's head; making Cameron Diaz  look so odd; John Cusack evolving throughout the movie from an innocent and  hermit puppeteer into an animal obsessed with obtaining what somebody else  has...<br /> It touches original terrain, unlike any other movie I've seen in  a long time. Guaranteed to make you think while having a GREAT laugh!  (weird ain't it?) ;)
B000007T2Z|5.0|The samples provided for these songs just don't give them justice, there is so much variety within each individual song. GYBE give us 15 + minute apocalyptic epics, which somehow have so much hope in them (I can't really  describe it).<br />This is definitely one of thoses discs that many will  listen to once and then never put it on again (but don't let that happen to  you). After a couple repeated listenings with headphones you won't be able  to get enough of it. These songs will haunt you.<br />If they ever come to  your town, don't miss them, they do a crazy show with movies that play in  the background with the music (it's really beyond description).<br />Highly  recommended
1558908498|3.0|I don't know how I've watched it twice!  Well, my friends forced me doing so. At least the film is better than I Know What You Did Last Summer (yes, I saw it. I feel guilty, ok?)- which will probably follow with the  sequences I Still Keep Knowing Ever and Allways What You Did Last Summer -  but which film isn't, right?<br />I've enjoyed Scream, The First, it was a  good film, but this one, please! It has, as the tipical teenage movies of  the 90's, cinical jokes while they are getting thriled by a psycho. I know  the film isn't supposed to be taken seriously, neither did I have this kind  of thought, but it's too foolish, predictable and boring - but that's my  opinion!<br />If you like Armaggedon and The Bone Collector - brainless and  trashy movies in general - GO WATCH IT!  YOU'LL LOVE IT! For the few  others who don't match with them, stay REALLLY away from it, as I think you  have already known.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Why does it seem like male-bashing makes the best songs?   =)  This album is great, there isn't a bad song on it.  If you like Destiny's Child, you'll like Pink, too.  The beats and lyrics are both great.  My favorite  tracks include: Hell Wit Ya, Let Me Let You Know, and Split Personality.
0812550706|4.0|I am not a sci-fi fan.  Not at all.  However, I had to read Ender's Game for my book group (all mom's/homemakers).  My 13 year old also wanted me to read it.  Honestly, I didn't like it at first.  I was often angry at  Ender's parents.  I didn't like the high-tech aspect nor the political  edge.  Then came &quot;that part&quot;!  I was totally hooked.  I loved the  way the author kept the book moving sooo quickly that I was always  surprised by what would happen next.  It is intense, sad and happy,  anguished yet so peaceful.  I can't say that I want to read more sci-fi,  but I do want to read more in this series.
0060229357|4.0|Harold is a small boy who goes out for a walk with a purple crayon in his hand. Harold draws everything he needs or wants with his purple crayon including his bed when he gets ready to lie down and go to sleep at the end  of the story.<br />Teacher Notes: Harold and the Purple Crayon is one of  several of Harold's Purple Crayon Adventures. Preschool or kindergarten  children would love this book. It would be great to read to students who  are reluctant to draw since Harold draws all of his adventures.
B00000IQBM|5.0|The haunting music, the isolated hotel, the splendidly chosen cast, and Kubrick's genius made one of the most eerie and suspensful movies of all time. The beginning sets the stage and slowly takes us into the lonely  hotel with just the three human occupants. It is there we start shivering  as Jack starts breaking down and the hotel ghosts start making their  appearances. I particularly enjoyed Lloyd the bartender and Grady the  caretaker. Their impeccable grooming and polite manners disguise their  fiendish intent. We get a brief feeling of relief when Scatman Crothers is  called in, but that is cancelled when he meets his untimely end. Shelley  Duvall was a perfect choice for Jack's wife. She has that vunerable frail  look about her and fear faces can convey fear the way she did in some of  the key scenes. Watch this movie on a cold night in a dark house alone!
B000021Y74|5.0|Run Lola Run is Groundhog Day done right.  What would you do if you only had twenty minutes to reset your life?  This film is a modern-day faery-tale retelling, embellishing on the &quot;three wishes&quot;  motif.<br />Everyone the psychically-powerful Lola meets has their fates  changed by the encounter.  I think the tragicomic effects of Lola are  absolutely hilarious!<br />The movie is very fast-paced (duh!) with an  excellent and oh!-so-appropriate soundtrack.  Cartoons are interspersed  with the live-action bits which are all covered over by driving techno  tunes and dotted with freeze-frame photography, creating a perfect panacea  for the tv generation.  And let's face it, most of us belong to that  generation, even if we've traded in our tellies for the Internet....
B000002UUX|5.0|Rust in Peace blew me away the first time I heard it. The intro to &quot;Five Magics&quot; is pretty much the reason I started playing guitar. Listening to the album now, I still feel the same excitement and exultation  I felt the first day I listened to it.      This album is without doubt  Megadeth's crowning achievement,  a showcase of their technical skill and  talent for creating visceral, by the nuts riffs. The only track on this  album which is not immediately memorable is perhaps either  &quot;Lucretia&quot; or &quot;Poison was the Cure&quot;. All of the other  tracks are effulgent displays of musical talent. If Bach and Peganini were  born in the late 60's, they would have created music like this. Created in  the last days of the solo, this album provides a persuasive argument  against the musical minimalism which has shackled players of talent since  1994.      Sad to say, this is for all practical purposes Megadeth's swan  song. Purchase this album, it is perhaps the last album the band created  with no concessions to marketability and with the artist's minds free of  the spectre of retirement.
B000002G30|5.0|This album is the reason I despise MTV and commercial radio. To think that I've lived my life for four years without this album, or even the knowledge of it's existance!  If it hadn't been for Powertrip's radio play, I would  have lived on never knowing that this band still existed. Every track on  this album is infused with energy, and memorable in it's own right. This  band opened for Marilyn Manson? In a just world, the situation would have  been reversed. This band is all about energetic rock, and totally free of  pretention and fake emo posturing. Try it, you'll like it... especially if  you're like me, a music fan who's felt deserted by Metallica and Megadeth,  and either disgusted or unimpressed by recent entries into the heavy music  market.
B000002ADT|5.0|though there are over two hundred other reviews of the same album.  And  why?  Because anyone who has ever heard this recording feels they owe it  something.  I can't say anything that hasn't been said, but I just had to  throw in my love for this album, the greatest recording of all time.  This  album was my introduction to jazz, and while I know very little about   music theory, I know that while accessible, this album reaches depths  uncharted before it.  It is easily the most beautiful music ever played,  and the virtousity of its performers is unparrelled.  This album introduced  me to the lyricism of Bill Evans, possibly the greatest pianist in jazz  history, right up there with Bud Powell and Thelonoius Monk.  It showcases  two of the greatest sax players in jazz history, Coltrane and Adderley.   The rhythm section is unmatched, perfectly complimenting and driving the  music.  And then there's Miles, at his most subtle and lyrical best.  I am  now a huge fan of jazz, and all of these musicians, thanks to this album.   In fact, this album honestly changed my life and brought about the  evolution of my musical tastes.  Quite simply the greatest recording of all  time, a must own, and an example of how music can not only provide  listening ecstasy, but also bring meaning to, and enrich  peoples lives.   There I've said my piece, thank you Miles, Coltrane, Adderley, Bill, Cobb,  Wynton, and the bass player whose name I can't remember offhand, (Jimmy?).   An album like this compels anyone who has listened to it to share their  love of it with anyone who will listen.
0792106989|5.0|Without a question, the greatest example of its genre.  When I first saw it in the movies as a young boy, I knew that I was in the presence of true greatness, a feeling which has not diminished over time.  If anything, my  feelings about the film have only grown stronger and stronger.
6304711891|5.0|This is the best action movie ever made.  It has everything-gunfights, explosions, hand-to-hand combat. How can any reviewer now give this movie ANYTHING below 5 stars?  Whether you have VHS or DVD, go out and rent or  buy this movie now. Trust me.
0800132335|5.0|Most War movies are just about action.They're usually about 2 hours worth of men killing each other, and that's it. Not that action is always a bad thing, it worked very well in Saving Private Ryan(but Ryan is an  exception)Usually in War films we don't learn about the charachters, and  hence, don't care much about them. This movie is different, it's authentic,  and also shows how different people react to certain situations. Because of  the movie's length, by the end you are almost certain to get some sort of  feel as to what it's like to be in a submarine for an extended amount of  time. Many people complain that this movie is boring. They just don't have  good attention spans.(I know because I've insulted them I'll get many  &quot;non-helpful&quot; votes.) This movie is about realism. If you don't  want that, and prefer action, go watch John Wayne. Those kind of movies  where the good guys are always confident, and the heroes always prevail.  But if you want to see a WWII movie with a different perspective, I  reccomend this one.
B000003TAR|5.0|Punk rock album for the punk rock fan.  Not for the mainstream&quot;rock&quot; fans that enjoy commercial and over produced garbage we have now (Godsmack, Korn, Limb Biz., Creed, etc.)...
B000000FG8|5.0|This album collects a good amount of the music put out by Operation Ivy in the short time they were together. This band is one of the most amazing you will ever hear. They mix fast punk rock, high-energy uptempo ska, and  searingly insightful lyrics. The songs are short and memorable. Every one  is a classic.<br />The album has one of the best opening songs of all-time and  one of my favorite Op Ivy songs: &quot;Knowledge&quot;. An explosion of  fast punk and howling vocals, with Jesse offering &quot;all I know is that  I don't know nothing&quot; on the chorus. From then on, every song is  great, from the brilliant ska of &quot;Sound Sytem&quot; to the  reggae-styled &quot;Take Warning&quot; to the massively influential  musically and lyrically &quot;Unity&quot;.<br />To close, there is NO reason  why anyone should be without this CD.
0393312836|5.0|Burgess created a brillant rollercoaster classic in A Clockwork Orange. It took me about a month to finish this book, which is longer than i expected. The russian slang is fantastic and adds color to the murky tale of A  Clockwork Orange.  I had to take breaks because reading this was difficult  in more ways than one.  Alex isn't one of those reporters on the tv,  telling us stories about crime and rape and the corrupt government.  He  isn't a journalist writing a 4-paragraphed sumary of a recent crime. He  lives the crime through his own hands, fists, feet, etc. Alex takes you on  the ride that is his life, into the tunnel of his mind and hole of his  heart. His antics and frame of mind are both very intruiging and  disgusting.  I felt somewhat of a softspot for him when his large love for  music was ruined due to his role as a guinea pig after jail.  Imagine  wanting to vomit when witnessing/hearing something you previously  absolutely adored and lived for.  A Clockwork Orange isn't for everyone.   If you are easily offended or closeminded, don't bother because this book  will mess with your head somewhat (at least, it did with me).  Your Humble  Narrator probably wouldn't reccomend it to everyone either.
B0000019PA|5.0|I have heared that this band has now broken up, and I can only hope that  this is an unfounded rumor.  The title track is so lovely that my brother  actually played it at his wedding, and made a gift to me of the CD  afterward, at which time I promptly fell in love with the whole thing.  Treat yourself to somthing different, and amazing!
B00000JHAU|5.0|everything by b&amp;s is good but this is the best
1572522232|5.0|My friend is a cheap-70's-horror movie buff, and I'm not. I figured I was in for a good laugh with this one, but I was wrong. I figured I'd fall asleep after the laugh, but I was wrong. Instead, I didn't take my eyes off  the TV until my friend turned off the VCR. Not to sound overly dramatic,  but Suspiria is completely stunning and unlike any of my friend's other  cheap 70's horror movies. I haven't seen photography like it anywhere else;  it's almost like an elaborate, freaked out home video. It impressed me so  much that I had to do it justice by writing a review for it. A very  strange, amazing movie, whether you get scared or not.
0783225733|5.0|With a new home theater system, I was in a quandary about whether to buy the DVD Dts or the DVD collector edition.  My dts DVDs I own so far... Jaws and Twister... are amazing.  After reading the Amazon reviews I went with  the non-dts and wow were you guys correct.  I'm sure the dts must sound  great because the non-dts sounds fantastic.  The extra features such as the  excellent documentary and the (2) different commentaries are completely  left out of the dts versions!  The Amazon reviewers gave me this info. and  I went with their advice.  The commentaries, one by Ronny Howard and the  other by Jim and Marilyn Lovell, give you tremendous insight into the film.   When DVD works well it gives you a film, an experience, and insight into  that experience.  This Apollo 13 DVD Non-dts collector's edition is well  worth the money!  Other reviewers give a good analysis of the film, while  I'm here to tell you that if you aren't sure which DVD to buy, read my  opinion and the reviews of others and you'll go with this version!  This  dvd, along with The Third Man and The Abyss are the best overall dvds I  own!   This will give you the full experience!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|...I am SOOOOO stoked that Dickenson and Smith are back in the band.  It just wasn't the same without em'!  It totally shows with this disc.  It is the best Maiden has put out in a long time.  And to celebrate...I'm  starting an AD&amp;D campaign.<br />Up the irons!
6303589162|5.0|I think this is the best movie Brian DePalma ever did, and that's saying something.  A great meditation on voyeurism (both the characters and ours),  this is a sylish, witty, and scary film.  The location manager deserved an  Oscar.  John Lautner's Chemosphere house, the Rodeo Collection, Mulholland  Drive, and the California aqueduct are used to great effect in this movie  (even though we are asked to believe that they are all in Beverly Hills),  and the camera work is fantastic.  In one shot, the movement of a swinging  door is the only clue that we are watching the filming of a porn video.  I  won't get into the plot, which is covered better in some of the other  reviews, but I thought it was very entertaining, and the principles as well  as the supporting cast are first rate.  I wish they still made movies like  this one- ones that can keep you watching from behind your fingers, but  still make you think to keep up with them
B00003BDXG|1.0|How desensitized to violence and murder does a person have to be to be entertained by such filth.
6302648750|5.0|This one is a corker- from the opening credits- over a god-awful 70's style finale for a musical version of &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (you'll want to rewind a few times) to the last line- &quot;Do you remember  where you parked the car?&quot;, you will alternate between laughter and  awe.  Awe that a major director and studio would put out a movie this  nasty.  IT's mean spirited, cruel, over-the-top, evil, and just about the  most fun you can have in front of a tv for 90 minutes.  Get the video- the  version shown on TV has, I think, about a half an hour chopped out that  will never make it onto even cable, unless it's HBO.  And despite it's  message, I think I would still take the potion.... I'd just not turn my  back on Bruce Willis.
B000003TA4|4.0|This album is some what over-rated.  This is one every one has on top ten lists as greatest albums of the 90s (In most of the lists that I have seen it is number one.)  When people think of muisc in the 90s a big cunk of  people think of this album!  (The song that comes to mind or should I say  NEVERMIND is SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPRIT!)  I think that SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT  is one of Nirvana's best songs, but I do not think that NEVERMIND is  Nirvana's best album.  I thik that &quot;BLEACH&quot; and IN UTERO are  greater albums.  But the way I look at the album is that most of the song  are not that great. Some of the songs just does not do any thing for me!  Over all I think that it is a good album to get.  I would saw that this is  not the greatest album of time.  It is just a good album with some good  songs on it. Every time I hear SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT, I hear Teen-e  boppers jumping up and down saying I love you Kurt Cobain when Kurt Cobain  is saying I hate you in his song!  One last thing....... Oh NEVERMIND!
6303972810|4.0|I loved this movie. Especially little Warwick Davis. This is a great movie that needs to be seen. I loved this movies so much I have seen it 46 times. If you like action, humor, magic, and romance than this is the movie for  you.
B000021Y77|5.0|It's a pity that Hollywood cannot produce films that rival foreign movies of the genre of Run Lola Run. It's powerful soundtrack, the brilliant photography, witty direction and above all, fine pieces of acting, combines  together to deliver a masterpiece.<br />Run Lola Run is about the uncertainty  in how things 'could have been' had 'this' happened. Upon viewing, one is  immediately led to place themselves in the shoes of Lola , don't be  surprised if you find yourself screaming - ohh, I wish I had read the  newspaper earlier in the morning, I wouldn't have missed out on the deal  they had down at the Mall,... or conversely, romantically recollecting - If  I hadn't missed the bus the day I met Jerry we would have never been such  good friends,... - everything that we do, our actions, even the subtlemost  of events changes every following event - that is the main theme. The  director does a brilliant work of explaining how every action shapes the  future in a cleverly crafted movie with a very apt soundtrack. This is one  movie you won't forget too soon, if you want to see a title with productive  context, yet not drab as a documentary, or fast-paced and context-less as  most Hollywood Action productions, watch this. It never drags even for a  moment, provides the viewer with food for thought, while at the same time  produce a brilliant work of visualizaion and above all, a novel and  absorbing unpredictable storyline.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I have always said I did not like Creed. Yet when I unintentially bought  HUMAN CLAY, I knew then I was going to be a fan of them for life. <br />With  songs like &quot;SAY I&quot;,&quot;ARMS WIDE OPEN&quot;, and  &quot;HIGHER&quot; this has turned me into a creed fan. Every song is  excellent it makes you beg for me. I am such a big fan,I am listening to it  now.
B000001FDQ|4.0|Malmsteen does a very good job.  He is very technically oriented.  he thinks he knows all there is to know about music.  He knows how to make the guitar go where he wants it to, but he puts no emotion into his playing.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This movie in short simply rocks. Set in late 99', the movie follows NEO(KEANU REEVES) as he tries to discover what the MATRIX really is. It also star Laurence Fishburn(MORPHEUS) whose trying to find the one to  change the Matrix.<br /> The acting is a little slow except for Fishburne,but  the script and graphics make this an excellent movie. This is a movie full  of action, drama, and totally rocking effects.
B000000WF9|4.0|The score for Gattaca is excellent. Even though many of the songs are less  than 2 minutes in length it is a great buy. All of the songs basically have  the same feel to them, but the way they are composed and rearranged is very  enjoyable. Overall, a very good album.
630133454X|5.0|i absolutely loved this movie. Full of deceit, lies, and sex. It captures all the combinations to make an excellent movie. If you like &quot;Angels and Insects&quot; or &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; , you will completely  enjoy this movie.<br /> The cast are miracle workers. With Glenn Close and  John Malkovich, you will believe the story they are telling.<br /> A must buy.
B00000J7JO|4.0|I feel like a jerk for giving this 4 stars. You know all the praise and I definately feel that &quot;Californication&quot; and &quot;Otherside&quot; are some of the greatest the Peppers have done. Although after One Hot  Minute and Blood Sugar Sex Magik this isn't such a bad album. Peppers fans  should definately buy it. It's not the best they've done but it's good. And  that's good enough to buy.
B000006U44|5.0|This album is strictly beautiful. In response to the &quot;heigth&quot; of her voice, she did it for the purpouse of the song &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and she is 17 and British, cut the woman a break. I  personally think it's lovely and more emotional than any other artists her  age today. She actually wrote this whole album, which is something any  other 17 year old could hardly do.<br />From &quot;Moving&quot; a chanting  song with the beauty of the song of a whale at the beginning and  incorporated chants, to &quot;Saxophone Song&quot; a poetic lovely song  with Kate's vocals soft and humming. Even such whimsical songs like  &quot;Kite&quot; (dedicated to Bob Marely's rythyms) with a fairly  reminescent beat and the delicate &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; &quot;The Man  With the Child in His Eyes&quot; and &quot;Feel It&quot; let's you in the  wonderous mind and delicate vocals of Kate Bush.<br />Of course there is  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; which went to No.1 and got Kate her success  in the first place, is hardly unlookable with an unforgetable rythym and  beautiful lyrics, is hardly passable.<br />Forget the vocals, dig the music.  Find your kick inside, and above all FEEL IT!
B000003TA4|2.0|Nirvana is by far one of the most over rated bands of all time. Really after hearing how great this album was by everyone and their mother I was  expecting it to be as great as a Beatles album. Finally when I heard it I  had to stop the thing before I threw my cd player out a window. Sure  Nirvana sounds great but the lyrics are almost childish. If you want some  cd for some mindless fun go ahead and get it. &quot;Smells like Teen  Spirit&quot; though is not the best song on the album.
B000002PBL|5.0|Hard Promises continued along the same lines as Damn The Torpedoes but the big bonus on this one was the songwriting - Tom Petty began to settle into a truly great songwriter. Hard Promises is yet another fine example of the  big fat &quot;Jimmy Iovine sound&quot; that really shined on Torpedoes as  well as on Patti Smith's &quot;Easter&quot; and Stevie Nicks's &quot;Bella  Donna&quot; (which was released a few months behind Petty's). Iovine gave  in to Nicks's plan to sing with Petty and a new rock and roll superstar-duo  got underway with two tracks on this album and several on Nicks's solo  records. The two showcased a few songs sporadically throughout the Hard  Promises tour often making musical magic onstage. Petty's career continued  to skyrocket with so many great releases that it's hard to figure out where  Hard Promises falls amongst the greatness. It's certainly one of his  strongest efforts and is sure to bring smiles to the faces of fans for  years to come.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is a really good CD.  People probably think, oh, well, yeah, Savage  Garden's just a bunch (actually, not a BUNCH, but) of soft, soft, soft,  bubblegum poppers, but actually this CD is pretty good.  The first five  songs are the best, but the Animal Song is pretty cool too.  The songs are  all pretty catchy and make you want to sing along (unfortunately for the  people around me! lol!).  So if you liked &quot;I knew I loved U&quot; than  this CD is 4 you.  Happy listening.
0671015206|4.0|I thought this would be a little more like &quot;Millionaire Mind&quot; and it is not nearly as good. It is very repititious about being frugal. Over all though, I would say it does have a good message about being  frugal, even though it takes like 300 pages to say it.
B000002GKT|5.0|Especially &quot;Hallelujah, I love you&quot; is incomparable for guitar,  lyrics and sentiment.  WOW!
6305910103|5.0|Like most fans, I recommend STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN as the best of the Trek film franchise, including the Next Generation films. Despite the lackluster STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, Paramount knew it had a franchise  to compete with STAR WARS on its hands, and put Nicholas Meyer at the helm  of the series' comeback.<br />Originally conceived as STAR TREK: THE  UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY (a tip to Spock's death -- the undiscovered country is  the place where no traveler returns from -- and a title Meyer liked enough  to resurrect for the sixth (and final) original cast Trek installment), the  film had just about everything going for it: plot, acting (yes, I said  acting), special effects, and an incredible sweeping musical score by James  Horner.<br />The DVD is pretty much perfect, with some caveats. I agree with  another reviewer about the lack of additional scenes on the DVD. What  happened, Paramount? We know these additional scenes to exist (via network  screenings of the film). One should note, however, the sound quality. It's  stunning, especially in surround. Almost worth it for that alone.<br />It was  also interesting to see the Trailer for the film again; I'd forgotten how  cheesy it was. :)<br />Despite shortcomings (lack of additional scenes or any  real extras on the DVD), this is one of the DVDs I've been waiting for a  long time. A welcome addition to just about any DVD collection.

0792107683|4.0|Shane is well more than the classic gunfighter-hiding-from-his-past western, though it is that in part. Both the sombre, striking  cinematography and the moral dilemma at the heart of the story are quite  modern; they give this movie depth and poignance that make it seem as  appropriate in company with, say, The Unforgiven as it is in company with  The Virginian.<br />A couple of examples of Shane's depth, hopefully without  divulging anything crucial to the potential buyer:<br />There are &quot;good  guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot; in Shane, sure. Ryker, the cattle man,  intends to push the local &quot;sodbusters&quot; to regain his free range,  and he's got the black hat on without a doubt. But the movie gives him his  due, in a few ways. The moral question is not one of what the sides want,  but of how they go about trying to get what they want. I respect that.<br />A  great deal of Shane's themes are almost tacitly told, too. For example,  Shane's attraction to Mrs. Starrett is subtle; you're allowed to wonder a  little what his intentions are. Above all else, the question of whether  Shane will return to his past life is never said aloud, though it's the  central plotline. That's the mark of exceptional writing.<br />Add that sort  of depth to very fine cinematography in perfect tune with the tone of the  movie. No question, this is a great Western and a great film.
B00004W5UA|5.0|Every one expected this film to simply be a simple film with over the top graphic violence, however anyone who has seen the film would have to agree that this isn't the case. The fighting part of the film is simply a  subplot, with the main plot being one of a psycholigcal insite one mans  warpped brain.  This is quite simply an excellent film with a plot which  will quite simply knock you back and I recomend you watch it, this is one  of bratt's best achievements to date, proving he isn't simply a man of  muscle but truely can act and can do it well!
B0000203Y5|5.0|these musicians. Enchanting melodies like no other; rhythm that taps you on the shoulder, grabs your arm and you are gone.  Simple lyrical stories only genious could write.  I saw this on PBS so I have to get the movie and  the CD's.  My family almost moved to Cuba when I was young; I agree with  Mr. Nee---I'm ready to go now-don't forget the camera.  Thanks, Buena Vista  Social Club and Ry Cooder.

0783239408|5.0|No, this movie was not the most unique of it's class. It's been done many times before, but I don't believe like this. The movie works for 3 reasons: Kevin Spacey, Annete Benning, and the cinematography. Kevin deserved the  Oscar well, and I'd give it to him just for the final look on his face, a  blank gaze of astonishment, horror, peace... and inevitablity. The film is  depressing in the end, yes, but it's in the way that it will make you  remember it forever, and it gives an important message. Even the first  words of the movie make you stand at attention (little do I know that in  less than a year, I'll be dead), as you see this man's upward (or downward,  for that matter) spiral. The scene that should definetly go down in history  is the wonderful dinner scene, where Lester tells his wife what he did that  day, what he thinks of her music, then, subtley stands up and smashes a  plate into the wall. Sounds like a pissy guy getting mad at his wife,  right? Look closer...
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is one of the best cd's to come out in a long time.  All the songs on it are worth listening to, except for the skits, which I thought were pretty stupid.  So what if he disses homosexuals, britney spears, nsync and  all the rest of them..did anyone ever say Eminem was serious?  This cd is  all just for fun if you take it seriously you could get seriously screwed  up. If you don't like violence or get offended easily don't buy this cd.   Every song on this cd rocks.  Everyone should go out and get it!

B00004RFCM|5.0|One of the BEST shows that HBO, or any television network for that matter, has come up with in...years!  At last, us 20-somethings (heading towards our 30's), have a show to call our own! Superbly cast, Carrie (Sarah  Jessica Parker), Samantha (Kim Cattrall), Charlotte (Kristin Davis), and  Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) give us characters to which we can all relate.<br />Carrie, a NY-City paper columnist who writes provoking shorts about  &quot;sex and the city,&quot; is a witty, trendy, modern woman of the  '90's--and a true romantic at heart. She wants the sweep-you-off-your-feet,  love-at-first-sight type of romance which she seems to get from Mr. Big  (Chris Noth)...but Mr. Big isn't ready to give back to her to the same  degree (c'mon, we've ALL been there).  Samantha, the most liberated and  sexually adventurous of the four, is &quot;a woman trapped in a New York  City man's body&quot;...and all she wants is a good time.  As she so  poignantly puts it, &quot;I'm tri-sexual; I'll try anything once!&quot;  Miranda, a corporate lawyer, is the epitome of the hardened, jaded,  suspicious 30-something woman with a razor-sharp sense of humor, and a  heart of gold. And Charlotte, an idealistic, sorority-type prude, searches  for a man with 3 qualities: money, looks, and an apartment on the East  Side. Watch Carrie, and her three cronies, go from man, to man, to man in  their never-ending search for &quot;Mr. Right,&quot; while they often find,  and settle, for &quot;Mr. Right Now&quot;.  This show is HILARIOUS,  well-written, always versatile, quite witty, and a sumptuous eye-candy for  the trend-addicted crowd. I rented it to see if it was worth to own...and  my answer? YES, YES, YES!  I'm buying it--and so should you!  This is a  piece of TV history, and an essential guide to pop-culture, and every  modern woman should own a copy!
B00004TWZF|5.0|I fell in love with this beautiful movie the first time I ever saw it. A long movie? Never long enough. I have been searchig for this movie for a long time. It has always been SO hard to come by. If you buy 1 movie, buy  this one. It will change your life.
6304308388|5.0|The Apartment  first bowled me over when I was 17--when I fell in love with the Shirley McLaine character, Fran Kubelick. One of the triumphs of this film is that it manages to be a very moving love story, very funny  comedy and very dark satire without diluting its emotional, comic or  intellectual impact. I think it's one of the best films ever made, and  certainly my personal favourite. <br />Fred MacMurray's screen persona exuded  avuncular reassurance. By exposing his character, in The Apartment, as a  ruthless, manipulative liar, director Billy Wilder neatly exposes the  corruption at the heart of the seeming benevolence of corporate America in  1950s.<br />The Apartment is about ordinary people trying to act decently in  the urban, corporate jungle-\\"the people who get took\\" up against \\"the  takers\\". Of course it is the takers (Mr Dobisch, Mr Kirkeby and their Bronx  floozies) who provide the laughs. I guess it goes to the heart of human  nature. Good people are not entertaining. Greed, lust and other sins are  inherently entertaining, even sympathetic. Hence the attraction of Walter  Matthau. It is one of the quiet triumphs of The Apartment that Lemmon and  McLaine manage to make goodness so gently and attractively comic in  contrast to the harsh, vaudeville of Kirkeby, Dobisch, the switchboard  operator, et al. In counterpoint to all this, is a wonderful chorus of \\"old  country\\" Jewish common-sense and decency, represented by Lemmon's next-door  neighbours Dr and Mrs Dreyfuss. They urge Lemmon to be a \\"mensch (\\"you know  what that means? a human being\\") in opposition to the cynical values of  corporate America. <br />And the film offers one of the best closing lines in  any movie, ever (&quot;Miss Kubelick I absolutely adore you.&quot;  &quot;Shut up and deal!\\"). Chokes me up every time.     An odd, 1970s  companion piece to The Apartment is the sweetly insane Can She Bake A  Cherry Pie starring the weirdly attractive Karen Black (Fran Kubelick after  a nervous breakdown?). It is another comedy about lonely misfits finding  love in New York City. It was memorably described by Time Out as the \\"damn  nicest film since Astaire stopped dancing\\".
B000000W5N|5.0|Of course, the album's brilliant. You already know that, or you wouldn't be reading this (I think we read these things about music we've owned  forever just to see our own opinions confirmed by others). But two  performances really stand out: Mick Jagger's vocals and Mick Taylor's deft  guitar work. It's always been a bit disappointing to me that Jagger's  popular reputation is principally that of a showman (or shaman, maybe), but  multiple listenings to this album prove to me that, at one time, nobody  could convey the nasty power or range of emotion he was capable of. And  Taylor really came into his own here, settling in and working perfectly  with Keith to create what I feel is the best twin guitar attack I've ever  heard. With regard to content, the range of songwriting is impressive, from  the sweetness of &quot;Wild Horses&quot; to the cynicism of &quot;Dead  Flowers&quot; to the harshness of &quot;Brown Sugar.&quot; (How many casual  &quot;fans&quot; do you think actually have listened to those lyrics?)  Anyway, it's a truly great album; right now it's my favorite of theirs,  which makes it my favorite of all time. But check back: it probably won't  be long before &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; or &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; lure  me back for a while.
B000002LND|5.0|The Immaculate Collection has to be one of the best greatest hits albums ever. It covers all of her best eighties music from &quot;Lucky Star&quot;  and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; to &quot;Vogue&quot; and the controversial  &quot;Justify My Love&quot;. There are 17 tracks here and it only covers  the eighties! I would love to see her release another collection with some  of her nineties material such as &quot;Take A Bow&quot; and &quot;Ray of  Light.&quot; Anyways,if you want a Madonna album and don't want to buy all  of her early albums(Madonna,Like a Virgin,True Blue,Like a Prayer,I'm  Breathless)this will definately save you some serious cash.
B000000WA4|5.0|This recording was just a complete slap in the faces of the naysayers that said if you release a double so early you will fall and fall hard well  guess what the pumpkins are still around and rocking harder then ever and  just having fun this recoreding starts you thinking oh my god what has  happened to the pumpkins but just wait for about two min and they will send  you off to dreamland with tonight tonight and just as you fall asleep and  your dreams become filled with the fancy of love you are jarred awake by  the grinding gutar and nasal tones of billy which ends with james iha  sending you on a ride to the world of love with the slow chords and low  voice tones and wisfull lyics that just as you start to sleep you are  awakin again (if you have a cd changer that is) by the song were boys fear  to tred which is followed by the loud gutar and off beat lyics of bodies  and then again they send you right back to dreamland with thirty-three and  in the arms of sleep and then you go back in time to 1979 but after that  don't dispare they take you deep in side the bonds of hell with tales of a  schored earth and make you wwonder what love is and then they just drop you  off and leave you like oliver twist saying &quot;please sir may i have some  more&quot; (just in case you couldn't tell i like the blue cd more but i  still like every song)
B00000J2PH|5.0|First of all,let me just say I am only sixteen-years-old,but I know a masterpiece when I hear one and tapestry IS one. I know,I should be off listening to Backstreet Boys and Christina Aguilera(who happen to be two of  my favorite artists/groups)but I love all music. This has to be the best  album of the seventies. Tapestry is amazing. It's no wonder that it spent  15 weeks at number 1 and stayed on the charts for a fantastic 6 years!   Carole King's voice is unmistakable and powerful. Her jamming piano  completely makes the song &quot;I Feel the Earth Move.&quot; Then there are  such gems as &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;It's Too  Late&quot; which also make the album outstanding. All music lovers have to  have Tapestry in their collection. It can appeal to everyone of every age.
0767903854|4.0|Bill Bryson's work &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; won't disappoint readers who enjoyed &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot;  While words like &quot;bewildering,&quot; &quot;antipodean,&quot; and  &quot;unforgiving&quot; may appear a few too many times for some, this book  is nonetheless entertaining and wittily written.  Readers follow Bryson  through his escapades and encounters across the Lucky Country -- including  a hilariously ill-fated attempt at boogy boarding in Bondi and several  run-ins with more than colorful locals.  The book combines a fun blend of  travels and Australian history, not at all dry or text-bookish.  For those  who have traveled in Australia, &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; evokes a  nostalgia all too enjoyable to revel in; for those who have never visited,  I guarantee you will walk away with an overwhelming desire to go.
0380788624|4.0|i loved this book, found almost every page to be a pleasure. I loved the length and the complexity.  I was, however, disappointed with the ending.  In fact, it didn't really make sense. why write this fantastic 900 page  tome, and then pay so little attention to the ending?  Suffice it to say  that the closing scenes and the ultimate villain just weren't believable.   it seemed like stephenson was just tired of the book and wanted it to be  over.  i also agree with the reviewer who was irritated by the loose ends.   Who WAS responsible for putting randy in prison?  If it is the person who  seems like the only possibility, it is hard to understand how he had that  kind of power.  Next time, stephenson should take a break if he gets tired,  but come through with a better finish.  p.s. i love lawrence pritchard  waterhouse.
B00004RF98|3.0|Singin' in the Rain is one of my favorite films, though I am not a fan of musicals.  It is not only a celebration of singing, dancing, Gene Kelly, and vaudeville antics, it is a celebration of the medium of film.  Though  it was made at a time when Hollywood was famous for its rigid and  creativity-stifling production practices, Singin' in the Rain is remembered  as a landmark of innovation and style.  <br />Despite this being both one of  the greatest and one of the most popular films of all time, MGM (and now  Warner) has released it as a sub-par dvd.  It lacks any real special  features (except for the trailer), though I imagine there are a number of  documentaries and perhaps interviews about the film, and certainly many  qualified film historians that would have been willing to record a  commentary track.  <br />The image quality is lacking.  This is the  worst-looking dvd that I own from a major studio (Warner hasn't remastered  for the rerelease).  It is exceptionally soft, and digital artifacting  abounds.  The colors are off, and the print could certainly be cleaned up.   It was probably duped from a laserdisc.  This film would truly benefit from  a restoration and re-release (like some of Hitchcock's films have gotten).   <br />If you love the movie, by all means buy the disc, but if you own the VHS  or Laserdisc copy (that isn't all worn out), I'd hold out for a special  edition, because the dvd won't look any better than a laserdisc, and not  that much better than VHS.  What a fantastic film.
0060196122|5.0|THIS is a cool book!  I loved it right from the start and found the introduction of new characters throughout to be a smart and savvy way of keeping a serious story light. Yes, it's about suicide, but the author's  psychological insight and plain common sense made me laugh and cry and nod  my head, &quot;yes!&quot;  Sometimes a hard blow is what is needed to wake  us up, and Veronika was delt the hardest.  How she emerged and what she  thought about in the process is fascinating. This is creative writing at  its best.
B00000DFMM|5.0|I first heard P-M along with the Smiths &quot;How Soon is Now&quot; and i was forever turned to &quot;new wave&quot; or &quot;Mod&quot; Music back in  the eighties...P was WAY ahead of their times and i was glad to have found  so early in my life<br />Even today, the same tunes still evokes the emotions  that it did almost 20 years ago. <br />in order for any music to be great, it  must be timeless. i.e. you can't tell when it was made..and this album, my  friend, is such an album.<br />it will ring true for me even when i turn  eighty!<br />aloha
B00000K19E|2.0|The Wachowski brothers take on reality. Obviously it's a subject that should have been treated by someone with more intelligence as the film dissolves into the kind of anti-technological paranoia found in 'The  Terminator'. It's true that the digital FX are awesome, but without a doubt  do not touch the power of The Phantom Menace. The story revolves around a  group of guerilla type freedom fighters who know that daily life is an  elaborate constuct controlled by artificial intelligence also known as The  Matrix. Indeed, in more typical sci-fi fair, the masses are not aware that  they are, well, 'enslaved'. This of course is not unlike the awesome 'Dark  City'. <br />The rebels are lead by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a paranoid  Obi-Wan Kenobi type who is searching for 'the One' who will save us all.  This 'One' is Keanu Reeves who acts as artifical as The Matrix. Though I  guess we are not supposed to care he can't act because we feel sorry for  his burden as humanities 'savior' (HA!). With such cool internet names as  Neo, Cypher and Trinity they are distinguished by their just as cool black  leather threads. Along with the obnoxious Techno/Electro rock tracks - it's  MTV perfect. <br />Though the pseudo Zen spiritual hokum and philosophy  (&quot;Human Beings are the cancer of the planet - We are the cure&quot;)  may enrapture 16 year olds across the world, the film is too caught up in  formula to have any real insight - Thousands of bullets fly, good guys  don't get hit, *yawn*. Like some comic book, the fate of the world comes  down to a big fist fight. Indeed, the real star of this film may be fight  choreographer 'Yuen Wo Ping' who did great work with 'Fist of Legend'.  Which really sums up The Matrix - An overdirected piece of Hong Kong flash.
B00004SU5J|5.0|This is one really great album which, in my view, is quite similar to Rinocerose's &quot;Istallation Sonore&quot; (which isn't a bad thing!). Where Rinocerose blend guitar/rock with electro St Germain fuses elements  of jazz and smooth beats, the result is extremely pleasing. Buy it!
B000000OUE|5.0|For sake for contraversy(and for the sake of pure unadulturated fun), I have dubbed this CD that title. And it will stay that way. Forever! BOHAHAHAHA!<br />Heh, that was fun...<br />Immature fun aside, I still stand by  my quote. Unlike alot of metal(both past and present) it has the following  qualities to it:<br />1)Hard, heavy, bone crushing riffs(and much less anoying  then alot of Zombie's present work. UGH! *shivers in fear*). 2)Memorable,  catchy songs(I'll be the first to admit it, I've cought myself singing  Super Charger Heaven on more than one occasion). 3)Strong  musicianship(something you dont see everyday, especially in Zombie's new  work) And 4)Not so serious, but still loud and cool as hell lyrics(here  again I go back to Super Charger Heaven).<br />So there you have it folks, a  classic in the making! Sure its not supa mainstream like Rob's newer stuff,  but to tell you the truth its a hell of alot better.<br />&quot;More HUMAN  than HUMAN!&quot;
0446677450|4.0|As a beginner in the financial market it was helpful to have information of how to be smart with my money. I firmly believe in going to school and even getting your grad degree, but the working world is extremely harsh. I would rather do what I like doing rather than working paycheck to paycheck.  This book gives me an idea of how to start. Yes, the book is not the best  written book, but ask yourself, what does it matter? The author himself is  wealthy, which is more than I could say about many of his critics. I did  not give it five stars, because he could have elaborated on some of the  issues like forms of investing other than realestate. Also I found it  insulting how he treated his father, but I do think his reason for doing it  was to portray the foolishness of the middle class philosophy. I do not  recommend this for people who are heavily in debt, extremely poor, or above  40. For people heading into the work world, or people who don't like the  working world, should buy a copy. ... For the  beginner the information is invaluable.
B00004THAY|4.0|When I heard that this partnering was in the pipeline,for this type of album,I could not help but get excited.I expected the best and what has been delivered did not disappoint.B.B.King is sounding better than ever and  the surprise is the great vocals of old Slow Hand.I just knew after hearing  the Rock Me Baby track,on B.B.Kings *Best of friends type offeringof a  couple of years ago,that the joining of these two greats was long overdue.  The songs on this offering are professionally crafted and excellently  produced.The guitar work is also excellent,it reminds me of Eric Clapton in  the pre Cream days when he was playing with the Blues Breakers.Some of the  guitar breaks cannot but force you to be spirited away to a bi-gone  time,and to play that air guitar.This is the type of recording that sounds  great on first listen and continues to improve the more you listen to  it.The money you have expended is certainly well spent,which cannot be said  for some of the CDs released from the swill of the popular/radio play  charts and lists of today. The music is not dated and the vocals are  great.Eric Clapton sings with that bluesy edge that has seemed to have left  him over the last decade.It appears that when these legends return to their  roots,and lets face it,it was R&amp;B and Blues that inspired them back in  the early to mid 60s,they get back to what they do best and what has  influenced the artists of the last 20 years. To play with B.B.King as a  friend,as an equal certainly makes this a truely joyous recording.Like a  good red wine B.B.King just gets better,and I see why Eric Clapton himself  would have been influenced by the likes of B.B.King Jimmy Rogers and John  lee Hooker in the first place.I sometimes wonder in 20 years time when  these guys are gone,what will be left to listen to?  This recording should  make any listener go back and listen to the catalogues of both artists,as a  matter of fact it would be foolhardy if you didnt! Music is a personal  taste thing,I know,but I think it is time to get some from listening to  this one!  To sum up this recording,I will say this,when the bargain  bins of the record stores offer originals and compilations of both artists  at a cheaper price,you can feel justified that you paid full price for this  one.I want to be happy to spend the money and like the result,I am with  this one.So pull over and let me in,lets go for a drive down the  highway...and let the ordinary listen to the thrashings of blink 182 or  whoever,..where are my sunglasses...4 to 41/2 stars on this one.ste thing,I know,but I think it is time to get some from listening to  this one!

B0000047D5|5.0|Oscar Peterson isn't called the swinger for nothing, as this classic album demonstrates. Covering current pop hits of the day like &quot;The Days Of Wine And Roses&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, and especially their version of  &quot;Corcovado&quot; which opens the album, the trio casts them in a new  light with uniquely different arrangements that showcase their tight  rhythmic playing. Great liner notes in the booklet and an excellent 20-bit  remaster make this album seem new again. A great album and one of the best  in the Verve catalog, period.
6304140428|5.0|i'm 15 years old.  my mother didn't want me to watch this film...(after  viewing it, i think inside she feels ashamed of her personality matching  martha's too closely..) anyways, i just finished watching it about an hour  ago.  i was touched at how, under all the hostility, george and martha  truly needed each other.  it was very moving and maybe too familiar.   perhaps even more so than what seemed at the beginning of the film as the  &quot;perfect couple&quot;, nick and honey.  this film makes one want to  examine life and look closer at those around you.  it also makes me want to  read the screenplay and learn a little more about virginia woolf...
630575067X|2.0|Overhyped, yes.  The movie is an epic, with some amazing special effects, and some great salutes to the Star Wars world we all know and love.  I actually enjoyed the movie and will buy it when it gets on DVD - it is  entertaining, but the below faults are what keeps this movie from being the  best ever - which, unfortunately, it could have been with a little more  forethought and direction (sorry George - the rust is way too apparant).   <br />1) Underdeveloped characters - made 2 dimmensional for kids, little  development for adults, cookie-cutter and expected, creates little to  identify with and care about.  This immediately makes the movie  &quot;worse&quot; than the other 3.  Characters of Liam Neeson, Samuel L,  Jake Llloyd, Natalie Portman as the slave girl.  Caring or loving them is  very, very tough!  <br />2) The Force as chemicals and science - totally takes  the fantasy out of Star Wars, which was always a blend of Sci-Fi and  Fantasy.  No more is it magical Jedi knights, but Hi-tech blood enhanced  combatants.<br />3) Jesus Skywalker - he can be chosen, just don't make him  immaculately conceived, that is just stupid and lame, and I think it has  been done before.  <br />4) Calling him Ani - everytime it was done it made me  cringe...the kid is way too happy go lucky for being a slave on Tatooine,  and does nothing to further his destiny - a slave who can build his own  droids, has his own place with his Mom, and he can build pod racers?   I  never got the sense that this life was oh so hard!  Just as much lack of  acting talent as movie direction.  Also, what is the deal with all of  &quot;Ani's&quot; little friends - since when do Slaves get to hang out and  play ball and build pod racers and act so happy?   The Greedo kid played by  Willow man also really looked bad and out of proportion.<br />5) Making light  of war with the Gungans and Droids - no real drama.  The droids were  dramatic when they came in, then the battle turned into some sort of  animated joke - even the Ewok battle almost brought tears to your eyes when  you realized they were dying and little babies would be motherless or  fatherless - it made the war real and you actually cared for a bit.<br />6)  The horrible &quot;World War II Japanese&quot; English accents on the Trade  Federation leaders.  Especially being the first real dialogue in the film  it made me cringe from the get-go.  I was half expecting them to be  planning another Pearl Harbor bombing - as someone mentioned, give them  their own language and use sub-titles like Greedo.  But alas, that would  cut down on George's audience of kids who can't read, and wouldn't George  hate to let those kids down instead of every person over 12. <br />7) Jake  Lloyd - too stiff, bad actor, no intensity or drama in him.  It was like he  liked being a slave and he seemed really fake - horrible choice,  especially, as people said, the &quot;I see dead people&quot; boy was  available.  Don't see how he turns into Darth Vader - Lucas does very  little to further that to the audience in Lloyd.  <br />8) Appealing to kids  directly and not even to adults.  Bad mistake.  Star Wars has always been a  young persons movie -but the genuis was that it truly did appeal to adults,  in rich drama, fantasy, and loveable characters. <br />I hate that this movie or the  others is not out on DVD - that just shows how much of a money grubber and  teaser Lucas is.  For all the 11 faults, I still liked the movie, found it  very entertaining and an epic.  If at least some of the above things were  changed or improved I know everyone would have liked it more (even those  who give it 5 stars) and if all of them were done, I know it would have  went down as the best movie ever.
0446677450|3.0|I think some of the points he made are quite interesting.  However, it could have been said in less than 50 pages. <br />If you are looking for an easy read and some general knowledge of how SOME rich people leave, than  you should buy this book.  Remember that the author doesn't go into  details.  He wants you to buy his other books as well as tapes.  What a  salesman, indeed - as he claims to be.
B000000P11|2.0|I've adored this band since their first release. And this release does have it's moments. All in all, however, much of it sounds like they were  writing while the tapes rolled and it sounds unrehearsed. Especially the  vocals. If it were marketed as a live recording or rare basement  recordings, I could let it slide but as a major release, the craftsmanship  is haphazard. And without the bonus CD that originally came with it,  there's not a lot for me to recommend. I do give it two stars for a couple  of reasons. First, if you can find a copy with the bonus CD, that's where  the best material was. Second, I still feel these guys were hugely  underrated and one of the more important bands of the time so, if you're a  fan, I'd still recommend rounding out your collection with it. If you don't  have any Chameleons, buy &quot;Script of the Bridge&quot;.

B00003XB8K|5.0|I don't know where to start...This is one of the best CDs I have bought in a long time. It was one of those spontaneous buys, but I am glad I finally got a hold on it. Although &quot;The Gate&quot; is more of a slow-paced  intro, the rest were magnificant. From the second I heard &quot;Push The  Limits&quot; I knew I would love it from beginning to end. I didn't really  listen to the rest of the CD for 3 days after I got it, because I was so  astonished at the brilliance of &quot;Gravity of Love&quot;. Although this  is a great Ambient mix, I have to disagree with some moron who said this  was a great love song. Just because it has the word Love in it, doesn't  make it a love song. But otherwise, it is my favorite song on this CD, and  my favorite song all together. And don't think I'm a first time New  Age/Ambient guy cause I've been listening to that stuff for awhile. If you  didn't like Enigma before, I'd suggest you listen to them again - and I'm  not just frantically saying this, I really mean it. Give them another  chance. I was extremely impressed. I can't really say much more than that I  can't get enough of them. Shortly after I recieved this product, I realized  that &quot;Enigma&quot; sounded farmiliar. I searched my CD collection  until I stumbled upon &quot;Elevation 2&quot;, a New Age compilation album.  There was a song by Enigma on there that wasn't one of my favorites on that  album, and rarely listened to it at all. I think it was one of their older  tracks, and it really showed how they matured, because I did not care for  that song much because it seemed boring. If you are a fan of Techno, New  Age, Dance, Rock, or even Easy Listening, get this one right away. You  won't regret it.
B000001EXR|4.0|THE BAND: Paul Stanley (vocals, guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals, bass), Bruce Kulick (guitar, lead vocals on \\"I Walk Alone\\" only), Eric Singer (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1997) 12 tracks clocking in at just over 60 minutes. Included with the disc is a minimal 2-page foldout containing song titles/credits, and producers. Recorded at Music Grinder Studios, Hollywood, CA. Label - Mercury Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I like this album. As far as Kiss in the 1990's go, I rank this \\"Carnival Of Souls: The Final Sessions\\" a close 2nd place behind \\"Revenge\\". I also rank it better than a majority of their albums in the entire 80's. \\"The Final Sessions\\" is a long album for Kiss... compared to their 70's albums, it's almost twice as long. Where so many of Kiss' early songs are in the 3-minute range, here they average 5 minutes in length. \\"The Final Sessions\\" was slated to hit the stores in late '95, but when the original 4 members decided to reunite for a tour, this album got pushed back. Fans managed a way to seek out bootlegs of the album, so the band was forced to release this \\"Final Sessions\\" quickly in October of 1997. Perhaps too quickly - as the low budget album cover and paltry liner notes may indicate - really cheapened the feel of the package. After reading several articles from worthy magazines, I found myself displeased at how Kulick and Singer were simply dismissed just after the release. Simmons and Stanley feeling a reunion tour was in the mix and hence, another money train in the making. As for the music here - the sound is stripped down and raw... with an absolute grunge flavor. The guitars are extremely crunchy. Singer's drumming is tight and heavy when needed. Paul, and especially Gene, sing with a lot of angst. The melodies are incredibly catchy... with the exception of one song (my least favorite track of Kiss' in the 90's - Gene's \\"In My Head\\"). Favorites being \\"Hate\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"Master & Slave\\", \\"Jungle\\" and the deep album cut \\"In The Mirror\\". Kulick's only ever song on lead vocals is musically good (including some backwards instruments), but his singing is rather flat... reminiscent of when Joe Perry sings a rare tune for Aerosmith. In 1997, \\"The Final Sessions\\" reached #27 on Billboard's Top 200 album chart (and the song \\"Jungle\\" reaching #8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart). Overall a great disc and essential to your massive Kiss collection (4 stars).ever song on lead vocals is musically good (including some backwards instruments), but his singing is rather flat... reminiscent of when Joe Perry sings a rare tune for Aerosmith.

B0000042MY|5.0|This music is one of the best soundtrack pieces I have heard.  I would  recommend it to anyone who has seen the movie and loves it; or someone who  enjoys instrumental music.  My only negative thought about this CD is that  &quot;Promentory&quot; was cut in half from the version in the movie, but  this can be overlooked considering that the other pieces make up for it.   Happy listening!
B00004SCX6|1.0|Oops, she did it again - as if we all haven't gotten sick of this play on words by now.  We get yet another cookie-cutter teen pop album brought to you by the girl who started teen pop again in the late 90's.  It's not  neccessarily that the songs themselves are bad, but it's just the same  recycled garbage from her previous album.  One would hope that Miss Spears  has matured enough over the past year (at least musically, that is) to  produce some better material than that found on &quot;Oops...&quot;.  Or  even *different* material would have been a nice change of pace.  Instead,  we get the same exact pop trash that made her debut album such a success  with the young teenybopper market.  <br />Where to begin... First off, the  album begins with a blatant rip-off of her previous hit, &quot;Baby One  More Time&quot;.  The problems continue with the next couple of songs,  which feature Miss Spears' heavily distorted or computer-altered voice.   But I guess no one is buying this album to hear *singing*, needless to  say.<br />The Rolling Stones cover &quot;Satisfaction&quot; starts off strong,  but quickly falls into blandness.<br />&quot;Dear Diary&quot;, the only song  ever co-written by Britney featured on an album, is Spears at her worst -  and that's pretty darn bad.  The lyrics sound like they came straight out  of the scribbled diary of a 10 year old girl.<br />The rest of the album is  mostly filler material, not extraordinary bad - but not good either, it's  just *there*.<br />The only semi-bright spot on this album, a  diamond-in-the-rough, is &quot;Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know&quot;.  The  heavy influence of Mutt Lange &amp; Shania Twain is felt on this track.   This song - and this song alone - seems to be the only evidence that  Britney has any chance of rising above her pop mediocrity.  Looking over  all her current material on the market right now, one could easily assume  that this song was a fluke.  That is probably a good assumption.<br />Well,there's always the next album.  Just don't hold your breath.  Spears'  fellow rival Christina Aguilera has a far superior voice and material to  boot, yet she comes in second in sales and star-power.  Isn't that always  the way?
079073804X|4.0|I am a big film buff, and of all the multitude of movies I've watched this is the only movie that has ever truly frightened me.  I saw it as a teenager and for weeks I dreaded going to bed for fear of being thrown into  convulsions due to it's Satanic gyrations as in the movie.  The Exorcist is  scary and disturbing, even by todays standards, and still a classic.
B00003000M|4.0|Bob Marley's music is pure bliss in any form. This album, though inferior  to Marley's original works, does a wonderful job of bringing the enchanting  lyrics, beats, and messages to a new audience of Hip-hop and R&amp;B fans.  The blend of artists bring new life to Bob's already amazing songs and show  a fresh &quot;face&quot; to the music, a &quot;face&quot; many would not  expect to see Bob wearing. Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill's vocals highlight  Marley's wonderfully, and the version of Kinky Reggae, performed with  Marely's sons was incredible. I do wish however that more respect had been  given to maintaining Bob's original message of unity, pride and peace. The  truth of Bob's lyrics seemed to be somewhat lost in heavy beats and  jibberish rap. Still overall, this was a nice new rendition of classic  music, I enjoyed listening.
6305905401|2.0|This movie made you keep an eye on the clock and when it ended felt like a big waste of time. The ending left you staring at the screen asking what just happened, buy this only if you have the keys to the other eight gates.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Bruce Willis is great.  The best sci-fi movie ever.  The special effects, the story line, the soundtrack and the actors (Willis, Thornton, Steve B.) make this movie a must see for everybody.   It is so well written and full  of action.  I recommend this movie to anybody that's into sci-fi or action  movies.
0064471047|5.0|This wonderful little book was, at one time, the first in the Chronicles of Narnia series, written by the late C.S. Lewis, a Christian philosopher and literatus.  It was the first one I read, and is a delightful story.   Both children and adults who enjoy the fantasy genre should enjoy this  book.  It is centered around four children who, while staying as guests at  an old mansion, walk through a wardrobe and find themselves in a completely  different world.  There, they have many adventures and get involved in a  great conflict between an evil witch, who is oppressing the land with an  eternal winter, and the good king Aslan, who comes back to his country  after a long absence to fight the witch's evil works.          Anyone with  a church or Sunday-school background should quickly recognize the Christian  elements in this story, and I think it is safe for young children to read.   It is a charming tale and worth reading again and again.  Buy the whole  Narnia set, read all the books, and pass them on to your children.
6301697707|5.0|Tremors is such a good movie because it is not a horror movie but and adventure movie.  It has a good touch of comedy in it too and that makes is it great.   Definitely a must see.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album proves that Metallica are the best band ever. Not even Guns and Roses compare, the raw combination of hard rock and passionate melodies provided by one of the most powerful orchestra's in the US, help to give a  real feeling to the album, it shows how to break down walls between  music,together it puts disgrace to Limp Bizkit who are absolute rubbish.  Rock needs passion and fire to it, this give it full blooded and pumping  with the best guitar work in the land,they are legends to all self  respecting rock bands.<br />You'll sweat after hearing the first two songs on  this, it moves you so much, buy it now, before it's too late.
B000031XCR|4.0|To get to the point- some of her better songs are missing &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot; and &quot;All By Myself&quot;<br />But that's not half as important as the other new songs. OK&lt; so Celine sounds good if not  great on her duet and her cover of Roberta Flack's hit. But when it comes  to songs like 'Live', 'I Want You To Need Me' and even the nice effort,  'Then You Looked At Me'just doesn't meet the expectations one would have of  Celine.<br />If you'd like to know what i mean, i'm talking about songs from  albums like Falling Into You. Where are the grand ballads like It's All  Coming Back To Me Now and by the way My Heart Will Go On is effective only  once- the new Horner-Jennings composition sounds less dramatic although it  is a beautiful song.<br />Well, Celine- this album is great but not quite  there. Hopefully, your next album will bring you back to your roots- your  original french style presented through english songs and then you'll be  all the way to the top.<br />Celine dion, what a great voice.
B000002IWQ|5.0|Rush hit a home run with _Counterparts_. Strong songwriting, varied textures across the disc, and great hooks combine to create a highly satisfying listening experience. This is one of those discs you can put in the car and listen to for weeks on end without tiring of it.
B00003CWL6|2.0|First of all, I think that it's pretty sad that a movie about a disfunctional family would win an Oscar for Best Movie!  Now that I got  that off my chest...I've seen 4 of the 5 movies that were nominated for  Best Movie of 1999. Out of the 4, American Beauty was by far at the bottom  of my list. I strongly feel that The Green Mile or The Insider should have  won, followed by The Sixth Sense. I've watched American Beauty twice, and  if it weren't for Kevin Spacey, then I probably wouldn't have ever seen it.  Kevin Spacey is by far one of the best actors out there. His brilliant  performance as Lester makes this average movie worth watching at least  once. He definetly steals the show! Other then that, in my opinion, this is  an average movie. There was nothing exciting or climactic in the movie. The  best part of the movie had to be the last 15 minutes of the movie.  Everything throughout the movie all came to one.
B00003CXGG|5.0|I must say, this is definitly one of the better movies i've seen this  year.  Jet Li's wushu didnt have the same feel to it as his other movies,  but the movie still rocked.  I was disappointed that the movie didnt  elaborate more on the building relationship between Li and Allayah.  But,  then again, who goes to see and action flick for a cheesy romance story?   All in all, a good film, a must see for anyone who likes action.
6305903182|2.0|I thought Scream &amp; Scream 2 were good! The 3rd installment, on the other hand, was a huge disappointment to me. I feel like it's getting a bit more comical now. Kind of like how &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;  ended up after part 2. Scream 3 wasn't as scary as the first one. The story  line isn't as good either. The story takes place in Tinsel Town, where the  filming of Stab 3 is taking place (what happened to Stab 2?). Sidney is in  hiding somewhere in the woods (like we didn't know that was going to  happen). To make a long story short, Sidney finds her long lost brother  that she didn't know she had...da.dah.da..dah..da. I was also disappointed  with Cottonweiry's role in the movie. The ending was open ended, so look  forward to a sequel to the trilogy!
0694003611|5.0|I sent this to my 2-1/2 yr old granddaughter.  She loves it.  Her Mom or Dad reads it to her every night at her insistance and she had it memorized within the week.  It must have been the first time she had heard a story  being told in rhyming poetry.  By the time she recites to the end of the  story she's (almost) ready for bed.  Grandma was a hit with this little  treasure of a present.
B00003CX6P|1.0|Let's get to the point! The movie was way too long, about 2 1/2 hours. It's about about a character named Tom Ripley, played by Matt &quot;where's my partner Ben Affleck in this movie&quot; Damon. Ripley's  &quot;talent&quot; is to mimic and plagerize people. The whole movie didn't  show any signs of his motive what so ever. It didn't explain why Ripley was  impersonating someone from Dickie's (Jude Law) school, if he's really gay  or just playing the role, if he's murdered anyone before, what happens to  him later....It's just a mess of a story. Just imagine The Empire Strikes  Back, and not knowing Star Wars or Return of the Jedi! I kept waiting for  Dickie to come back, but he never did. I also thought Gwyneth Paltrow  over-acted with her charecter. The only thing I liked about the movie were  the beautiful cinematic scenes taken place in Europe.
6305718954|5.0|I'll argue this to my grave... Stigmata was an AWESOME, awesome story. And the movie couldn't have done a better job portraying this difficult issue. Arquette and Byrne were great. Arquette being the typical victim of the  90's era and Byrne living a pastoral, quiet life. Reviewers keep comparing  this film to the Exorcist. It couldn't be more different. Stigmata is much  more amazing then the Exorcist ever could have been. The Exorcist deals  with the devil...yeah yeah yeah... so do a lot of movies. Stigmata deals  with God. God dominates over Satan-so who dominates over God?   NOTHING!  And that's what makes this movie stand above the rest. It's  creepy, it's frightening and it's almost comforting in a way. See it! If  you don't like it-oh well, but it deserves to be seen...and thought  about...
B00003CWN3|1.0|Boys Don't Cry has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I thought that Hillary Swank's portrayal of Brandon Teena was over-rated. It seems like if you play a character that kisses someone of the opposite sex or  someone that's physically challenged, then the Academy automatically hands  you an Oscar. Look at Swank, you already knew she was going to win the  Oscar before the actually ceremony. I feel that her performance wasn't  Oscar worthy! Based on a true story, Swank plays a character by the name of  Brandon Teena, a transexual on the run (don't know why?). He/she falls in  love with a young woman named Lana (played by Chloe Sevigny). Being new in  town, Brandon befriends a group of people, mainly guys. When they discover  his/her little secret, you can imagine the Southerners reactions. Chloe  Sevigny did a good job playing Lana. When I watched this, there were 8 of  us. We were all ready to go somewhere, but we kept saying, &quot;5 more  minutes&quot; to each other. It was like, we had to watch it. At the end,  we all looked at each other and said that it was a horrible movie!
B00003CWL6|5.0|The thing I really love about this movie is how great Kevin Spacey and Annete Bening work together on screen.  I have  always been a Kevin Spacey fan and now I ike him and his acting even more.  The director (Sam Mendes)  had me imagining I was Lester Burnham half way through the movie and I  began to feel sorry for him and the problems that arose in his life.    &quot;American Beauty&quot; pretty much cleaned up at the oscars.  The only  movies that only came close to being better than &quot;American  Beauty&quot; were &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and  &quot;Magnolia&quot;. A GREAT MOVIE TREAT YOURSELF TO THIS FILM IF YOUR ONE  OF THE RARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN IT!
078324228X|4.0|This is a great movie that brings you mixed feelings. It gives you anger, sorrow, strength, compassion, love and hope! This movie is based on the true life story of Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, played by Denzel  Washington. He's chased by a racial driven detective since the age of 11.  Being dealt the wrong hand in life, he spends half of his life (wrongfully  accused) in jail. I didn't like the directing in the first half of the  movie. The director, Norman Jewison, kept jumping from one time frame to  another, sometimes without you knowing. During the second half of the  movie, it started settling down. It focused more on Hurricane and his  relationship with Lesra and his 3 Canadian tutors. Lesra was inspired by  Hurricane's publicized book. Hurricane befriends Lesra and his 3 tutors. In  fact, they devote their entire lives in trying to prove Hurricane's  innocence. Something that activists, famous actors and musicians failed to  do before them. This wasn't your typical jail-type of movie. It didn't have  any rape, drugs or violence. I look forward to reading the out-of-print  hard copy of Hurricane's book, &quot;The 16th Round...&quot;.
B000000WA4|5.0|I wasn't really into the Smashing Pmpkins until my bro brought this CD home. It's got something for everyone, it's a mellow rock album which  obviously takes it's inspiration from all different types of music and this  is why I thik it is so popular. I know no less than 7 people who own this  album, and I never get sick of it! It is insrumental genius!
B0000399WI|5.0|This is brilliant. I have seen it twice and I recommend it to all my friends.<br />Tim Robbins plays a banker (Andy) that was sentenced to prison for killing his wife and lover, whose quiet demeanor was a cover for his iron-will, determination and inner strength. Morgan Freeman, plays friend and cell mate, Red, represents the rest of us, who are on a journey to discover what made Andy tick. Both actors put up an excellent performance that keeps one enthralled in the film, wanting to know everything they do, think, and how they develop over the course of their years in prison.<br />The irony in this film struck me most. From the little ironies such as whether Andy really murdered his wife, to the secret behind his &quot;obsession&quot; with movie star posters. It was subtly presented with maximum impact. <br />I have read Stephen King's book and I think that this film is a very good film portrayal of his writing with charaters that adhere closely to the book, and are very well-explored by the two experienced actors. Definitely worth watching.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|David Bowie has a lot in common with Frank Zappa. They are both very talented musicians with a very thorough knowledge of music. Both  experimented a lot and were able to change styles completely overnight. I  see two main differences between them: to me, Bowie is less talented than  Zappa was (Oops: that might hurt some people's feelings), but he takes  himself more seriously than Zappa ever did.<br />'Scary Monsters' is the  closest Bowie ever got to Zappa: I think it's his best album, and also his  funniest album (Oops: I did it again).<br />Typically Zappa is 'Up the hill  backwards': the intro is a twisted version of the intro of 'Panic in  Detroit'. Zappa did that sort of thing all the time. Also, the intro is in  7, and it smoothly goes into 4/4, to go back to 7 at the end of the song.  Zappa was very good at that.<br />I think it's brilliant how Bowie wrapped up  the music between two versions of the same song ('It's no game'). I  especially like the opening version, e.g. when he shouts 'Shut up, shut up'  at Robert Fripp's weird guitar notes.<br />For me, a song like 'Fashion' is  pure satire. I find it hard to believe that only a few years later Bowie  wrote exactly the kind of songs that are mocked on this album ('Let's  dance', for instance).<br />When Bowie gets really serious, his songs start to  irritate me. That never happens on 'Scary Monsters'. The songs are  well-written, the melodies are great. This album is unbridled fun. Too bad  that people take it all so seriously.<br />David Bowie sould listen to Frank  Zappa more often.
B000005J56|5.0|This CD is a must own for anyone, no matter how diverse your musical  tastes. The haunting music, beautiful and memorable tunes, are perfect for  relaxing to. A really great mellow, and enjoyable compilation of music.
B000021Y74|5.0|This German masterpiece puts US films to shame.  It's like Sliding Doors for the rave set.  Franka P. is totally awesome! She should be eligible to compete for track events in Sydney :) This film is creative, innovative and  totally rockin'! one of my favorites!        The fact that it is in German  only makes it cooler.  I've seen it in subtitles AND dubbed and in it's  native tongue it's SO much better!<br />P.S.  The soundtrack is awesome too,  good to exercise to, but do not drive to it!  It causes speeding!
630575067X|4.0|Well...here i am, typing away to you, the reader...someone I will probably never meet...hoping that maybe my comments will affect the way you look at  this movie. It's a good movie.  I have it on VHS and have watched it  several times....and it is proving to be a &quot;true&quot; Star Wars movie  in that I can watch it over and over.  Sure, at my first viewing in the  theaters, I was disapointed...the digital animation seemed to take away  from the lifelike appearance of the aliens in the original Star  Wars...there is something to be said of a gritty looking alien as opposed  to the free flowing, polished look of the characters here.  I was also a  little miffed at Jar Jar Binks.  Now, I am a bit more accepting of his  presence, but I hope that he will be a limited creature in the next  feature.(HA! ) More criticism:  Darth Maul was no doubt tough as  nails...but, TOO much make up...too evil looking on purpose...lacked a  taste of vilian reality...my real complaint here is in comparing him to  darth Vader...Darth Vader had a political and intellectual presence that  Darth Maul never attains...mainly because he rarely speaks in this  movie...no dialouge or arrogent &quot;I'm going to mop up the floor with  you&quot; type discourses that you would expect from his pointy headed  appearance.  However, watching him dance the dance of light sabers with TWO  jedi's is wonderful...he puts on quite a show. Next realm of critisicm:  The trade federation aliens were absolutely horrible...is that a racial  stereotype i see in there?<br />So, why did i give this four stars?  It's  still a good movie.  It's still fun to watch and it gives insight into the  beloved Star Wars universe...Like many, I am a tough to please fan of the  original.  My ultimate complaint is that Harrison Ford isn't in the movie  as Han Solo...even though I know that would have been impossible...he's  still my favorite character.
B000002BPS|5.0|This CD is one of the Offspring's best along with Smash and Americana.  I'll tell you about each of the songs.  &quot;Disclaimer&quot; isn't really  a song, it's similar to Smash's Time to Relax.  The &quot;Meaning of  Life&quot; has an excellent sound to it and tells about how others  typically force their ideas on you and how you hate it.  &quot;Mota&quot;,  which is about a friend with a drug addiction, is definately one of the  underappreciated songs on the alblum.  I like it a lot for it's sound, yet  it also forces you to think about drugs and their consequences.  &quot;Me  and My Old Lady&quot; isn't the typical type of song you'd hear.  It starts  out with the repitition of the lyric line, &quot;she ain't no ball and  chain&quot;, over and over again until the REAL music starts.  Otherwise,  it's a great song with a different moral message. &quot;Cool to Hate&quot;  is one of the few songs that sound like they belong in a different alblum  (like Offspring, or Ignition).  &quot;Leave it Behind&quot; is where the CD  really starts to get great.  I still love that song although it is only a  minute and a half long or so.  That song tells about how you need to leave  your hate behind.  &quot;Gone Away&quot; is the best song on the CD.  About  a love one dying, it shows a new side to the Offspring that isn't to  visible in other alblums.  There's also a video made to accompany  &quot;Gone Away&quot;, but you can only see it on MTV2 every once in a  while, or on the CD extra for Americana.  Next, &quot;I Choose&quot; is  another great song telling of the worth of your own free agency.  Dexter  Holland says, &quot;the world can be a nightmare, or a playground if we  choose.  And I CHOOSE.&quot;  Thats a great philosophy to follow, trust me.   &quot;Intermission&quot; is the next song and it really isn't a song, it's  like elevator music.  &quot;All I Want&quot; happens after  &quot;Intermission&quot; and that's another great song about how all you  want sometimes want to get away from it all.  &quot;Way Down the Line&quot;  is next and this song deals with teenage pregnancy and child abuse and how  they're past down to generation to generation.  &quot;Don't Pick it  Up&quot; is the only song I don't enjoy.  It's about how you have to watch  what you &quot;pick up&quot;.  Trust me that is a stupid song.   &quot;Amazed&quot;, another great song, is about how hard it is to change  sometimes and has the same mood as &quot;Gone Away&quot;.  The last song,  &quot;Change the World&quot;, is about how you want to change the world,  but instead you should change yourself instead of being so selfish.  That's  the whole alblum according to me, and I love it.  I gave it five stars for  it's integrity, besides &quot;Don't Pick it Up&quot;, and quality sound.   If you buy it, hope you enjoy it!
B00002MZ4W|4.0|I didn't really like &quot;Title&quot; when it first came out, but when  &quot;When the Pawn...&quot; came out,I loved it.  This album shows all  aspects of Fiona Apple's musical talents.  The songs give off many  different styles of music, which is great because &quot;Title&quot; wasn't  as diverse.  If you like angry-girl music, you'll love this CD.
6305079900|5.0|Terminator is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time.  The plot was original.  A superior machine race sends a Terminator (Schwarzenegger) back  through time to kill the mother (Hamilton) of the future rebellion leader  to stop her son from being born.  The resistance sends a lone man (Biehn)  back through time to stop the terminator.  Schwarzenegger is awesome in  this movie.  Arnold portrays a killer machine who will stop at nothing to  complete his assignment, to kill Sarah Connors.  There is a love story  mixed into the plot and the actors have great chemistry and intensity.   This is the movie that turned Arnold into the world's greatest action star.   See this movie, and then go watch Terminator 2, which is also great!
0767903854|5.0|I am a huge Bill Bryson fan and have just finished &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot;, which was absolutely marvelous.  We visited Australia 12 years ago (during their Bicentennial) and I really loved how his imagery  and amusing anecdotes brought back to life the experiences and emotions we  had on our trip.  We spend most of our visit (like he did on his)  alternating between sheer awe of the other-worldly scenery and numb fear of  a too-close encounter with one of the countless venomous or toothy native  creatures.  He captured the enchantment of that strange and distant land  perfectly and made me laugh heartily at many of his self-deprecating and  witty stories (I thought the book was almost as humorous as his early  travel books).  I'm ready to go back Down Under and see what I haven't  seen, thanks to the incomparable Mr. Bryson.
0671015206|5.0|The Millionaire Next Door is an apt title for a book that is the culmination of a two decade study of millionaires. The authors are clearly the experts in their field, and they confirm that most millionaires are  hard-working, thrifty folks who have a plan. The book also shows how one  family can be close to retirement, while another with the same earnings can  be less than a year from bankruptcy. I strongly recommend this book for  anyone who wants to see firsthand how the rich become that way. Learn from  those who did it, not from those who teach or write about it!
B00002E233|5.0|Deep Blue Sea was Jaws all over again.   If you enjoyed Jaws, then this wil terrify you. With all the special effects you end up believing the shark is out to get you!   The whole cast supporting and main work so well  together.  It was great to see my old fave Samuel L Jackson still does not  have a good dress sense as is another fave film of mine Long Kiss Good  Night.  All I can say is KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
B00003CXCT|4.0|I'd give the original Star Wars 100 stars if I could, but not the Special Edition. Why mess with a national treasure? Okay, its cool to go back and enhance the picture quality, the sound, and the special effects. I'm all  for that, but I didn't like any of the added footage. Jabba the Hutt? Come  on! He didn't look half as real or menacing as he did in ROTJ. The Biggs  scene didn't help anything but didn't really hurt either. Some people  complain that it just makes the movie longer. Well, if you think Star Wars  is too long you probably don't enjoy it anyway. The first time I saw it I  never wanted it to end. And the worst added scene in the entire film:  Greedo shooting first at Han. It just looks stupid. Han moves his head like  one inch and Greedo misses. I either read or watched an interview with  George Lucas where he stated that he never liked the idea of Han killing  Greedo in cold blood. Cold blood? Greedo had a blaster aimed in Han's face!  I liked it much better the original way when Han just says, &quot;Yeah, I  bet you have&quot;, and bam! Anyway, I think a film's test to be truly  great is in its ability to be watched over and over again. A New Hope and  The Empire Strikes Back definitely achieve this goal. Return of the Jedi  does to a degree, but I think it drags in some places. The Phantom Menace?  No thanks. Twice is enough. I think the biggest problem with it was not the  lack of action like alot of people say, but the lack of interesting  characters and dialogue. And of course Jar Jar and Anakin being a kid.  Anyway, that's all. I got off track. One last thing. Has anyone else  noticed that something's different about Vader in ANH compared to the  sequels? I can't grasp exactly what it is. Its either the mask around the  eyes or the helmet is shaped just a little differently or something. He  just looks better in ESB and ROTJ. Pay attention next time you watch it and  see if you notice it.
6300214400|4.0|Despite the holes in the plot and the need to willingly suspend disbelief at times, Star Trek III is among my favorite of the original cast films.  I even like it better than Star Trek IV.<br />The special effects in this film  are really good and I love James Horner's score enough to have bought it on  cassette.   There are many dramatic visual moments, including when the  Enterprise approaches the giant space station orbiting Earth and the  destruction of the Genesis planet, and of course, the destruction of the  Enterprise.<br />The cast is in their usual fine form.  Uhurua gets a smaller  role in this movie because she stays behind, but she does get one really  good scene giving a young Starfleet cadet his comeuppance.  Scottie gets to  shine as temporary engineering officer and vandalizer of the new starship  Excelsior.  McCoy is funny, occasionally slipping into his Spock mode.  One  of his best lines, upon hearing that he is carrying Spock's  &quot;katra&quot; inside him is &quot;It's [Spock's] revenge for losing all  of those arguments!&quot;   William Shatner has a really good dramatic  scene when Kirk learns that his son has been killed by the Klingons.   Christopher Lloyd is good as the Klingon commander Kruge.  Unrecognizable  as one of his subordinates, Maltz, is the guy who played Dan Fielding in  the Nightcourt sitcom on NBC.<br />Merrit Butrick and Robin Curtis are not  particularly memorable as David and Saavik, but accomplish what is expected  of them.  Another reviewer observed that the film barely hints that Saavik  sleeps with the young Spock as he experiences Pon Faar.  I read the  novelization of Star Trek III, and not only does it make it clear that she  is &quot;intimate&quot; with him, if indeed Vulcans can be intimate, but  that she also sleeps with Kirk's son David as well before they go to the  Genesis planet.  Had it been included in the film, it really would have  added another element to it, though in the end it might have been  distracting too.<br />It is a bit of a coincidence that Kirk gets Spock off  the Genesis planet at just the right age, and the way in which Spock is  brought back is a bit hard to swallow, after all, even the Vulcan high  priestess declared that the process had not been done in ages, and then  only in myth.  Why would Spock then be confident that it would work?  Then  again, since all of us Trekkies wanted Spock back, we won't quibble.   Star  Trek III is a good combination of action, humor and drama.   If there is an  off numbered curse in the Star Trek movies, it clearly does not apply to  this one.
6303201954|3.0|&quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; isn't really a bad start for the films, if one can get past the wooden acting, the bland sets and uniforms and the muddled storyline. Kirk and company are back on board the newly  remodeled USS Enterprise to intercept an alien intruder named  &quot;V'Ger&quot;. That is about for the plot. The rest of the movie has  the cast entering the alien and staring at it endlessly for around 50  minutes. It didn't really bother me, because I loved the special effects.  The talking bothered me because I really had no idea what they were talking  about throughout the movie. Something about V'Ger being a child and merging  with the creator and so on and so forth. To me it didn't make much sense at  all. One thing that makes this movie stand apart from it's successors is  the music. Jerry Goldsmith's score is quite possibly one of the best scores  ever put on film, this is definitely my favorite. Many people bash this  movie but if it wasn't for this, you Next Generation fans wouldn't have  your main theme and us fans of Star Trek wouldn't have 8 terrific sequels  to watch.
0782008372|2.0|I don't understand why this was given a 4.5 on         quality. It's terrible. It was the first disc I bought after I got the player and I thought my new DVD player had a problem. And the disc is not 141 minutes,  it's 116 minutes. I loved the movie, but my VHS copy is just as good as  this.
0061002747|5.0|The name Agatha Christie is equated with really good mystery in the minds of most mystery buffs. If you read any Agatha Christie, if you're even considering reading any Agatha Christie, read &quot;Murder on the Orient  Express.&quot; The ending is sure to surprise, and throughout there is the  joy of watching the great little Belgian, Hercule Poirot at work --  meticulous, exacting, and rather insufferable in person, I would imagine,  but interesting to read about!
0446677450|5.0|As Kiyosaki states himself he isn't the best writer but his message is profound.  He tells you how to think.  Rich people think differently about money than poor people.  If you don't understand and adopt the  &quot;rich&quot; thinking process you haven't gotten the main point.  If  you missed this point I would suggest reading it again and reading some of  the other books he recommends until you really get it.   Just before  reading &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; I read &quot;The Millionaire Next  Door&quot;.  This was an outsiders view of the rich. The main message I got  was that many people became rich by being frugal and having their own  business and investing the money they saved.  &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot;  is the insiders view.  It tells you why the rich people do these things  (how they think).  The difference between the two books is that after  reading &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; I began looking for the next  book to read.  After reading &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; I immediately  found some asset building opportunities and also looked for the next book  to read.   Start building your financial intelligence today by reading this  book.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Dogma seems to evoke either love or hate from those who saw it. I for one LOVED it -- thought it was not only a brilliant satire on organized religion but a well-cast, well-acted, hilarious romp that never failed to  please. Most of my friends also thought it was fabulous, though a couple of  them hated it. I cannot see why. Like so many movies in the second half of  1999 (BJM, Election, Blair Witch, American Beauty, Magnolia, Three Kings),  this film was overflowing with originality. We need more films like  this!
B000005ALP|5.0|This is,in my opinion,one of the 5 best cds of all time.A few years ago i used to listen to the eels on the radio but i forgot about them but recently i bought this cd and i loved.Nirvana is my favorite band but i  like this cd much better than all of their cds.Im sad to say but beautiful  freak is one of the only cds that i can listen to all the songs every  time.I listen to it at least twice a day and im still not sick of it.It  also has the best lyrics i have ever heard.I can realy relate to  them,especially &quot;not ready yet&quot;.Not ready yet is the best  song.Rags to rags and guest list are good too but they are all great.I have  electro shock blues.It is good-4 stars-but beautiful freak is much better.I  would write more but i have to go listen to my eels cd.

6300271439|4.0|&quot;Who's That Girl&quot; is one of Madonna's most entertaining pictures to date. Unfortunately, the film was ignored by critics and audiences alike upon its release in the summer of 1987. This was one of Madonna's best  periods. She wrote four outstanding songs for the soundtrack that would  also be ignored by Madonna, herself, in later years. &quot;Who's That  Girl&quot; and &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot; reached No.1 and No.2,  respectively, but they weren't to be found on THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION.  &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; meanwhile, has stood the test of time as one  of her most achingly beautiful ballads, yet she FORGOT to include it on her  ballads collection, SOMETHING TO REMEMBER. Go figure. The picture itself is  a noisy screwball comedy that is hysterically funny. One of the best lines  in the film (and there are many great ones) is &quot;What's the patient's  name?&quot;      &quot;Loudon.&quot;      &quot;Loudon what?&quot;       &quot;Clear.&quot; LOL. It makes me giddy just thinking about it. I should  note, however, that, while WHO'S THAT GIRL is funnier than DESPERATELY  SEEKING SUSAN, it is not a better movie. DSS is still Madonna's best  performance and she is not playing herself in either movie. The only  pictures where Madonna is playing herself are VISION QUEST and TRUTH OR  DARE. Got it?
B00000JJQK|3.0|It's got some decent moments, but really folks, trying to compare the  beach boys to the beatles is trying to compare sandlot stickball to the  world series!It's just not real to try, and even brian wilson said in a  interview when sergeant pepper came out &quot;we knew there was know way we  could compete with the beatles&quot;. This is a ok album, but to say it's  the best ever is pure insanity!
6305126062|1.0|The only good thing about this movie is the beautiful scenery and the trasformation that happened with the the Girl, Grace, and her horse. I found the romance between the mother and Tom (the horse whisperer)to be  totally unacceptable and disgusting.  It totally ruined the movie. People  may not always be able to control being attracted to someone, but they  should control giving in to passions, especially when one is married to  someone else.
B0000020C4|5.0|I've been listening to many different casts of Les Mis, but  this one tops  them all!  Lea Salonga is the PERFECT Eponine in my eyes! I don't  consider her voice too forceful or harsh as some people have protested.  It's just right for the charactor.  In the video of  this concert  performance, her acting skills are just as wonderful as her beautiful  voice( even when she is just standing and singing her songs)! Her diction  is so perfect, her voice is so strong- she is my idol! She made Eponine my  favorite charater in a way that no other actress could have.  Forgive  me- because I don't know all of the names of the cast- but  the Fontine in  this cast  was wondeful as well! Her voice has a unique quality that I have  never heard before! She has a youthful quality to it. It's very lovely and  I think it suits Fontine better than the other voices I have heard. She is  also a very beautiful Fontine.  For Michael Ball: one word- PERFECT! I  could never imagine any other Marius but him. He portrays such a sweet,  caring Marius. Exactly as Marius should be. I just love him!  I don't  know too much about this musical yet, and so I really don't have the right  to judge it. But this is thecast  who introduced me to Les Mis and I will  forever think that they are the best! For most of these charactors, I could  never imagine anyone else playing the role!  Well this is getting  fairly long so I'll rap it up: This is the asbsolute best cast  I have  heard with more than a few exceptional singers making each song an  incredible experience. It' s well worth it!
6304011431|5.0|**UPDATE**    Since the untimely death of Michael Jackson, I am compelled to update my review to include my thoughts about the character Powder and the strong parallel he makes to the King of Pop.  If ever there was a man who suffered such senseless persecution and indignities because he was \\"different\\", it was Michael Jackson.  Brilliantly gifted, highly evolved, and amazingly gentle and kind, he compelled us to care, to help to change the world.  How incredibly heart-breaking that he died before the mainstream recognized his message.      Michael Jackson was the  modern day poster child for \\"bullying\\".  This film is so relevant for today.  It's an amazing story and should be considered as educational curriculum in schools.    Powder was recommended by a friend. I saw it two years ago and found myself overcome with emotion and in tears at the end.  Yesterday evening, I happened to catch it on a local station and found myself as absorbed in the movie as if I had never seen it before!  As others have stated, the movie  has flaws but nothing is perfect!   Powder was so enlightened and  sensitive.  His strength came not from bravado, but from insight, caring,  and a deep respect for and love of life.      Because I'm an animal lover, the  scene with the dying doe was almost more than I could watch.  It's as if I  knew what he was going to do before he did it!  It was scary!  I knew that  Powder was only going to exist on Earth a short time.  He was far too  intelligent and elevated in his thinking and empathy to live among us  humans in this world. I could sense the pain he experienced from watching  how we treat each other and other creatures. It was a well-done example of  the best and worst of humanity--exposing the fears that form our  prejudices, and opening our hearts to allow the purest, deepest feelings to  surface.    This is a beautiful story about a beautiful human being.  I  highly recommend it to everyone!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|For Metallica to be approahed by the San Francisco Symphony is a testiment that they are the best at what they do. The concert was tight, accurate, and professionlly done. James and the Gang give a awesome performance, they  show they can play with some of the best musicians in the world. It's a  must have disc.
B000002UAR|5.0|critics and fans alike have long stated this is the greatest rock  recording ever done.Then, revolver was named the greatest album of the  century, then two of it's songs, eleanor rigby and here there and  everywhere were named two of the greatest songs of the past century.My  opinion? I would give it 10 stars if I could!A positively incredible  recording from start to finish!
B00004TH83|4.0|One rainy weekday I had the t.v. on in the background as I was aimlessly  picking out what to serve my family for dinner. Blah  ..blah..blah.....Suddenly a strong, etheral voice grabbed my attention. I  wooshed down into the family room to witness a performance by Lara Fabian.  The next thing I knew, I had Saturday night happy feet. And found myself  rhythmically dancing to her disco-esque song, &quot;I Will Love  Again&quot;.<br />Granted, this is not new lyrical material. I am sure as she  enters the US market, her songwriting abilities will mature. Everyone wants  to compare her to someone else. If I played that game, I'd say, if  &quot;Cher&quot; married &quot;Andrea Bocelli&quot;, they could conceive a  talented child such as Ms. Fabian!<br />The track &quot;Adagio&quot; is a  splendid ballad. As her French lips part....you feel her powerfully  resonant singing lifting you into another world. <br />Happily I rushed out  and bought her CD and shared it with my husband when he came home. What  happened to dinner that night? The kids had fishsticks. We made  reservations at our favorite French cafe!<br />Thank you for your interest  with your comments--CDS
B00003Q43A|5.0|After seeing this movie in theaters 11 times,  I was very disappointed with the quality of the VHS.  So now that ID4 has come out on DVD, it's like being back in theaters.  The picture and sound quality are stunning.   This is a must have for any person who owns a DVD player.  Even if you  really didn't like this movie buy it just for the amazing special effects.   This and Saving Private Ryan are the two best DVD movies EVER!

B000002VQQ|5.0|Sheer intensity!  One may hear hints of her in a few musicians, but  there's only one Patti Smith.  She set the standard, yet remains an  original.<br />This is a concept CD, but the concept is musical, rather than  lyrical.  Beginning with the dissonant chords and long tonal lines of  \\"GLORIA,\\" Patti Smith goes on to punk-ture the rock landscape in about 43  minutes of tone poetry, screaming vocals and snarling guitar. It's the  musical equivalent of \\"Howl.\\"<br /> A few songs, or fragments of songs, are  somewhat melodic and playful, almost teasing.  While these are \\"easier\\" and  sound great, the CD is most notable for its shredding power, and the sound  of the most original female voice in rock.  Great support on guitar and  drums. Intense and poetic, yet somehow unaffected and sincere, she makes  the spoken/sung lyric not only compelling, but credible.<br />In many songs  it sounds like the rhythm might slip out from under the vocals and go on in  an entirely different direction.  There's something going on here!  Beautifully recorded and mixed, the voicings are distinct, both melodic and  dissonant.  Someone may observe these days, \\"that's been done before.\\"  It  probably has--by Patti Smith.  Highly recommended.
0767809246|5.0|Stand by Me is one of those movies that reminds you of the joys of being a kid.  It reminded me a lot of the fun parts of my childhood.  <br />The movie deals with four boys going on an adventure to find a dead body, since it is  based on the Stephen King novella,&quot;The Body.&quot;  The four boys are  really different from each other, but they form a bond that will always  exist.  I think that it is great at the end when Richard Dreyfus in a small  cameo as the adult Gordie says that he will never really have the same kind  of friends as he did when he was a kid.  To some degree, I believe that  many people can relate to this feeling.<br />River Phoenix(Chris Chambers),  Wil Wheaton(Gordie LaChance), Corey Feldman(Teddy Duchamp), and Jerry  O'Connell(Vern Tessio) are great as the four buddies who travel together in  search of the dead body.  They relay a true sense of companionship as the  young friends.<br />Some of the highlights include Gordie's pie eating contest  story, the mad dash for Gordie and Vern to get to the other side of the  railroad bridge, and the scene where Gordie stands by Chris and tells  Ace(the older bully) to leave or there will be another dead body.<br />If you  ever want to go back and relive some of the adventures of your childhood,  then you don't want to miss this movie.
6305897786|4.0|Pardon the review title, but I think it aptly sums up the film.  The plot is predictable up until the ending, which is quite startling (and disturbing), but this is not a negative.  It is largely a mood piece, built  around the connotations of occultism, drawing on our own relgious  prejudices to frighten us and to get us thinking about their lack of  complexity (it doesn't, apparently, frighten us, but for the most  fundamentally devout who take these matters seriously).  Aside from  Polanski's sometimes uncomforable portrayl of women (always the Eve in his  films), what is genuis here is Polanski's use of the  \\"sex-and-satanism\\" theme without risking b-movie takiness. One  should take a glance at the other reviews for a plot summary; here I will  only say that one should not put all her eggs in the plot basket.  See the  film as a nice, eerie, sometimes funny, mood-making event, and you will  enjoy the visual puzzles. I'll also add somewhat of  a spoiler (READ NO FURTHER UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM) . . . if you read Depp's characer as a fallen demon who is being called \\"home,\\" his motivation (and the movie) falls into place.     I should also mention, however, the the DVD version  misrepresents the special features.  Many of the items listed as  \\"extras\\" DO NOT appear on the special features menu (e.g., no  cast and crew bios, no production notes), but only on the paper menu in the  case.  The website, however, has lots of interesting goodies (linkable  through artisanent.com).
B00003W8NM|1.0|I am a big fan of both actors, cult and indy films, and most creative exercises in cinema. However, after waiting for &quot;Fight Club&quot; to  come to DVD, I was most excited about the Special Edition extras. After  finally seeing it, all I can recommend are the extras, and certainly not  the complete waste of talent that this film is. The &quot;story&quot; is a  contrived 2-hour-and-17-minute series of vinettes seemingly meant to  portray the characters' boredom with everyday life and how even graphic  violence can become boring and lead to more extreme sources of  gratification. &quot;Fight Club&quot; will leave you shaking your head,  leave you extremely disappointed, and make you feel both irritated and in  need of a shower. What a downer! Even indy film lovers will no-doubt feel  cheated by David Fincher's off-target directionless mess. Fincher thinks  it's cool and ground-breaking to use subliminal shots of a blown-up penis  (twice) and foreshadow the Brad Pitt character with one-frame shots of him  before he actually appears in the film.  Does this impress most viewers?  I  doubt it.  <br />This film seems to be targeted at viewers who love to thumb  their noses at non-film buffs who supposedly &quot;don't get it&quot; or  aren't &quot;smart enough&quot; to figure a film's message.  Well, let me  tell you, folks.  It's not worth trying to figure out this work of  depravity.  Telling us that the world is decaying is not much of a message,  is it?  And watching one sick scene after another is pretty depressing  stuff; although somewhat like watching a series of car accidents, it can be  addictive to some (hence, the 5-star reviews? ).  This film misses the  mark it intended to hit, and Pitt and Norton need a better film to show off  their acting range because this one is a waste.
B000002UB6|1.0|It is truly a shame that this was ever released.  They should have just bowed out with Abbey Road.<br />With the possible exception of &quot;Get  Back&quot;, this is pretty forgettable.  John's awful singing on  &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is painful.<br />Skip It.
0780631684|4.0|Upon looking at this cover of the &quot;Final Destination&quot; video/DVD/poster, I thought that this film was just going to be your average teen-slasher flick, but it turned out to be much more, a lot  scarier because here the killer is not a person but Death, powered by Fate  itself. It's hard to tell how, when or where exactly the next person is  going to die, and each gorey murder will leave you clutching to your seat.  This film also promises more-in-depth characters than we are used to with  the typical teen film. Devon Sawa does a great job as the unfortunate soul  who foresees the deaths of his classmates, Ali Larter offers a beautiful  AND intelligent on-screen female character, and Seann W. Scott (best known  as Stifler from &quot;American Pie&quot;) gives great comic relief to the  film. All in all, this film will have you scared and paranoid for days,  wondering if and how death might take you at any second.

B0000009XP|5.0|Buddy Guy is arguably the most distinctive, electrifying guitarist in Blues history. On a good night, there is no player in the world who can match him. But for all of Guy's talent, unfortunately there are few studio  recordings that document his genius. Producers have always wanted him  either to sound old-fashioned (i.e., the '50s Chess Chicago Blues sound) or  too modern (i.e., some abberation of Jimi or Clapton). <br />Buddy was only  produced properly one time: and the result is this album &quot;Stone  Crazy.&quot; After several mediocre albums in the '60s and '70s, someone  finally let Buddy play in the studio with the creative, reckless abandon  that, when playing live, has ignited every building in which he has ever  played.  Buy this album now! This IS Buddy Guy!
B000008H1R|5.0|You may have to be a fan to love this album, but it remains one of my favorites after many years.  Teacher is a great song that saw its share of  air play, but Inside is my favorite on the album.  It's a light-hearted,  happy song, in contrast to some of the other, heavier numbers, like To Cry  you a Song, and With you There to Help Me.
B000008LH5|5.0|This is what I've come to love in TYA,Alvin and the boys are as tight on this CD as I've ever heard.This is one of my favorite live CD's in my  collection.What stands out is Alvin is definately tearing it up with tunes  like &quot;Help Me&quot; and the classic &quot;I'm going home&quot;.If you  are a Ten Years After fan this is definately a must,believe me I don't  lie.You will not be disappointed.
B0000073LF|4.0|Solid ball of rock is a saxon album through and through.  It has your typical (and thats why we love them) anthems and true rock n roll riffs.  Any one who considers themselves a saxon fan will be happy with thius gem.
B00000634J|4.0|I have always felt that John's solo stuff was spotty at best.  I don't  know, maybe it's  because I never could get into Yoko Ono.  However, there's a lot of John's  post-Beatles  stuff  I really like, all of which is on this compilation.  A must for any Beatles  fan who  doesn't  already own (or want) all the solo stuff.
B0000033P0|3.0|I was quite let down. I bought this and &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; as trial runs for ELP. I had heard of the band through my interests in the amazing Italian band Goblin, and I had heard Keith  Emerson's thrilling soundtrack to Dario Argento's &quot;Inferno,&quot; so I  figured this had to be great.<br />Well....<br />Okay, the opening suite, we'll  start with that. I'm sorry, but the hype is all centered around....what? I  don't mean to put down an acclaimed piece of music, but I wasn't thrilled.  It was okay, but not great. And the rest of the CD. I could barely get  through Jeremy Bender, and the others I enjoyed mildly, but by the end, I  realized...I was let down. And I'm sorry to hear it. I'm interested in  getting into listening to more progressive rock, and I figured ELP was a  great band to move into the style of music with, along with Goblin. And  while some of Goblin's music isn't dated at all (Suspiria is absolutely  amazing and sounds like it was created today) a lot of ELP's stuff is. I  guess it's all in the band, and this band isn't one that thrilled me, I'm  sorry to say.
6305128952|4.0|I, like many people, went to see this movie hoping it would be about horses, with a little human intervention.  However, with Robert Redford and Kriston Thomas, you gotta expect a steamy love story!  This movie delivers  BOTH, some for the horse lover, and some for the romantic.  Montana is  MAGNIFICENT in every way and so the setup is successful from the start.    The story is of a young girl,Grace, who is involved in a tragic accident  with her horse and her best girl friend.  Grace's mother, Annie(Thomas),  tries to find healing for her daughter and the horse, seeking out the help  of Tom Booker(Redford) in Montana.   I loved the performance of the young  girl, Scarlett Johansen, and would like to see more of her.  The horse  scenes are thrilling for anyone who loves horses and the erotic tension  between the married character of Thomas and the sexy cowboy-with-a-heart  Redford left me wanting MORE!  Also,the actual age difference between  Thomas and Redford was more believable than I originally thought. I read  the book so the ending was different in a very GOOD way.  All in all a very  beautiful movie!
B000024D4R|5.0|&quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was an experimental and highly musical  expansion into lunacy. &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was a momentous  tribute to the great lunatic who started Pink Floyd, Syd Barrett. And now,  in the day-and-age when Punk and Disco were clashing, Pink Floyd release  this album that makes a statement on music's disgust for the corporate  machine with all the abrasive spite of punk, but all the symphonic and  experimental qualities that made Pink Floyd one of the greatest in  progressive music. The last album clearly showed that Roger Waters, the  less-than-emotionally-stable genius was assuming greater control over the  material, and with this album it becomes quite evident that he was taking  his place on the stage as his own fictional character, Pink. Guitarist  David Gilmour only contributed to the music of &quot;Dogs,&quot; which is  my second favorite of the four compositions on this album. &quot;Dogs&quot;  reprises the dog-howling vocals the band experimented with on  &quot;Seamus&quot; on their 1972 &quot;Meddle&quot; album, but to a more  subtle and eerie extent. Gilmour's solos are brilliant and edgy, yet very  clean sounding and not annoying to the ears. A lesser guitarist would have  sounded very dirty and almost difficult to listen to. Richard Wright's  keyboards add an ambient and symphonic quality that sends the listener into  an almost euphoric state. &quot;Pigs: Three Different Ones&quot; is my  favorite off this album. A very blues-based song that begins with an eerie  organ and pig squeals that resonate throughout the entire song. Waters'  bassmanship on this song is wonderful, and Gilmour's eerie guitar volume  swells and cries create a spacy feeling that is almost frightening. His  ending solo is as brilliant as always, wrought with his signature playing  style. &quot;Sheep&quot;'s intro is great, as Water's bass pulses beneath  Wright's keyboard solos, also making this somewhat bluesy and jazzy.  &quot;Pigs on the Wing,&quot; which begins and ends the album is a  quandary. It's so dirt simple it's almost humorous, yet the fact that it  begins and ends the album on a peaceful note with three  &quot;over-ten-minute-long&quot; rock symphonies that give a sense of  George Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; is actually a note of subtle  genius. The reason this could be my favorite Floyd album: it's the most  edgy without sacrificing musical quality and craftsmanship. The previous  two albums, which seem to hold higher esteem with fans, were experimental,  progressive, bluesy, brilliant, and musically excellent, but there wasn't  as much sense of the band getting down and dirty as there was on this  album. I guess that's to say that even with all the overdubs and  multi-tracks, this probably has Floyd at their most raw sound! And yet it  still shows the talent of the band members that they played their  instruments with great precision to produce a clean sound. Truly an  underrated album from perhaps the best progressive band ever to exist.
B000002KAT|5.0|This work rises far above the remaining output of Van Morrison, who would on the stength of &quot;Brown-Eyed Girl&quot; alone (not to mention &quot;Moondance&quot;) rank among the great popular recording artists.   &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; defies comparison to other popular music and  should rightly be spoken of in the same breadth as Keats, Yeats, Proust,  Vermeer, and Fra Angelico.  Somehow, two days spent by Morrison with studio  musicians working without charts on songs that were strongly-felt but raw  in their original incarnations(listen to the early versions on any of the  myriad compliations featuring &quot;Brown-Eyed Girl&quot;) resulted in a  work that transcends not only genre but medium to directly elicit in the  listener an elevated state of mind--something approaching temporary  Buddhahood.  Through a pointilist depiction of everyday life, with its  sorrows, joys, moments of beauty and struggle, layered over repetitive,  trance-like musical motiffs, Morrison compels us to share in his compassion  for all beings, including the weak, the old, the very young, the  drug-addled, the gender-confused, and other outcasts, no less than for his  beloved Sweet Thing.  All this and you can dance to it! (OK, not really,  but you could sway, at least.)  Obviously, this music isn't always received  ethusiastically (see below).  Perhaps it is simply too much unlike  everything else we hear, too timeless (almost literally--the tempos and  leisured development of songform are seldom encountered elsewhere), too  meditative, and too generous in spirit. Patience will be rewarded, however,  for those willing to invest the time in decoding a masterpiece.  It shares  space on my shelf with Joni Mitchell's &quot;Hejira&quot; (Jaco Pastorius's  finest moment), The Blue Nile's &quot;Walk Across the Rooftops&quot; and  Beth Orton's next CD if she realizes her apparent full potential (and  features REM as guests on a track or two).  Nobody else comes close.
B00000JNNY|5.0|If you can listen to Etta sing and not feel like you have been moved, you must not have a pulse!  This woman's voice is a knockout, and the songs on  this album blew me away!  &quot;At Last&quot; and &quot;I Just Want to Make  Love to You&quot; are my two favorites.  I suggest listening to this album  over cocktails for some serious fun and a great atmosphere!
B00004S361|5.0|The mid-70's belonged to Stevie Wonder, and this 1974 release a year after  the masterpiece &quot;Innervisions&quot; finds Stevie in more relaxed mood.  From Michael Sembello's beautiful guitar intro on 'Smile Please' to  Stevie's laid back vocal delivery, the smooth tone to the proceedings is  set immediately. 'Heaven Is Ten Zillion Light Years Away' is his most  passionate gospel number ever and features a simple one-man-band sound that  suits the material well. The stark, stunning piano ballad 'Too Shy To Say'  finds him standing emotionally naked while confessing the kind of deep love  we all feel at one time or another, but simply can't put into words.  Yearning doesn't even begin to describe how he sounds here. &quot;Boogie on  Reggae Woman&quot; and &quot;You Haven't Done Nothin'&quot; are the big  hits here and are both uptempo, funky clavinet based tunes that lift the  listener both in mind and body. Special Note: check out the Jackson 5's  catchy 'doo de wop' backing vocals on &quot;Haven't Done....&quot; Classic!  The remainder of &quot;Fulfillingness.....&quot; is mostly flawless ballads  (the classic &quot;Creepin&quot;, &quot;There Ain't No Use&quot;, the scary  &quot;They Won't Go When I Go&quot; etc.) that round out the album quite  nicely.  This is highly recommended middle-period Stevie before his  artistic pretensions got out of hand on his next project. Smooth and  imminently listenable from start to finish.
B00000IPAX|1.0|ive liked blink for a long time, before they ever hit the mtv scene. i was really disappointed with this album. their music has changed so much. i am  ashamed to have even bought this cd. dont worry, im not going to go into  this tirade about whether or not theyre punk, or what the definition of  punk is. frankly, i sick of hearing about it anyway. but i will say this.  blink has strayed afar from there roots. i loved the boys, but i think i  will leave them to all the 12 year old girls who say theyre so HOT. if you  want a blink cd, buy cheshire cat. dont buy this cd.
B000001EAQ|5.0|When I saw the world premiere of U2's new single, &quot;Discotheque,&quot;  I was bit surprised.  Can this be U2?  No.  Really?  They sounded so  different!<br />I was a bit miffed.  The sound was different, unique, but  definitely U2.  I waited for the CD to come out.  I listened to the CD as  much as I could to familiarize myself with their songs as I waited for them  to tour.  Well, wouldn't you know... the more I listened to POP, the more I  liked it.<br />&quot;Discotheque&quot; has a snappy beat, while on the other  side, &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot; grabs at you.  My favorite  song is &quot;Please.&quot;  It's dark and moody, but it lifts you up and  carries you away.  Bono hasn't moved backward in his songwriting; on the  contrary.  He shows as much promise as a songwriter as he did when  &quot;Boy&quot; came out.  He'll continue to grow, as will the band.<br />I  think what best defines U2 is that they can't be defined.  They can't be  forced under one sub-genre of rock n' roll.  True, they have a definite  sound - when you hear Bono sing, you know it's him, when you hear The Edge  play his guitar, you know it's him - but they are a band that will be  forever trying out new sounds.  They aren't satisfied with being labeled  under one type of sub-genre.  It's as if each album has it's own story,  it's own life.  U2 keeps reinventing itself, trying out new sounds.  That's  what makes them U2.
0553562355|5.0|Erich Segal was not my favorite then, but when i got to read this book, he became first on my list. He really imparted the feelings of a man torn between his family and his other son. The realism of the story hit me and i  was moved into tears after finishing this novel... I tell you, you got to  read this book or forever miss the opportunity of reading one GREAT story!

0767903854|5.0|I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I've read most of Bill Bryson's work and found this one to be a perfect balance of humor and information. A few of his others seemed to slip into TOO much detail (A  Walk in the Woods for instance was VERY dry in places!) &quot;Down  Under&quot; (as it's called in Aussie!) kept my interest from start to  finish and left me wanting to read more! I especially enjoyed it because I  have some very special friends who live there and tell me all about life in  &quot;Oz&quot; and it sounds just like this book. &quot;Down Under&quot;  has encouraged me greatly to finally venture over there (as they've been  asking me to do for years now!) and see it for myself! (Ironically, I  &quot;turned them on&quot; to BB and now they're great fans of his, too!)  GREAT one Bill! Keep it up!
6303160344|1.0|I used to think that the Canadian comedy troupe, SCTV, did the best parodies of all that can be pretentious and boring when it comes to foreign films (remember, these are 'films' not 'movies'). That was until this  priceless comedy gem was recommended to me. &quot;Blue&quot; is about a  woman who stares meaningfully into vast distances and has a stylish  apartment. If you don't fall asleep watching this woman (who is played by  Juliette Binoche, usually seen in more serious movi ... I mean, 'films'),  then you will scratch your head and grin and say, &quot;I will laugh, for  obviously that is what I am supposed to do. No movie can be this  aggressively pretentious on purpose. It must be a comedy. Ha ha ha.&quot;  Director Kieslowski (also, usually attatched to more serious projects) is  so good at capturing what was once a cliched ponderousness in foreign  films, that one would almost think he, himself, is serious. I saw through  it, though, and that makes me the winner. Okay, I am out the price of this  mov ... I mean, film, but I am still the winner. So there.
0792845730|5.0|this movie is simply the greatest movie of all time!  it has it all, great plot, great special effects, great acting, and LOTS of action!  this is one of those movies that everyone should see.  its a story about police officer  alex murphy who gets shot to death in the line of duty and is reborn as the  cyborg &quot;robocop&quot;.  who knew about a movie about a guy who gets  shot to death then turned into a robot could be such a success?  paul  verhoeven was the only director who took the script after so many others  turned it down.  he did a fantastic directing job and basil poledouris  added a soundtrack that brought so much life to this movie.  the ED-209  sequences were just amazing.  i loved the ed209 vs robocop fight that was  action packed! <br />     peter weller does an outstanding job as alex  murphy/robocop, he does such a great job playing the cyborg. nancy allen  also plays her role very good too, as the partner of robocop, anne lewis.   Clarence boddicker is one of the baddest SOBs that i've ever seen in a  movie, he is the ultimate villan.<br />     all in all RoboCop is worth the  buy!  you must see it, you'll never forget it!
0688156819|5.0|What is better, the illustrations or the dark humored stories? You will have to decide for yourself. This book is cloth covered and makes a great gift (that is how I got it) for anyone of your friends who loves Burton.  Not easily found in bookstores - so grab it when you see it. This will be  worth some big bucks when it goes out of print. So, maybe buy two?
0553573403|1.0|I cannot contest the power and strength of the writing in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;.  Had the book been less well-written it would never have provoked the depth of dislike I feel for it.  However, far from being swept  into the story, I found myself continually putting it down or skipping  pages.<br />The problem for me lies in the wealth of unlikeable characers. I  quite honestly couldn't find a single character I wanted to know more  about.  I started each chapter, grateful that I was going to read about  someone different, hopefully somebody I would care about.  Unfortunately I  never did end up caring.  It was not the moral &quot;greyness&quot; of the  characters which bothered me; many of my favourite fictional creations have  both good and evil  in their makeup.  It was more that I could find no  reason to like the characters nor any way to identify with them, and as a  result found myself alternately bored and depressed as I read.<br />The world  Martin creates, however expertly, is a dark, gritty and cynical place.  Hope, innocence, kindness, and even sorrow do not survive in it.  And that,  for me, removes the very qualities that make a fantasy novel a joy to read  and set it apart from other  kinds of fictions.

0790731894|4.0|I first saw this on video and I immediately liked it.  When I found out it was available on DVD, I got it right away.  The action and the story was fast-paced and kept me entertained for the whole film.  I also liked Steven  Seagal's performance in the film.  I don't that this film was weak or  depressing at all.  I really enjoyed this movie.

6301930827|4.0|I had first seen this film on HBO and I immediately enjoyed it. The film had a great cast which gave very effective and convincing performances.  I also liked the plot of this film. The action and suspense was fast-paced  and it kept me entertained and interested.  I really enjoyed this film.
076790382X|4.0|So what's this then? A collection of columns written by Bill Bryson for the British Night &amp; Day magazine, assembled into a book? I was sceptical when I first picked it due to the unfamiliarity here; I thought  he was a travel writer. But then I started reading through the first few  pages and am delighted to report that they were so entertaining and  accessible that I ended up finishing the book very satified.<br />This book is  about America, about consumerism, hypocracy, politics, culture and  everything else in between, such as motels and boring interstate highways  and the condition of AT&amp;T service these days. Why should all this be so  interesting? Because Bill Bryson's voice shines throughout, dissecting  normally more complex subjects into bite-sized articles which are eminently  readable to the extent that it is at times impossible to stop. Of course,  his trademark humour is present too. If you read this in public, there is  the risk of embarrassment by your involuntary snorts of  laughter.<br />However, 'I'm a Stranger here Myself' isn't perfect. Much of  the book is predictable, and 85% of the time, Bill appears to be  complaining. Someone as talented as Bill Bryson should know not to engage  in such indulgence because the end result is that the reader occassionally  feels frustrated over the ostensible monotony. You also can't help but feel  that an assemblage of brief columns is not enough to make a book.  <br />Although this book is not standard Bill Bryson fare, it still manages to  excel. It really is exceptionally enlightening, to read what he has to say  subsequent to spending 20 years in England. He compares the contrasts  between the two nations and questioning so many aspects of life that  Americans take for granted, such as driving from shop to shop when they are  merely footsteps apart, or the blatant excesses of junk food. Each article  (in my edition, Black Swan) covers only five pages so they are very easy to  get into. <br />If youare an American, perhaps you will enjoy this book more  than anyone else as you will undoubtedly find it compelling to look into  the views of an outsider in the process of 'assimilation'.<br />'I'm a Strange  here Myself' doesn't feel like a book, more like a colelction of columns  binded together. If you are willing to accept this, it is an extremely  rewarding, insightful and refreshingly diverting read. This is enough to  gain a hearty recommendation.
B00000G3PA|4.0|I think that this is one of the best films that Michael Bay ever made.  It has a great cast that gives great performances.  The effects in this film are also very impressive and amazing.  I don't that this is a depressing  film at all.  The action and suspense is fast-paced and kept me entertained  throughout the film.  I think that this is a really great film.
0451191153|4.0|This is Rand's Great American Novel - it presents an inspiring view of individualism worth re-reading over the years. Roark is a self-actualized, self-motivated individual. Rand contrasts Roark's character with three  fascinating male characters; Keating, who betrayed his dreams by  conforming; Toohey, who deliberately seeks to destroy greatness; Wynand,  who lives a tragic mistake. My one disappointment is the character of  Dominique - Rand was not yet able to project the female equivalent of Dagny  in Atlas Shrugged.
B000000WF9|5.0|When I saw &quot;Gattaca&quot; I fell in love with the music which is composed by Michael Nyman (The Piano, Carrington, Drowning By Numbers, etc.).<br />Nyman structures the music to really feel in your soul about what  you really want in life and how you have to sometime make sacrifices.  The  music hits you in the SOUL.<br />This soundtrack never loses a beat throughout  its entire spin. What baffles me that Nyman who has never won an oscar for  scoring was totally ignored even for a nomination for this wonderful  masterpiece (Gattaca)....a shame....but of course John Williams, and Bill  Conti get nominated time after time for the same ole schtick.<br />Other  wonderful compositions by Nyman are also one of my favorits &quot;The  Draughtmans Contract&quot;, and &quot;Prosperos Books&quot;.<br />Nyman is a  truly gifted composer who still has not got his due.<br />A wonderful CD with  beautiful composition.
6301969294|4.0|Given the constraints of a Hollywood 1940's production, this is a masterful condensation of the novel - one that deserves a mini-series. It's a stylistic production with an excellent Max Steiner score. The sense of  Rand's heroic individualism comes across in Cooper's performance. However,  it's time for a remake. <br />I suggest reading the novel first.
6300183211|1.0|Lets first get one thing straight- this movie is not classy, enjoyable, great or anything else, those who are obsessed with the film will tell you. This film is unpleasant to say the least, after watching the movie for my  first and only time I felt morally corrupt and bankrupt, a feeling I have  never really experienced before even after seeing the Godfathers,  Goodfellas and Donnie Brasco. I'd go as far to say I was almost cheering on  the bad guys in them films! <br />Most of the film was complete, mindless  violence. If we're comparing violence, and unpleasant scenes on a scale of  1-10 Scarface is up there at 10, no doubt about it, Goodfellas doesn't even  come close. This guy (Al Pacino) is mean, hes pure evil, not your average  mob guy- no Henry Hill, no Sonny Corleone even. He makes Joe Pesci's  charachter in Goodfellas look like Mother Tresa or Ghandi and no that is  not an exhageration!  And it over steps the mark, it stops being  entertaining, moving it just comes across as being unrealistic and sick.  <br />I hated the soundtrack which was cheap 80's keyboard rubbish, rather  than belnd into the background it was firmly in the foreground and got in  the way. The combination of the directing, music and acting when Pacino's  character goes crazy when he sees a guy with his sister (any guy, even his  best friend) is terrible.<br />His cocaine addiction just over stepped the  mark and stopped being entertaing or moving too. Just sick. It was hard to  watch some of the scenes and I watch a lot of mob films! and scarface seems  to develop an unhealthy sexual thirst for his sister!<br />Finally (thanks for  reading if you've got this far) don't watch this film- just don't (about  sums it up)
068484267X|5.0|If you enjoy a book that peeks into the lives and hardships of others without over-glorifying the content (though how he manages to remember his life in such great, descriptive detail is incredible) - and you can sit  through the tragedy and squalor that mark this book, page after page,  Angela's Ashes is an excellent choice.<br />Frank McCourt lived (remarkably)  to tell the story of his impoverished and tragedy-striken family who's  hardships followed them from Ireland to New York and back again -  unrelenting, and unforgiving. His detail is both intriguing and disturbing  - his story memorable and his style brilliant. Highly recommended.
0767903854|3.0|When Bill Bryson's newest book was published, I had been home from my 5 month semester abroad in Australia for almost as long.  Still achingly missing a country I had come to love and feel at home in, I eagerly ran to  the bookstore to buy Bryson's book.  <br />Yes, the book is overall  entertaining and pretty much witty; it's easy to read and a little hard to  put down.  But for the most part, i was disappointed.  Occasionally, I  would even find myself thinking, &quot;I could have written this book and  done Australia more justice!&quot;<br />Australia is a spectacular, wonderful,  welcoming, enchanting country.  As if anyone could have any doubt about  that after listening to Bryson effuse for 300 pages.  Perhaps some will  find the fact that he sings the Lucky Country's praises page after page  grating; for me, I felt I had found someone with whom I could sympathize  about missing the place!<br />However, for all his accolades, Bryson seems to  only brush the surface of a country rich in history, landscape, and  experiences waiting to be had.  He spends only ONE DAY at one of  Australia's most recognizable landmarks, Uluru, the giant monolith; he is  too much of a sissy to even GO UNDER WATER at the Great Barrier Reef; he  misses out on the beauty and home-i-ness of Adelaide (my home away from  home!); he doesn't see an opera at the world famous Opera House; and he  doesn't even VISIT Tasmania, a place almost too beautiful and wild to put  into words.<br />Having lived in Australia for those 5 months, and having  traveled extensively, I was looking for something to aleviate the sadness  of having had to come &quot;home&quot; from a place I had become so  attached to.  I wanted something to evoke a vivid trip down memory lane.   What I found did not live up to those expectations, and I suspect for those  like me, the feeling will be the same.  And for those of you who have yet  to visit Australia, there's more out there than Bryson relays; it's better  than the book.

6303168507|5.0|Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List descends into hell but finds redemption. The black-and-white filming mutes the gore, as does the consistent light thread of black humor: Schindler (Liam Neeson) hires only young, shapely Jewish secretaries (who appear to type 15 wpm) - and he hires plenty; meantime, Isaac Stern (Ben Kingsley) busily tries to save the lives of highly educated-highly naive Jews by misrepresenting their liberal arts professions to the SS as \\"skilled trades vital to the German war effort\\"; the lethal, menacing, sinister SS repeatedly tell Schindler what truly bothers them about his Jewish workers - \\"It's just all the paperwork, you know, Herr Schindler\\"; later at Auschwitz Schindler rescues all his workers' children by brazenly (and quite convincingly) lying to the SS that only little children's hands can get inside 45 mm shell casings to polish them - making those little hands \\"vital to the German war effort\\".<br /><br />The sole splash of color in the entire film is the muted red jacket of a young girl four or five years old. Schindler sees her wandering through Cracow during the SS pogrom, and he sees her later again as a little red-jacketed corpse exhumed for cremation from an unmarked mass grave.<br /><br />Essentially an Ebenezer Scrooge morality play, we view Schindler's growth in Christian compassion. (Schindler was Roman Catholic.) Liam Neeson does a stellar job and his rapport with Ben Kingsley is magic. The pair move from chilly professional respect to warm against-all-odds friendship. This friendship is a counterpoint to Schindler's friendship with Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), the SS commandant in charge of Schindler's workers. Goeth ironically is more tragic than Stern, becoming day by day more and more of a cold-hearted brutalizer of the weak and helpless - as Schindler points out to Stern.<br /><br />The SS uniforms are immaculately correct, as is Spielberg's portrayal of the moral tide of anti-semitism throughout the war - initially rabid, later cold-blooded, finally matter-of-fact. His personal faults aside, Schindler's life was a beautiful testament of a glorious human soul surrounded by death and horror - and how that soul made a difference.<br /><br />A magisterial film that gets better with each viewing.

B00004SCX6|1.0|Once again, Britney Spears has made a not-so-good-CD. I will admit &quot;Lucky&quot; is a catchy song only because it is played so many times  on MTV. It is the only song with a meaning in it. As for the people that  say she has &quot;grown up&quot; with this album, I doubt that. &quot;Dear  Diary, Today I saw a boy and I wondred if he noticed me...&quot;. That is  not how a NORMAL 18 year old girl would react to a boy. Sounds like a 10  year old reacting.  The title track, &quot;Oops....I did It Again&quot;  sounds like every other pop song I've ever heard. To make it worse, she  sings the whole album through her nose and if you don't like her, you'd  have to stop the CD cuz there's only so much bad singing a person can take.  &quot;Don't Go Knocking On My Door&quot;--Can we say broken record?  Its  ike halfway through the song it repeats itself and although could be an  attempt to have meaning, well, she did it again.  &quot;Stronger&quot;  sounds like something off of her even more childish CD &quot;...Baby One  More Time&quot;.  As for &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, it's not very  satisfying. It is probably the worst attempt to recreate a song that I have  ever heard. And Im not the only one.  All in all, if you listened to the  faster songs on the CD you honestly would not know when the song ended and  when a new one started thats how alike they all sound. And as for her  slower songs, please dont do it again Britney! Try harder next time, it may  happen some day.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed is an amazing band, even though they have been criticized for  sounding a lot like Pearl Jam. I don't see what the big deal is. Everyone  is obviously inspired by some band, so just lay off with the Pearl Jam  stuff. Anyway.... back to the cd. This album, in my opinion, is better than  My Own Prison. I have no idea why, to tell you the truth, but the songs  seem to have more meaningful lyrics and this album is a bit more positive  and uplifting. Well, I guess thats all for now. Just go and buy this cd,  cuz it's better than a lot of the stuff that's already out there.
B00003W8NM|5.0|When I saw Fight Club in theaters, I witnessed a truly disturbing and intriguing movie. I followed the path of a young man (Edward Norton), made so hollow and emotionless by our society that he must resort to attending  testicular cancer (among other deadly diseases) meetings so that he can  feel emotion.  However, the movie is called Fight Club because soon  enough he can no longer even get support from the groups and so he and his  new and mysterious friend, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) start Fight Clubs to  feel the emotion and adrenaline of fighting for life.  The movie twists  and turns into some somewhat unrealistic turns, but the audience gets an  amazing glimpse of the human psyche and the dark recesses of the soul that  are hidden to society.  All that having been said, the marketing team  and technical team really went all out on bringing the movie to DVD. The  cover box is even great to inspect and look at, and once you get to the two  disk DVD's you are stunned. You get all the added features listed above,  and so the DVD takes what is really a 4 star movie to the next level.
B00000JPH5|5.0|Labyrinth came out when i was four years old...the moment my father popped it into the VCR, i could not take my eyes off the tv screen..even when the movie was finished, i wanted to continue to watch it repeatedly. I used to  run outside in my little princess dress with my stuffed animals and my  crystal ball, pretending I was Sarah, the heroine of the story.  &quot;through dangers unknown and hardships outnumbered, I have found my  way back to the goblin kingdom..&quot; till this day, those words stay in  my mind everytime I see David Bowie or an owl. This movie is one of the  best examples of children's fantasies. &quot;nowadays&quot; its very  difficult for kids to find new movies that are actually good...I highly  suggest that everyone either rents or buys this gem of a movie. It's a  great investment for all of those &quot;young at heart&quot;!
0780631684|5.0|I show this great thriller at theaters before 4-5 days... I think that it was the scariest movie I've ever seen, and I will never forget it! I am now  looking forward to buy the Dvd (the price is good :) The script was great  and all the effects seamed to be so real... If you like action and scary  movies, don't miss this one. Notice that this movie contains lots of hard  scenes and mustn't be viewed from children.
B00004TJTS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies from the past year.  I think Frankie Muniz should get an Oscar nom for his performance.  The director really  lucked out in getting this kid, and right before he hit it big with  MALCOLM! They just don't make movies like this anymore --the shot with  Muniz and the dog running through a field, silhouetted against a glorious  sky, reminded me of THE YEARLING.  The scene where the grown up Willie gets  on the bus for college, mom and dad wave as the bus pulls away, then they  turn and walk off, and we see the little dog sitting on the sidewalk  watching the bus disappear down the road ---I lose it right about there!    And I mean lose it BIG TIME!  This is one of those movies you don't rent,  you BUY IT because you are going to want to watch it again and again!
630542845X|5.0|Do Not listen to the people who reviewed this title and said it falls short in spots. They are no nothing pathetic movie critics who have no sense of a good Prophetic film. Sure this kind of movie is not for everyone  but the people that its not for do not have to put it down for being so  different. If you like watching films that at the end leave you with a good  feeling then Powder is a movie for you. A very well done story about a  person who was very different from everyone else around him, and of coures  people were afraid of Him and rejected his non violent way of being  different. I hold very little respect for people who think this movie is  not very well done because, they did not understand or grasp, in a sense,  the true meaning of this film, for the one reason which the film's theme  is, that if your different than people will reject you because they fear  what they can't understand.

6305910103|4.0|I would pay good money for the additional scenes that used to air with the ABC broadcast of this movie.  As another reviewer said, they go a long way toward explaining some of the stuff that fell kinda flat in the theatrical  release.  Also, why not dig up Nick Meyer and a couple cast members, and  give us some audio commentary?  Come on, Paramount, use the format to it's  fullest extent!<br />As a film, though, Star Trek II just rocks.  And the DVD  transfer looks and sounds good, even if it is a bit lacking in other  features.
B000002UR7|3.0|though not polished, at this stage in their careers pablo honey shows  evidence of the brilliance to come from this UK band.  The range they  display on songs from &quot;anyone can play guitar&quot; to &quot;thinking  about you&quot; is gargantuan.  If you love this band, you'll have to  finish off your collection by owning this, their first U.S. release, if  only from curiosity.
B000002B5L|3.0|i use amazon a lot and i could not believe when reading these reviews that everybody(even the editor) think that 2 of the songs are covers. ready or not is also a cover from a delfonics song. killing me softly is quite a  good cover, however no woman no cry is totally unnecessary and is  COMPLETELY mediocre when compared to marley. ready or not is still below   delfonics.   the rest of the album is vey ordinary and it is these three  songs which stand out and they stand out because they are not the fugees  original work.
0780631684|4.0|This was a very good movie.  It really kept me on the edge of my seat.  Job well done with the suspense.
B00003CX6P|5.0|Don't let the smiling faces of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law on the cover fool you.  The Talented Mr. Ripley is a disturbing film.<br />And it's not a &quot;Silence-of-the-Lambs,&quot; &quot;what-if-this-really-happened&quot;  kind of disturbing, either.  This story bothers us because the horrible  irony of the concluding scene is both unavoidable and hauntingly logical.  We have sympathized, even agreed, with Tom Ripley at each step in his  journey.  Unrequited envy, hopeless infatuation, and self-loathing are  too-common emotions, and although our consciences, unlike Ripley's, may  keep us from acting on them, his urges are our own.<br />We've known a Dickie  Greenleaf, a popular, talented go-getter who seems to have everything he  wants.  We've caught ourselves dressing, speaking, behaving like our idols.  We've felt that peculiar blend of lust, jealousy, and admiration that  makes us think thoughts we're ashamed of, start sentences we're embarrassed  to finish, and cling breathlessly to dreams of &quot;if only&quot; and  &quot;someday.&quot;<br />There are moments in this film where Matt Damon and  Jude Law are the fiction--Tom Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf have such a REAL  relationship on-screen that we feel right along with Ripley the thrill of  sharing Dickie's laughter... the ache of admiring his beauty unnoticed...  the sting of his fickle rejection.  Paltrow, too, as the woman who has what  Ripley wants but wants what Ripley has, is spellbindingly real.  No one in  the film--including Ripley--ever seems completely to know what's going on,  and it's that sense of uncertainty perhaps that draws us so close to the  characters.<br />Just what is Mr. Ripley's talent?  Watch the film and see  what your answer is--my own answer hits a little too close to home.
0425173739|5.0|This is one of the finest Christie mysteries, both for its marvellous use of atmosphere as well as its twisty, holding plot.  Linnet Ridgeway, a young and beautiful heiress marries and sets out for Egypt on her  honeymoon.  However, Linnet's new husband, Simon Doyle was engaged to marry  her best friend Jacqueline until Linnet deliberately set out to seduce him,  and a heart-broken Jacqueline has vowed revenge....The honeymooners are on  a cruise down the Nile when they are stunned to find Jacqueline there,  waiting for them.  Despite their fears, all appears well at first, but a  few days later, Linnet Doyle is murdered in her bed...a clear-cut case  surely, except it is shown to be impossible for Jacqueline to have  committed the murder!  The authorities are baffled but fortunately, Hercule  Poirot is one of the passengers on the cruise and is determined to find out  the real killer....an incredible mystery filled with local color - the  description of the splendors of Egypt is wonderful and the characters of  all the passengers on board are well developed.  Christie shifts the  possibility of guilt like a kaleidescope, showing us in turn how almost  every single passenger on the cruise had a plausible reason for wishing  Linnet Doyle dead....the ending is a genuine shocker, yet completely  believeable.  You must read this book if you are a mystery lover, it will  play havoc with all your notions about guilt and innocence!
B00004W4UB|5.0|Julia Roberts as Mary Reilly is wonderful in the film. She gave a sensitive dramatic performance in this artistic film which takes the  classic tale of Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde (played superbly by John Malkovich)  in a different perspective - in the eyes of his faithful lady servant,  Mary, played by Roberts. Also, in the film is a hilarious participation of  Glenn Close. I recommend this movie for serious fans of Julia Roberts.  Great Film!
0553108034|5.0|&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; is a marvelous continuation of the intriguing story begun in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;. George Martin has created a rich, fascinating world peopled with believable, sympathetic characters who do sometimes-noble-but-mostly-terrible things. Nothing is certain in this tale and no one is safe, so don't go thinking &quot;Oh, Martin can't possibly kill off THIS character&quot;. He can. He has. He will again. I loved it! I raced through the second book, then went back and read it again. While I wait for book three, I find myself constantly returning to the previous two, looking for clues to resolve the many mysteries, or hoping to guess what's going to happen next. I'd sworn off fantasy series (they all began to sound alike to me), but the Books of Ice and Fire have made me a believer again! Not since I read &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; have I been so excited about a series of books, and that's the highest praise I can muster. Yay for George Martin!
B000020617|5.0|This is the best CD that the Foo Fighters have come up with yet. all of the songs have there own way of creeping into your sence of beat and getting the best of you. By this CD. if you don't you will be sorry
0060925000|5.0|Mr. Seth is a wonderful writer with tremendous scope and vision. If you enjoy Dickensian novels with huge casts of characters and social conscience, read this. On one level, it is a fun and enjoyable tale of one  girl's mother and her search for a marriageable boy for her daughter; on  another level, it is an examination of arranged marriage, independence,  individualism, love, family, poverty, politics, prostitution and Indian  culture. I can't recommend this enough.
B00004TDTO|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time and also the first I ever saw at the tender age of 4. This DVD version enhances the home experience to the fullest and gives enough extras to justify purchasign once again. For those  who have yet to see it, buy this and live the adventure. THe acting is  good, the story is great, and the action is top notch. The deleted scenes  are kind of funny, especially the one with Quint mimicking a young boy  playing an instrument. The documentary shows how hard the film was to make,  yet the success obviously eased the pain. I cant say enough about this  movie so go get it now!
B00000HZFH|5.0|Hate to say it, folks, but right now nobody is rocking out any harder than Built To Spill.  These guys are Radiohead with cojones.  Nothing against Radiohead (I love them), but THIS album is so chock-full of power chords,  killer riffs and bone-crunching crescendoes that it's almost unfair.  The  first four songs are about as good as rock n' roll gets.<br />How these guys  continue on in their relative cult status is the biggest mystery in popular  music.  If you're looking for the best band on the planet, look no  further....it's Built To Spill.  An essential for your collection.  Go up  to that &quot;Buy&quot; button on your screen and click on it.  It will be  the best money you'll have spent in years.  That's a promise.
B00002E23E|4.0|I was glad to see that this movie was released on DVD. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the lack of extra's, the only difference is the trailer, other than that it is identical to the video  version. Of course DVD is better quality video and sound, and that makes  this a must for Zep fans everywhere. If you are a new fan to the group this  movie will solidify your enjoyment of the band, and unfortuantely is the  only official release of the band live, with some movie extras with members  of the band. Long live Led Zeppelin!  Lets hope they release some  unreleased concert footage on DVD next!
B00003BDXG|5.0|To start off, Natural Born Killers is nothing short of excellence.  Like a prized dog, this film twists, turns, rolls, and has a hell of a bite.  A lot of the movie is made up of spiradic and violent dilusions that the  murderous couple encounter on their excapade, which gives a hint that the  whole thing might just be one sick fantasy.  I admire the cinematic effert  put in to depict the corruption that a serial killer must endure, as well  as the moral instability a murderer enherits over time, due to the media.   The violence is, oddly enough, not as explicit as many would expect, but  more of a pardoned obscurity that the movie chooses to tred a bit lightly.   I dont feel that Natural Born Killers glamerizes violence, or even attempts  to moralize it.  Its a film that presents to its audience a horrible and  psycotic way of life, to which the emphasis of right and wrong is not  required.  Everyone in the movie, even the victims, are depicted as having  the same amount of corruption and demented instincs as the murderous couple  do, just at a lower rate.  In this way, we see how even casual contact  leads each mass murderer deeper and deeper into the realm of insanity.  How  the sick and diluded representations that television and the media produce  are accepted as a form of reality.  How even the most horrid of  occomplishments, such as achieving the title of &quot;mass murder&quot;,  are praised and even encouraged in society today, as though we are  applauding the home-run countdown of Mark Magwyre.  I did not enjoy this  movie as much as I admired its exceedingly impressive use of effects and  contravercial originality.  Its like Bonnie and Clyde on acid.  You'll  leave this movie with a different view twords the media's &quot;pop&quot;  culture, as well as an equally disturbing look on the reality behind serial  killing.  Its a lot of bang for your buck folks.  Buy it for the kicks, but  don't dig to deep.
6305603847|5.0|I was blown away at how great an experience it was to view this on DVD with surround sound. I have seen the video version numerous times and having the DVD now makes this movie even better. The documentary and added  scene of 'hey you' make this an amazing buy. The documentary was made for  this release so it shows the makers in present day and past, and they offer  their perspectives after making the film 20 years ago, and how it effects  them today.  Any Pink Floyd fan or fan of the movie must own this on DVD.
B00002SWEM|4.0|Ry Cooder and Reuben Gonzalez are the stars of this enlightening documentary. It is a story about a Cuban who gathers long-forgotten stars from the Buena Vista Social Club together to reunite.
B00000IQ4Q|5.0|I went to this movie hoping it would be good.  From the previews I wasn't sure if it would be as good as the firt two Batman movies or as bad as Batman and Robin.  It had the potential for both.  I was not disappointed  at all.  From the opening sequence featuring Traci Lords and a great track  by New Order, I was hooked by this movie.  This movie arguably may bost   some of the BEST fight sequences in any movie, especially the very first  scene in the vampire club.  Added to the great choreography is the music  which only adds to the whole scene.<br />Snipes was a great cast for Blade.   He must have really worked out because I have never seen a buffer Snipes.   Dorf was very good as the evil, evil vampire.  Kristofferson was a good  cast as Whistler.  He was perfect as the gruff old man who really cared for  Blade.<br />The movie plot was good too.  Thrown into the dialogue are a  couple of gems that can't be printed here.  Topping it are two lines.  One  is about ice skating and the other is only mouthed during the beginning of  the final battle.  Watch for these, you won't be disappointed.  The final  end also leaves a great opening for a sequal and ends with you wanting  more.<br />This is a great action movie that was a superb crossover from the  comic.  In fact, just writing this review has made me want to go watch it  again.
0671034065|4.0|beautifully crafted...it catches the reader's interest with the mystery for the question, &quot;what makes a perfect man?&quot;.... readers can't put the book down once they start the first page... odds and ends are some  of the surprises found in this book... definitely must read...
6302906636|5.0|This is the movie that started the whole thing.  Now there have been sequels and a TV series, but none of them can compare to this classic of fantasy.  This is one of my favorite movies.  Maybe it's becuase it  juxtaposes sword fighting and modern times.  Maybe it's because you can  never place Lambert's accent.  Maybe it's just because this movie has  something that you can't put your finger on, but will watch whenever it's  on.<br />This movie is just a classic.  It's about a group of immortals who  have to do battle because 'there can be only one'.  They fight for the  prize and the only way that they can be killed is by beheading.  The battle  leads to modern day New York between the Highlander and the Kurgen (very  bad guy).  The battles are good and the ending to the final battle is  great.  <br />If you've seen any of the other installments, you have to see  this.  The sequels are not good.  The TV series is a pale imitation of this  movie.  With the new movie (which unfortunately pairs Lambert with the TV  guy) coming out, hopefully this movie will see a resurgence.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is my favorite book.  It was by complete chance that I found it in the bookstore. After reading ten pages I already knew this book would be my favorite. It is honest in a way that can't be  described.  I loved it and I hope you do too:-)
0783221487|5.0|Dune is my favorite movie.  And I know, it doesn't compare to the book, but how many movies do?  Taken alone, as a movie it is amazing.  The sheer grandeur of its undertaking is awesome.  The story is of young Paul  Atreides who is the target of an assassination attempt.  He comes from a  line that has been bred for quite some time by a sisterhood of witches,  hoping to create the supreme being.  In his escape he ends up with the  Fremen, a desert tribe of warriors who aid him.<br />This plot doesn't sound  eventful, but it is and the way that it unfolds and is portrayed is  something to see.  This movie is visually stunning.  You need to see it in  Widescreen with a good sound system becuase it needs to feel big.  The  music (by Toto) is a perfect backdrop to everything going on.  The casting  is all very good.  There is a longer version out there that has a different  voice narrating and explains a lot more things.  I prefer this version  because it makes you put the pieces together and the narration is better.   You'll need to watch it a couple of times or watch it with someone who's  seen it to understand it, but that just makes it better.  It doesn't get  boring after repeated viewings and has so many levels of meaning that it is  mind boggling.
0140288503|5.0|I knew these people, they were my, colleagues, my friends, my 'Ranger Buddies'. I was stationed with the 3d Ranger Bn. for four years from 1996 to 2000. I learned a lot about the actions of my buds, from stories here and there, but none so comprehensive as this. When you talk to individuals you get small pieces of the pie, and the command structure was never really willing to talk about it too much, either, except for certain tactical applications. I learned more about the silent heroes that worked around me everyday through this book than I would have ever known otherwise.<br />This book was extremely well written, fast paced, and graphic. It will provide the reader with an unstoppable thrill ride of action and fact.<br />Funny how things are, but this book which is the most accurate account of Mogadishu, was never encouraged to be read by our leaders, mainly because it did point out some of the faults of the past leadership.<br />Overall one of the best books I've ever read.
B0000399WI|5.0|Man, not too many of Stephen King's movies turn out like this.  But you know...Stephen King is one frightening writer even when he's not trying to be scary.  King can scare you because no matter what he wants to write, it  will turn out to be one of the most amazing books written.  Which will then  become one great movie.  This one is no exception.<br />Tim Robbins plays an  innocent thrown into prison and befriends an old man (Morgan Freeman).  The  things Robbins does in this movie just keep it so interesting, and  Freeman's narrating over the entire movie is just great.<br />This is one of  those &quot;must watch&quot; movies.  You'll be smiling when this one ends,  I promise you.
0783243499|2.0|The film is disjointed as it relies heavily on a previously gained knowledge of the novel. Bateman is not properly introduced and the film succumbs heavily to the afore mentioned fault. Despite this, if you have  read the book, then the film is interesting to watch due to the images you  may have created in your head and how they differ to those generated by  Harron in the film.

B000003RCY|5.0|My addiction to Rammstein began in a small cement black room... No I wasn't in jail, I was in college. In Joe's Room playing what else but  Nintendo 64. Nothing like playing Golden Eye with Rammstein blasting  through the campus.<br /> This CD has been my latest acqusition to my  collection (although mine's has a different cover). While I HAVE heard most  of Rammstein's songs this was the first time I heard &quot;Der  Meister&quot; &quot;Das Alte Leid&quot; and &quot;Herzeleid&quot; I LOVED  the way they sounded, although in my opinion Rammstein has come a long way  since then. I highly recomend this CD to ANYONE who likes Industrial Metal.
0790732254|5.0|Finally, a film in which Elizabeth Taylor gives a performance to rival any of the other great actresses of her time.  This biting black comedy is as perfect a movie adaption of a stage play can be.  The writing is phenomenal  and the acting first rate.  One of my all-time favorites.
B0000057C5|5.0|When I first heard this CD I had no idea what I had gotten myself into. My friend Joe would play Rammstein CDs all the time (so that everyone on campus could hear). But I found the music to be intoxicating. I loved it  even before I knew what they were saying.<br /> What I enjoyed most about this  band is their whole playulness (and pyrotechnics). I would like to thank  Joe for his catchy addiction. Your legacy will live on.<br /> My favorite  songs off of this CD are &quot;Engel&quot; &quot;Klavier&quot; &quot;Spiel  Mit Mir&quot; and &quot;Stripped&quot; The vocals are truly excellent.
6305897786|5.0|I thought this movie was great! I had no problem with the way the plot was built up, how it ended, or anything. I haven't read the book so I'm not about to make any comparisons. But the DVD edition was great and I highly  suggest watching it. But if your expecting a horror flick look somewhere  else like End of Days.
6303913881|5.0|This movie is an absolute gem.  Make no mistake it's terrible, but if only every flop could be so much fun.  Think of it as a spoof of every too-serious coming of age film, Vegas flick, and canned-Hollywood morality  tale.  For all the T&amp;A, the greatest shock of this movie is that it  almost redeems itself and manages to rise above the incoherent plot,  horrible dialogue, and frightening bad taste.  Almost.
B00004W5UA|5.0|A potential classic! Alright, maybe that statement was going a tad bit overboard, but the oddness and dark humor contained in this movie will keep you thinking about it long after the credits have rolled. It's basically  about a person determined to change our materialistic and commercialized  world with the help of a stronger person to latch onto. Brutality is shown  when the change begins with shirtless guys getting the anger off their  chests by beating each other up. Then it moves onto something greatly  larger... see it for yourself!
B00004TDTO|5.0|Everyone who is anyone has heard of Jaws and more than likely has seen the amazing film in some form or fashion. I'm not here to praise the film itself, which I can accomplish by simply saying &quot;One of the best  movies I've ever seen.&quot; <br />I've been watching this movie in various  ways for years. Edited for TV, old VHS copies, and then my widescreen VHS  cassette which was pretty good.<br />But this DVD blew my out of the water.  Never has this film looked so crisp and gorgeous. The sound is engaging and  powerful. I was absolutely blown away. And the supplementals are classic.  The documentary is fantastic, illuminating the troubles with Bruce the  mechanical shark and providing some cut scenes.<br />This disc should replace  the Matrix as the standard first disc for new DVD customers!
B000023VR6|5.0|This album is just as good as Dre's last album, &quot;The Chronic&quot;. Dre shows not only that he can still rhyme like the best of them, but that  he can produce the tighest hip-hop albums. Out of the 22 songs most are  impeccable, featuring Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, and of course his latest find,  Eminem.<br />This album is a must have for any hip-hop fan, especially west  coast rap fans.
6305718903|5.0|Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne are two of my all-time favourite  actors, so my impression of this flick is undoubtedly already biased (Hell,  I liked Nightmare on Elmstreet 3; Dream Warriors, just because Arquette  starred in it). And for that, I am truly sorry. Pending my bias, I would  just like to add that although the acting is superb, the music is great  also. Chumbawumba's &quot;Mary, Mary&quot; is featured during the opening  credits and the background score throughout is low and eerie. I would've  enjoyed it if the director hadn't gone down cliche road and employed the  five &quot;standard&quot; injuries of stigmata. Something new and arcane  would've been exciting (sort of). But that's Hollywood for you...<br />Ah, see  it. It's definately worth renting, if not buying.
0062502182|5.0|First off this book should (if possible) be read in portuguese or spanish, as the english translation does it no justice, it reads like an elementary school book. Apart from this detail, the story is compelling.<br />Coelho's  message is simple, follow your dreams, but more importantly it leaves the  reader with an &quot;itch&quot;....reminding you to constantly evaluate  yourself with respect to what you want out of life. This, I think, is the  message Coelho delivers so well.<br />The book delves into the religious a  bit, however it is probably his best work. Other books such as &quot;The  Fifth Mountain&quot; get a bit too religious for my taste. I would  reccomend this book to anyone, regardless of the need to &quot;follow your  dreams&quot;, it is very inspiring.
031286504X|5.0|Nothing Matheson has ever written has disapointed me (what can I say, all those rave reviews aren't just a smoke screen) but &quot;I am Legend&quot; is different because it is a landmark in the vamp genre. In a world where  so much garbage is pumped out into the public and passed off as literature  it's nice to read something of substance, something gothic and dark and big  enough to make you forget your life. The plight of Neville in this gem made  me forget my own worries, and Matheson's unique use of the English language  allowed me to visualize that plight in detailed horror. If you enjoy the  works of Stoker and Rice, but haven't read Matheson, you don't know what  you're missing.
B000005HNQ|4.0|Nice CD. It's like your making a yourney through a fairy-tale world. Especially the last three songs (Kevin's Telescope, Nighttime Birds and  Shrink) are great. Anneke's voice perfectly fits into the music.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's music is pioneering and this CD contains some of her best songs. I've noticed that some of her songs sound remarkably like some  X-Files tunes, especially the opening few seconds of &quot;Possession&quot;  which almost sounds Mark Snowish. The lyrics of &quot;Building a  Mystery&quot; could be made into the unoffical Fox Mulder anthem, you guys  notice that? Also, on the X-Files movie soundtrack there is an exclusive  McLachlan song &quot;Black&quot;. All things considered, I've come to the  conclusion that she must be an X-Files fan.<br />About this CD, in particular,  then... okay. The music is great. Sarah has made waves in the music  industry that parallel those made by Cher and Jewel and Alannis Morisette.  She has a beautiful, lilting voice and songs with lyrics and moods that  stretch the gamut from happy and upbeat to pensive and brooding, to  grieving. But you all know that already. <br />The only thing that bugged me  about this CD is that it's a live recording, but then again, I should've  read the back a little bit more carefully.
B000002N9L|2.0|Well, after reading all the other reviews from very happy listoners I was supprised, I believed it to be one of, if not, the worst albums he has  recorded. Not a single track stood out, even the single was not worth  releasing. I must admit I have not heard a lot of this album, I rushed out  to buy it when it was released, and was so dissapointed with it. It is a  lot heavier than all other of his albums and is to me a simple Rock album,  I am not saying it is not worth purchasing as an album but I just expected  better from an artist that has produced such classic tracks as Purple Rain  and Cream. A very dissapointing album.
0780631684|5.0|This movie was a breath of fresh air in the horror industry. Lacking many overdone cliches of 1990's horror. The highly foreshadowed elaborate deaths were real eye candy. Special effects were tight and sound was nerve  racking. This film is a must own if you are a horror afficienado or if you  just want quality story telling.
B00000K19E|5.0|Stunning! This is one good movie! I went to go see this movie because it looked cool, and I got what i expected and then some. It goes like this: a computer &quot;hacker&quot; named neo has a stupid job and not so great of  a life. This almighty guy &quot;morphieus&quot; finds him and makes neo  think hes all important then a bunch of stuff happens. Im not gonna tell  you anymore 'cause its to good.<br />You may be asking &quot;yeah thats all  great and good, but what about that rip off comment you made?&quot; Well im  getting to it. The guys who made this film are huge anime fans (anime, you  know japanese animation, no its not porn, thats hentai) Anyway there is a  series that the whole consept is that there are 2 worlds and the one your  living in now is fake. This series is Serial Experiments Lain (extreamly  good series! But be warned this is not for people with a short attition  spa.. ooo shiny)so the whole kung foo fights and really fast movements are  all things they got from anime! but hey I love anime and I love the matrix.  an easy 5 star!
0800177177|5.0|What a show!  This version of the (old theme) Dracula, actually comes to live in a weird and extremely entertaining way.  You never suspect to be touched in such a way - you actually feel sorry for Prince Dracul and his  long lost bride.  I wanted them to end up together.  And who better to  entertain us than the brilliant Sir Anthony Hopkins and the very sensuous  Gary Oldman.  Great cinematic tricks that enhances the pleasure of this  film.
B000002UAU|5.0|What can you say about this album? by writing this review i just feel overwhelmed, because you can praise it a hundred times and you'll still feel like your underrating it. It's influence, it's overall quality, the  beauty of each of it's songs and the feeling that you get after listening  to it from start to finish it's just undescribable. Even the other great  rock and roll masterpieces (such as &quot;dark side of the moon&quot; or  &quot;OK computer&quot;) can't be measured equally, mainly because without  this album's influence there's a pretty big possibility that they wouldn't  exist as we know them today. It's almost impossible to name the album's  best tracks, because of the enourmous quality of each and every one of it's  songs. However, my personal favourites are the everlasting classic  &quot;With a little help from my friends&quot;, the gorgeous &quot;She's  leaving home&quot;, the delightfuly eccentric &quot;Good morning, good  morning&quot; and the album-closing masterpiece &quot;A day in life&quot;.  All in all, a true rock and roll classic, an album that radically changed  music in the century, the Beatles best record and without a doubt a must  have. This is the type of album that if you don't have it already and you  consider yourself a music lover, you must rush to the record store and buy  it. I assure you, you won't regret it.
B000002MY3|5.0|this cd is simply wonderfull! alanis has unique vocals which are filled  with emotions. so we can say that pain makes good albums... all the songs  are perfect for every moment and i like in particular &quot;ironic&quot;  and &quot;you learn&quot;. but i love also songs like&quot;perfect&quot;  and &quot;forgiven&quot;...they give me shivers... perfect music,unique  vocals,strong songs,fantastic words......a winner! alanis only a few words  THANK U!
6305594252|3.0|A familiar story with some minor new twists (aliens colonized our planet...in a sense)about a linguist (Spader) enlisted by the military to travel through a mysterious gateway to another universe, where they help  liberate an oppressed people from a super race that wants also to destroy  earth.<br />Good production from the same guy who did &quot;Independence  Day&quot; and, more recently, &quot;Patriot,&quot; but much of it is hard  to believe.  A primitive people become very comfortable with advanced  automatic rifles, for instance, despite having initially been horrified by  a Zippo.  Spader is able to understand their language once he &quot;gets  the vowels down,&quot; which he does very quickly.  (This is an ancient  Egyptian dialect--remember, these people were the ancient colonists--which  over thousands of years has not changed! Absurd!)  Jay Davidson, looking as  lithely feminine as ever, plays &quot;Ra,&quot; god to both the ancient  Egyptians, and the primitives in this other universe.  He is cagey enough  to survive for thousands of years, but so inept that he gives a weapon to  Spader, expecting him to kill his comrades...Duh, Ra!  How could you be so  stupid?<br />Small details like this can spoil a movie for me because they are  so easily fixed...but aren't, apparently, out of sheer laziness.  This is a  B-movie in fancy clothes, but enjoyable enough, and worth a look if there's  nothing better available. <br />James Spader is great in this, as he is in  practically everything he's in.
0800139151|2.0|What was this guy thinking while he was directing? I love a good western and I love Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman and Russell Crowe. But as I sat through this video I kept hoping I'd see something good. There was some  good action at times, but I was still left hangin' because this movie could  have been better. The background of Stone's character was ugly enough to  make her hard, cold attitude understandable. But everything else was weak.  Maybe with a different director or writer it would have been better. I  don't know. But I say &quot;thumbs way down&quot; on this one.
B000003Z4C|5.0|Wow, here is a bitter man, but he can really translate it well into his  art.  Every song beats you down with a baseball bat and makes you hate the  world and hate in general.  But it is on a very deep and skillful level  that he does it.  The man has a knack for cutting to the deep meat of it  all, and show true feeling in the end.  It makes you think, it makes you  wonder, and it makes you depressed.  <br />It is amazing to me that with most  songs used in movies, they become &quot;property&quot; of that movie...  in  that the song becomes so closely related to the movie in people's minds  that it becomes synonimous with that movie...  But Red Right Hand is so  strong, and so Cave that Scream has never really been able to take it away.   I bought this album for Red Right Hand, and when I was done listening to  the whole thing for the first time I found myself more amazed by the other  songs...  a great testament to how great this album is.
6304118392|1.0|Previous reviewers have said you'll either love or hate this movie - well, put me down as the latter.  Stone's &quot;message&quot; seems to be that violence is perpetuated and glorified by the media. Gee, thanks Ollie! He  doesn't just lay it on with a trowell, but with a bulldozer. Pitched at the  intellectual level of a retarded slug, this reprehensible, self-important,  mess of a movie isn't even in the &quot;so bad it's good&quot; category. In  Hollywood, no-one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of their  audience. An absolute dog.
B000000OQF|5.0|This was one fo the first CD's that I ever purchased.  It is a genius  album, and it is too bad what happened to GnR after this album came out.   They were never able to match it.  Use Your Illusion would have made a good  album, not two...  But Appetite hits you blow after blow with raw  punk-esque garage metal.  It brought rock out of the spandex and back in  the hands of the people.  It resonated and it rocked.  I can't think of a  song on the whole album that I haven't screamed at the top of my lungs in  the car, at home, at school, at work...
B000002NC4|5.0|bar none, the finest bts album. the artistry in this masterpiece is  spellbinding. this album will make you cry from the beauty of it's melodies  and guitar work, if you give yourself over to the music. enjoy this record  and remember that things in this world are rarely pure, but this is one of  them.
B000002JS6|5.0|I was going to take the time &amp; write a nice review of this great album.But thinking about it just makes me want to kickback and CRANK THIS MOTHA UP!  I was 13 when &quot;Black&quot; was released,and 20 years later  it's still the greatest.Jeez, 20 FREAKING YEARS!  has it really been that  long! ....
B00004TL21|2.0|Deftones.  Cool name.  Cool sound.  Not as electronic as i was hoping, but hey it still sounds decent.  My one gripe is the pathetic songwriting.  &quot; taste you much better/off teeth taste/of white skin on red  leather/check the claws we got/night time cavity to come downtown&quot;  ~Korea.  Is it existential or moronic?  I think it depends on the amount of  illegal substances in readers bloodstream.  Fortunately, the music  overshadows the weak vocals to the point where they are ignorable.  One  song however does have cool lyrics.  Elite sports a cool riff where Moreno  loses it in a tantrum of yelling &quot;you'll bleed out of control&quot;  over and over.  Neat, i suppose.  But the novelty of that song is nullified  when you look over again and read a lyric like &quot;stop i'm drunk/ but  i'm off my knees/ the police stopped chasing/im her new cool meat/she pops  the trunk/and she removes me/and a machine that takes/pictures of us&quot;  ~feiticeira.  Music should be about artistic expression, poetry.  Not  random ideas juxtaposed to create a semblance of rhyme.
0671034065|4.0|If you like a little suspense and passion you will enjoy Mr. Perfect.  I found the characters human and enjoyable.  Ms. Howard put a twist in the end that I never expected.  Ms. Howard wrote a romantic suspense novel with  humor, sensitivity, and tension.  It isn't often I can read something that  will make my stomach curl with fright then hurt with laughter and all in a  few hours.
B00000JMQC|5.0|'Return to Oz' is a masterpiece. It has been my favourite movie since the first time I saw it. I recomend it to people of all ages. If you are a young child it takes you to a magical place deep within your imagination and if you are an adult it allows you to travel back in time and visit your  childhood becoming open to the idea of magic and fantasy, even though you  think that it does'nt exist. 'Return to Oz' is the enchanting story of a  young girl who strives to make the fantasy world she is living in become  reality. It includes many loveable characters such as the Scarecrow, Tin  man and Cowardly Lion from the original movie, 'The Wizard of Oz' as well  as many new ones, such as Jack Pumpkinhead, a stick man with a pumpkin for  a head and Gump a flying sofa and Tic Toc a wind up mechanical man. However  no story is complete without the villains and in this movie there are  plenty. The Wheelers are men who have wheels for hands and feet and they  work for Princess Mombi an evil woman who has over 30 different heads and  last but not least the Nome King, a man made of rock. And who tries to stop  these evil beings, Dorothy.  In this movie Dorothy is played by Fairuza  Balk. (The Craft, The Waterboy) But in this movie Dorothy trades in her  much loved Toto for her talking chicken, Billina. Return to Oz is a magical  film for the child in everyone and if you loved 'The Wizzard of Oz' or even  if you did'nt you WILL love 'Return to Oz'. So buy the video it will be  money well spent. Who said money could'nt buy happiness.
B00003CX6P|1.0|I can't beleive how bad this movie was.  It's been a while since I have seen such bad acting and direction.  There are few things I regret in life, and watching this movie is one of them.  How did Gwyneth ever win an Oscar  anyway?  People, news flash! SHE CAN'T ACT!   And Matt Damon isn't much  better.  I'm sure this review will get lost among all of the reviews that  are giving this movie five stars.  All I have to say is that I am very glad  I don't know any of the people writing those reviews.  If I can save just  one person from wasting two hours of their life on this movie, I will be  content.
B000002KIE|5.0|No Sex Pistols, no punk rock.  It's that simple.  When Bollocks came out, it ignited a movement and became THE standard to which all other punk rock records were held.  The Pistols are the trunk of the punk rock tree.   Everything else is just a branch:  Nirvana, Green Day, The Clash, Gang  of Four, Buzzcocks, Dead Kennedys, everything.  If you like music with  attitude, this is your record.  Bollocks is protest music in a league with  anything by Bob Dylan or Public Enemy.  Period.
B000002KON|5.0|And that's a good thing cause on this album (The Kinks' last GREAT album) they just rock in such an assured and rolicking manner that you'd think the 70's would've been their decade. This album has in my opinion one of the  most heartbreakingly beautiful songs of all time &quot;Young and Innocent  Days&quot;, never has a lyric and song complemented each other so  beautifully, it will honestly make your heart ache. Other moments of sheer  genius include &quot;Shangri-La&quot;,&quot;Drivin'&quot;(&quot;We've  plenty of beer&quot;)and  &quot;Australia&quot; not just that but the  concept actually holds up! Anyhoo just get this classic!
B00000K3UR|4.0|Adam Sandler is one hilarious actor, &amp; this is no exception. The movie is really great, &amp; worthwhile, too. In certain areas', it can get sort of repetitive, but nonetheless, very funny. I do recommend this, although  not that appropriate too children under 8.                                                                                                                                   My friend also saw this movie, said that it was  repetitive, dull, and very steryotipical. She applauded it, though, for at  least having homosexuals in it, and not making fun of them. But my friend  dissapproved of the little child cursing.                                                             I decided that I would offer any readers two very  different thoughts, to give more variety.
B000004286|5.0|Solo hay que escuchar este compact disc para que en el momento se nos  vengan a la cabeza las imagenes impresionantes de la pelicula. Es el mejor  Soundtrack de una pelicula que he escuhado en mi vida, y en todo momento se  hace sentir en forma fisica lo que fue ver la pelicula por primera vez.  Cada uno de los instrumentos que acompaan esta obra nos lleva hasta  Escocia, siendo el mas representativo la Gaita que de a poco se va asomando  y nos hace emocionar. Al ser las mismas piezas las cuales se repiten a lo  largo de la obra de James Horner con distintos instrumentos, al mismo de  tiempo de escuhar una calidad musical distinta, podemos escuchar distintas  versiones de la misma pieza.  En pocas palabras, una obra maestra, no por  nada fue nominada al Oscar por la musica que la acompao.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The DVD version is excellent. This movie has it all- great acting,war, romance, historical plot, fantastic scenery,wonderful background music, I could go on, but see  it to enjoy it.
0380002930|5.0|I see that there are already a great number of reviews on this book.  I just figured I would throw my two cents in anyway.  I promise to make this brief -- This is the greatest book ever written (with the exception of the  bible of course).  I don't care if you don't like reading at all, buy this,  and you'll be on page 100 before the night's up!
B000002TYK|3.0|I listened to this album after Colour and Shape. Get this one first. This  album is ok but the only really good songs are &quot;Big me&quot; and  &quot;This is a call&quot; (which is too damn short! ARGH!). Pay a couple  of bucks for it at a used cd store and it'll seem like a lot better album.
6305265488|5.0|There are two things I love about this movie. First, it is beautiful.  The actors are beautiful (especially Dougray Scott).  The costumes are beautiful.  The scenery is beautiful.  Watching this movie, makes me feel  as if I am part of the fairytale.  Second, this is a great twist on the  Cinderella story.  We see a girl who has been beaten down in almost all  aspects of her life, but does not allow her spirit to be beaten.  Trying to  save one of her beloved servants (though she has become a servant herself)  she goes to court to free him, also meeting the prince.  He is, of course,  smitten, and she keeps up a masquerade of a lady, in order to continue  seeing him.  The story follows the basics of the Cinderella tale (slipper,  wicked stepmother), but in this case, we have a Cinderella who doesn't need  a prince to save her, just to love her for who she is.  In any case, this  is a wonderful movie.  Problems are resolved quickly, and in the end,  everyone gets their just desserts.
B000002GEY|4.0|A classic Supertramp. Probably the one with most well known tunes (The  Logical Song, Breakfast in America). As usual with Supertramp, the Roger  Hodgson tracks are more pop oriented (particularly in this album) and the  Rick Davies ones are more jazzy/bluessy both with a progressive feel. Do  not expect progressive epics as in previous albums. A must have for Prog  Rock fans and also for music lovers in general.<br />Hidden masterpiece: Track  8 - Just Another Nervous Wreck
0812589041|4.0|This is a difficult book to review, because everything really depends on the &quot;surprise&quot; near the end; lets just say this: While it is full of excitement and suspense, the story is a challenge to BOTH militaristic  patriots AND to absolute pacifists. Read it just for adventure, if you want  to; or, read it for the message (or, messages) and ask: Was this right?  Card was once asked why he wrote a war story with children; he answered:  &quot;Because that's who send off to war -- children.&quot;
B00000GAIW|5.0|Ahhhhh! Aqualung is one of Jethro Tull´s best albums (if not the best) and one of the best Prog Rock albums ever. Is the first album of Jethro Tull´s golden age (the most prog oriented one). The music is hard but virtuous.  The album has no bad moments, is strong from the very beginning to the end.  The mix of hard rock-oriented passages of music with soft guitar-based  ballads is excellent. And of course, Ian Anderson´s flute playing is  superb. The lyrics are also very interesting. If you like Jethro Tull, BUY  IT! (hard to believe that a Jethro Tull lover do not have this album yet  but, just in case...) If you like Prog Rock, BUY IT! If you want to know  what Jethro Tull is about, BUY IT! If you are none of the above be aware  that this kind of music is hard to listen the first time. Give this album  several tries.<br />Hidden Masterpiece: Track 3 - Cheap Day Return
0152023984|5.0|Easy enough for a child, with issues profound enough for a college philosophy professor; easy enough to read if you are sick and tired; worth paying attention to if you are wide awake and vigorous. Somewhere, in this  lovely book, you will find yourself.
B000002O3I|5.0|I heard &quot;smokestack lightnin'&quot; when I was a kid and never forgot  it, it was that haunting.  Decades later I remembered it and Howlin Wolf  and I'm glad I did.  You will be too. This is not over-produced studio  blues. This is the real thing, warts and all and it is truly beautiful in  its purity. R.L. Burnside has his place and it is fun, but this is the real  thing.
B00000K31V|4.0|Wow!  This is all that can be said about this video.  It's a must have for any si-fi fan, and I recomend it even if you are not.
0451191153|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down.  Considering the length of it, this shows how interesting it was.<br />There were 5 main characters, Howard Roark, Dominique Francon, Peter Keating, Gail Wynand and Ellsworth  Toohey.  Each character was well developed in a sense that once you were  in their head you knew what they were going to do next, with one exception.  I felt Dominique Francon's character was frequently inconsistent and her  motivations at times pretty muddy.<br />The book takes you from before Howard  and Peter finish college until about 20 years later.  The story parallels  these two men's careers as architects.  They covered the architecture  aspect just enough so you could see where the argument was but, not to the  point where it would lose the readers.  In this aspect, you are under no  doubt that Howard is passionate about his craft and Peter is merely giving  it lip service.  Peter is into architecture as an end to a means.  It has  the pontential of making him popular.  Most of the disputes in architecture  center around the traditional versus modernistic view point.  Traditional  meaning keeping to the Greek Porticos and decorative features of the past  versus a style more centered on function.  Howard is dedicated to the fact  that form should fit function.<br />Mostly this book centers on the inner  lives of the characters and the forces that affect their personal  decisions.<br />Howard is an end to himself, where Peter does not exist  unless someone else is in the room.  These two characters choices are  about as opposite as can be found.<br />Ellsworth Toohey, whom is  mentioned in passing early on, gets further developed later in the book and  provides a manipulating force in Peter's life &amp; that of many others.  This character early in his life discovered the two extremes of  personalities as Howard and Peter and has discovered the secret of using  the &quot;Peter Keatings&quot; of the world.<br />Gail Wynand is an even  more complex character than Ellsworth in the sense that he at one point in  time stood alone, but at some point due to some various situations in his  youth, became power hungry and decided on a similar path as Ellsworth  Toohey.  However, he never quite consciously made this choice and really  was almost unaware of the path he chose &amp; his dependency on the people  he controlled.<br />Dominique Francon, never really gets developed to the same  point as the male characters.  Early on as a co-worker to Ellsworth Toohey  and the daughter of Peter's employer, she is shiftless and comes across as  just spiteful.  You are not sure if she is a Toohey disciple or worse.  Later on in her dealing with Howard, Peter and Gail, her motives and logic  are still a bit ill defined.  I think Ayn Rand was negligent in giving her  female character's the necessary development in the book for her to be  understood.  Considering that she wrote this in the 1930s and 40s and the  fact that the character had 3 husbands, this may have been the furthest she  dared to go, lest the reading audience would unnecessarily focus on  that.<br />Much of this book is dialogue between the characters, you have to  follow it closely.  Some of Ellsworth Toohey's one on ones with the various  characters make you think of the many political speeches we hear every day.  Then, when you consider the black heart of the character, it is  frightening.<br />I think a person in their teens and 20s would walk away from  this book with a different take than one in their 40s, as I am.  An  idealistic 20 year old still believes there are these singular characters  out there like Howard and Peter, etc.  They would get quickly discouraged  with others and themselves, when they walked away from this book.  An older  person would recognize that most people have of blend of characters and  these change with time.  Then, one can only hope that we have more Howard  than Peter &amp; hope we are not deluding ourselves like Gail Wynand.<br />An  excellent book, I am under no doubt why it is a classic.ourselves like Gail Wynand.<br />An  excellent book, I am under no doubt why it is a classic.
B000002PBL|5.0|If you enjoy Tom Petty's music, you simply can't go wrong with &quot;Hard Promises;&quot; some might even contend that Petty and his band have never sounded better than on this album in 1981.  The drab cover shot of Tom  Petty in a record shop typifies his non-glamorous style, yet his music has  held up solidly from the very beginnning.  His tunes grab you with their  tunefulness and hooks instantaneously, and his ability to make songwriting  seem so effortless is unrivaled.  Amazingly, no two Tom Petty songs usually  ever sound that much alike, despite his unchanging style.<br />As for the  actual songs on this great album, it's hard to go wrong with the leadoff  80's gem, &quot;The Waiting,&quot; yet the album boasts even better songs.  As usual, the lyrics are hard luck, the sound much brighter.  &quot;Nightwatchman,&quot; however, is a Tom Petty shot at humor and  observation, a truly funny and astute song.  His vocals sound great all  over, yet particularly shine on &quot;Something Big,&quot; where a tinge of  typical Petty country-type sounds seep in.  This album features its share  of feel-good tunes as well, like on the bold sound of &quot;Kings  Road,&quot; where Petty flashes that classic jangly rock and roll that  sounds perfect in the car as you're driving too fast on a beautiful day.  &quot;Kings Road&quot; would sound awesome live, and actually is a  precursor to future Petty classics off the album &quot;Learning to  Fly.&quot;  &quot;Letting You Go&quot; is an endearing 60's style breakup  song, containing bleak lyrics, yet featuring another feel-good type sound.  The awesome &quot;A Thing About You&quot; keeps up the frollicking rock and  roll pace, with an immensely catchy chorus and a rocking/honky tonk sound;  check out Petty really letting loose on the guitars midway through.  &quot;Insider&quot; is a very pretty ballad with Stevie Nicks contributing  her perfect accompanying vocals, upping the true emotion in the song and  blending perfectly with Petty's own emotional voice.  With greats like  &quot;Insider,&quot; it's hard to believe only one hit escaped this album.  Even second rate Petty tunes like &quot;The Criminal Kind&quot; - with its  lazy slide guitar and observational lyrics - have an engaging quality that  appeals to many people.<br />&quot;Hard Promises&quot; ends dramatically  with another emotional gem, &quot;You Can Still Change Your Mind.&quot;  With such insightful and passionate lyrics, it's inexplicable why critics  over the years have blasted Petty's words as being trite and meaningless.  I happen to think he writes some of the best lyrics in the history of rock  and roll.  As I said, if you're looking for classic music, pick this one  up.y with Petty's own emotional voice.

6304196784|5.0|Congratulations to the American Film Institute for recognizing the hilarity of this movie and voting it one of the 100 Funniest Movies. I saw &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; at the theater when it was first released  and my friend and I laughed so loudly that we were almost asked to leave.   It's just a great at home...plus people won't stare at you.  <br />The  performances of all four leads are exceptional, not just Kevin Kline's  Oscar-winning Otto (&quot;It means eight&quot;).  I've been a fan of John  Cleese and Michael Palin forever and, whether Python fan or not, they'll  have you rolling on the floor.  Palin's stutter is brilliant especially  when he's trying to tell Cleese the name of the hotel (&quot;Sing it, Ken!   Sing it!&quot;).  John Cleese is subtle and surprisingly real (I know, I  was surprised too) and Jamie Lee Curtis is terrific.<br />In this age of  Political correctness, it's fun to watch a movie that doesn't take itself  too seriously.  This movie is what a comdey movie should be: hysterically  funny.
0399143904|5.0|This book was so superbly written it stunned me. The way clancy meticulously describes every detail made you very anxious. I could not put this book down and read it in 3 days. 740 pages of pure genius. Some might  say clancy is strange, crazy, or the like. I agree completely, which is why  his work interests so many people. Some of his work is so frightening is  actually scares you (LIKE THIS). If you want me to tell you one book to  read, definetly this one, no doubt about it!
0767819179|3.0|Jeff Bridges was darling in the movie.  I know he is a professional and would probably never say anything; but, I bet Babs was a real pain to work with....like insisting on being filmed only from one side.  Please!   Another actress cast in the lead would have made a much better film.
B000021XR5|4.0|Well this album is really good considering the 3 year hiatus that Stone  Temple Pilots had and also considering all the rumors that they were no  longer in existence.  Scott and the boys are back and are definitely going  strong!  As a fan, I love this album because it combines all the different  types of sounds heard on their three previous albums: the original grunge  of Core, the more refined and extremely popular Purple, and the down to  earth melodies of Tiny Music.  Definitely a good one for that combination,  but not their best album ever. The best tracks on the CD are Down, Heaven  and Hotrods, Glide, Sour Girl and Atlanta.  Those are the ones that you  will never be able to get enough of, especially on Atlanta and Sour Girl.   Definitely LOVE this one!
0553277472|5.0|A review of this book by me, or even a thoughtful critique,could add nothing to what has been so well-said in the numerouseloquent essays among the 200 below. Among the decisively best dozen, reviewer Barron T. Laycock, only a few reviews below, describes &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; about as well as it need be done. Another finely-drawn perspective is provided immediately below by reviewer Cicha1994, who gets to the bottom of Pirsig's magic of delivering an incredibly complex synthesis with timely spoonfuls of sugar thusly:<br />&quot;Mr. Pirsig has an uncanny sense of timing, and he never allows the heavier passages to labor on too long. This is avoided by craftily interspersing his philosophical discourse amongst very down-to-earth and charming observations made during a motorcycle trip ...&quot;<br />Not daring to venture into the rarified air of the erudite reviews already here, I humbly offer a more fundamental observation, one that is &quot;down-to-earth as fertilizer,&quot; as we say.<br />How I came to read this book the first time -- of how many? -- I can't imagine. I have no interest in Zen, never owned a motorcycle and so needed no advice about keeping one humming. What I found I did have very strong interests in was everything Persig had to say.<br />&quot;Zen and the Art...&quot; was an immediate best-seller when it was published 26 years ago. That couldn't have inspired my interest in it, for I have instinctive misgivings about best-sellers. But I did read it and have been all the better for it. Every subsequent reading has opened a little door or niche missed before. <br />Call any used book store and mention of &quot;Zen and the Art...&quot; and you'll get immediate recognition of it, often a comment like, &quot;Oh, yeah. That Robert Persig book. No, we can't keep them.&quot; Still selling like crazy, after all these years.<br />There is a positively bone-chilling aspect about &quot;Zen and the Art...&quot;. The millions whohave read this supreme intellectual and artistic masterpiece -- many, many of whom, like me, were profoundly enriched by it -- came perilously close to being denied the experience. If memory serves, Persig's manuscript was rejected 122 times before William Morrow picked it up (probably after having also rejected it a few times). That says volumes about the dismal state of publishing back then, an industry that is in even blacker depths today.
B000002WU9|5.0|If you don't have this album in your collection, seriously, either you  don't like hip-hop or there's something wrong with you. This is a timeless  classic.<br /> I'm not even going to begin to describe why every track is  dope, cuz I'd literally be here all night. Incarcerated Scarfaces, Glaciers  Of Ice, Ice Cream, Wu Gambinos, Heaven &amp; Hell, etc...they're ALL  classics. But if I had to choose two favorite tracks off of here (I could  never choose just one), they'd be Rainy Dayz and Verbal Intercourse.<br />  Rainy Dayz is so smooth it'll give you chills....I remember the first time  I heard this track, I played it over and over again, and just like the  whole album, it never gets tiring or old.<br /> Verbal Intercourse lets us  hear with our own ears the transformation of Nasty Nas to Nas Escobar, and  Esco fails to dissappoint. Everything about this track is beyond  classic--the unbelievable beat and the flawless flows of Nas, Rae, &amp;  Ghost combine to make this one of my personal favorite tracks of all time.<br /> Now enough reading this review, BUY THIS  ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW!
B00000I8UD|5.0|Warm liquid comfort enters the soul when listening to this album.  It is  at once uplifting, contemplative, and sensual.  First we hear the opening  track of &quot;I Surrender&quot; and it beckons us to surrender to the calm  and enlightening melodies that follow.  Spiritual stories and personal  insights make up the lyrics, including a Hindu morning prayer set to  Sylvian's ambient music sung by his spiritual teacher, Shree Ma.   Sakamoto's orchestral backgrounds provide the dark and full underlinings of  the album that set off the melodies beautifully.  Both easy-listening and  complexly layered at the same time, it makes for a CD to which you can make  love, relax, do hobbies, drive, or have a personal introspection.  One's  life can be greatly improved by owning this CD.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Limp Bizkit, who's that?  Nobody knew of them until they appeared on stage  on year at MTV's spring break.  They got up on stage and sung a little  cover of George Michael's Faith, and everyone thought, hmm . . . not bad.   A few years later, and with their second album, Limp Bizkit is blazing up  the charts with singles like Nookie and Rearranged.  Though this album is a  lot lighter than the Jonathan Davis (lead singer of Korn) inspired first  album, it is still a good listen all the way through.  Fred Durst knows how  to bust a lyric and Wes Borland can create a killer bass chord (a good  example is Rearranged).  Though you may like the hard and heavy music of  the first album, this album has a lot more musicality to it.  It is a good  buy, and worth putting in your discman while jogging or riding a bike.
6305892806|3.0|This is a clever, boisterous, and cheeky film.  It is extremely well-photographed, and, for its purposes, well cast and well written.  The trouble is, it isn't Mansfield Park.  Fanny Price isn't Fanny Price, Sir  Thomas isn't Sir Thomas, and Jane Austen isn't Jane Austen.  The outline of  the plot is there, but it is an altogether different reading from the book.   Rozema has incorporated (or crammed) some of Austen's letters and  juvenilia into the character of Fanny, and has created a heroine who is  neither Fanny Price nor Jane Austen.  Throughout the film the viewer barely  gets a whiff of Jane Austen's wit and style.  What we see more often is  what may pass for the author's subtext, and still more often Rozema's  superimposed contemporary interpretation.  It amounts to a contemporary  study of Mansfield Park, and how much you like it will be largely  determined by how much you like contemporary values and mores; those in the  film are not those of Jane Austen.  If you like the movie, it doesn't  necessarily mean that you will like the book, or Jane Austen.  I think the  director/screenwriter is more fond of her own ideas about Jane Austen than  of Jane Austen herself.  Some have suggested that this is how Austen would  have written it if she lived in our day.  Quite frankly, Mansfield Park  (the book) could not have been written in our day by anybody.  I am sure  that Austen would not approve of her most moral novel being displayed in  such a comparatively raucous tone (more like the tone of the condemned  Lovers' Vows), nor would she wish it to be a vehicle for feminist themes.   By the time Miss Crawford's true character is revealed, so little attention  has been paid to morality that she does not sufficiently shock.  For my  part, the heroine constantly winking, as it were, at the audience, was  rather off-putting.  I saw it because my curiosity could not be satisfied  any other way.  It is, however, an interesting movie to see, but not before  you've readthe book.
158234082X|3.0|Chef is a very funny guy for a little while but his humor grew stale.  The book started out very nicely but descended into an insiders tell all that became confusing and pointless.  The chapters on how to cook and  terminology we almost worth the price.  But mentioning names of dishes so  esoteric that few understand them much less differentiate good from bad was  waaay too inside.  I got the feeling that near the end that chef was naming  names of friends as some sort of payback like &quot;hey I'll mention you in  my book if you come work for me again.&quot;<br />I was glad to finish it, and  also glad to know chef didn't end up dead of an overdose, which seems like  a miracle.  His best days in cooking and writing remain in front of  him.<br />He may run a fine two star room but his book became a one star read.

Paul Newman is Cool to the Bone as is George Kennedy.Paul Newman is a Can't miss in this Film.He handles the Film from start to finish.as Cliche' as this might sound it's one of those roles  he was born to play.the Chain Gang isn't the same with Cool Hand Luke  around.a must see film.very well Acted&amp;Directed.
0316234753|5.0|This book is a lot of fun for kids (and, I imagine, kids and their parents)--I remember it well from my childhood.  The Emberley books use about two dozen simple shapes (dots, lines, right and equilateral  triangles, and so on) to draw a wide variety of animals, vehicles,  monsters, and any number of other things.  The drawings are demonstrated  step by step, with witty twists and variations.  One strong suggestion:   the drawings come out a lot better if you use colored pencils, since the  demonstration drawings in the books are printed in color.
B00000J6AG|2.0|Extremely basic, and fairly sad effort all in all. The fact that it's so popular just proves how bad pop music has become and how little people actually listen to music. Because you really listened to this album you  wouldn't hear alot! <br />Worst of all you can hear the plagerism in all the  songs.<br />But it's catchy and makes people happy so i give in minor credit.
B000002KNY|5.0|...for a number of reasons.  First, Byrne's sense of witty paranoia in regards to everyday situations and objects comes across so beautifully.  Some of these songs are in fact unforgettable for their lyrics alone; for example Paper and most certainly Animals (\\"animals think they're pretty smart / sh** on the ground, see in the dark\\"...it is indeed half hilarious and half downright disturbing to hear someone get so upset about animals \\"living on nuts and berries\\")!  Naturally, when Byrne writes about drug experiences (\\"Memories Can't Wait\\" and, of course, \\"Drugs\\"), he captures the experience of a very BAD trip quite effectively - just listening to Drugs in particular makes me feel like my mind has been violated.  Byrne sings \\"I feel mean, I feel OK\\" so unconvincingly you almost feel like you had better find a sober person who can calm him down right away. <br />Second, on no other album do the Heads so brilliantly walk a fine line between pop music and inaccessible avant-garde.  You will want to sing along with \\"I Zimbra\\", a song whose lyrics are completely incomprehensible because they are from a made-up language! <br />Third, the musicians are all in top form.  Any fan of the bass guitar is going to be highly intrigued by Tina's playing.  I don't know where/how she ever came up with such original bass lines.  On songs like Mind, I listen to the interplay between Tina and Byrne and think, \\"This doesn't sounds like it should make much sense to the human ear but it sounds so good!\\" <br />This is a fantastic album and a great place to start with the Heads if you are new!  Get it!
B000001GKC|4.0|In 1883, about 6 weeks before Wagner died, Anton Bruckner arrived at his  home with a morose thought:  the Master did not have long to live.  Bruckner wrote that that the great Richard Wagner would soon rendevous with  his grave &quot;made me very sad&quot;.  The emotions Bruckner experienced  formed the impetus of the 2nd movement of his 7th symphony.  The main theme  is played by a quartet of Wagner tubas (Bruckner utilized Wagner tubas in  each of his last 3 symphonies - 7,8 &amp; 9). The coda was written during  Wagner's last days &amp; also shortly after his death.  It is not a  coincidence, I think, that it became such a somber adagio;  one can hear  just how deeply moved Bruckner was by the passing of his guiding force and  mentor.  It is, I believe, one of the most passionate and hauntingly  beautiful pieces of music ever written.<br />This is the 2nd best recording of  this symphony that I have heard.  The #1 performance also belongs to the  Vienna Philharmonic, conducted by Mario Carlo Giulini in the 1980's.  Sadly, however, that Deutsche Grammophon recording is out of print.  I used  to have a Chicago Symphony Orchestra CD of this work conducted by Solti,  but both the present and Guilini's performance blow that one out of the  water.<br />As for technicalities, I did not like Karajan's tempo in the coda  of the adagio;  I thought it sounded a bit &quot;rushed.&quot; A few other  parts were a bit overly-dramtic when Bruckner would have liked a bit more  subtelty The recording itself is digitally done &amp; is quite remarkable.  It is also the last CD Karajan made before he died. (kind of fitting, I  think).<br />The motif of the first movement came to Bruckner in a dream;  he  got up in the middle of the night, lit a candle, wrote it down, then went  back to bed.  The scherzo is unremarkable.  The 4th movement has some fine,  majestic moments to close out the symphony.  However, the #1 factor which  makes this work so wonderful is the lyrical, stirring adagio.  Get out  &amp; buy this CD, all you Wagner fans.  This one is for the Master.....and  you...g adagio.  Get out  &amp; buy this CD, all you Wagner fans.  This one is for the Master.....and  you...
B0000256E1|4.0|I would like to let the public know that the translation of &quot;Du Hast Mich&quot; is &quot;You Have Me&quot; (as in, You have me a question and I have no answer, roughly translated)  This is sometimes comfused with  &quot;Du Hasst Mich&quot;, which sounds the same but means &quot;You Hate  Me&quot;.  Part of the problem is the  English translation says &quot;You  Hate Me&quot; (incorrectly) as well as changing some of the other lyrics.   This is my only complaint of the album.
0792842731|4.0|I took a chance again and bought `Tomorrow Never Dies' and was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it every bit as much as `Goldeneye'. Given what a disgrace `The World Is Not Enough' was, I was very reticent to pony up the  dough for another Bond film, but my feeling paid off. This the second of  the Pierce Brosnan Bond films, and is a very slick look at the world of  international media, but instead of news companies faking events in order  to sell papers or get more people watching the news on TV, Carver Media  goes to extreme measures to create the news, and in most cases since they  know a certain event will happen, they always get the scoop and the  exclusive, guaranteeing the high ratings, and of course, revenue generating  by those ratings. It's a neat idea, really, and `Tomorrow Never Dies' does  an excellent job in turning it into a story.<br /> I am not a huge Bond  fan, but I like Pierce Brosnan, mostly because he fits my image of who I  think James Bond should be. It also doesn't hurt that Brosnan is probably  the most talented actors to take on the role. I only wish the rumors had  been true and he took the reigns in the late eighties after the end of  Remington Steele instead of waiting until 1994 to do `Goldeneye'.<br />  Bond is set up as a banker so that he can infiltrate Carver's big media  party where he meets Paris Carver (Teri Hatcher), who is stale toast in a  nice evening dress. She and James have a past, and something that upsets  Carver to no end, and upon learning that Bond is actually British Secret  Service, sets up their demise by killing Paris then having James find her.  This is pretty evil, and guarantees that Carver gets to die in a really  messy fashion.<br /> One of the most important things in any successful  Bond film is the villain, which is why `The World is Not Enough' is so  weak, Robert Carlyle's character was about as threatening as Moneypenny on  a bad hair day. Carver (Jonathan Pryce) comes across as an over-excited  teenager with too many toys, spoiled and powerful, he is decidedly creepy.  As Carver he heads the Carver Cable Media Group, which is sort of the  Microsoft of the TV world. A ruthless company with so much money that  Carver, with the aid of a Chinese general, build a stealthy ship that they  use to sink a British missile frigate and steal one of its nuclear cruise  missiles.<br /> The theft is staged in such a fashion that it will be  blamed on the Chinese and ensuring the British will get involved. James has  48 hours to uncover all of this and put a stop to it. By the end of that  time the British Navy will be off China's coast, at which point Carver  plans to launch the stolen missile into Peaking and make it look as though  the British have launched a nuclear strike on China and starting what will  almost certainly become the third world war. CCMG will of course be there  to get the exclusive on the story, just like they did when the British  frigate sank. It's a contrived plot, but it has a nice intricacy to it that  nicely delineates Carver's insanity and the lengths he's willing to go to  in order to make news.<br /> The other of the so-called `Bond Women' is  Michelle Yeoh, who makes up for Hatcher in more ways than I can count. This  charming, almost elfin woman is one of the bigger female Hong Kong cinema  stars, and plays perky and aggressive Chinese operative Mai Lei (Uh-huh).  With the grace of a cat she routinely stays with Bond, and occasionally one  step ahead of him even though they are essentially on the same mission. And  while she is of course attracted to Mr. Bond, she would rather tease and  leave him handcuffed to a metal pipe than let him know. She also single  handedly beats up a bunch of thugs, finishing just before Bond arrives to  rescue her, (You go, girl!).<br /> So, of the Brosnan Bond movies,  `Goldeneye' and `Tomorrow Never Dies' are well worth your attention, `The  World Is Not Enough', the film that tells us weapons grade plutonium can be  carried in one's hands and you can fight next to an open reactor without  suffering the ill effects of both intense heat and hard radiation, isn't  worth the celluloid it was shot on. `Tomorrow Never Dies' also has some of  the best action sequences that I have ever seen in a Bond film, a decent  villain, and in the case of Michelle Yeoh, a dynamite leading lady. Go for  it, you know you want to.
B00002MZ12|3.0|Alanis Morissette is one of my favorite artists although I really didn't  get into her music until the beginning of this year. Not surprising since I  was eleven when she first came out. Anyways,this was the first album of  hers I got. I really wanted a CD with &quot;You Oughta  Know&quot;,&quot;Ironic&quot;,and &quot;Uninvited&quot; on it. I was really  looking forward to hearing &quot;You Oughta Know.&quot; I was disappointed  when I heard it,though. It was more of a relaxed version with piano and  strings. The piano added a nice touch,but I really wanted to hear the  aggresiveness. The &quot;You Learn&quot; and &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; is  really good on here,but if you want a really good Alanis album without  crowd noise and more spunk,purchase the classic Jagged Little Pill.
B000003S5H|5.0|think of enough to say about this album, except that it's lovely and it  doesnt grow stale like so many other records can and do. air has become o  so trend-eh these days, but i suppose there's reason for it. they cover a  fair range of styles, and they can do pink floyd better than pink floyd  does (i.e. la voyage de penelope). femme d'argent is probably the standout  track, sadly, you may remember it from l'oreal commercials a while back.  still, it's a cd worth adding to your collection.
6300213714|5.0|I've seen a lot of movies in my time, &quot;The Warriors&quot; is by far the best movie ever made, and that's no idle exaggeration.<br />You know those new Nike commercials featuring &quot;communiques&quot; by &quot;Mrs.  Jones&quot;?  Ripped off straight from The Warriors.  I'm surprised that  Walter Hill doesn't sue.  The so-called &quot;Mrs. Jones&quot; is clearly  based on the radio DJ in &quot;The Warriors&quot; who seems to work for the  Bronx's top gang, the Gramercy Park Riffs, by coordinating the efforts of  all the gangs in New York (except the pathetic Orphans -- &quot;they're not  in our network&quot;) to hunt down and destroy the renegade Warriors for  supposedly gunning down the gangsta messiah Cyrus.<br />Talk about ahead of  its time!  Most people dismiss the Warriors offhand as a campy, old-school  action movie with a shallow, unrealistic plot glamorizing gang life.  But  upon the fifth in-depth viewing or so, one begins to realize that nothing  could be further from the truth.  For instance, how many of those who've  seen the movie know that it was based on a highly political novel by  radical activist Sol Yurick?  How many have pondered the historical  significance of the name &quot;Cyrus&quot;?  Or the fact that &quot;The  Warriors&quot; has brief, uncredited appearances by celebrities like Tony  Danza, Geddy Lee of Rush, and Todd Bridges (Willis from Different Strokes)?<br />In fact, &quot;The Warriors&quot; brims with astute social commentary  on the nature of class, urban decay and social change in 1970s America.  No  moment in cinematic history is more transcendent than the movie's final,  poetic climax on a Coney Island beach after an all-night chase and ordeal.  It makes one feel exhausted but passionately tranquil, as if one had just  stayed up all night to make love, fight a duel, and write a brilliant  master's thesis all at the same time.<br />And what's more amazing is that  Walter Hill went on to make such crappy films as &quot;Geronimo,&quot;  considering the cinematic genius of &quot;The Warriors&quot;.  Forget all  that other old-school jive like &quot;Shaft&quot;.  Once you watch the  first few minutes of &quot;The Warriors&quot; and feast your eyes upon the  gang of guys that look like mimes, not to mention the gang of guys that  look like Cooter and Uncle Jesse combined (but wearing roller skates) in  the unforgettable opening montage-shot of all the various gangs getting on  subways and converging for Cyrus' big speech, you will be hooked  forever.<br />Epilogue: I met Joe Walsh of the Eagles in 1992, and he claimed  to not even remember contributing a song for &quot;The Warriors'&quot;  soundtrack.

6304458223|5.0|FLy Away Home is one of the few movies that can inspire people. It shows people who truly care about animals and want to help them.  This movie is Directed to perfection by Carroll Ballard(The Black Stallion). He is one of  the most talented directors around. When he and Caleb Deschanel, the  cimomentropher, team up their is no better duo in hollywood. Caleb also did  The black Stallion.   this movie is one of the most beautifully acted  movies I have ever seen.  Jeff Daniels performs the dad with amazing  sensitivity and depth. this was his best and most serious performance.   Anna Paquin is phenomenol as the daughter. She captures the emotional shock  of lossing a loved one with what seems a minimal amount of effort. Paquin  herself seems to evolve with her character, as the film progresses. Paquin  proves that she will be a staying power in hollywood. Paquin has a natural  acting ability that few posess. Daniels and Paquin are the best  father-daughter duo to come around in a long time.  They understood each  other and their characters. They click the moment they are on screen  together. The film is wonderful and you can't help loving it. This film  reaches to a big audience and is definently an instant classic.  This is a  movie you will WANT to see many times over!  Bravo to everyone who helped  make it, you should be proud. The only problem with the DVD is That IT IS  NOT IN WIDESCREEN!  ALL of CARROLL BALLARD'S FILMS ARE MENT TO BE SEEN  THAT WAY!  BUT SEE THE MOVIE ANYWAY DEFINENTLY!
6300214559|5.0|What is so compelling about a movie taken from history is that no matter how much we hope and pray, we cannot change the ending of the movie. And Lady Jane is one of these. We feel for the two young lovers so that we  would do anything to prevent the inevitable. Just knowing the fate of Lady  Jane almost reduced me to tears.<br /> The acting was superb, the scenery  stunning, and the costumes both lavish and breath-taking.<br /> And if *that*  doesn't tempt you enough, then I have two words to add. Cary Elwes. You may  remember him from The Princess Bride and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Not  only is he a terrific actor, but he gets the job done looking *incredible*.  He alone is reason enough to make this purchase.

All the songs are  simpley marvelous, including the one sthey haven't released, such as  &quot;Affirmation&quot;&quot;Chained TO You&quot; and especially  &quot;Gunning Down Romance&quot;. If you have their first album, you HAVE  to get this one!
6303168507|5.0|I can make that statement for a number of reasons. All in all it is a superb movie, practically a work of genius. The fact that it almost hurts to watch the movie only makes the impact stick more. This is the movie that  proved Steven Spielberg's status as a great director. I mean, come on,  which is better: ET or Schindler's List? The acting in this movie is  wonderful, and I congratulate the actors on doing such a wonderful job in  this movie. A great ensemble cast was needed to make this movie what it  should be. And I see absolutely nothing wrong with the choice of making the  film in black and white. Like many other people I think it made it much  better and deprived us of seeing the goriness of the Holocaust slaughter. I  really cannot think of anything bad to say about this film. I don't think  anyone can. It is truly one of the greatest works of art of all time.
0671027344|5.0|this book is great! nicely written but towards the middle you get the sense you're not reading letters from charlie but it turns into more of a novel. but still a great book! made me see how passive i was like charlie.  an eye opener! recommended!
B000001FMX|5.0|From the opening guitar chords, howls, and piano runs (Thank you Todd  Rundgeren) of &quot;Personality Crisis&quot; to the closing chorus of  &quot;Jet Boy&quot; the N.Y. Dolls have come up with the absolute blueprint  of what was to change popular music in five years time. <br />The Dolls were  the future of rock and roll and many critics refused to acknowledge their  warped and powerful message: Live life like it's a flash of light.<br />  Unfortunately that message is what led to their quick demise.<br />This disc  contains eleven of modern rock's most powerful tracks and no serious Punk  collector should be without it!
B00000IP3S|5.0|I heard about this strange metal band from Germany on a newsgroup about  king arthur.  I decided to check them out and I fell in love with them. The  music these guys put out is truly awsome and unique.  As a big arthurian  fan this album was my favorite, but I love them all (especially Nightfall)!
B00004RHZU|3.0|I like Pink because after I heard There You Go I thought she was the best  singer out. Then I got the entire CD. Well I still think Pink is a good  singer and has a good voice but I do't like her as much. If you liked There  You Go then you'll love this CD. I really really liked her third song, Most  Girls and the last one Is It Love?. There You go is the best song but some  songs sond too much alike each other. By the way I can't tell if she's  black or white will somebody tell me!?
0446310786|5.0|Having read this book 20 years or so ago in high school, I had a suggestion to try it again. I'm glad I did. The daily life of Scout Finch is described well. Characters Jem and Atticus Finch are good too. Add in  summer friend, Dill. Of course the daily activities include wondering on a  way to get the infamous Boo Radley out of his house. The trial of Tom  Robinson is also very interesting. The end result a really entertaining  story by Harper Lee.

0312853238|5.0|I have long felt that Orson Scott Card is the best writer in the genre of Science Fiction today.  This is without a doubt his masterpiece.  Card pulls you into the lives of all of his characters.  You see what they see,  you feel what they feel.  Ender's game examines the mind and emotions of  children equally well as it explore the same in adults.  Be prepared to  make a commitment of time and emotions to this book.
0694003611|5.0|At the risk of sounding redundant, &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; succeeds in entrancing every toddler (and every toddler's parent) who sees and hears it.  Unlike many other books suitable for children at an early linguistic  level, &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; manages to capture both adult and child  in its charms.  The repetitive structure never bores, as it constantly  surprises with its rhymes and subjects (I still laugh at the blank page  where it goes &quot;Goodnight nobody&quot;).  My daughter is now three, and  she isn't quite as excited by the book as she was when she started hearing  it at one, and when she insisted on it every night when she was two, but  she still likes to take it out every once in awhile.  I still love  &quot;Goodnight Moon,&quot; however, and look forward to reading it to my  next child, and to my grandchildren.  I only wish my mother had known about  this book when I was a child!
B000002TLX|5.0|I wasn't really much of a Richard Marx fan before I bought this cd.  I'd  always heard his songs on the radio and finally decided to get his greatest  hits record.  Every song on this cd is WONDERFUL - I just listen to it over  and over again.  Definetly worth buying!  HIGHLY recommended!!!!
6301969294|3.0|THE FOUNTAINHEAD's protagonist, Howard Roark, is loosely based on the life of maverick architect Frank Lloyd Wright, and many of Roark's buildings are patterned after Wright's works.<br />Howard Roark is a fiercely independent  architect who would prefer obscurity and anonymity over wealth and  popularity by not conforming to the common expectations of a collectivist  society.<br />Hollywood likes to make films based on best-selling books  because they come with a built-in audience. However, in the case of Ayn  Rand's epic; &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, translating a novel replete with  lengthy didactic speeches into a Hollywood blockbuster proved extremely  difficult, especially since Rand wrote the screenplay herself and insisted  that no dialogue be changed without her approval. The result, while a  failure at the box office, continues to be one of the most noteworthy of  American films.<br />The lasting power of the film lies not in the quality of  acting or cleverness of plot, but in the power of Rand's message: that all  progress and achievement come from the independent mind; and that NO one  should be forced to work for the &quot;common good&quot; or  conform to the  wishes of others.  It is this message to which all other elements of the  film are subordinated.<br />MOVIE SYNOPSIS<br />Roark meets architecture critic  Dominique Francon while she surveys her father's stone quarry. The two fall  in love but Roark suddenly leaves for New York to take a commission.  Dominique decides to marry Gail Wynand, the arrogant, rich publisher of  &quot; The Banner&quot;, a newspaper that delivers to the public what they  want to hear. Within these pages Roark is initially attacked for his  radical designs. Eventually Wynand realizes Roark's talents.<br />Peter  Keating, an unscrupulous architect, hires Roark to ghost-design a public  housing project for him. Roark agrees on the condition that the building be  built *exactly* as he designed it and never to be altered from his designs.  When it becomes clear that the plans were modified, Roark blows up the  unfinished buildings, preferring to go to jail than to see his vision and  his integrity compromised.<br />In the end, Roark heroically and symbolically  rises above society as the final shot zooms upward with the architect  perched above all else: his direction comes not from the opinions or values  or expectations of others, but from the integrity of his own inner vision,  values, and commitments;  and to keep faith within the best of oneself at  all costs.<br />ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br />Rather than define her characters, Rand  makes each one an analogy for different parts of her thesis ­ the conflict  between individualism and society's need for order and conformity: Roark  symbolizing freedom of choice, reason, human ability and achievment through  individual rights, political and economic freedom - while the ruthless  reporter Ellsworth Toohey represents the collectivist-socialist who  preaches self-sacrifice, altruism and charity as a means to power over  other human beings. Other characters represent varying degrees of the  theme; their role is to challenge Roark's strength and courage of mind. As  such, this film is a useful teaching tool for a discussion of Rand's  theory.  But behind the primary theme of individualism versus collectivism,  Rand also presented her readers and viewers with two other topics to  consider: the nearly absolute power of the media in a free capitalist  society, and the intricacies of romantic relationships between  uncompromising people.<br />IN CLOSING<br />Despite its failure with audiences  and critics, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; takes its place among the  literary classics as it forces us to confront and examine the role of the  individual in our society.<br />Henry David Thoreau's famous line, &quot;If a  man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears  a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however  measured or far away.&quot;hears, however  measured or far away.&quot;
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for destruction, the debut album of one of the greatest bands in history, is in the same vein as AC/DC's back in black. In my opinion it's their 2nd best album if you count Use Your Illusion I &amp; II as one album. Songs such as &quot;welcome to the jungle,&quot; &quot;sweet child  o' mine,&quot; and &quot;nightrain&quot; helped develop gn'r's reputation  as the worlds most dangerous band. But you must understand that unlike  bands such as motley crue and bon jovi, they lived the life. Before gnr  were signed, they lived in an abandoned tenement house infested with  roaches. But I digress. This is the cd to buy if you like slash's signature  guitar style and Axl(who sounds like the son of janis joplin) rose's voice.   Also to anyone who has a problem with axl, I have to say if you grew up in  an abusive family and the love of your life sue you for money you might  write some twisted lyrics yourself. everybody has parts of themselves that  the world doesn't like. Axl just doesn't hide his warts. everyone in the  music industry hates him because he doesn't have to sell out to make $57  million in 5 years.
B00000JCB2|4.0|I have read many reviews on this site that go on and on about how Durst  can't rap or write and how this is just the latest &quot;fad&quot; and how  its not really metal and not really rap and therefore is bad. Know what? I  don't care. I like the way this music sounds and that's all I care about.   Go ahead and buy this cd. It's fun and thats all that really matters.
B000002OX7|5.0|For anyone unfamiliar with The Who, I'd recommend starting with this and  the singles collection Meaty, Beaty, Big, and Bouncy.<br />At the time The Who  were working on this, synthesizers still weren't used much in rock (save  Emerson, Lake, and Palmer and other great progressive rock acts).  Pete  Townshend incorporates some innovative synthesizer work on &quot;Baba  O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;. <br />This album was  originally supposed to be a concept album entitled &quot;Lifehouse&quot;  but what came out instead are some of The Who's best songs.  The new  version includes an alternate take of &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;I  Don't Even Know Myself&quot;, and &quot;Pure and Easy&quot; (which were not  on the original album).<br />Their music began to have a harder edge to it in  the studio.  Pete wrote some his best lyrics at that point- anybody who's  been burned, disillusioned, or at the end of their rope can relate to songs  like &quot;Bargain&quot;, &quot;Love Ain't For Keeping&quot;, &quot;Behind  Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;Song Is over&quot;, and &quot;Fooled&quot;. <br />You  have bass player John Entwhistle's sole composition &quot;My Wife&quot;  (which features him on brass), Pete's power chords and intricate solos on  &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Fooled Again&quot;, Keith Moon's  maniacal drumming on &quot;Going Mobile&quot;, and Roger Daltrey's vocals  on most of the songs (he lets out a blood-curdling scream at the end of  &quot;Fooled Again&quot;), and guest Nicky Hopkins' melodious piano on  &quot;Song Is Over&quot; and &quot;Getting In Tune&quot;.<br />I look forward  to the release of The Lifehouse Sessions due later this year.
B00000ILDE|2.0|James &quot;I can find a way to make bigger budget movies than anybody&quot; Cameron put together a nice gore fest here, but that's about it as far as I'm concerned. Aliens is just bigger - bigger weapons, more  crew members, more and bigger aliens, big explosions, bigger gore; you get  the point. And people talk about the first one taking so long to get  started, but what about this one!  The expanded edition is over 150  minutes, and by the time the body parts and gore start flying it seems like  it's warn itself out. It takes soooooooooo long for Ripley to even make the  decision to go back, which is crazy to begin with. And when she does go  back all we get is a big budget sequence exactly like the first one with  the crew waking up and meandering about. Except this time they're not  nearly characterized so well - they're just straight from some comic book  with paper-thin tenacity and transparent toughness. So then everybody  stands around shooting their mouths off and flexing muscles. Then in a  disaster of a scene, Ripley tries to brief them on what they're going to  encounter. Nobody takes her seriously; they make fun of her, and even the  guy leading the squadron stands around like a big jerk running the mouth  and smoking his cigar. Then all of a sudden they land on LB-426 and it  takes sooooooooo long to even find the aliens. More standing around, more  running the mouth, more flexing muscles. Then bullets start flying,  alien/human body parts go whizzing past the camera, acid burns people's  skin off, and most of the crew gets wiped out in the first encounter.  Oddly, Bill Paxton's hideously annoying character is about the only one  left to get killed, and it takes way too long for that to happen. <br />   I  don't honestly see where all the suspense is - who actually thought Ripley  was going to die in the explosion in the end? Who didn't see the potential  for a likely romance between Ripley and Hicks? - he wasn't going to get  killed. Who thought after the bonding between Ripley and Newt that the  latter was going to be killed by the hulking alien in the end? And most of  all, who didn't see that remake ending of the first one? - just a bigger  alien (more money to build it) on a bigger ship (more money to build it  too). I liked the first one's terseness and &quot;that thing's running  around in here with us&quot; atmosphere along with the way it was put  together so much more. But Aliens is a decent action movie for gore lovers.
B00003CWTI|5.0|That line is first uttered by aging game show host Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) in Paul Thomas Anderson's epic character study \\"Magnolia.\\" Hall's character is the first of several to make this loose and indicative  religious quote in \\"Magnolia,\\" a film so emotionally complex, alarmingly  twisting, and arrestingly original that it should be marked as the last  truly great film of the 1990's.<br />Pinning down a two-sentence summary of  the plot is almost impossible for a three-hour opus of this magnitude. It  is seemingly plot-less and runs on and on, without any real inevitable  \\"goal\\" associated with most films. It's basically (and I use that term as  loosely as possible) an exercise in following a group of people living in  the San Fernando Valley and absorbing all the love, loss, regret, and wants  that they're experiencing. As mundane as that appears, \\"Magnolia\\" is so  inventive that it towers to become much, much more than it sounds.<br />Being  a movie with many diverse characters, it includes a very fine-tuned  ensemble cast. Among the characters are those trying to give their  compassion and help the helpless in a heartless society, like police  officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly, in a flawless performance) and  caregiver Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman). There are those who are  trying to find some basic respect in life, like Stanley Spector (Jeremy  Blackman), the 10-year-old prodigy of a kid's quiz show called \\"What Do  Kids Know?\\" and Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), a former contestant of the  very same quiz show who has gradually become a spineless has-been who's  place in life is obsolete.<br />There are those who are at death's door and  fighting to redeem a life full of lies and failure, such as wealthy  television producer Earl Partridge (Jason Robards, looking quite dead) and  Jimmy Gator, the troubled host of the aforementioned quiz show. There are  also characters who feel lost in their own pasts, like Claudia Gator  (Melora Walters, in astartling breakout), a burnout cocaine addict who is  so shattered and trapped in her own history that she instinctively shuns  almost anyone who tries to introduce love into her life. There are wives  who parallel each other; one, Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore), having a  change of heart about her dying husband; the other, Rose Gator (Melinda  Dillon), blissfully unaware of her husband's infidelity. And there is Frank  \\"T.J.\\" Mackie (Tom Cruise, in the most limitless role of his career). Frank  is a sleazebag who teaches seminars to men in hotel ballrooms on how to  \\"seduce and destroy\\" any woman they want; the amount of initial ambition  and pretension in the character is scary.<br />On top of these main players,  there are yet more. These characters do not belong to the story, they are  the story. The film opens with a surreal examination of chance that sets us  up for the series of occurrences and collisions that take place between all  these people in the day the film takes place. It would be criminal to go  into the film in any more detail, for the turmoil, psychological  manipulation, and powerful sequences it holds need to be experienced  first-hand. Seemingly owing something to Robert Altman's 1993 L.A. study  \\"Short Cuts,\\" the elements of divine intervention, dread, desperation and  care in \\"Magnolia\\" make it a much different and much more affecting  work.<br />Director, writer, and producer Paul Thomas Anderson is emerging as  one of the most creative and articulate forces in Hollywood. The  29-year-old one-man-army behind \\"Boogie Nights\\" and the overlooked film  noir \\"Hard Eight\\" pieces together something flawless out of what seems like  nothing special. Anderson seems to have a knack for building impressive,  cohesive ensemble casts, and this is certainly no exception. He takes bold,  unapologetic chances with the writing, chances that pay off. Anderson also  develops a very distinct style with \\"Magnolia;\\" the pace of the film seems  very urgent, likea friend rushing to tell you some grand payoff of a story  but patient enough to let all the subtle, creeping details sink in.<br />A  very compelling element of the film is the soundtrack, almost all of which  is tackled by the brilliant songwriter Aimee Mann and her  sometimes-producer Jon Brion. Mann's sharp music lends a stunning  vulnerability to the story, but Anderson is not content at just dropping  songs into his film for atmosphere. Mann's songs actually helped Anderson  to compose some of the characters in the story, and several songs are used  to very poignant and unique effect at key points in the film; just another  innovative step \\"Magnolia\\" takes towards cinematic perfection.<br />Other  critics may point out that \\"Magnolia,\\" clocking in at almost three hours,  is too long, too vague, too pointless, or too unorganized to even bother  with. Yes, it is long, but it feels like the film would be much less if it  had scurried along to complete some evident purpose as fast as it could. It  helps that it does not have some set course to travel along either; we  can't see where it's going or even why at points, and if we could it would  surely be a less interesting journey. Not one scene seems boring or out of  place, partly because of the life and blind audacity that the cast leaps  into their respective roles with, partly because Anderson throws us into a  world we are a little familiar with and a lot more confused and curious  with.<br />Paul Thomas Anderson has said that after the critical success his  breakout \\"Boogie Nights\\" was, he wanted to just cut loose and make a  three-hour epic about whatever he wanted to make a three-hour epic about,  develop unrelated characters who unexpectedly relate, and throw a bunch of  Aimee Mann songs in it, just because the studio now gave him the power to  do so. Somehow, that blunt description evolved into the towering,  psychological, profound, brutally bold work of art and reflection of life  that is called \\"Magnolia.\\"
B00001R3GI|1.0|I can't understand, why so many people regard this as the Rolling Stones'  best work. For me, every track is the always same song. Perhaps it's also  the problem that it is a mixture of many different styles, but the mix is  always the same. The bad endings -nearly every track ends thoughtlessly  with fading out- contribute to my bad impression.
0780631684|4.0|This movie is a must for fans of true scary movies and not cheap, boring slasher flicks. With a very interesting screenplay by the writer of many X-Files episode, James Wong and Glen Morgan and a very hip cast, they spin a tale that will chill you to your bones and prey on your most primal  fears. The first 15 minutes of this movie is the best opening to a film I  have ever saw and it keeps getting better. Here is a little taste to wet  your appaetite. Alex and a group of high school students take a flight to  Paris for a French class trip. Before they set off, Alex has a premonition  of the plane bursting into flames minutes after take off. He tells everyone  to get off the ill-fated aircraft. Moments later in the departure lounge  the student see the plane explode before their very eyes. Now the FBI  thinks that Alex had something to do with it and follows his every move.  His friends start to believe he had something to do with it also and slowly  fade out of his life. But now, each one of his friends is mysteriously  being killed by something that appears to the Grim Reaper. Alex starts to  believe that fate is starting to taking it's toll. This film on DVD is a  must have...
0671027344|5.0|i read this book a few days ago. i started it at 12:30 that night and read it straight until morning. i would be the first to admit that i'm an avid reader; reading constantly and sharing my opinions (solicited or  unsolicited) about that books that i have read. i'm very critical and  terribly hard to please, but yet this is the first book that i honestly  COULDN'T PUT DOWN. it was fascinating, being a teenager of about Charlie's  age, to read something that didn't preach, exaggerate, lie, or hide the  truths of life. this book best described the side of highschool where they  experience the &quot;forbidden&quot; things: drugs, alchohol, sex, and the  rocky horror picture show. it had the raw aspect to it, Charlie was totally  honest in the letters and showed that he was overwhelmed, struggling and  desperate at times as many teenagers are. though it is easy to dismiss his  type of friends as misfits, outcasts, misguided, they were true friends to  him and helped him through a terribly difficult time. this is what high  school is really like for many even though adults don't want to admit it.  Charlie is such a great kid, you grow to love him and his friends as the  letters progress and you feel pain when he does, happiness when Charlie is  happy and betrayed when he is so. this isn't just a book, it's an  experience and i promise you will be changed. i don't promise you'll like  it, because if you don't want to acknowledge what you may be afriad of you  won't, but you will be changed. that i can guarantee.
0684867621|3.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was good, but not great. I was looking for more and didn't get it. In any Stephen King novel, there is a bit of the supernatural that drives the book forward. I didn't get it here, so I was  let down. However, it was still a good book and recommended for those  looking for a safe read.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Actually I was surprised by this album. I bought it because I like &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot; thinking that would be the only song I liked. Basically I wasn't much of a Britney fan, but after I got this album  it totally changed my prospective. I think this is a great album.  Inparticular are the songs &quot;Lucky&quot; which is a typical Britney  song, and though at first seems corny,  for some reason can get very  addictive. It's truely great. Another songs is an upbeat song called  &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; It's a great song with a great  beat to dance to and a great message.. bascially it's great. :) So even if  you aren't usually a Britney Fan I Strongly reccommend it. :
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca's most haunting and beautiful scene is a love scene, shot through an upside down camera in room with transparent walls. In the metallic, clinical and angular world of this film physical love is unnatural. Sex is  an impulsive passionatte act and therefore not intune with the perfection  of an intelligent, balanced, stoic and ultimately robotic populace.  Afterall the person you're with could take a hair off your head, take it to  a shop down the street and see if you are a &quot;valid&quot; person.<br />     Vincent (Ethan Hawke) has never accepted the fact that because he was a  natural, faith birth, he could never persue his dream about going to  outerspace. He meets a &quot;valid&quot;, genetically perfect Jerome (Jude  Law) who despite the previlage of genetic perfection is paralysed.  &quot;There is no gene for fate&quot; Hawke observes in his moving  unintrusive narration. Jerome agrees to lend him is indentity, and in  return Vincent will help him maintain his affluent lifestyle. This switch,  along with a murder plot would be enough to make a decent thriller, but  Gattaca only use this to hook the audience. Both Hawke and Law give the  best performance of their careers in these roles. And although I could  praise Gattace as one of the best sceince-fiction films I've ever seen,  calling it sceince-fiction seems like a stretch. <br />    In the near future,  doctors will be able to extract the best possible child from a man and a  woman. As a doctor explains to the parents in this film, &quot;You could  concieve naturally a 1000 times and never get such result, this child is  you, simply the best of you&quot;. You can't argue with a line that, and  I'm sure given the opportunity, most parents would choose to have their  children disease free, but it would never stop there. How about physical  fitness, good looks, a high I.Q., wouldn't you want to give your children  all these things. It is that age old arguement of man playing God, what is  particularly tragic about it these days is its inevitability. You can't  stop scientist from creating alternative organs for transplant, and you  can't stop them trying to wipe out cancer gentically. Afterall these are  good things, paradoxically they will almost certainly be abused. Even in  the world of Gattace &quot;discrimination is illigal&quot;, but that  doesn't stop the firm from using a urine sample as their interview.  Sceince, humanity's great shining light will also be its downfall. Opposing  sceince is undoubtly bigotry, all you can do is watch as we drift into  Orwell's 1984.<br />   As you may have guessed, this is a deeply provocative  and timely film. It is also an intensly passionate one. In the history of  film music, only Ennio Morricone's music for 1986's The Mission can compare  with the emotional impact of Michael Nyman's score for Gattaca.  Periodically his lyrical, etheral, almost mournful score is played over  scenes making the film an emotional rollercoaster ride. There is a scene  played under Nyman's music where Vincent and his girlfriend Irene (Uma  Thurman) go to look at a field of Solar Cells. The Cells are the plants of  the future, when the sunshines they bloom. Although they are magnificent,  unlike the plants they don't need you to water them. <br />    Gattaca is a  magnificent and overlooked film. Essentially optimistic in its view that  determination can truimph over any genetic pre-conditioning, I think its is  actually more ambigious and wiser then its outcome suggests. It suggests  that you may have to leave this planet to escape the clinical prejudice.  But if you don't have a space ship to get on, then leaving can only mean  one thing. Suicide.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden's newest CD is full of heart felt songs, about love and  friendship. They are very well written, and it is worth the effort to  listen to the lyrics.
B0000025YM|5.0|When you listen this album, all that comes to your mind is that Judas  Priest are the best of the best.<br />Defenders of the faith is by far, their  best album, only &quot;Painkiller&quot; and &quot;Hell bent for  leather&quot; could give a fight, but this is my personal favorite... It  was my first album and I couldn't find anything as good as this.<br />No song  will dissapoint you. &quot;Freewheel burning&quot; and &quot;Rock hard ride  free&quot; are devasting songs. &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; and &quot;The  sentinel&quot; are my personal favorites, containing all the power that  made Judas Priest the Metal Gods. &quot;Night comes down&quot; is the most  feelfull song. &quot;Some heads are gonna roll&quot; and eat me alive&quot;  are the perfect complement for a great CD!<br />It's perfect for any Metal  fan... Maybe Metallica can grab this one and remember what is REAL METAL
6305905401|3.0|The only thing more bizarre than the ending...are the reviews on this page.  It is always interesting that people are able to convince themselves that they know exactly what was going on, and anyone else thinking in an  opposite direction...well, they're stupid.  You can read all the reviews  you'd like to read here - but that's about what they boil down to.<br />This  movie is fine.  Not great, not bad - certainly not a masterpiece.  Many  parts of it are interesting - many parts of it are not.  Johnny Depp was  fantastic...on the other hand, Lena Olin slinks around this movie looking  like Cat Woman from a bad old Batman rerun.  It is interesting to see Depp  get pulled into this evil, and to realize that someone that is not  &quot;evil&quot; themselves...is actually the one that is the driving force  bringing us to the 9th Gate.  But again, the good is almost always counter  with the outright goofy in this movie - and it comes in as being  above-average, worth watching, but not fantastic.
6305622930|5.0|&quot;Patton&quot; is the story of General George Patton, a complex man who was religious and profane at the same time.  This film isn't a biography of Patton, but it does show him during WWII.  Franklin Schaffner  portrays Patton in a more objective manner than usual with this type of  film.  This is one of the few films where you will like and dislike the  main character at the same time.  <br />On to the DVD.  The picture quality is  excellent, but there is some age evident in the print used.  This is an  early 16:9 enhanced disc by Fox, though the packaging does not indicate so.   There is a tad too much edge enhancement and it annoyed me, but it isn't  terribly intrusive.  <br />The sound is a remixed DD 5.1 track.  The surrounds  get quite a bit of use, but don't expect &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;  type sound here.  The soundtrack sounds a bit dated, and the ADR sounds  obvious when it appears.  <br />On Disc One, an audio essay by a Patton  historian is included and runs about 81 minutes.  It is not screen  specific, nor is it a commentary, so kudos to Fox for not saying that it  is.  Trailers for &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; &quot;Patton,&quot; and  &quot;The Longest Day&quot; are included also.  A French mono track and  Spanish subtitles are included.<br />Disc Two contains a documentary on the  filming of &quot;Patton&quot; which runs about 50 minutes.  It was included  on a previous LaserDisc release of the film, but given that it is on a  separate disc, they could have lengthened it.  An option to play the  isolated score from &quot;Patton&quot; is included, which will run over the  documentary if selected.  Only about 30 minutes of the film were scored, so  including the isolated score on Disc One would have left a lot of silence  during passages.<br />Fox has a winner on their hands with &quot;Patton,&quot;  with its good video/audio quality and fairly good extras.  Dissmissed!
B00000JGOJ|3.0|Playing by Heart is the type of film I love to hate. The sub- Woody Allen, sub-Robert Altman schmaltzy ensemble dramas seem to drive me up the wall. Recently I saw the abysmal Miami Rhapsody, and that piece of horse dung was  like a big fat fly on hot day that just won't go away. Playing by Heart is  arguably just as shallow, but between the flagrantly fake sounding dialogue  beautiful moments of truth shine through.<br />   The film chronicles several  dueling couples related in one way or another to Sean Connery and Gena  Rowlands who are about to celebrate their 40th wedding aniversary. While  they argue over an affair Connery almost had 25 years ago, their three  daughters Gillian Anderson (cynical, heartbroken), Angelina Jolie(club kid,  romantic) and Madeline Stowe(cheating wife) all try to deal with life and  love in Los Angelos. Out of these storylines the one involving Angelina  Jolie and Ryan Philliepe is the most touching. Their confusion, heartbreak  and affection is so well acted that it makes the rest of the film pale in  comparison. Elsewhere the film is a calculated series of scenes that seem  to be written by a second year Physcology student and sound staright out of  a self-help book, but every once in a while we get a standout scene. Dennis  Quaid's scene in a gay bar where he tries to convince a drag queen that he  is gay just to prove himself a man with &quot;imagination&quot; is  uproarious. A subplot with Ellen Burnstyn and Jay Mohr as her son dying of  Aids doesn't quite work because we don't know these people and watching  such intimate moment is embarrassing rather moving.<br />    Infact an indepth  critical analysis of the film will only reveal how shallow it is. And any  further introspection about the film will force me to trash it. Its a  credit to the film that you enjoy it too much to be able to do that.  Although the film was shot by legendarry cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond it  is technically unremarkable. Paradoxically watching the film is quite a  pleasant experience.<br />    The film's best scene take place between Jolie  and Phillipe inside one of those new VW Beatles which is a car with an  average engine, average performance and a bloated price. But people  continue to lap it up anyway because its cute and makes them feel good. A  lot like Playing By Heart then.
0780629450|5.0|The editorial history of the play Hamlet is, to say the least, extremely vexed. Several editions from the early 17th century exist, all of them are quite different, and more than one of them could be seen as &quot;the  best&quot; version. So any edition of the play one reads these days is  likely to be a sort of &quot;best guess&quot; by its editor as to what  Shakespeare really wanted to happen in this play.<br />Branagh's solution to  this quandry--to use ALL the texts available--turns out to be a wonderful  idea. After 10 years of teaching this play at the university level, I was  delighted to see all the fascinating juxtapositions of different variants  of the text played out together and providing new depth and texture to the  play I thought I had known.<br />Beyond the textual issues, this film contains  some magnificent surprises. Derek Jacobi presents a complex, dangerous,  deeply-layered Claudius. (Okay, a great performance by Jacobi is never  really a surprise!) Robin Williams puts in a good, if brief performance as  Osric--a character I never expected to care about in performance. Kate  Winslet is her usual, extraordinary, talented self, playing a smart, sexy,  but overwhelmed Ophelia. Polonius is NOT the typical semi-senile moron in  this version; instead, he is shrewd, sly, and menacingly manipulative, and  I regret not remembering the name of the well-known actor who delivers this  stellar rendition. And Charlton Heston simply floored me with his haunting  and exquisite monologue as the Chief Player.<br />There are several levels to  the production itself, from the glaringly obvious--its use of star power to  draw in any audience available--to the delightfully subtle--the use of  Blenheim palace as the exterior, as a commentary on the rewards of  cooperation with authoritarian government. Yes, I wish Jack Lemmon had not  been a part of this, and I got tired of the director's own hyperactive  performance at times, but I am praying for the day that this masterwork  comes out on DVD.masterwork  comes out on DVD.
0060194995|5.0|Harper Lee's timeless novel, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, tops the list of classic literature. It shows bitterness and descrimination of all kinds through the innocent eyes of Scout Finch, a young girl in Maycomb,  Alabama. Her father, the town's best lawyer, tries to teach his children  the lessons of life by living it, instead of by just being told.<br />The plot  revolves around a court case involving a black man being accused of raping  a white woman. Scout's father, Atticus, takes on the impossible case,  causing society to shame him and his family.<br />This wonderful piece of  literature is a fantastic depiction of life in the south in the earlier  part of the century.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I don't think there are words to explain how much i like this album. If you are a fan of pop music, I seriously doubt you wouldn't like this. It has many awesome upbeat tunes (Oops, Stronger, What U See is What U Get)  and sweet, slightly corny ballads (Dear Diary, Where Are You Now, and the  great DLMBTLTK). Many bad reviews here are left by pop haters who feel  insecure by Britney's sucess. Go find something better to do than to  critisize an album you knew wasn't your type of music to begin with. By the  same logic, I could go rip on a rap artist (cause I don't like rap) and say  they have no talent. Get a life. I have yet to hear a review on this album  that has some constructive critisism by a person who was really  disappointed by the album.  As for Britney, she is gunna keep churning out  some mega-hots in the future based on what I've heard on this. GREAT!
B00000JPHE|3.0|Tod Browning's production of Dracula made Bela Lugosi's name immortal in the annals of horror film.  While Lugosi had played the role many times on stage, he had a difficult time landing this role.  He did and so became  intensely identified with the role and never really overcame the  typecasting.  But he was brilliant in the style he portrayed the count.   Helen Chandler was excellent as Bela's victim.  The production bogged down  in mid to late scenes but the early scenes of Castle Dracula and the bleak  Carpathian mountain countryside are brilliant, some of the most gothically  chilling in cinematic history.  Dwight Frye's Renfield was a role of  genius, his maniacal laugh still producting chills down the spine.  I only  rated this movie three stars because it is somewhat dated and does slow  down in pace and drama in the last two thirds.  The first third place it  with the all time greats and if that mood could have been sustained,  Dracula with Bela Lugosi would have been unmatched. Edward Sloan as Dr. Van  Helsing was brilliant.  The only one better was Peter Cushing.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Let's say this now: If the only Pearl Jam CD you like is &quot;Ten,&quot; step away now. Pearl Jam will, frankly, never create another album like that, and in my opinion that is the greatest news I can give to any real  music fan. Over the course of ten years and five albums, Pearl Jam has  defied the norms of the music industry and become one of the most talented,  honest groups out there. <br />So anyways, let's talk &quot;Binaural.&quot;  The production is very laid back compared to the slick-sounding  &quot;Yield.&quot; If I didn't know better I could say it sounds rushed,  but the stripped-down effects don't detract from the experience. No  instruments are lost, you can still hear Eddie's fantastic pipes, and the  waves of music sound all the more moving without fancy studio tricks behind  them.<br />The band members are in top form. Ed, Stone, and Mike all  contribute their talents to the guitarscape, and Jeff's bass is a solid  backing as usual. New drummer Matt Cameron is highly talented (you might  remember him as being the driving backbeats of Soundgarden) and certainly  doesn't effect Pearl Jam in any negative way. And, I think I should get  this out: I certainly admire Pearl Jam for taking the risks involved in  letting every member of the band write the songs. It shows that every  musician has large amounts of talent, brains, and integrity, even if Ed  (who writes five songs by himself here) seems to lead the circus.<br />So lets  go with the songs heard here. First, Ed attacks The Who's &quot;I Can See  For Miles&quot; with &quot;Breakerfall.&quot; Along with &quot;God's  Dice,&quot; this is as hard as Pearl Jam has gotten in years, and it sounds  wonderful as an opening to the album. Next up is &quot;Evacuation.&quot;  The song is hook-filled, but unfortunately there are a few too many hooks,  and they all seem to get lost in some sort of mess. It's not bad, it's just  hard to follow.<br />Next up is &quot;Light Years,&quot; a mid-tempo crooner  thathas Vedder sounding more sincere than ever. The stripped &quot;Nothing  As It Seems&quot; uses every member of the band to create a wonderful  experience. You can almost feel the anger in every member. &quot;Thin  Air&quot; is another mid-tempo crooner, with a larger emphasis on the  guitars here. Next comes &quot;Insignificance,&quot; a loud, fast,  boisterous, and excellent attack on collateral damage. Ed is ANGRY, and he  lets you know it. &quot;Of The Girl&quot; has trouble finding a real hook,  but the layered guitars and pretty lyrics make it a fine  treat.<br />&quot;Grievance&quot; again uses like 3 different guitar hooks,  but all of them work better than those in &quot;Evacuation,&quot; and the  song showcases Vedder as a singing force. &quot;Rival&quot; unfortunately  sounds somewhat closed-off, but it's catchy at parts. &quot;Soon  Forger&quot; is a poignant little ditty by Vedder, with some powerful  singing to back up his manly little Ukelele. This comes between  &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; and &quot;Parting Ways.&quot; These two are  beautiful, moving, layered, and difficult.<br />In fact, that goes for most of  the album. It's not an easy listen, but after a few times through, the  power and emotion of Pearl Jam's songs begin to shine. And this comes at a  time when the music world deperately needed this album. It's full of sound  and fury; a seething, boiling album that seeps into your soul before you  even know it's happening. It's a thouroughly enjoyable album, nay,  EXPERIENCE that I highly recommend for the patient souls that are awaiting  the return of good rock. Here it is. Bravo, guys.
0061020710|3.0|&quot;The Color of Magic&quot; starts off the wonderful series that is Discworld, a giant disc flying through space on the back of four elephants that are standing on a rare breed of giant turtles. Though this is a great  book to explain some of the physics and background of the Disc, I would not  recommend it as the first book to read. I would recommend &quot;Lords and  Ladies&quot; first.<br />&quot;The Color of Magic&quot; is not one of Terry  Pratchett's better Discworld books. It drags on and lacks the humor found  later on in the series. It's the story of Rincewind the incompetent  goof-ball of a wizard and Twoflower, the wandering tourist. Together, they  travel the Disc, fighting dragons and gods and escaping the clutches of  Death himself.<br />The book is inconsistent. Twoflower begins speaking in  such a language that only Rincewind can figure out what he is saying. Then,  later in the book, everyone can understand, including Hrun, the Disc's oaf  of a barbarian hero.<br />A must-read for any true Discworld fan, but not one  of Discworld's best. It gives a bad impression of what Discworld is truly  about.
0375804013|5.0|I specifically came looking for this book for my new son because I remember how much fun it was to read to my nieces and nephews.  It was an all time favorite for the everyone.  In fact when I mentioned looking for  it they all said &quot;Oh I loved that book!&quot;
630245333X|5.0|Chuck Russell constructs a great remake of the original and has the audacity to kill off Donovan Leitch (SP?), the Steve McQueen type hero, all-american boy nearly at the very start.  But Kevin Dillon fills in  wonderfully as the James Dean rebel without a cause but plenty of clues to  help save Shawnee Smith and the whole town from a biological man-made  weapon which the secret powers that be want to use to destroy communism  forever.  The problem with this weapon is that it wants to eat us too so  the military and CIA types really anger this thing and it darn near kills  off everybody until.....well, the ending is too horrible to be  believed...you'll have to see it for yourself.  This is an excellent  remake.  Wait...what's that? It's..no! AAAUUUUUGGHHHH!
B00004WEJZ|3.0|When Sean Connery Left his role of james bond after diamonds are forever, he say &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. But Nobody is perfect so he accept in 1983 to make a new james bond movie which is in fact a remake of  the fourth james bond &quot;Thunderball&quot;. The film is good, like the  actors, but the problem is  that this movie is not made by EON productions  (the producters of all james bond movies), that mean that there is no james  bond music, no Q, no gunbarrel, no good song etc... If had to choose  between Never Say Never Again or Octopussy (the official bond in 83) i will  choose this last, because there is ll the ingredient of a bond movie. But  if you are a james bond fan like me, you must see this movie, because Sir  Sean Connery is in, and this is the big point of this film.  ENJOY !
3822884979|5.0|Before I got this book, and being a WWII nose art reproduction artist myself, I really knew only of the big three! This book is phenomenal as it lists dozens of artists who perhaps have not gotten the same recognition as their more famous counterparts, but still deserve to have their work seen. This is a collection of artists with usually no more than 10pg/artist. Stay away from this if all you want is Vargas, Petty, or Elvgren. A MUST BUY IF YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THE RICH HISTORY OF THE PIN-UP! HUGE BOOK, good layouts, EASILY WORTH THE MONEY
0553275569|5.0|As good as &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; is as a movie, the book is even better.  Thomas Wolfe's account of post war American test pilots and the first American astronauts is frank, amusing, moving and ultimately  triumphant.  Wolfe humanzies the cocky heroes that made America's space  program successful.  He punctures the myths that have grown up around such  legendary men as Chuck Yeager, John Glenn and Alan Shepard and portrays  them honestly, warts and all.  The test pilot sequences and the onerous  astronaut training are the best parts, but the whole book is utterly  fascinating.  &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; may very well be the best  aviation story ever written.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Jaws has finally been released on DVD and it's been a long time coming in my opinion...a great film with an amazing cast.  Roy Scheider plays the ambivolant Chief Brody with ease and finesse.  Richard Dreyfuss plays the  tussely-haired Marine Biologist Matt Hooper in what had now become his  trademark halting delivery style.  Robert Shaw's performance as the gnarly  old sea captian Quint becomes haunting in his famous speech about the  tragedy on the U.S.S. Indianapolis.<br /> The film is really two different  films.  The half of the movie that takes place on land, and the half that  takes place aboard the Orca...hunting for the shark.  One could not exist  without the other.     The direction is expert, courtesy of Steven  Spielberg.  The dreadful shoot, delayed by the faultering mechanical  sharks, turned out one of the greatest films ever made.  The pacing is  perfect, following a slow-build pattern that ends with an incredibly tense  climax.<br /> It's one of my favorite movies ever...always will be.  The  DVD offers a great interviews and a documentary on the making of the film.   This is what DVDs were made for...the movie in all it's widescreen glory,  great picture and sound quality, and tons of extras for the movie buff.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This is the bomb of a cd. Its awsome. Nothing can take its place  if you  don't like this then i'd like to see you sing better.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I do not speak Italian, had never heard of Roberto Benigni and detest chaotic, slapstick humour. This film contains all of the above and oddly, I loved it and thought it a truly wonderful film. (I ended up watching it  twice in 24 hours). Having briefly scanned other reviews about this DVD, I  know I do not need to go into great depth about its content and quiet  magnificence. Suffice to say it is a gentle, funny, spiritually inspiring  film and you must see it. Roberto Benigni deserved all the accolades he got  for this.<br />Additionally, I must say that the horse scene and the German  translation scene rendered me a howling heap on the floor and I had to  pause it in order to compose myself and not miss any lines. And this is a  movie about the Holocaust?
B00000IAU3|5.0|This girl is sensational.  I've read the other reviews comparing Dido to Sarah McLachlan, Fiona Apple, Sinead O'Connor, etc.  But in my humble opinion: She stands alone as a unique artist with an incredible soul to  share with the world.  Her lyrics are poetry, and the music has beat.  &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Here with Me&quot; are just two great songs  that we've heard around; but this entire album has the same bittersweet and  heartfelt emotion. Clive Davis definitely had insight when he signed Dido  up for Arista Records.  I've listened to this album everyday since I  ordered it from amazon.com (two months ago), and still haven't tired of  it.<br />I read other people's reviews and appreciate them, but never thought  I'd write a review myself - until now.  So take my opinion for whatever  it's worth, but Dido's &quot;No Angel&quot; is worth the money and the all  the hours of play that you can get out of the CD.
630204135X|5.0|Haunting, mysterious, deep.  I've seen this movie at least 10 times and I'm still picking up new layers of meaning.  If you like to have your senses ravished and your intellect stimulated, you should see this film.
0141301066|5.0|Okay, So I might not be in the catchment of Roald Dahl's books anymore at the age of 20, but this is still my number 1 favourite childrens book. <br />Matilda is a little girl who has mean old parents. She goes to school one day and makes her teacher Miss Honey,realise that she is very  intelligent, and she starts to see what she can do with her skills, and  this leads to all sorts of exciting capers, for she is a very special  little girl. Watch as she gets her own back on everyone thats  mean!<br />Anyway I will tell you no more as I have already seen the many  other reviewers have given away the ending! Parents- buy your children this  book. It doesn't talk about cruel realities of life, or things that you  should be telling your child about once they get old enough, it's a good  old fashioned fairy tale with a modern approach .A brilliant story and  Roald Dahls story telling abilities are really amazing! <br />My family  brought me up on Roald Dahl, they were the first books I ever read by  myself and I will remember them all my life as the most fun, great, and  imaginative stories to read, that real encouraged me to start to read and  helped my vocabulary as a child!<br />Even if your not a kid- This is a book  that's such great fun to read!
B00004TL21|2.0|Probably one of the most repetitive, blandest albums I've heard. Plain vanilla. Nothin' special here.
0441172717|5.0|Then these are truly the ones. <br />They are not fiction, they are an education. This first book is an amazing introduction to Dune, the planet Frank Herbert created with his own bare hands. Frank Herbert, just for  creating this world so imaginatively and vividly, deserves godly status,for  he is truly a genius unlike myself.<br />I have never read such an enchanting,  amazing, horrifying, insight into our world around us and our religions and  societies, yet this book really does teach everything whilst telling the  most enriched story at the same time. <br />Whether you read between the lines  or accept the text literally there is pure delight and contentment in  reading it. The Bene Gesserit are most fascinating, intellectually supreme,  devine genetically engineered beings. They show you something beyond your  reach that makes you want to be like them, wise and spiritual. <br />Paul  Atreides is an amazing character to follow and I recommend that you MUST  read the following books in the series and they only get more and more  amazing and above beyond where the wildest imagination can take you.<br />You  live Dune. An amazing literary works that really does describe everything,  putting you there watching everything happen as if it were there in front  of you, although you would still not get the insight if you were there- as  you could not perceive the situations on such a vast scale!<br />I only wish I  had a wide enough vocabulary to fully express the true pleasure I enjoyed  while reading this book and if you pass by the opportunity of reading it  you are missing one of the greatest experiences of your life.
B000023X9W|5.0|Absolutely fantastic!  I have almost every album by Neil Young and have  been a fan for 30 years.  I love this CD.  On most CD's by any artist,  including Neil, there are a couple of songs that I don't care for but that  is not the case with this one.  I love every song.  It is such a beautiful  piece of work. This is the Neil Young that I love so dearly.
B000000WJZ|5.0|No joke, i've owned this album since it came out in 93'and it has stood the test of time.  Maybe even becoming better, expecially in comparison to all the crap new bands are putting out on the radio now a days.  Every song  on this album is great in its own way and they were all perfectly placed.   This is as close to music prefection as has ever occured.  Amazing lyrics,  and fantastic guitar and everything else i don't see what they could have  done to have made this album any better.  After owning this album for 7  years i still say i average listening to it about 3 times a week. I can't  say that about anyother album i own.  My personal favorites on this one are  Cherub Rock, Quiet, Soma, Geek USA, and Mayonise.  But the others i didn't  mention are excellent as well.  So if you don't own this album you have no  idea what you have been missing out on. I say get even if it costs you 100  dollars its well worth it.
0671578278|5.0|The above is a desprite warning from one who has been there.  This book is absolutly Incredible.  The way Bujold breathes life into the pages of her books has in the past been noted - but this drives the point home.  Bujold  has won 4 hugos for her works, only Heinlein ties her, and if this doesn't  win her her fifth, well... The book packs all of the usual elements,  Political Intrigue, Well dipicted action scenes, and Bujolds sudden Humor -  Humor that takes you by surprise and keeps you there page after page.  Also  it's got EVERYBODY - The Count, His Captian, Mark, The Koudelka's, Miles  and His crush, Gregor and his Bride-To-Be.  And of course Ma Kouskes  Cooking!  Enjoy!
0140186409|5.0|I bought this book on a whim, drawn by the attractive binding and it's reputation as a classic.  My friends thought that I was crazy to read it on my own will, and, to tell the truth, I was somewhat hesistant myself to  begin such a daunting book.  Going in, I was expecting it to be  boring.<br />However, as I started to read I found that it was hard to stop.  It's not that the story is compelling, but I truly loved the style of  writing.  Sure, the story is not fast, but from the start I felt as though  I was a member of the central family, suffering in their misfortune and  rejoicing in their joys.  The abundant dialog allowed me to truly discover  the character of everyone in the story.<br />I admit that if I were forced to  read this for classes, as well as having to contend with 4 other subjects,  I would become frustrated at the slow pace.  However, for never one moment  did I regret my decision to read it.  I highly recommend it to anyone who  can enjoy the writing stlye.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I read the book Lynch on Lynch and in it David relays a story about how Stanley Kubrick invited some friends over in the late seventies to watch his &quot;favorite film&quot; and when the lights went down Eraserhead  flickered up on the screen.  Praise doesnt get much higher than that. For  those interested in immersing themselves into a wholly realized artistic  vision track down a copy of this bizarro. I love it!
B00000FC5H|4.0|With the possible exceptions of Rufus and Sly and the Family Stone, there is virtually no other band to so successfully marry elements of funk, R&B, and pop as Earth Wind & Fire. Their heavy horns, infectious rhythms, and disco overtones are nothing short of an all-out party, and the digital remastering some of their best-loved tracks are granted here make the aural results all the more delicious. <br />Funk workouts like \\"Shining Star,\\" \\"Let's Groove,\\" \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" and the classic \\"September\\" are solid, irresistible works that age like fine wine, and silky ballads like \\"That's the Way of the World\\" and \\"Reasons\\" proved that they could be twice as smooth even when the tempo was half as fast. The band even offers up one of the strongest Beatles covers ever recorded, an irresistibly bright reading of \\"Got to Get You Into My Life.\\" But their hands-down masterpiece will always be \\"After the Love is Gone,\\" a simply-perfect cut that boasts flawless vocals, lush horns, and a striking chord progression.<br />Of the songs that weren't crossover smashes, some are revelations (\\"Mighty Mighty,\\" \\"Saturday Night\\") while others simply aren't up to snuff (\\"Serpentine Fire,\\" \\"Kalimba Song\\"). Regardless, for a single-disc collection of a supergroup of Earth Wind & Fire's magnitude, you really couldn't do much better.
B000000OUJ|5.0|I was surprise to see I didn't revue this album which I bought five years  ago. This is the best Wu album from the solo group. This brotha don't play  when it comes to lyrics. This is true hip hop and lots of rappers don't get  that brand.
B000002GJH|5.0|I just have to say that I have listened to a lot of music, and lots of  types of stuff.  Through all of my searching and experimentation I have not  come across a better song than Hunger Strike.  Not one.  I don't like to  say which songs are better than others, but I positively think that Hunger  Strike is the best song ever written.

0515127485|4.0|Archangel is one of not so many books available today, where author really understands what's going on in today's Russia, gives his interpretation about the history and its impact on today and it is really interesting to  read about the events in Moscow living in Moscow in less than 1 km. from  the Beria mansion.  The other great book that should be mentioned in this  context is &quot;Snow Wolf&quot; by Glenn Meade that also covers the last  days of Stalin.
B000002LCB|4.0|Knopfler created a wonderfully fitting soundtrack to the film &quot;The  Princess Bride.&quot; However, this also creates a problem. Without the  movie playing at the same time as the music, you notice the imperfections  in the soundtrack quite a lot (such as the overuse of synth strings). The  high points of the soundtrack seem to be the guitar pieces, which,  unfortunately, are far too few. Though it has some problems, The Princess  Bride is probably one of the most pleasing soundtracks to listen to in  entirety. Whether it is enjoyable or not is a matter of personal  preference: if you don't like hearing synthetic strings, you might want to  stay away.
6305910103|5.0|Regarded by many--including myself--as the best Star Trek film (though many call IV their favorite, if not the best, for the laughs), Trek II is just amazing to behold on DVD. Seeing the film widescreen for my first time  was a wonderful experience, and the picture is sharper and clearer than  it's ever been.<br />Although this DVD has literally zilch for special  features, I still give it five stars because the movie, already great,  truly comes to life in this format. The joy of seeing the whole picture and  in such fine detail, and of hearing it so crisply, is more than enough to  make up for the lack of additional material.<br />If you've only ever seen  this film on video or on TV, I believe the Mutara Nebula segment will be  enough to win you over. The colors are razor-sharp and the sound intense  (thanks to the dynamic range of the audio format). Widescreen did a lot to  enhance the experience, but it's the absolute precision of the picture  that's so startling. It's like seeing the movie again for the very first  time.
0441172717|5.0|When I picked up Dune in 1998, I had no idea what it was. I had seen the horrible movie when I was a slight bit younger, and had been disgusted by it. I figured that the book would be pretty much the same. However, I  opened the book, and could not stop reading. In Dune, Frank Herbert has  created a living, breathing world, with characters that I can actually  visualize. Herbert is a master of the speculative fiction genre. As far as  I have seen, he is the only author capable of capturing my imagination in  such  ways that Dune (and later, its sequels) was able to.
B000002J1S|5.0|The opening of the title track fades into existence.  You know something  is about to happen.  Then Peter belts out &quot;And the Laaaaaaamb...lies  dowwwwwwwwnnn...ON BROADWAY!&quot;  The music on this song sends shivering  chills around my body.  &quot;I'M RAAAAAEEEEEL!&quot;   After rocking to  this song, you'll feel like a hovering fly smashing a windshield on the  freeway as the instrumental part of Broadway Melody hits you and sends you  to another world.  Tony Banks was, and is, a sensational artist who has  always taken my breath away with his melodic and haunting sounds.   I wish  people would come out of their Cuckoo Cuckoons and admit that this album is  the greatest piece of work ever.  But I guess they prefer to stay in their  cages.  After enjoying &quot;Grand Parade&quot; and rocking to &quot;Back  in NYC&quot;, I'm counting out time until the Carpet Crawlers.   Ohhhh, the  Carpet Crawlers.  This is one of Genesis' greatest melodic and  inspirational tunes they've ever done.  &quot;CC99&quot; off their hits  album is an awesome updated version of the song.  If only they could  re-record all the other songs and create a full version of &quot;The Lamb  2000&quot;.   The rest of the album is a little less full of short songs,  and has more instrumentals which build up to the final siren that  introduces &quot;it.&quot;    <br />If you have not yet bought the album, it's  well worth the 25 bucks to get it.  It will take a couple of listens to  start loving it, because it's different from Trespass on up to Selling  England By The Pound.  Before I bought The Lamb, I wondered how anything  can get better than Selling England By The Pound.  But now I'm sure that  nothing can get better than this.
0684833395|5.0|The best way that I can find to describe this book is Abbott and Costello's infamous &quot;Who's on first?&quot; routine. The entire plot and interaction between characters is a mish-mash of miscommunication. The  characters run the gamet of absurdity. From the main character Yossarian,  the bombardier who thinks that everyone is out to get him personally  because they are trying to kill him in a war. To the private, who is  running a black market between countries and enemies, selling anything and  everything he can get his hands on. To the colonel who feels that the  success of the army depends on whether or not he can provide a good parade.  The list goes on and on.<br />   The plot weaves back and forth in time and  can get somewhat confusing at times, but then again if you're not on your  toes this whole book could get away from you. I found the best thing to do  is just find a quiet place and let yourself get absorbed in the  ridiculousness. The best way to sum up this satirical look on war is this:  &quot;Catch 22&quot; IS a catch-22.
0060263865|4.0|As a child i was read this book by my teacher and i really enjoyed it. It is a great novel and shows a great friendship between a pig and a spider. They get up to all sorts of things. This is a great book for all the family  and can read from many levels. E.B. White deserves 8/10 for his  compasionate novel.
B00001U03Q|4.0|My main problem with this compilation is the odd song choices, 'Layla unplugged' over the original 'Layla'?  Wheres' She's Gone' (form Pilgrim).  Overall I like all of these songs but there arrangement seems unbalanced,  (several slow songs then poof! Rockin' Clapton).  People have complained  that Clapton has mellowed, but I don't think so, hes just grown as a person  and an artist.  I wasn't alive when 'Layla' was first written, but to those  who were: Are you the exact same person today as you were then? Instead of  playing pop nonsense to make money, Clapton writes and sings from the  heart.  This, in my opinion,  makes his new sound  all the more better than  his eariler works.
B00000ICD9|5.0|My husband picked up this DVD while we were out shopping and I was stunned.  I knew I wanted to see it....but HIM.  We watched it that very night and we both absolutely loved it.  It is visually incredible and right  up there with &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; for my all time favorite love  story.  Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding Jr. are remarkable.  The special  effects awesome.  The story line one of a kind and very much in line with  todays open mindedness about reincarnation.  If my &quot;Big Ole Truck  Driving Husband&quot; is man enough to be touched by it, you likely will be  too.  I recommend it for everyone who has ever been truly in love or has  wanted to be.  It could easily make people appreciate love and life in a  whole new way...Right to the core of their being. A WONDERFUL MOVIE.
B000002JEV|4.0|Led Zeppelin live, sounds sooooo much better than Zeppelin in the studio.   When I first heard the first song &quot;You SHook Me&quot; I was instantly  enthralled by the band.  This album converted me into a true Zeppelin fan.   i would say that with the excetion of Clapton Unplugged (which is very  different from these CD's) I would say this is my favorite live rock album.  A must own for all fans of good music.
B00002RAOR|2.0|If you love buying videotapes mastered in the dreaded  E.P. mode, with atrocious sound quality, improper letter- boxing and grainy picture quality-this title is for you.   It's very fortunate I didn't waste more  money by ordering the DVD edition, because apparently it isn't any better.      As for the film itself, it is impossible to judge under  these  circumstances.  The plot is difficult to follow due to the incomprehensible  dialogue and the visuals are hard to  appreciate.  If Image is restoring  this to add to their Bava collection, you would be well advised to wait.
B00000J7J4|4.0|Santana surprised me, I bought it because of &quot;Smooth&quot;.  I like  Matchbox 20 and Rob Thomas.  Initally I thought the whole CD would be about  the same: Pop Rock.  I was WAY WRONG!  Several tracks are in Spanish and  have a traditional feel, but with a rock influence (kind of like jazz in  Espanol), there's a reggee track, a soul track, and surpisingly: a Rap  track.  I like all kinds of music so this mesh was very much welcomed.  I  can see why this won a Grammy as alubum of the year.  I am very impressed  with Mr. Santans music but also his message, inside the CD case on the  dedication page is information about Santana's various charities.  Imagine,  a rocker with a heart.  Three cheers for Santana's return!
B00004TRD8|5.0|The previous DVD version of T2 had &quot;English (Descriptive Video Service)&quot; as one of the audio tracks. This new one doesn't. <br />I realize it was intended for blind and visually impaired people, but I liked  listening to someone describe the non-verbal action of the film. Since I'd  already seen the movie many times, it allowed me to walk around my house,  doing other things while I &quot;watched&quot; the movie. Since the track  was included in the previous disk, I kind of wonder why they didn't keep  it. <br />I'm thinking about &quot;upgrading&quot; my T2 DVD to this new  version. I was going to either sell or give away the one I have now, but I  would miss the DVS track. I really want all the new extras, but do I really  need two?<br />Movie - 5 stars  (Missing DVS - 0 stars)
B00004THAY|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've ever heard!  I usually don't listen to  Blues but I do now!  Both artists shine equally, with neither artist  running the whole show, I liked it you will too!
B00003CX5A|5.0|This film is one of the best I've seen in a real long while.  All I could think of while watching this...was the cartoon usually shown on Halloween on Disney......Sleepy Hollow is a great movie....good job Tim Burton,  Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci....(Hey, isn't 'Brom' that guy from  Starship Poopers? )  Any film with Christopher Walken will be a  classic....that goes without saying....a classic film....no cheese found  here, except maybe that Starship Pooper's/Luke Skywalker wannabe guy....the  friendly ghost  Caspar Wuttzisface...........I could watch this again and  again....not get bored!
0783242808|2.0|I almost feel bad typing this...there is nothing new or original here.  All of this has been done before.  (ie Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, etc)  I was actually rather bored by this film...I'm sorry...I guess  pastry and internet sex shows don't do much for me.  I wish someone would  realise that people between the ages of of 13-20 (well, some of us, anyway)  aren't really that amused by bodily fluids and flatulence.  The  performances were very good, very believable, with the exception of Shannon  Elizabeth, but I seriously doubt that she was cast for her acting ability.   For a more intelligent teen coming of age story, I recommend 'Get Real.'
B00000JGHM|5.0|This film without a doubt is a masterpiece. Seeing DeNiro and Pacino back together really sets the mood for this movie. Heat is your traditional cops and robbers movie, with great action scenes. The sound on the dvd version  is spectacular, the bank robbery scene is excellent. The picture quality is  clean and spotless. Great DVD! Highly recommended!
B00000705Z|4.0|From looking at the other reviews of this album, I'm not going to focus  again on how incredible these two men are.  That is a given.  But I do  wonder sometimes why this album didn't become more popular, especially in  the time of where everyone's living la vida loca.  It's got a latin type of  beat to it, and the music is pretty diverse in that area as well.  But I  really want to comment on one particular song that could represent the  whole album in a nutshell: Why didn't the song &quot;Single&quot; from this  album get released as a single?  It has all the components.  The subject  matter IS different, but Pet Shop Boys couldn't be normal if they tried.  This whole album is a journey through their eyes of going through life when  traveling around the world, but the song Single, could best reflect Neil's  attitude and perhaps all celebrities attitude of what it's like to be  somewhere where you've never been before.  Taking that even further, it  could signify any person who experiences &quot;culture shock&quot;, where  one is recognized in a place where you least expect it.  Whether it be from  just a grocery store, to another country, this song is a great  representation of how fast everything moves in one's life, and how you only  have time to think about it later, after it's over.  The song also follows  the formula of possibly being a hit single: it's not too short, or too  long...it focuses on the same type of phrase and beat most of the time so  people can have something to easily remember and sing with...and it's a  subject that is different, YET at the same time one wouldn't have a  difficult time relating with any part of the song.  As for the rest of the  album, see other reviews.  I could go on forever about how good it is,  myself.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Siamese Dream is unquestionably Smashing Pumpkins's  finest work. Most of  the tracks are absolutely killer. In my opinion ' Today ' is the most  melodious alt-rock song ever written. It's absolutely breathtaking - so is  ' Disarm. GET this album or you'll be missing the best by a legendary   group.
0451169514|5.0|Stephen King has a way of writing so that you constantly see the book playing in youre head.  Its like watching a movies, his description are so vivid you actually feel like a character in the book.  It was the third  Steven King book I've read, It wasnt the scariest, but it was certainly the  best.  I recommend this to anyone who has even read a book.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I was not a fan of &quot;Tidal.&quot;  I found the anger and resentment  expressed on the album (for both others and for herself) wandered into  territory too often explored by female singer-songwriters.  I picked up  &quot;When the Pawn...&quot; after a friend recommended it to me, and it  has not left my CD changer since.  Apple expresses herself well, and has  songs well-suited to her jazzy voice.  &quot;Paper Bag&quot; and  &quot;Limp&quot; are especially well rounded songs.  I enjoy this album  completely, and if there is a weak link in the album it's the single  &quot;Fast As You Can,&quot; which is a very strong weak link.
0140277447|5.0|This is the third, and probably the last attempt for me to give this book five-star evaluation. I had already given ten stars before, but since I have received a wonderful reply from Mr. B. T. Laycock, a well educated  young man, I felt there is need of my response using this review section;  if the sum of all reviews upon this book can help you, any of you, create a  new, positive perspective of life with your deep awareness of the suffering  of another, regardless of any time and space, that will be a good,  beneficial start that enables whoever, or whatever that will keep surviving  in this world to accomplish the order of less violence and unswayed peace.  And, that will be the intrinsic compensation for any beings that have  experienced succesive severe suffering from all our war crimes. In my  political view, the current Japanese government should react to Asian  countries with greater respect than ever, and they should make as much  compensation as possible in the reality, in the same way the German  politicians have done for the Jewish people. I simply think so because,  otherwise, they would hardly believe the Japanese constitution even if that  were designed right after world war II by many Japanese who have realized  the true color of the Japanese empire at the time, with the help of the  U.S. General Headquarters in Tokyo, to swear peace. The incommensurable  wrath of the war victims especially in Asian countries such as China,  Korea, and several others will never calm down without the reciprocal act  of recognizing all histories between Japan and them. To desparately defend  a position for a continuum of conscientious dialogue between us is, I  think, a moral and logical way of being as a country, and Japan needs more  of that positive action. The insult and hatred that the Japanese empire  generated all over Asia since the war time, while most of that is not yet  known to citizens in Europe and the U.S. because of suppressed situations  of journalismin Asian countries, has become a large undergoing force in  Asia based on mistrust, and obviously, things will get just worse if the  Japanese citizens keep ignoring or denying the fact of the invasion and  massacre by the Japanese military. In the past several decades, policies  that the Japanese government chose, however, reflected many Japanese  individuals' partial understanding of their neighbors. And, needless to  say, Japan needs to make a proper apology that can clearly reach to the  heart of American citizens, for attacking Pearl Harbor, and for starting  the gory battle. It is a right thing to cast the blame on Japan for their  faults in the past and present, and in my opinion, there is no argument  about that. Sooner or later, Japanese citizens will have to attain sanity  in their politics, and fundamentally, in their education system as well.        While having opinions like above, however, I regret to state that my  understanding about world war II is still insufficient to lead a concrete  answer, and for me, the entire truth of the same war is beyond the mist of  nihilism. According to a fact in an official document that the Department  of State of the U.S. announced in 1943, Joseph Clark Grew, an American  ambassador in Japan, sent his correspondence to the U.S. on January 27,  1941, carrying the information about Japan's sneak attack of Pearl Harbor.  That was ten months earlier than the actual attack by the Japanese  military. Also, one day before the miserable chaos at Pearl Harbor on  December 8, 1941, a decoder team from England had decoded the Japanese  empire's plan of attacking Pearl Harbor, by catching their correspondence  in Singapore, and therefore Churchill and Roosevelt should have been  informed about the Japanese attack in advance. This is not to say that this  fact makes any allowance for the war crime committed by Japan. And, this is  not to say that England and the U.S. were sharing any part of  responsibility for casualities at Pearl Harbor. But, it was possively not a  total sneak attack, and there were probably specific people who took  advantage of the Japanese military action awaiting for the U.S. to fight.  Bankers? Politicians? Or, industries? I don't know. B. T. Laycock's sincere  and kind reply to my confusing comment posted before has presented his  reasonable viewpoint of the two atom bombs that were actually used, in  August 1945, to terminate the unprecedented brutal behaviors of the  Japanese empire. I don't think that the use of atom bombs was the best way  to stop the war. But, he inferred the war continued unnecessarily longer  since the use of nuclear arms was delayed. That makes me think that there  were specific unknown reasons to keep Tokyo and Berlin undestroyed by  nuclear arms (maybe, to effectively exploit them after the war?).  Furthermore, the U.S. General Headquarters failed to judge a part of the  party of Japanese war criminals. Secret dealings may have been made during  the processes of the judgement after the war, between specific people among  Europe, the U.S., and Japan.  Also, I wonder why we are talking about the  Japanese war crimes now, but not much before?  What is the full reason for  it? Who and who have made the true control of the war? Many facts of the  technocratic war disasters seem to be, unfortunately, still out of the  sight for the empty sagacity of pseudo interectuals who always hide  themselves behind either the sword and the pen.       Finally, I would like  to show my respect to Mr. Barron T. Laycock for being kind and honest to my  sensational, controversial, and impolitic review. I apologize for shocking  him, and other readers if there are any.  *Do not post this if the same  review has already been posted*      Hirofumi Wakimoto
B000006TRV|4.0|The Wall was and is still one of the best pink floyd cd's, but it is not  the best. For that reason I have chosen to give it 4 stars. The Wall is all  about how Roger Waters complaning that he was now famous and he didn't want  to be famous. There are good songs on this cd, Another Brick In The Wall,  In the Flesh,Hey You. Disc 1 is the best disk. I would recomend Meddle,  DSOTM, Wish You Were Here, and/or Piper At The Gates of Dawn. If you are a  true fan like me though I would buy the wall for songs that I hadn't heard  yet even though some are not worth listening to. The Wall is important  because it is the last great Roger Waters CD. If you do buy the Wall try to  find the meaning it is harder than any other Pink floyd cd.
B00003CWN2|4.0|Hilary Swank is so believable in this movie, I kept forgetting she is really a woman. She gave an outstanding and heartbreaking performance. The director of this film really captured the ugliness of this horrible  scenario that occurred in Nebraska in late 1993. In a way this movie was  hard for me to watch, but it really touched me. There are two reasons I did  not rate this a five star film..first,  is that Philip DeVine, one of the   of the actual victims of the crime, was cut entirely out of the film and  never mentioned. Second, I didn't like that Lana Tisdel (portrayed by Chloe  Sevigny in the film) was seen present at the murders, when in truth she was  not present. Overall, a very good movie with five star performances.

B000001ABD|5.0|To write a review about Stevie Wonder should not be that difficult for me,  as I heard him for the first time while living in Cumana, watering the  garden at night. Specially the song &quot;Yester me, yester you,  yesterday&quot; impressed me a lot and later on there was &quot;You are the  apple of my eyes&quot; and so many more which made my heart sing. He has  not only a good voice, but expressive as well. Besides, my guess is he  composes his own songs, the lyrics as well as the music. In one word a very  versatile artist. He'll be around for a long time!
B000007SIN|5.0|As a person who listens to music as carefully as a wine critic evaluates a  glass of wine, I find this DTS disc brings forth a  musical flavor that  could only be replicated with the use of perhaps a ( Carver Sonic Hologram  Projector ) unit or something in that caliber of sterio gear. Yes, the  sound is dramatic and even true hardcore Steely Dan listeners will find a  new reason to listen to this release even more often! You may ask, how  could S/D get any better? Give this disc a listen, and your heart and soul  will sing!
B00004TL21|5.0|This is a stunningly powerful and devastatingly emotional third effort  from the Deftones. This album is an instant classic with some of the  Deftones best songs to date, like Change (in the house of flies), digital  bath, &amp; passenger (feat. Maynard from Tool/A perfect Circle). Have a  computer nearby as this Cd also contains a multimedia package that consists  of pictures, video clips, diary entries, &amp; a cool Pac man game  (Deftones version).
B00003W8NM|1.0|Can't connect in any way with this movie. Worst movie I've ever seen..
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I love this album. Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones have taken their already  FANTASTIC music writing skills and improved upon them. The song Crash and  Burn comforts listeners and help them get through the hard time by letting  them know they are not alone. I Knew I Loved You is a gentle, innocent love  song...I Love every song on this album and I look forward to their next  album. This is just the BEST band out there today.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Elliot Smith is the epitome of an indie artist.  He does what he does  without compromising.  And the music he creates is very good.  His voice is  haunting and works well with his songs.   Miss Misery remains my favorite  song of all time, but the songs here are noteworthy.  Son of Sam and  Everything Reminds Me of Her are fantastic.<br />If you have had enough of boy  bands and dancing girls, this is for you.  It is the complete antithesis of  cheesy and bubblegum pop.
006016848X|1.0|This book is a perfect example of how one can get rich simply by inventing a clever title (a la &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot;).  Inside the cover, however, there is nothing but oversimplified, stereotypical trash,  with about as much scientific value as the content of the average TV talk  show.  How sad that so many people are taking this garbage seriously.
B00004TL21|4.0|This is the first deftones cd i have ever bought, all though i doubt that  it will be the last.The deftones were recommended to me by a friend and  since then, i have become a big fan.  Most of the songs on this album are  pretty good. Several highlights include 'feiticeira', 'digital bath'  'elite', 'knife prty' and 'change (in the house of flies)'. on all the  songs, vocalist Chino Moreno uses his extensive vocal range to its fullest,  creating a dark, haunting sound. The bandmembers-Abe Cunnigham, Chi Cheng,  Frank Delgado and Stephen Carpenter contribute to the music by exaggerating  the heavy riffs and creating music that seems to reach out and fill the  air. In all, this cd is definitely worth a listen.
6301967992|5.0|I laughed like hell at some parts of this film.Roman Polanski's  a fantastic Actor,as well as  being a great director.Sharon Tate is beutifull,even though she doesn't have a big part.I don't have this  tape,but remember seeing it years ago on TV.I'm going to order &quot;The  Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; today.
0812550706|5.0|I recieved this book as a gift one year and I had seen other people reading it before, so I figured it must be a good book. I wasn't at all prepared for what I began to read that day. This book has the mind of a  genius behind it. The characters dive in to the some of the deepest love  and some of the darkest hate inside the human mind. The fact that the main  character is a child is even more incredable. You must read this book  several times to really pick up some of the points and morals in here.  <br />After the earth has already been attacked twice by aliens knowns as  &quot;buggers&quot; people begin to breed and train children geniuses in  the hopes that one will be the perfect commander for the next invasion. The  main character, Ender, is a &quot;Third&quot;(He is the third child born in  a family) and is sent to a military training school where children are  raised in a harsh environment where they play &quot;games&quot; designed to  help them build several skills nessesary to become a great commander.  Although this is a  sci-fi book it is not and &quot;action packed&quot;  book. It is an exploration of the human mind and a look at such topics as  power, greed, hate, innocense, and the idea that no one is in control of  their life. If you don't read this book you are missing one of the greatest  books of all time.
6305897786|3.0|Johhny Depp, who has always been known for choosing strange &amp; challenging roles, did something strange in 1999,2000. Over the course of a 12 month period, he starred in 3 films. Usually just the opposite is true.  The Astronauts Wife was totally forgettable, while Sleepy Hollow was  wonderful. The Ninth Gate falls somewhere in the middle. Trying to get back  his glory days of Rosemary's Baby, director Roman Polanski chose another  interesting, supernatural vehicle. I just felt that it lacked a lot of  things that kept it from being as brillant. One of these things,  regretably, was Depp's performance. Only a bit more animated than his  performance in the Astronaut's Wife, Depp sometimes seemed to be sleeping  through this role. He was much more effective in another of his &quot;every  guy&quot; role in the movie Nick of Time. Though the truth is,with this  film, he didn't have a heck of a lot more to work with. Polanski couldn't  seem to make up his mind whether the characters in this movie were supposed  to be cartoony or dramatic. He got an odd mix of the 2. Just listen to  lines like Depp's after he and the dead book owners wife have just finished  mking love ( i can't repeat them here)...but he delivers the line smirking  into the camera like something out of a campy spy movie. There's also the  annoying bit of Polanski not introducing the when &amp; where of any of his  scenes. Depp goes from NY to Portugal to Spain, and Polanski leaves the  viewer wondering just where the character is now, and sometimes how he got  there. Sometimes it feels like the viewer came in in the middle of the  picture, when they have been watching it from the start. However, the film  does hold the viewer's attention ( unlike the somewhat similar, apocolyptic  snoozer End of Days), despite its almost 2 &amp; 1/2 hour length. And some  of the performances are genuinely eerie, like that of Frank Langellas (  just listen to that voice on the phone!).But going for the anti-climactic,artistic ending was a wrong move. It left me, oddly enough,feeling like I  was taken ( much like Corso's clientele in the movie). The picture was shot  nicely enough &amp; had some terrific music ( that included a bit that  almost sounded like the Jaws theme). I think that Polanski could have given  in and given the viewers a little bit more of a spectacular, Hollywood  ending ( and beleive me, I don't say that often!).
B00004TH83|5.0|If you like the breathy, sexy voice of Amy Grant, the powerful voice of Celine Dion and the emotional voice of Barbara Striesand, you will love Lara Fabian as she delicately combines the excellence of all three  characteristics into a romantic and charismatic journey you will want to  take over and over again.
B000002KAT|5.0|You won't be playing this record at a party ! But you may find yourself  playing it late at night or early in the morning, either by yourself or  with someone else. You may hear this record in a cafe or a bar, but you are  unlikely to hear it on the radio. When you do first hear Astral Weeks you  are shocked by its beauty. Songs such as &quot;Beside You&quot;,  &quot;Ballerina&quot; and &quot;Young Lovers Do &quot; are in turn  uplifting and melancholy. It is rare that a performer can leave so much of  himself or herself in a recording, but this is what Van Morrison does here,  and this is why it stands apart from other records. The second reason is  the musical backing, essentially acoustic but with plenty of variety,  plenty of surprises and somehow always catching the mood of Morrison's  songs.  This record is so superior to the rest of Morrison's output. Yes,  you can find &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; or later, the song  &quot;Moondance&quot; elsewhere, or even go back to &quot;Here Comes The  Night&quot;(although not written by him), but it doesn't matter because  there is so much richness in &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; that it bears  repeated listening and sounds as fresh now as it did the first time, 32  years ago.
B00000K19E|3.0|it's okay. good for the special effects.<br />sci-fi, action, slightly suspense/drama/romance/mystery.<br />so keanu is like, this hacker dude, and he does stuff, and he gets in trouble, like, but he doesn't know what he's  dealing with. but there are some totally awesome special effects which are  worth watching for their music-video-quality of style, innovation,  techno-fruit.<br />and of course it's kinda nice to watch from a 'i wish i  could do that' kind of perspective. the concept is definitely sweet. ahh,  to be inside a computer. to be hyperreflex supertalented and inside a  computer. to be wearing such nice pvc outfits. ahhh.<br />i didn't buy it and  i wouldn't have...someone else put me on the spot in a DVD store and said  'ok which one do you want' and i liked everything else there less. so i got  the matrix.<br />it's nice here and there.
6303022901|4.0|This and the Ang Lee film &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; were both released at about the same time.  And I think they may have cancelled out each other.  Both are great but like any wonderful film, if another equally  great film with a similar theme is released at the same time it can cause  an overload.  People won't go see either. <br />So why should you see the Joy  Luck Club?  Because the acting is wonderful.  Really top notch.  If the  current affection for having asian women in films lasts then maybe we could  see more of these fine actresses.  Too bad that so many wonderful actors  can get typecast because of race but there is hope.  I'd absolutely love  some more films like this.<br />Wayne Wang's direction is great.  This story  goes from funny to sad to touching without being cliche.  This movie might  be marketed more toward women, and it does hit on great female  relationships, but it's not to sappy the boyfriend will cry from boredom.
0792156684|1.0|Well, Well, Well, where do I begin.  Lets start with James Cameron.  I admired the guy until now.  What can I say, he did some great work, TRUE LIES, THE TERMINATOR SERIES, THE ABYSS, not bad films at all.  But there is little good to be said about his latest pile of trash, &quot;TITANIC&quot;.   (what an original title by the way).  Its not exactly the most original  concept either, I mean come on, they've been making movies about her for  eighty years!  Most of which are several times better than this...      Leonardo DeCraprio was brought into the picture simply for teen chic  appeal...not a very professional descision on Cameron's part.  I felt  absolutely no simpethy when Leo bit the big one...infact, I was even a bit  releived.  What upsets me most about this picture is the fact that Cameron  simply ignores the many other types of people who lost their lives in the  disaster...sure, a few snid bits here and there, but unfortunetly, he fails  to go in depth...and do you know why?  Because if he doesn't show you how  horrific it was, he might even con you into seeing this film again as a  repeat audience; anyone who has seen this film more than once should be  dragged out into the street and...the makers of this film seem even  colder than the waters Titanic sailed in herself.  Not one screening was  issued for charity, unlike EPISODE ONE, which would remain the number one  box office hit, had they not engaged in doing so.   The most convincing  character was BILLY ZANE, although I liked him much better as a punk in  BACK TO THE FUTURE.  Kate Winslet's bra size is larger than her I.Q., and  is the only reason she was picked for this role, I'm sure.  Notice how I  refer to the characters as the actors who played them; this is only to  prove how unconvincing they were, and that i never once believed they were  the characters they played.   Titanic should not have garnered the  impressive amount of academy awards that it did.  Best picture, film  editing, director,and screenplay should have gone directly to AS GOOD AS  IT GETS, and I'm not just saying that because I happen to be an Opsessive  compulsive.  It clearly was the better picture.  It may not of had the  impressive sets or production design, but it had something TITANIC could  never have, the ability to convince an audience.  What I'm trying to say is  simple.  Why it appealed to so many  people is simply astounishing, and just go's to show you how shallow are  society really is.  I've had bowl movements more meaningful than this  movie!  Come on, folks!  Anyone mature enough nows this movie is a pile of  trash.   Titanic got it right on two accounts; one, hiring James Horner  (THE MASK OF ZORRO) to compose the score; (even though the award still  should of gone to JOHN WILLIAMS for his score to THE LOST WORLD) and for  the production design.  The only thing convincing in TITANIC was the boat  itself!   I especially love the fact that the entire plot of the movie  revolves around two teenagers jumping and running thru the ship just to  make out...simply astounishing...now that is oscar material!  A very, very, disappointing film indeed.  CAMERON! YOU  SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!
B000003TSP|5.0|This album is way, way better than Dummy. This is probably the most  experimental and forward-thinking of all the albums released in the trip  hop genre.  Undoubtedly one of the best albums of the 1990's, this  self-titled sophomore release is thoroughly listenable all the way through,  with no filler, no wasted space and filled with carefully crafted songs by  a talented band. While everyone else compares it to Dummy, this album is in  a class of its own, free from the rigid constraints of traditional trip hop  that Dummy was immersed in.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This CD was a waste of money.  It only had one good song, &quot;Opps...I did it again.&quot;  She's right, opps, I bought another one of her CDs again.  All the songs have that same beat to them.  If I knew this, I'd  just listen to &quot;Baby one more time&quot; over and over.
0892818875|5.0|In my opinion, this is the finest exploration of the emotional uses of essential oils in print today, and I'm delighted it has been reissued.  Gabriel's overview of TCM and how it applies to aromatherapy is thought  provoking; but it is in his descriptions of the emotions and of the oils  that his work truly shines.<br />This book is a must have for anyone  interested in healing on levels beyond the purely physical.
6305949638|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best movies I have EVER seen. Beautifully filmed, acted, and just a poignant, strong story. It provokes thoughts and feelings that most movies never touch. Wonderful, wonderful  film, I would recommend it to all and honestly can say that it deserved  more Oscars than it recieved- I believe that it just came at the wrong time  with &quot;American Beauty&quot; and society's desires today for movie  content, but certainly rivals it in quality. A must-see!
B00004TJTS|5.0|I don't think that anyone who has seen this film, can say a bad thing about it.  The story involves a young boy (Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz) and his friendship with his dog Skip.  He doesn't have many friends,  so he becomes best friends with his new dog.  The story takes place in a  Mississippi suburb during WW2.  His friendship with his dog teaches him  many things along the way.  It's a comming of age story about growing up as  a kid and having one true friend, then looking back at your  childhood.<br />This story is very touching, and anyone sensitive will  definately need some kleenex because it is an uplifting teer jerker.  It's  good to see that a movie doesn't need sex, violence, or language to be  genuinely good (although the movie has a couple of mild words, and stuff  that may scare children under 5).<br />On the DVD, there are 2 nice  commentaries.  One by Frankie Muniz and the dog trainer, and another by the  director.  Very informitive and it increaces the replay value of the  movie.<br />If you're looking for a good, uplifting, innocent story:  buy this  movie, you won't be dissapointed.  Highly reccomended.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album ROCKS!!!! This is the best album ever!!! Breed is so catchy and  Teen Spirit is....um...spirited???!!?!?!?!?
B000002H97|5.0|If you were a fan of music in 1991, you were a fan of Metallica.  How  could you help it?  This was without a doubt the greatest Heavy Metal album  ever in print.  Before 1991, a metal band winning Album of the Year was  unheard of.  It seems that Metallica had turned more heads than anybody  could have possibly imagined. This is a CD who made Gods of a group of men,  and made fans out of an entire country of people.  An eye-opening and awe  imspiring album... worth every penny and hundreds more.  Buy it, you cant  go wrong.
6304935870|2.0|The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor seems to be accurate, as to time, and place, and naval/military deployments. However, the screen writers have gone out of their way to depict Americans as either stupid, ignorant, or  unconcerned. While on the other hand, the Japanese enemy is depicted as  polite, wise, and opposed to war, and the number of American casualties  seems of little importance.<br />It is apparent that the dialog was written in  Tokyo; and it surely could have been the product of General Tojo's war-time  propaganda machine.<br />Yashida and Yamamoto, et al., say things like:          1- &quot;We have awakened a sleeping giant.&quot;       2- &quot;I've  lived in Washington and studied at Harvard, so I           know the  Americans are a proud and just people.&quot;       3- &quot;If war becomes  inevitable America would be the most             formidible foe we ever  fought.&quot; Such words belie the truth: Japan's intended world conquest,  in conjunction with her NAZI allies, as revealed at Corregidor and on the  Bataan Death March, and earlier in China and Korea.<br />The Japs were very  much a part of the European Holocaust, in that they were willing allies of  the NAZI Party; in this video the blame for the NAZI alliance is laid on  General Tojo, not the Navy, and not the Emperor. The good fellows in Tora!  Tora! Tora! were &quot;only following orders.&quot; Sound familiar???<br />In  keeping with the general disingenuousness of this 20th Century Home  Entertainment product, customers who are paying for a commercial-free  viewing experience are getting several minutes of advertisements, for  several different 20th Century videos. The advertisements are not disclosed  on the packaging, or at the point of purchase. A sneak attack, very much  like the Japanese killing of Americans at Pearl.
B000003TA4|5.0|The band that had redefined rock n' roll and invented the style to be  known as Alternative, delivers a shocking blow to the music world with this  album.  Who would expect the Seatle grunge band to knock off The King of  Pop and his new album Dangerous? Listen to the first track of this CD and  you will KNOW why.  Kurt Cobain writes himself into the history of music  with Nevermind, and immortalizes himself in our minds forever.  This CD  deserves 6 stars... a true beginning from a man who had reached his end.
B000009CEM|5.0|First off, great album.  superb.  excellent.  stupendous.  need i say  more?  okay sure, this is a concept album, but if you listen to the  lyrics,(and read, you might get more pronunciation out of the words if you  just read the lyrics) you'll find that some of them actually ring true to  the current state of society. and some also ring true to what we NEED in  the current society.  Okay, down what you've been dreading the whole time;  the track by track review. 1. Shock:  nice, heavy song.  sure there are  heavier songs out there, but this is plenty heavy.  Burton's up to his ol'  vocal tricks during this song; i.e. growling for most of the song, but  giving us that beautiful voice for the chorus.  good song. 2. Edgecrusher:   this is the track about our hero for the album.  really good song,  bordering on great.  sadly though, no melodic singing. humph.  anyway, the  breakneck crunch of Dino's guitar and Ray's drums is broken up by the well  timed &quot;technical scratchings&quot; of DJ Zodak.  really good song. 3.  Smasher/ Devourer: Okay song.  cool chorus, though.  wouldn't recommend  buying the cd just for that song, as there are plenty of lovely tracks  aside from it.  okay song. 4. Securitron (Police State 2000): this is a  song about the album's version of &quot;Big Brother&quot;.  The melodic  chorus is back *yay!*. this is one of my personal favs on the album. great  song. 5. Descent:  some peeple like this, i personally find it too...  alternative for me. i find it too lite for my tastes. oh well. you might  enjoy it. peculiar song. 6. Hi-Tech Hate:  Now here's a song about society.   wow, great song. just the line of &quot;we are losing, weapons  controlling&quot; is enough to make me like this song, but it has the  melodic chorus so i have to give it credit for that. great song. 7. Freedom  Or Fire: Pretty cool song. i find it kind of repetetive though.  but it's a  good song all around. 8. Obsolete:  ah, here we are, the Title Track!! this  is actually a great song, with a few minor drawbacks.  The chorus, although  growling, is actually really catchy. but the rest of the vocals could use  some work.  just a little bit of timing here and there and that would make  this a really great song. 9. Ressurection:  my personal favorite.  okay,  let me just say this:  THE WHOLE F**IN' SONG IS IN THE MELODIC VOICE!!!   *yay!*  well, the last four lines in the song are growled, but it switches  back to melodic on the last word. so... this is my favorite song on the  'bum so i think it's needless to say that i find it stupendous. 10  Timelessness: some peeple say that this song is too soft, seeing as it only  has a band of string instruments (that's violins and the sort to you grease  monkeys out there) and a sinth or two as instruments.  but it's in the  melodic voice, and actually a really, really good song. 11 Cars: for some  reason, on the tracklisting up there at the top of the page, they didn't  mention this track. oh well. anyway, wheh, did this one take me by suprise.   this song has nothing to do with edgecrusher or his struggle to reclaim  the hope for humanity.  this is a remake of the Gary Numan song and it  actually has Gary doing vocals with Burton.  this song is very strange next  to the rest of the album, but you'll love it. okay, just buy the album and  stop reading reveiws.  if you don't think for yourself once in a while, you  won't get anywhere. plus, not only do you get the songs, but you get a  short story.  Burton has taken the time to write &quot;Conception 5&quot;  which is comprised of little between song segments that tell you about the  way the world is at that time, and advance the story onto the next song.   So just buy the album!!!!
0792845684|1.0|Escape From New York is a film that, for some reason, has gained a cult following.  Perhaps it's Kurt Russell's performance and his creation of the character Snake Plissken, or maybe it's the film's dark look, but I can  tell you that this is a very dull film that moves at a pace so lethargic  even people in the year 1981 would have still found it boring.  <br />There is  a reason why I bring up the year this film was released.  1981 was a year  that brought up some very well-known action films starting with the  masterpiece Raiders of the Lost Ark, the raw and exhilarating The Road  Warrior, and the critically acclaimed Das Boot.  Compared to these films in  terms of generating tension or excitement of any sort Escape From New York  would make a person fall asleep.<br />Granted, Carpenter's idea is intriguing  but the premise never explored to its full extent.  What should have been  one of the most original films of the decade ends up being one of those  &quot;good idea, bad execution&quot; movies.  It's the kind of film that  disappoints me a whole lot more than one that's bad from the beginning  because after such an interesting opening it just falls downhill from  there.<br />As a science fiction tale Escape is even worse than its attempts  at action.  Once Plissken is inside the prison of New York there's very  little good stabs of satire or a good fashioned sense of adventure.   Everything in the film feels so small despite its desires to be an  epic.<br />Each of those three films I mentioned above are worth much more  watching than this film.  If you want to check out an exciting Carpenter  action film I suggest you watch Assault on Precinct 13, but forget his  film.
6300247120|5.0|What a marvelous movie, one of the best scripts in the past 30 years and featuring a once-in-a-lifetime performance by Paul Dooley as Dave's father. This film perfectly captures the pathos, fears and wonder of being 19 years  old and not knowing what to do with your future. It portrays those feelings  to a &quot;T&quot; and centers around four likable, charasmatic,  interesting characters. These are characters you like and care about, you  feel as if you know them all intimately by the end of the film.<br />The  script never flags, there are no filler scenes, gratuitous dialogue or  wasted characters. The soundtrack supports the movie beautifully and the  cinematography makes you want to move to Indiana (now that's effective  photography!)<br />The closing scene with Paul Dooley is one of the most  hilarious endings in motion picture history. This is simply an outstanding  movie, it's impossible not to fall in love with the characters, their  personalities and their lives. A must see.
6304011431|5.0|Everyone of you should read this gentleman's review.  This is what I have been trying to say for years about this movie.  If you want to check out what I had to say about this movie - go to the Internet Movie Data Base or  imdb.com - under this movie title and you will see that my views of this  movie is in most cases exactly what Jerald here was saying.  Thanks again  Jerald.
B000005YZM|5.0|I don't know if I'd call this the British answer to &quot;Pet  Sounds,&quot; if only because the Zombies weren't gunning for a thematic  masterpiece as Brian Wilson was. But this is still the great lost album of  1960s pop - or, properly said, rock when it could still be classified as  pop music without gutting either the pop or the rock. The Zombies, of  course, had the most unique harmony singing style this side of the Hollies,  and a sense of the absurd which compared rather favourably to the Beatles,  unless you think &quot;Care of Cell Block 44&quot; and &quot;Beechwood  Park&quot; indicates stone cold impassivity. But if you must strain for  something resembling a theme, call it the anti-psychedelic, anti-concept  album: clever song structuring and harmonies, private jokes and arch  longings, equalling an album you shouldn't want to trade even one track  worth for every damned psychedelic album you've ever heard. Argent won't be  going into anyone's hall of fame. The Zombies will. And, in hand with their  first two singles, this is the credential. Or should be.
6305810109|5.0|I cried all the way through this movie.  I don't know why.    Maybe Richard Farnsworth evoked my grandfather Harry, a farmer who was wise without benefit of much formal education and who was cantankerous and  stubborn, just like Alvin Straight.  Maybe because of the core message of  the importance of family.  Maybe because the scenery was lovely.  Maybe  because the music captured my fancy (buy the soundtrack, too,  people!).<br />It was perfect.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I was very sad because I had some troubles in my life. So, one friend gave  me this cd. I confess, each music in this cd bring a peace, some hapiness.  It does I remember some things of my life, my friends, my family... I love  each music, but for me the most beautiful is &quot;These Are The Special  Times&quot;, this music bring tears to my eyes. But Celine and Andrea is  lovely, too. I recommend this cd, for each season of the year, not only the  holidays. Celine, congratulations for this beautiful record!
B000002KHF|5.0|Moondance is a wonderful album. Van Morrison is a truly gifted songwriter,  not to mention his wonderful, yet unique voice. If you want to hear music  that is more flash and glitz and commercialism, give Moondance a listen.  Just reading the lyrics to this album could stir your soul. The lyrics are  amazing, and the music is great too. In addition to the great acoustic  guitar playing, bass and drums, Van has also added saxophones, flutes,  clarinets and pianos to many of the songs, giving the album a rather  distinct sound. My favorites are Come Running, Moondance, These Dreams Of  You, Caravan and of course, the BEST song on the album, maybe Van  Morrison's best song: Into The Mystic. This album would get 5 stars just  for Into The Mystic even if all the other songs were bad. Fortunately  though, that's not the case. Moondance is marvelous from start to finish.
B000002C1V|5.0|Nothing like Wish You Were Here or Dark Side of the Moon. This is a Roger  Waters album. Angry, anti-war blues and rock. You frequently here melodies  used in The Wall repeated here, but put to work differently. Final Cut  lacks the humor of The Wall and Amused to Death (which in my opinion may  surpass The Wall as Roger Waters' best), but again the album follows a  consistent storyline giving it that quintessential Waters theatre. I have  long viewed Waters as one of the more important people/composers in  contemporary music. More than the music (which is stunning) he has  something very important to say, and he justs says it so well. That message  may be exemplified by his lyrics in &quot;The Gunners Dream,&quot; where he  sings of a better place to live, where &quot;everyone has recourse to the  law/ and no one kills the children anymore/ no one kills the children  anymore....we cannot just write off his final scene/take heed of his  dream/take heed.&quot; Great stuff.
B000002KC5|5.0|This is by far my favorite Randy Newman album.  Every single song is great.  It's funny, moving, and well, this is just a great album . . . that's all there is to say.
B000000993|5.0|For true fans of Tool and the &quot;Undertow&quot; album, here's something  to see! If you take apart the jewel case, behind the CD you'll find a  secret picture! Those goofballs! For as dark as their music is, they have a  very clever sense of humor.
B00000ILE6|5.0|This has to be one of the most terrifying and creepy action films ever made. The special effects won an acadamy award, Sigourney Weaver was nominated for best actress, and the script was flawless. Everything about  this film was superior! But if you are like me, one who is too affected by  eery films, I'd pass it up! That should tell you how phenomenal it is!
0380973464|2.0|This is the title that closes the chapter on Stephenson for me.  I'd enjoyed Snow Crash enough to overlook the accumulating cuteness that gooed up the end, and I found sufficient merit in Diamond Age to offset the even  larger splashes of the same defect marring that volume.   Despite  its ambitious conception, however, Cryptonomicon is a showcase of sloppy writing and  errors of fact.  The tone throughout is  cleverness so precious it gags.  Cute.  It's just so preciously cute.  Disappointment is compounded when a talented writer mistakes energy for effort.
0930073193|5.0|This is perhaps the best book to introduce the layman to the field of economics... This book was a Godsend for me... I stumbled on it in my early college days when I was taking two semesters of Economics and neck-deep in a Keynesian textbook of Fabian socialist fallacies and lies. Hazlitt's book opened my eyes to an insightful intellectual library that  supports free-markets and individual liberty. Economics in One Lesson  enlightened me, while it helped develop my economic reasoning. It helped  me confirm what common sense told me all along - that a laissez-faire free  market is the way to go!      This  book basically introduced me to the Austrian School of Thought on  Economics.  The \\"Austrians\\" vindicate the market economy's spontaneous  order as the surest way to have optimal prosperity, opportunity, and  individual liberty for the masses.  The verbal logic and reasoning of the  Austrian school is generally easy to understand and makes sense to the  reader.  Needless, to say my interest in the laissez-faire perspective grew  - and I read and amassed a library of hundreds of interrelated books on  various disciplines from economics to history to political theory.  I also  recommend any books by other \\"Austrian\\" luminaries such as Ludwig von  Mises, F.A. Hayek, and Murray Rothbard.  Hidden Order by David Friedman and  Capitalism by Ayn Rand are also worth mentioning.
0785918736|5.0|This is my favorite collection of Roald Dahl stories.  Regrettably I bought my copy while traveling. As the idea of adding the weight of books to my increasingly large pack became less and less appealing I opted to  give my copy away.  I now wish I owned a copy of this.  I consider it his  better collection of macabre stories.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Si bien muchos critican la duraci&oacute;n de esta pel&iacute;cula (al igual que \\"Coraz&oacute;n Valiente\\") yo no coincido en lo m&aacute;s m&iacute;nimo con que esto sea algo negativo.<br />Una pel&iacute;cula si es buena, si es realmente buena va logrando que uno se introduzca en ella, que sienta lo que sienten los personajes y que no interese lo que los que est&aacute;n al lado puedan comentar o hacer (vi&eacute;ndola en un &aacute;mbito hogare&ntilde;o por supuesto, no as&iacute; en los cines). Y esa duraci&oacute;n solo ayuda a amplificar esta clase de sentimientos.<br /><br />\\"Heat\\" tiene una trama espectacular, atrapante, inteligente, tiene escenas de acci&oacute;n en momentos concretos, bien colocados y que ayudan a la trama (no para mostrar lo que una computadora puede hacer, como la mayor&iacute;a de las pel&iacute;culas actuales).<br />Adem&aacute;s, la trama de una pel&iacute;cula ayuda, pero para mi un 50 por ciento de cualquier pel&iacute;cula est&aacute; en los actores, y De Niro y Al Paccino son excepcionales actores! y me pongo de pie para escribir esto. La escena en la que se sientan y hablan en el bar, es digna de ser vista todas las ma&ntilde;anas solo para sentir la pasi&oacute;n y la credibilidad de estos dos \\"master\\" de la actuaci&oacute;n.<br /><br />Si no la han visto, realmente h&aacute;ganlo y sabr&aacute;n lo que es una obra de arte del cine, sin rayos laser, sin meteoritos, sin barcos hundi&eacute;ndose, pero definitivamente con lo que toda pel&iacute;cula debe tener: excelentes actores, espectacular e inteligente tem&aacute;tica y acci&oacute;n en los momentos justos.
B0000019PA|4.0|I am always on the look-out for music new to my ears and found a gem in  this intelligent and fun record. Lyrically heartbreaking and sarcastically  sweet it challenges the listener to have fun and feel melancholy  at the  same time. Love it.  I will wholeheartedly recommend this to friends and  family alike, although with the understanding it's not for all! Fans of the  likes of Dirty Three or Tindersticks will assuredly love it as I have!  Here's to new finds....
B00004TH7Z|1.0|C'mon, guys...Five star...If you die-hhhhard fan of Iron Maiden,  maybe...But, please, don't force the rest of good metal fans to buy this  &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Thanks God, one of my friend of mine has bought  this CD and I had a chance to listen to it. It saved my money. Flat,  boring, monotonous, grey...Bruce's solo albums are much more better.   Honestly speaking, I've never been the group fan and always supposed it is  &quot;shade of Deep Purple&quot;, literally, though some albums were really  good crafted. But this album just is shade of Iron's classical albums. I've  mentioned I'm not die-hard fan, but couple of my friends are, and they've  got the same opinion: the &quot;brand new world&quot; is so terrible that  we'd rather stay in our good old one!
0784011680|5.0|This film truly is a masterpiece. It's a crime Robert Downey Jr. didn't win the oscar for this role that he filled perfectly. The portrail of Chaplin does not skim over his faults. And although the film doesn't delve  too deep into Chaplin's darker side, it goes beneath the glossy surface you  are likely to have seen in biography shows on TV.<BR><br />Touchs on all the  major events in the life of Charlie Chaplin.
0486266885|4.0|I have read or seen performed several different versions of the Jekyll and Hyde story, but none of them compare to the original short novel.  Usually extra characters and subplots are introduced, but in Stevenson's story the  plot is simple and the characters few.  Stevenson had a gift for  characterization, and one can't help but pity Jekyll after reading his  final confession.
B00004SCX6|1.0|...but in the end of it all, that does not lead to good music. what ever happened to the days when the writer/composer of the music was heralded? that is where the talent lies anyways, right? it doesn't matter how well  anyone can sing (and britney does not have that good of a voice anyway),  but the music itself is what we love to hear. let's get back to the days  when we honored those that actually wrote the music and not the performers.
6305907102|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The horror, the chills, the laughs, the mystery, all these things make this movie what it is. The acting is very good, and it gets you.  Parker Posey is extremely funny in  her performance! She made me laugh a lot during the film.  Neve Campbell is  very good as Sidney Prescott, along David Arquette as the-unforgetable  Dewey Riley. Courteney Cox Arquette is great also, she makes a fantastic  duo with Parker Posey!(The Gale-Gale Duo). Then we have the &quot;Stab 3  cast&quot; by Jenny McCarthy(as Candy, the bitchy unhappy actress), Matt  Kesslar(as Tom Prinze, the teen-idol), Deon Richmond(as Ricky, a  Randy-like-alike character) and Emily Mortimer(as Angelina Tyler, the new  actress who wants to shine). The scenes are very good planned, Wes Craven  did a great job directing the script that Ehren Kruger wrote. If you buy  this movie you will not be dissapointed, its fun and entertaining to see.  Some will see it again and again. I recommend it to every SCREAM and horror  fan, but if you arent one of those youll spent a very good time seeing  this amazing film!
0316777722|5.0|I hesitated writing an on-line review, because I wasn't sure I could possibly share how excited I was about this book and about David Sedaris.  Here's a go at it though:  It was hillarious, catching me off guard every  other sentence.  It was smart and charming, real and personal.  As soon as  I finished the last page, I packaged it up and sent it to my best friend in  France who I know would appreciate it (a good deal of the book deals with  David's adventures in France and with that language).  The book gives a  great introduction to this wonderful writer and wonderful person/soul.  It  was also great to read about his sister Amy (Jerri Blank of &quot;Strangers  with Candy&quot;), and see how she got started.  I've just finished  &quot;Naked,&quot; and am about to dive into &quot;Barrel Fever,&quot; and  &quot;Holidays On Ice&quot;.  Read this book...it subtlely reaffirms how  fun humanity is!
B0000025FG|3.0|With all due respect to the great wisdom of the venerable &quot;Top 500 Reviewer&quot; Ms. Scott, I still think she is a touch off the mark (i.e barking mad) when she denies the influence of disco on one of ELO's most  blatantly commercial offerings, the 1979 &quot;Discovery&quot; album. One  listen to the opening track is all you need to tell you that Jeff Lynne  spent his time since &quot;Out Of The Blue&quot; boogie-ing to the  &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack which was so prevalent at the  time. Several tracks are littered with fast, tinny, disco hi-hats and  &quot;Last Train To London&quot; sports a particularly funky disco-esque  bass-line. It made me shake my booty anyway. That said, it would be unfair  to say that the album is unenjoyable: the swooping strings of &quot;Shine A  Little Love&quot;, the ridiculous Beatles homage / pastiche / rip-off of  &quot;Diary of Horace Wimp&quot; and the stomping drum beat of &quot;Don't  Bring Me Down&quot; (&quot;grrrrrrrrrroooooossssss! &quot;) are all moments  that stick in the mind, but as usual, Jeff Lynne sticks doggedly to his  workable pop formula for the 70's : bolting &quot;classical&quot; music  onto whatever type of music was popular at the time -  &quot;progressive&quot; rock for the earlier albums then disco in  &quot;Discovery&quot;'s case.  This album probably marked ELO's zenith in  commerciality: it was downhill all the way to the sad finale of  the 1986  &quot;Balance of Power&quot; project after this ... this was the era of a  seemingly, uninvincible, multi-million unit shifting, stadium rocking ELO  ... how were we to know &quot;Xanadu&quot; was just around the corner ?
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles Masterpiece. The transformation from the Beatles up to 1966. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the result. I have total respect for George Martin after hearing this finished product. True Lennon and  McCartney were the song writers but the album wouldn't have been what it  was if it weren't for Martin.  No, I still can't say this is the best  Beatles album but yes get it. I can't pick the best Beatles album you just  can't do that.  This album you'll get the lyrics (Not all word for word)and  song recording info. The title song starts off the Beatle first theme album  and introduces Billy Shears (a.k.a. Ringo Starr). Ringo sings on  &quot;While A Little Help From My Friends&quot;. &quot;LSD&quot; sure you  think that's what that song is all about. But I'll believe Lennon saying  his song gave him the idea for the song. &quot;Lucy In The Sky With  Diamonds&quot; no doubt has a psychedelic sound. That makes the song  awesome. &quot;Getting Better&quot; yes that's the one on that TV  commercial. This one is by McCartney and it has a neat guitar slap to it.  &quot;Fixing A Hole&quot; the lead guitar is great. &quot;She's Leaving  Home&quot; By McCartney and Lennon, is a pretty ballad. Lennon's vocals are  great on this. &quot;Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!&quot; The  circus-like song by Lennon. &quot;Within You Without You&quot; the only  song they allowed Harrison to put on here. This you might like if you like  eastern music. &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot; is probably one of the most  popular songs off this album. &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; has a psychedelic  sound to it also. &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; is fun in it's own  way the middle 8 is my favorite part of the song. &quot;Sgt. Pepper's  Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)&quot; has Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison  singing this short song that leads into the end title &quot;A Day In The  Life&quot;. &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; is actually a 4 part song. 3 by  Lennon and 1 by McCartney. The climax at the end is the best part but after  the piano clash has faded don't stop the album yet... There's a surprise at  the end, and get your dog out of the room. You'll understand what I mean if  you hear it. Own The Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. No  music collection is complete without it. Enjoy!
B000009O8A|3.0|I confess I have a warm, soft spot in my heart for violent female revenge movies.  At the top of the list are LA FEMME NIKITA and THE LAST SEDUCTION.  MS. 45 is a very stylish core collection here.  And so we come to I SPIT  ON YOUR GRAVE.  In a way the most realistic of the bunch (the hillbilly  rapists are incredibly believable, much more than the hillbillies in  DELIVERANCE though not as menacing).  But also the simplest plot.  And yet,  not quite so simple.  We know what our heroine is going to do.  But she  diesn't do it by brute force, she does it by trickery and guile, making the  revenge ever-so-sweeter.  Be prepared for a cheaply produced  movie--stitches appear on our heroine's face even though she didn't see a  doctor, but a couple of days later they are all gone as if they never were  there at all, even though she didn't take time out to go to New York to see  a top plastic surgeon.  All right, so the makeup department was  underbudgeted. And the pace of the movie is a bit slow, perhaps because it  was done way back in 1978, when it was probably fast for those days. Three  stars coming from this cheapskate reviewer is high praise, and I believe  you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie if you don't go in expecting  DELIVERANCE.  It definitely belongs on the Female Revenge Movie shelf,  which is saying a lot because it's a short shelf of real goodies.
B000002UB3|5.0|I can't tell you what is the best Beatles'album is. I don't have a favorite because they all are to me. But since I'm taking the time to review all 13 albums I'll start with Abbey Road. This is one of those  albums I remember since day one. Even when I was 4 I can remember putting  this record on the turntable and and let it play it's 47 minutes and odd  seconds. Side One: &quot;Come Together&quot; is an all time favorite of  mine. I don't know why maybe it's because it's a Lennon tune.  &quot;Something&quot; another favorite because Beatle fans know Harrison  can write awesome tunes with great middle 8 sections that are hard to get  out of your head, the same with &quot;While My Guitar...&quot;  &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; is a song with a catchy sound to it  which McCartney wanted as a single. Not ah.. this is really in my opinion  an album song. The kids would love this song. &quot;Oh Darling!&quot;  another McCartney song that he screams. I like it. &quot;Octopus's  Garden&quot; This is Ringo's song that he wrote. I think it's meant for  young children and Ringo fans. It's a fun song. &quot;I Want You (She's So  Heavy)&quot; this Lennon 7 minute and odd second tune ends side one with an  awesome jam. Grandmas usually don't go for this song. This is believed to  be the last song that all Beatles performed on. Side Two: &quot;Here Comes  The Sun&quot; is my Favorite song of all time. I don't know why. I think  it's a personal song to me and it's really a beautiful song. Harrison  really does know how to write rememberable songs. &quot;Because&quot; a  Lennon tune where he, McCartney and Harrison harmonize. Definately an album  song. Now Abbey Road goes into it's medley part. &quot;You Never Give Me  Your Money&quot; which McCartney wrote, starts it off. I wanna say that  this is my favorite part of the medley, but I can't because it gets better  after &quot;Sun King&quot;. &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot; and  &quot;Polythene Pam&quot; Both Lennon tunes, are fast rockers. Then we end  this medley part with &quot;Oh look out..&quot; &quot;She Came In Through  The Bathroom Window&quot; this McCartney tune is just awesome. The rest of  the album is all McCartney. The next medley starts with &quot;Golden  Slumbers&quot; that's a gentle ballad that goes into &quot;Carry That  Weight&quot; with a horn section. &quot;The End&quot; is faster til it gets  to it's climax &quot;And in The End...&quot; Stop stop yet wait (I think  its 16 seconds if I remember) &quot;Her Majesty&quot; just comes on to  finish. I hope this review helped. It's definately worth getting. Hey it's  the first album I listened to. This is a priceless album. I tell you want,  this is one of those albums that's great to listen to in the car when you  are driving late at night going long distance. Enjoy!
0316777722|5.0|I've read all of Sedaris' books, and this is the best one yet.  Practically every selection caused me to laugh out loud.  His pieces on learning French are particularly good.
B000002UYZ|5.0|I give this 5 stars because.. yep you guessed it. The Beatles.. yes they are the band. Compilations for The Beatles are very hard to do and I'm not sure why they were done. You really can't say these 26 songs on this 2 disc  set really tell you what The Beatles are all about. True these songs are on  the radio and are chart toppers of their time (And should be now). I like  all the song on the album. If I were to make this compliation which I might  disappoint some people and it would be hard for me too. And yes I'd stick  strictly to original songs because you can get &quot;Twist And Shout&quot;  on Please Please Me and The Soundtrack for Imagine. Plus I believe pure  talent is if you do your own material especially on a hits or a compilation  set. I'd do it this way Disc 1: 1.&quot;Love Me Do&quot; 2.&quot;Please  Please Me&quot; 3.&quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; 4.&quot;Do You Want  To Know A Secret&quot; 5.&quot;From Me To You&quot; 6.&quot;She Loves  You&quot; 7.&quot;All My Loving&quot; 8.&quot;I Want To Hold Your  Hand&quot; 9.&quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; 10.&quot;A Hard Day's  Night&quot; 11.&quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; 13.&quot;If I  Fell&quot; 14.&quot;And I Love Her&quot; 15.&quot;Eight Days A Week&quot;  16.&quot;I Feel Fine&quot; 17.&quot;She's A Woman&quot; Disc 2:  1.&quot;Help!&quot; 2.&quot;You've Got To Hide Your Love Away&quot;  3.&quot;Ticket To Ride&quot; 4.&quot;Yesterday&quot; 5.&quot;We Can Work It  Out&quot; 6.&quot;Day Tripper&quot; 7.&quot;Drive My Car&quot;  8.&quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot; 9.&quot;Nowhere  Man&quot; 10.&quot;Michelle&quot; 11.&quot;In My Life&quot;  12.&quot;Girl&quot; 13.&quot;Paperback Writer&quot; 14.&quot;Rain&quot;  15.&quot;Taxman&quot; 16.&quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; 17.&quot;Yellow  Submarine&quot; I had to put &quot;Taxman&quot; on there. You need a  Harrison song on the Red Album. I mean I'll recommend the set but you'd  probably enjoy the albums more.
B00004U2GH|5.0|After dealing with the lousy sounding, edited, bleeped CD issue that's  been available for the last 12 years or so, this is a total god-send. The  mastering is immaculate, and it even sounds better than the old LP. Most  importantly, the concert is here in its complete form. <br />The best thing  about this album is the fact that it reminds us that live albums don't have  to be superflous... this one is absolutely essential. The songs, while  familiar take on a unique character, not just of time but of place... there  is a tension and energy evident. This recording places you in the prison  mess hall. Sure, the venue is an acoustic nightmare, but those columbia  engineers really knew what they were doing... it doesn't sound like  carnegie hall, and it's not supposed to. This new remaster extracts all the  ambient detail you need to &quot;hear the room&quot; on good audio gear.  The instruments are correctly placed across the generous soundstage, and  there is a real sense of the air around them. Cash's every phrasing nuance,  cough, breath and chuckle is here. I know I'm making too much of the sound  quality, but it really is essential to understanding how the listener can  become totally involved in the record... it's not one to put on for one  song. Sit in the sweet spot, start from the begining and just *listen*.  Having the complete concert, patter, jokes and all gives it a certain  dramatic tension... it's not just about the songs.<br />The back-to-back rips  through &quot;San Quentin&quot; remain the highlights (with Johnny asking a  gaurd &quot;if any of them are still speaking to me&quot; for a glass of  water between takes)Sure, perhaps the 20th century may have produced  *better* singers but none, and I mean none, were *braver* than the original  man in black.<br />Your record collection and your life in general is  imcomplete without this CD. Even if you have the old two-fer with this and  &quot;Folsom&quot;, spring for the new issue, and the new issue of&quot;Folsom&quot; as well... you can get them for under 10 bucks each, and  that is probably the best thing you can do with 20 bucks these days... If  you are new to Cash, skip the greatest hits for now and dive in with this  disc... hearing the songs in this primal form and tense context will give  you a better idea of the life-and-death nature of Cash's singing.
6305428050|5.0|I don't know what it is, but this movie is the greatest. Maybe its becuase when I was a little kid I liked Elisabeth Shue and now I still like her.  I could recite this whole movie easily. Its just great.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I will admit that I've heard better form these guys but it's still pretty awesome.  Those people who argue about whether their music is actually punk have way too much time.  But I'm not ashamed to own the Cd, and wheter  they're punk or not they've got some awesome music.
6301404440|5.0|My brother and I count Roger Rabbit as one of the best movies ever made.  We used to have all-day Roger Rabbit festivals, where we would watch the movie over and over again.  The movie is THAT fun.  I venture to say it is  a movie for all ages.  Adults will find subtle humor that will go over kids  heads, and kids will love the animation and slap-stick jokes.  This is one  of the most visually amazing movies ever made, and you forget that most of  the characters are cartoons.  This is a movie where the toons truly come to  life.
158234082X|5.0|Like Bourdain, I've been cooking for more years than I care to admit.  My wife gave me this as a gift, and I read it in a few days.  Not an easy task when you work the hours that the culinary trade demands.  I, fortunately,  was never exposed to quite the degree of hedonism that Mr. Bourdain was,  but I can certainly remember similar stories about the kitchens I've worked  in.  The language and attitude of line cooks is just how he spells out;  it's not for the weak or timid.  I laughed many times during reading this  book, because his recollections were a lot like ones I endured.  Being a  chef/cook is not and never will be 'easy'.  To the non-kitchen public,  they'll never understand the hell or joy of the biz, they will find the  book not to their liking.  If you've been through it, read it - it's good  therapy.
6305280711|1.0|Although i am a big Die Hard fan (just loved part 1 and 2) i found this one to be disappointing....the story was way out there and the quality of the movie didn't even come close to the first two...i'm just hoping that  they'll make a part 4 so that the legacy wont end with this one.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" is a record you'd never thought would be so brilliant. This is a record you play a few times and it grows slowly up on you. You accept the fact that this is the best record you've ever heard.  Here's my review on all 11 (well, 12 actually) songs on \\"OK  Computer\\".<br />\\"Airbag\\", it's probably about the danger of drinking and  driving. And when you accidentaly crasch the car an airbag saves your life.  And the feeling is about the joy of being saved by an airbag. Kind of  weird, and the music is the soundtrack of the feeling.<br />\\"Paranoid  Android\\", I must applaud Radiohead for being so brave for releasing a first  single of the album like this one. It's over 6 minutes, very rocky and very  sad. It starts up with an acoustic guitar and then turns over very rocky.  And just in the middle of the song it just stops and the lead singer sings  something that reminds me of a buddha chant. Well not exactly, it goes  \\"rain down, rain down, come on rain down on me\\". And it goes like that for  a good 2 minutes. And it seems the song is about people rejecting you and  being very sensitive. This is the Bohemian Rhapsody of the  90's.<br />\\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\", from what I've learned about the  style of this song, is that it is heavily influenced by jazz music. And I'm  not a jazz fan and that makes me confused how it was influenced by jazz.  The song is probably also about rejection or depression. Or about being  friendly to people but recieving no love back.<br />\\"Exit Music (For A Film)\\",  this is most beautiful track on the CD. It was originally on the soundtrack  to \\"Romeo + Juliet\\". And the song is basically a musical version of the  same movie. You have met THE love of your life and you want to be with that  person every day. The line \\"Now we are one, in everlasting peace\\" brings  you almost to tears, it's a about powerful love. Amazing.<br />\\"Let Down\\", the  one of the two saddest song on the album. To put it simply the song is  aboutbeing let down by someone. But it also takes hold of you and says  that things are going to be okay sooner or later. A comfort.<br />\\"Karma  Police\\", this has to be the most ironic and weirdest song. I guess it's  about the police breaking into parties and wrecking stuff. And being so  powerful to the general society, it goes so far that the police have no  feelings. Which is very true, there are a lot of police brutality going on.  Those who recently witnessed the filmed police brutality do now what I  mean.<br />\\"Fitter Happier\\", basically what the members of Radiohead did with  this track, is to program a lyric into a computer program, into a  Macintosh. And a unemotional kind of voice speaks the lyric to you. And  that's the song plus some weird noises. It's probably about you wake up in  the middle of the night and you can't go back to sleep. And you think of  million things while trying to get back to sleep. I don't think everybody  shares the thought of the lyric to this \\"song\\" though.<br />\\"Electioneering\\",  this is a political song. It's about politicians pretending to care about  people, when it's only their vote they're after.<br />\\"Climbing Up The Walls\\",  this is a very dark song. I have a kind of two thoughts about it. One, it's  probably about the mind of a serial killer, especially when the song goes  \\"either way you turn i'll be there, open up your skull i'll be there\\". Or  it's a deep desperation after the person you truly love. But the song  itself is very brutal especially the ending. This song could be on any Nine  Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson record.<br />\\"No Surprises\\", this is the other  saddest song on the album. It's about emptiness and disbelief. I guess  people who had a terrible job would say that this suits their mood. And it  does really help you if you feel depressed. The line \\"no alarms and no  surprises please\\" says it all.<br />\\"Lucky\\", this song was released back in  1995 on a album called HELP to help the war victims in the former  Yugoslavia. Can't say much about the song but the line \\"kill me sarah, kill  me again, with love\\" pretty sums it up. It's about people fearing for their  life and loved ones in wars just like in Yugoslavia.<br />\\"The Tourist\\", is a  song that didn't make any impression on me. What I've read about the  recording of that song, is that they made it in a quite hurry. It was at  the end of the recording session and it all was quite go by ear.
B00004STPT|2.0|Ok...I cant be the only one to notice how much of a blatant rip off of the &quot;Mars&quot; section from Holst's &quot;The Planets&quot; this score is.  I have no problem with someone being inspired by a piece of work, but  for god's sake dont copy it note for note!   This cd rambles on and  on...the 2 or 3 main musical themes in this soundtrack just keep taking  turns.  I thought my player was on repeat, its hard to tell most of the  tracks from each other.  For the most part they are bland and repetitive.   The music worked in the film, but as a piece of work by itself it falls  flat on its face.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Everybody says her voice &amp; the music has matured. The only thing that has is the music. And that's only a little bit. Her vocal ablity has not mature at all. Just because the songs are more catchy,does not mean she has  matured as an artist. Her &amp; the songs lack a great deal. Other than the  fact that her songs have got more uptempo it sound like the first CD. Don't  get me wrong I am not saying she has no talent,it just not as impressive as  other artists. As far as being enjoyable it is probably 5 on a scale of  1-10. If you like pure pop you'll love it, but if you like me it's okay.
0783226063|3.0|For those of you who are  complaining about not having a director's cut, need I remind you that this IS the director's cut!   This is the only version approved by Lynch.The so called &quot;long version&quot; (or  &quot;director's cut&quot;) was not approved by Lynch, was very poorly  edited and the special effects weren't even finished (no blue eyes on the  Fremen, for example).  Lynch had his name removed from the credits, and  rightfully so.  Also, this so called &quot;4 hour long version&quot; is in  fact about 2 hours and 45 minutes.   You will probably never see the long  version on video or DVD, at least not while Lynch is alive to fight it  anyway.  That aside, I thought this film (both versions) was quite  inconsistent.  It was beautifully cast and photgraphed, but the characters  are a bit shallow and the scenes are quite rushed, as Lynch did his best to  keep this film running at 2 hours.   The worms are the highlight of the  special effects...they are quite remarkable!  However they lose alot of  their impact on a television screen,  they dont look near as monstrous as  they must have been on the big screen.  The only people who will enjoy this  movie are hardcore Lynch fans and fans of the Dune books, but the Lynch fan  will definitely like it better.
B000035Z3K|4.0|I found the Glass score to be very helpful to the movie - it is in the style of the period, and although it does play over the dialogue in many instances, it serves a very useful role in papering over the shortcomings  of director Browning's work, and establishing a somber, foreboding mood,  when all the viewer is otherwise hearing is scratchy silence and jarringly  bad (by today's standards, of course) accents and acting.  To say nothing  of the armadillos in Castle Dracula!  The movie stood up to modern viewing  much better with it, in my opinion.  The documentary notes and commentary,  with their focus on the far better Spanish version included are the  highlights of the DVD, however.  Watching the Spanish version is a real  treat.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Anyone who is interested in the possibilities of film should see this astounding work, David Lynch's first, and in my opinion one of the all-time greats. It is the antithesis of the usual Hollywood experience where the  viewer is usually spoon-fed a cliched, formulaic plot. In this case the  film is what the viewer makes of it - I believe most, if not all of the  &quot;story&quot; takes place in the protagonist's mind. Perhaps it's a  glimpse into the mind of someone slowly going insane? Perhaps not.  No  matter - you actually have to think and decide for yourself. Eerie,  haunting, unsettling and memorable, Eraserhead is nevertheless extremely  funny in parts, which keeps the viewer off-guard. A unique experience and  unlike any other film I have ever seen.
B00003CWOL|5.0|This movie is a great follow up to the Jersey Trilogy. It further develops the characters of Jay and Silent Bob while creating new characters. Being a big fan of Kevin Smith's other movies, Clerks, the outrageously underrated  Mallrats and the more serious but still great Chasing Amy, it is probably  not surprising that I loved this movie. I saw it in the theatre twice and  bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. I can't see where the critics are  coming from who criticize this movie. It is not in the least offensive to  anyone except those who are so caught up in their religion that they can't  see past their own opinions. This movie makes many points about where  religion is going in this country.  I would recommend this movie to anyone  who loves the other Kevin Smith movies, Kevin has never disappointed before  and he doesn't disappoint now. I would also suggest this movie to anyone  who loves to laugh. I would even recommend this movie to really religious  people, maybe you'll learn something.
6305910103|4.0|This is still one of the best Star Trek films along with First Contact. We all know the film by now, needless to say, it's very well scripted, characterised and pretty well acted.<br />The DVD itself though is a  disappointment. I refuse to believe that the picture quality couldn't have  been any better, it's quite grainy in some places, probably not because of  the transfer but from the master film they used. Sound quality is also  pretty dull, it's functional, you can hear the stereo but it's not clear  and punchy.<br />Other features on the DVD? A theatrical trailer (really takes  you back to the eighties!) but nothing else at all. There's masses of  features they could be adding to these releases but have chosen not to at  this stage. The most exciting thing is the leaflet inside showing that The  Next Generation is soon to be released on DVD. So expect re-releases in a  few years so you can buy it again.....<br />So 5/5 for the film and 2/5 for  the DVD. You should still buy it though, it's better than the VHS and the  Laserdisc!
B00004TL21|5.0|I bought this down in Oregon on a 2 day road trip and it was the best thing ever!  It was not at all what I expected from them considering I only have the first CD which I love and recommend you listening too also...  I think this is progression at its finest you can realy see how much they  have grown as a band and musically.... they have more then proved they can  do more then make a liitle noise for the pit people which I ma but when you  want a good chill album this is one to have at the top of your list... It  has a few totally rockin songs to help keep a good flow and to make all you  die hards happy too but for people who love to see a band evolve like I do  then pick this up and see what I mean!
B000020617|3.0|I was disappointed with this album. The music is good but it drags on a bit. IT is nothing compared to The Colour and the Shape and i would certainly recommend that over this.I was especially disappointed with  Aruora which i had heard so many good reviews about.<br />However, there are  some excellent songs like &quot;Stacked Actors&quot; and &quot;Learn to  Fly&quot;.
0805062971|4.0|I unfortunately came to Fight Club via the movie. After seeing the movie I was agitated. Concepts were introduced and not developed, the story telling was haphazard. Fight Club became a reluctant memory. Then a friend started  to feed me propoganda about the greatness of fight club. Not really swayed  by his viewpoints, fight club again became a memory. Until the book came  into my life.<br />Where and how I do not know. But the fact of the matter is  I acquired a copy of Fight Club the novel. And I read it. My friend was  right, fight club is powerful. The problems I had with the movie were  aleviated by the book. Fulfilled concepts and a story that didn't have  holes, and thankfully there was quite a bit more ambigity. Fight Club  assualts all that you know. Read the book, then watch the movie.

6304539258|5.0|This is the movie that started the legend. This movie is excellent i mean it has great music, excellent graphics, good storyline, and lots of action.<br />This movie is my favorite next to &quot;The Empire Strikes  Back&quot; but thats another story. This is the movie that started  everything. I mean we could all identify with luke who wanted to get off  that dustball of a planet and fly in the stars with the rebellion. I for  one would love to do that.
6305897786|5.0|Many people (including mainstream reviewers) don't comprehend that &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; is geared as a black comedy and not a straight-on supernatural horror fest such as &quot;End of Days&quot; or  &quot;The Omen&quot; or such.  <br />It's full of Polanski's wonderful macabre  wit and penchant for detail and always steers clear from the typical.  It's  also jaw-droppingly gorgeous to behold--from camerawork to art direction,  costume, editing, music, etc.  Everything works.  From Langella's  &quot;666&quot; code to the gray streaks in Depps's hair to the hilarious  coven of bored, wealthy satanists.<br />It's only slow moving if you're  expectations are seeking the obvious.<br />Absolutely brilliant film.  And the  DVD's terrific as well.

0553208845|3.0|As a Global History teacher in New York it is very important to teach about religions.  Religions has been a major topic on most of the statewide Global History and Studies tests for the last few years.  And of course,  when talking about Global religions it is very important to discuss  Buddhism and its founder Siddartha.<br />Having taught Buddhism for over 5  years now, I finally got the chance to read Hesse's novel Siddartha.  I  found it on a display of recommended high school reading.<br />I must say I  enjoyed sitting in a local park, looking at a nearby pond and reading this  book.  I especially enjoyed the parts when Siddartha gave up his material  items.  I found the passages when he realized life was suffering and that  he must rid himself of desires, wants, and material possessions.<br />However,  one aspect of the novel confused me enough to leave me with mixed feelings  about it.  Call me stupid, but what messed me up was that there was a  character in the book known as the Buddha, Gautama, and yet Siddartha was  another character.  Siddartha was the founder of Buddhism and his title was  Buddha, and yet they were two different people in the book.  Or were they?  Was Siddartha and the Buddha in the book really the same person but Hesse  just did not come out with it directly?  Or is Hesse contrasting his  character, a fictional Siddartha, with the real Buddha?  I am not  sure.<br />Also, as a teacher I would not assign this entire book to a 9th or  10th grader which are the grades who study Buddhism.  Personally, I do not  think this is the type a book most high school students would enjoy or  fully understand.  I had trouble with it and I am the teacher.  However,  there were certain parts and passages of the book that I certainly would  discuss in class.  So I recommend certain parts of this book to be used in  school and not assigning the whole book to kids.<br />I am glad I read this  book and look forward to reading it again and understanding even more of  it.  This strikes me as the type of book you learn something new from each  time you look at it.n more of  it.  This strikes me as the type of book you learn something new from each  time you look at it.

B000021XS0|5.0|DreamTheater's &quot;Metropolis Pt.2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; is the  most exciting album I have ever heard.  The storyline is a deep murder  mystery filled with several twists and turns.  The suspenseful question of  what will happen next keeps you listening until the very end.  The music  does an excellent job of bringing out the dialog and painting detailed  pictures of what is going on.  The talented musicians use smooth, fluid  transitions to flow from one melody to the next with ease.      You will  not be bored while listening to this album!  The variance between styles,  keys, rhythms, and tempos keeps your attention at all times and makes you  feel the mood of each presented situation.  A final surprise at the end of  the album leaves you with a mystery to solve on your own, involving you  personally in the complexity of the story.  This album is a must-have!   Also, if you want to hear more about two of the characters from this story,  see track 5 on DreamTheater's album, &quot;Images and Words,&quot; entitled  Metropolis-Pt.I: The Miracle &amp; The Sleeper.
630463949X|4.0|This is as the Eagles, Steely Dan and others have done.  Choose a soundstage, a small live audience and rock.... The video was clear, with multiple camera angles.  The audio was superb as well.  I watched it in 5.1  and 2.0, and I prefer the AC-3 version of 5.1.  Once again, the production  was well thought out, these people can still put on a show...
B000002HMH|3.0|When I got this album when it first came out, I thought that it would be a another really great album. I had heard many rumors that metallica would be going back to their 80s sound, but instead they go and make Load. Most of  the songs don't live up to what metallica is. There are a ges songs that  are good like until it sleeps but most of the album is bland like king  nothing and the house that jack built. This album has marked their decline  as metal pioners to metal downfall.
B00000K19E|3.0|I'm not going to dispute that &quot;The Matrix&quot; has entertainment value. Some of the scenes are truly loud and visually mesmerizing. Though some scenes had an artifical look to them they were entertaining  nonetheless. The battle that develops between Neo(Keanu Reeves) and Agent  Smith(Hugo Weaver) is very entertaining. The monotony of the voice of Agent  Smith will bring back memories of Ben Stein's blurb in &quot;Ferris  Bueller's Day Off&quot;.(&quot;Anyone,Anyone&quot;)It's fun with a capital  F when they duke it out using martial arts and Agent Smith taunts Neo  calling him Mr. Anderson. There is a forgivable lack of characterization.  The setting involves a great deal of tension and it is understandable that  the characters don't have the time to sit down over a cup of tea and  describe themselves in great detail to each other and the audience. The  action and drama more than makes up for the lack of characterization.     There are some flaws. The first is the style of the writing. The writing  violates one of the first principles taught to you in an introductory  English class. The characters do way too much explaining and the movie does  more telling than showing. It is odd to hear Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne)  tell Neo that nobody can be told what the Matrix is than have him go right  ahead and tell Neo what it is.(Some mentor he is)Watch out for numerous  overly explanatory phrases where it seems that they almost freeze frame for  a moment and explain to the audience what just happened. Show don't tell.     The thought provoking aspect of this film doesn't make as much sense as it  would seem when you listen to Morpheus's endless babbling. The Matrix is  described as a virtual world controlled by living machines. People are  enslaved, unaware that the world they live in is just an illusion  programmed by the machines and translated by the human mind. It is  understood that those unaware that they are in the Matrix can experience  all five computer controlled senses and therefore can be killed in the  Matrix. The rebels who have escaped the Matrix are cooped up in a ship  where they hack into the Matrix. They enter the Matrix aware of the fact  that it is an illusionary world created by the machines yet they still can  experience all five computer controlled senses. I have a problem with their  level of awareness. It is impossible for your mind to experience the full  range of five senses in two different &quot;realities&quot; at once. They  are aware of the real world and the virtual world when they enter the  Matrix. It is like entering a dream but knowing you were entering a dream.  You could see and maybe hear but you cannot feel and experience the  situation as if it were really happening. It is hard to manipulate the  senses of touch, taste, and smell. When you have a spontaneous dream and  you are unaware that it is a dream you can experience all five senses. It  is as if you were there. So, when bullets are fired at the rebels and the  Matrix tells them they are real then why can't they counter that with  remembering they are in the Matrix and those bullets are artificially  created by the Matrix and not real. Can thought/awareness affect how your  senses work?  If there is no spoon as Neo learns then why isn't there any  bullets right from the start. How can you be killed by something you  already know doesn't exist?    &quot;The Matrix&quot; asks questions about  what reality is but never comes up with an answer and ends without  attempting to resolve that issue. I have my own answer. In looking at what  is real it is important to focus on the senses of touch, taste, and even  smell.(Sight and hearing are too easily manipulated)  In nature when you  touch something with your finger, for example, there are nerves in your  fingers that send a response to your brain that then translates that and  sends a signal back to your finger to illicit the correct response,  whatever it may be. Virtual reality, in mymind, on the other hand, starts  with the mind bypassing the initial touching of the finger to a keyboard,  for example, and even though you haven't touched that keyboard it sure  feels like you did. Reality starts with the outside world and how the  senses react to it. A message is sent to the brain from another part of the  nervous system present on the human body. Virtual reality starts in the  mind bypassing the outside world and how the senses react to it. It  emulates the desired effect. In other words by stimulating the correct area  of the brain you can trick the body into sensing whatever you desire. When  you watch &quot;The Matrix&quot; and you see the rebels reenter the Matrix  just question whether virtual reality and true reality can exist at the  same time? Does it make any difference that you know something is not real?  Can it still physically harm you? Enjoy the ride.
B000002H2H|5.0|THe 1980s were the peak of metallica's good music. They seem to have been declinign since then. The songs on this album are really well written. Listen to songs like fade to black, fight fire with fire and call of ktulu.  These songs all far out do albums like reload and load. A must have for a  metallica fan.
0515127485|4.0|English historian Fluke Kelso meets one of Stalin's old bodyguards in a Moscow bar. The old man tells an interesting tale about how he was there the night Stalin died and he knows where Stalin's old notebook is buried.  But before Kelso can get the location from the old man, the old man  disappears. Together with American correspondent, RJ O'brien, Kelso finds  the notebook but it's not what it seems. To uncover the puzzle they must  follow the trial to the frozen north of Archangel with Stalin acolytes and  a Spetznatz hit squad on their tail.<br />This is a very literate book for a  thriller. Robert Harris knows how to write and he knows how to plot. The  action moves along smoothly drawing Kelso ever deeper into the intrigue.  Even though we find out the secret halfway through the book it doesn't take  away from the enjoyment and the ending. I'd recommend this book highly.
B000002HRE|3.0|This album is ok but it is obvious that metallica i spast its createive peak with this album. The songs seem to just drag on like the memory remains or devil's dance. Unforgiven2 is pretty food but why keep the intro  from the original Unforgiven? They albums that they have done since this  album continue to prove metallica has run out of ideas. Garange inc, an  album of covers. S&amp;M, has just two new songs, one of which they have  been working on for years. The others are just stuff from previous albums.  So far, there is no info about a metallica album with all new material on  it. Lars says that 2000 is an off year for metallica so don't go holding  your breath for it.
B000005S0E|5.0|After so many years, still the best Cure's album for me. If you know The Cure well enough to discern their substyles, this will be a good find for you: this disk is a new chapter. It is hard to describe it in terms of  other Cure's albums: it is quite different. Not the easy listening they  were doing of late, and not quite as depressing and gripping at the throat  as &quot;Pornograpy&quot;. A lot more elegance, a lot more light, a lot  more definition to the style. Personally, I consider &quot;The Top&quot;  (along with &quot;Kiss me&quot; perhaps) the most pure, pronounced, and  emotionally charged album of theirs. Simply paralyzing. Have not heard  anything better in this style yet. (Drop me a line if you have).
6304925034|5.0|This is a superb, as the amazon reviewer says, deeply satisfying movie. New layers are constantly revealed to the plot, and Nicholson's character thrills with his reckless persistence in the face of the unknown, and his  ability to always know more than people think. That he survives through the  end of the movie simultaneously defies commonsense and thrills, like  watching Emmet Smith dodge five tackles in a row (only to lose the ball on  the goal line).<br />What does Nicholson say in his final line?
B000007OY0|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List have a common theme:  Using the system to achieve one's goal.  In the case of Oscar Schindler, he used  the corrupt NAZI government system to save lives.  In the Shawshank  Redemption, banker Tim Robbins (Andy) is convicted of a double-murder --  killings that he did not commit.<br />Tim Robbins (Andy) realizes that  bucking the system will only get him hurt.  So, Tim Robbins decides to use  his time constructively.  That is, instead of rocking the boat and causing  problems, he uses the corrupt and brutal prison system to his benefit.<br />Eventually, by being the model, helpful prisoner; he earns the trust of  the crooked prison warden and the cruel, brutal jailers. This opens the  door for Robbins's escape<br />Sure, we can focus on Andy's escape from  prison.  However, this is not the point of the film.  The lesson in this  movie is on using time constructively to work within a given system, not  against it. Working against a system gets you branded as a trouble maker, a  ne'er-do-well, a radical; and, eventually, it could get you thrown in jail,  or worse.  You can accomplish more by working within a system -- no matter  how corrupt, cruel, or brutal -- to achieve a desired goal; to make a  difference -- as in the case of Oscar Schinder and Andy.<br />This movie is  definitely worth watching more than one time.  The film does not drag on;  it moves along at a decent pace.  While watching this film, you will see  how Tim Robbins uses the system to his benefit.  Tim Robbins and Morgan  Freeman put on a stellar performance.<br />Good movie. . . .Good Acting. . .  Good Lesson. . . Good fun.
0670451495|5.0|Children naturally are interested in understanding a parent's perspective on the family.  Mr. and Mrs. Mallard's search for a safe home for their future family makes a wonderful story for children and parents to explore  and understand more about parental love.  Although the book has a 4-8 age  reading level, younger children enjoy having it read to them (based on the  experiences of my four children).  The illustrations are terrific and draw  the child's interest very easily.  Older children like to reread the story  because of its comfortable connection to their more youthful years and  reinforcement of their sense of being wanted, loved, and belonging.<br />To  me, the best part of the book is that the locations are actually easy to  find in Boston.  So if you live in the Boston area or ever come here, you  can also take your children to experience the story.  I know my younger  daughter thought that her first Swan boat ride in the Public Garden was the  ultimate moment in her life (up to that point).  She kept wanting to know  which duck was Mrs. Mallard, and which one was Mr. Mallard.  Then she  wanted to spot Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack (my favorite name in the  book), Pack, and Quack.  I had a ball! There are also statues of Mrs.  Mallard and her 8 offspring that the children can touch.  There's also an  annual parade that you can participate in.<br />If you don't know the story,  here's a summary:  Mr. and Mrs. Mallard were looking for a place to live  where they could raise a family safely.  Whenever Mr. Mallard found  someplace he liked, Mrs. Mallard worried about foxes and turtles.  Finally  they got to the pond in the Public Garden in Boston, and were too tired to  go on.  So they spent the night on the little island there.  The next  morning they could not find much food, until the people on the Swan boats  began to throw them peanuts.  But the Mallards were almost run over by a  bicycle, so they felt they needed a safer place.  They tried several, but  each had a drawback.  Finally, they found an island in the Charles River  not far from the Public Garden that met all their requirements.  Michael,  the policeman, fed them peanuts.  Soon, Mrs. Mallard laid 8 eggs, and  stayed to hatch them.  After the ducklings were born, they learned to swim  and walk single file behind their Mother.  One day, she walked them towards  the Public Garden.  But they could not get across the highway.  Michael  spotted them and stopped the traffic so they could cross.  He called Clancy  at the station and told him to send a car to help Mrs. Mallard and the  ducklings cross at the Public Garden.  When in the pond there, they met Mr.  Mallard on the little island.  They decided to live there, and followed the  Swan boats for peanuts after that.<br />I have enjoyed reading this story  and reading it to children for almost 30 years.  I look forward to reading  it to my grandchildren when the time comes.  It has also been my favorite  book to give as a gift to new parents.<br />Enjoy the wonderful gift of warm  family feeling in this book, and leave your stalled thinking about your  cares and worries behind.  It will remind you what is really important in  your life!everal, but  each had a drawback.

0783242808|4.0|I usually do not like movies that are aimed towards the teenaudience, even though I am a teen myself(18 years old). In the past Ihad found these movies ridiculously stupid, mainly because it takes no extraordinary intellectual effort to make them. With that aside I found this movie very funny and surprisingly enjoyable. The thing that I enjoyed the mostis that it correctly protrayed teen sex life with a bunch of different personality types. My opinion is that if teens want to have sex then it's their choice, hopefully they'll do it with thought and understanding of the consequences. Anyway great movie. <br />Peace to all the teens out there.
B000002P72|5.0|Wow!  That is all that can really be said.  Very rarely is a live album this good.  Almost 40 years and still the standard by which all others should be judged!  BB is in nearly perfect voice and his guitar sings like  only he can make it sing.  I could listen to this for days at a time!
