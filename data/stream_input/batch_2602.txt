B00CWY76CC|5.0|An 11 year old and 7 year old girl challenged me... GAME ON. I'm hooked now. Wish i had all the levels...
B004H4XDBI|4.0|After reading If I Stay, I knew I had to read Where She Went, even if it ended up being terrible. I had to know what happened AFTER. I was nervous when I started the book, but the author carried over into Adam's voice seamlessly. The book provided closure for If I Stay.<br />Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the end. Adam's voice seems replaced - I realize he's not all surly anymore but he didn't have to go to the total opposite end of the spectrum, either.<br />Overall, great read. Will read more of her stuff in the future.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I thought this as a good series when it was, on and was sad to see it go by the wayside. I think anyone in to SiFy will like to watch. I have seen it more than once and still enjoy it.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I was really disappointed by the plot of the movie. It seemed silly to me. As a life long Oz fan, I can't say I recommend the movie to others.
125000098X|5.0|I can't wait for the next volume to come out. Each one is better than the last. Very enjoyable series.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|This is a great lineup of tracks for listening straight through. There are several standout songs, but the album as a whole is great!
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|Great, easy, fun read in the vein of her other books!  Would highly recommend as a light-hearted summer beach read!
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|When I saw that this device let you share photos over WiFi, I was afraid that both your phone and the device had to be connected to a router in order for this to work properly. That's not the case. Rather, you connect to the MobileLite, which acts as its own WiFi router (that you can connect to your other WiFi router so your devices can stay connected to the internet when using the MobileLite).<br /><br />Thus, this is fully functional as a wireless SD card reader that can work even when you're in the middle of nowhere, wanting to transfer your camera's photos to your iPhone (so that you can edit them, upload them to Facebook, Flickr, etc).<br /><br />The MobileLite also advertises itself as being able to charge your phone, but it runs out of juice pretty quick when in \\"charge\\" mode. You'll probably only get 1/2 to 3/4 of a charge on your phone before it dies.<br /><br />Worth mentioning is that the device is less-than-intuitive to use, but not so much that you have to be a tech geek to figure it out.<br /><br /> At any rate, if you need a good solution for getting photos from an SD card to your phone, this is a great buy!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be from the preview. It was a cute & romantic zombie movie.  You may enjoy it if you're looking for something light with a good story.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khaled Hosseini is a great story teller.  I enjoyed this book, but needed to pay very good attention to the characters.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|To me this is a film that explores the concept of reincarnation and interestingly, how some souls may be benevolent in one life, and less so in another. It also examines how a god figure is created. This is a movie that will promote discussion and debate.  Aside from the high concept themes, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" has something for everyone: romance, mystery, comedy, and even some good sci-fi action. Note that the film has an R rating, and contains some disturbing scenes.<br /><br />As most of the lead actors played multiple roles in this movie, some of the makeup effects were less believable than others, and some seemed gratuitous, but the story of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" held my interest from start to finish.<br /><br />Clocking in at just under three hours, this movie shifts between stories and timelines more than any film I've ever seen - the result could have been a mess - they did a great job making the whole experience cohesive and satisfying at the conclusion - there wasn't one boring moment.<br /><br />Great cast overall, but Tom Hanks stands out as always.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" looks stupendous on Blu ray!
0316056898|5.0|A wonderfully fun read.  Tina straight talks growing up in a way only she can.  I purchased four more copies for my sisters and friends.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good character development.  So many twists and turns.  It kept me up all night to finish this read. I liked it very much.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|I forgot how much I like Paul Newman and Robert Redford as a team.<br />  This way I have a western to view if there is nothing good on television
B00A6WSTIW|5.0|This movie is one of the best shark thrillers around. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone wanting a sea thriller.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Great game though I was somewhat addicted and finished it quickly. Waiting for Tree of Life 2. I loved it.
0345455681|4.0|kept me involved and interested all the way.  lots of characters and intertwining of generations.  good perspective on the overall history of the development of london.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Good game, good for casual play, only problem is the game seems to be replaying same game over and over.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughters as they wanted to read it before the movie came out.  As I had nothing to read I decided to give it a go.  I had never heard of this book until the promos for the movie came out and so I had no expectations.  In fact I was surprised how long ago it was published.  I couldn’t put the book down.  I was engrossed almost from the beginning and really enjoyed the characters and the story.  This is definitely a book I would recommend to adults who like a bit of dystopian science fiction in the vein of the Hunger Games Books as well as kids and teens from say 10 up in age.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the most awsomist and addictive game ever ,just cant get enough i play it any time i can and when you start playing you cant put the game down so much so im late for work a couple of times a week.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I have movie day with my brother once or twice a month and he loves Bruce Willis and really enjoyed this show, as for me I thought it pretty good, not the best in the series but good.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Really appreciate the availability of the Phantom of the Opera on Amazon Prime.  Timeless musical. One of my all time favorites.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|The flick had alot of action and a pretty good story I rented it because my 17 year old wanted to see it she loved it .It was okay kept me awake.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love this CD and just purchased his other CD.  I wish there were more out there.  The movie Finding Sugarman was fabulous and I highly recommend it.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|i liked most of Arnies movies and this was okay too it kept me watching and had some good action. glad to see him baaack!!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and recommend everyone see it. A story of relationships, friendship, diversity and compassion. It's based on a true story which makes it more powerful. It will make you laugh and cry. Simply brilliant.
B00271HAK8|5.0|I have watched this movie when I was a teenager in the 80's, and now watch it with my kids!!! They love it as much as I do. Classic and everyone should watch over and over again.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Great book! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Best book so far. Always enjoy his books because I have never read a bad one.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Tom Cruise was excellent!!! Never been a huge fan but it was a great movie. Plot was good. I would watch it again.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game was born to be on a a &larr; Touch again to save tablet.  The swipe of a finger is perfect<br />//
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the-best book I have read. This is the 2nd time I read it because of the coming of the picture in November and I enjoyed it a lot. The story itself is amazing and I this it is a must book for anyone in a leadership position.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|Its a cool concept and fun at first but after you play it a couple times it gets boring. It should upgrade offering more mutations and ways to play
B00A8ECU24|4.0|its great to play unless it needs an update, then it glitches to where what you did before doesn't stick and then you have to do it again... its a hassle when u reach that stage, but otherwise its a great game.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I really like this game. I spent almost all day to enjoy this game.<br />I will recommend this game to all of my friends.
145210655X|5.0|This book was adorable.  Two of my grandsons are big Star Wars fans (ages 8 & 5).  This book was very cute for the 5 year old, plus the 8 year old enjoyed it, too!!  The illustrations were also done very well.  Highly recommended!
0545265355|5.0|These hardback books, along with the box built to hold them, are not only a great read but look good on the shelf after you finish them, too!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Said there was something wrong with the server so I never did get it to work so I deleted it and now I want to try it again and can't find it. You might want to help me here.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|Nice spin on Zombie 'Mythos' - Don't expect too much depth, but it's light-[Dark Humor] and enjoyable. Try not to watch too many trailers, the movie isn't that long.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Alice and wonderland meets Japanese anime. Bizarre tale of a family divided and a little girl's struggle to reunite them.  On the way, the girl meets a dragon and weird monsters at a bath house.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Honestly this was a good book the story the climax it was written well very nice book. BUT.... I am sorry Sylvia is this the best you could come up with the ending It was just stupid... The book was delicious all the scenes were Great but the ending was a total L
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show, good acting, good story line, what more could you want. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a little sci-fi
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|If you're reading this review then what is wrong with you?<br /><br />It's MOONWALKER in HIGH DEFINITION.<br /><br />You know you want this.
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|this was a very disappointing movie given the caliber of actors involved.  i can't quite put my finger on it since the production value was there and the performances were all okay, but something was just off.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Too many good books to read...too little time. All of the Clifton Chronicles books are a good read. I'd recommend them to anyone.
B0048KXRPS|5.0|&#34;Greetings people of poo! We come from the land of soap!&#34; So, yes, childish humour that your stuffy aunt may disapprove of but which children and adults who remember what it was to be children will find hilarious. Hilarity aside, the children learn valuable lessons from Nanny McPhee.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|free edition only ten levels? wish there was more. i found the ten levels challenging enough but not frustrating. cant wait for more free levels
B00CH87HF4|4.0|While the game is light on story, the graphics and gameplay is nice. I find myself playing 'just one more minute...' to get that next item to power up.
B00CRQV1TY|4.0|It gives new life to old songs. I am really enjoying it. Good songs performed well never go out of style...
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game has pretty good graphics and really fun. I recommend this if u like war games. AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!!! I played it for 6 hours strait... get it!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game. It is a unique hidden object game because you don't know what you'relooking for until you find it.  Im only giving it 4 stars because its not very complex so it doesn't take long &amp; I don't think its something I would want to play more than once.
B001NGUMDA|5.0|Love this album. Great old school deftones. A must for any deftones fan. And at a price cheaper than the record store.
1451648537|4.0|I had already read this on my kindle app and enjoyed the book very much. It's such a great insight into the life of one of the most influential person for his time, a modern Albert Einstein. My only problem was with the shipping. Now it was super speedy, only took two days. However the book wasn't protected and the top corner was wrinkled and I can't get it straightened. Also the bottom of the pages is marked with dirt. It was just in the box and wasn't wrapped, most likely contributing to the damage. Not a problem of anybody affiliated with the book, just amazon.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I must admit to being over 50 and still very much enjoying this movie that targeted a much younger audience.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I do a significant amount of home projects and woodworking.  This calculator makes fractional mathematics a breeze.  It is clear and easy to use.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to make sure their measurements are divided correctly.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This was a quick read but a good one. I like almost anything by John Grisham, and, while this is written for a younger audience, I still enjoyed it (especially the Animal Court segment).
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use my yahoo account to signup to various groups like Freecycle, Craigslist, etc.  As such, I need to keep this email clean.  This app was a great choice.  I can easily navigate, clean up, and even respond to email from my device.  I highly recommend it.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The show is well written and the photography is breathtaking.  I love the stories and the imagery!  I would recommend this show to adults only.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have played on the kindle if you think about getting it, DO IT. Trust me it will one of your best chose on the kindle.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This CD has the best music from the movie and the additional enclosed booklet is full of interesting information and lyrics.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Album is great from start to finish. The teaser videos released before the actual release were also incredible.<br />Enjoy the album artwork too.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I use OfficeSuite Pro for basic Word Processing and Spreadsheets on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and it works for what I would need. There are more detailed reviews here if you are looking for them. I am writing this review to let everyone know that the version on Amazon currently has issues saving to DropBox and Google Drive. Sugar Sync still works. But, if you contact MobiSystems, they will direct you to download the latest version from their site and will give you a license key to activate it.
B00ARF92HK|1.0|This movie seems to drag on forever.  Nothing special would make for a good epitaph.<br /><br />The acting is mediocre, the script is so-so and it is hard to make it through the whole movie.
B00CFA222M|4.0|Director Bryan Singer's visionary flair and state of the art CGI helps establish JACK THE GIANT SLAYER as this year's classiest fairy tale reboot.<br />Unlike the souped up world of HANSEL AND GRETEL, JACK's landscape is vintage fairy tale with disgusting and frightening titans, nasty and traitorous humans and honorably noble heroes.  While Nicholas Hoult and Eleanor Tomlinson are appropriately squeaky clean as Jack and Isabelle, they are also quite dull...not so much their acting, but the script gives the best roles to the secondary performers:  Ewan McGregor doing a smart Deppish flair as heroic Elmont; Stanley Tucci's foppish turn as the diabolical Roderick; Ian McShane, Bill Nighy, John Kassir....all get scene stealing moments.  JTGS is about 10 minutes too long but overall, it's a rousing and enjoyable adventure.
0446672653|5.0|great book! answered a lot of my Qs. easy to read and helps you find ur path in life. recommend to everyone!
1476734941|5.0|My doctor told me I needed to lose weight and suggested the Fast Diet.  I'm a 58 year old male. I lost 47 lbs in 3 months (255 to 208 lbs). I followed the diet as it was described in the book.  My weight loss really wasn't that difficult. I've tried lots of diets over the years with limited success, but this one worked. It's a very simple diet to follow.<br /><br />The other problem with diets is that they are not sustainable over time. I believe the 5/2 approach is sustainable. You get to live normally for 5 days a week and you may actually enjoy the 2 fast days as I do. I enjoy the fast days because I feel so good the day after. The fast days give your body a break and in return, your body rewards you by feeling better.<br /><br />Based on my experience, I believe the magic is the two fast days.  The book explains the science behind this so I won't repeat it here. My point is that this diet isn't a gimmick like so many others. It's a simple common sense approach based on the science of the human body.<br /><br />Do you need to buy the book for this diet to work? Probably not. The diet is so simple you can understand it in about 30 seconds. However, for about the price of a Big Mac and super-sized fries and soda, it's helpful to understand the science behind why it works. For that reason alone, the book is worth it.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Fast Diet.
6305511055|5.0|Very good movie with lots of suspense.  Of course, Robert Redford made a lot of good movies, but this one is a great thriller and with an amount of class lacking today.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|one of the best book I have read in years. Amazing writing and amazing glimpses into avantgarde NYC of the 70's
B0047Y17P2|3.0|Love Mickey Haller and that's what makes this book OK.  Usually, Connelly engages me much more and I was a little disappointed with this effort.  Almost felt like the book was some kind of survey to see if a movie should/could be made.  If this is the way Connelly is going, ala Patterson, I think I may have to take my money to another table.<br />There's still Harry Bosch though!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I was not disappointed in this Dan Brown novel. The description of the landscape and the surrounding areas as well as the characters was well done. The storyline kept the reader's interest until the last page.
B003V5ED7W|4.0|Really good family movie.  Funny.  Has a good message.  Holds up well over time.  Watched it with my 5 and 8 year old boys and we all had some good laughs.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I cannot say how much I absolutely love this series.  It is so unlike anything else that is on TV right now.  I'm just so sick of reality TV and this is a welcome change.  I am in love with all of the characters and cannot wait for the next season to start!
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Great selection of cover tunes, great lineup, well executed songs.<br />gets alot of play at high volumes in my music lineup
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Love Shinedown, have been waiting for a long time for a new album. This one fits the bill, good music.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Witness the birth of a new powerhouse name in acting, Tatiana Maslany. Anyone should watch who simply loves to enjoy top-notch acting.<br /><br />It's sci-fi but that's secondary to the character driven story. Plus it's biotechnology, secret agendas, action, drugs, sex, and emotion.<br /><br />We'll be talking about this one 20 years from now.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I've had this app for about six months. I updated my kindle yesterday, went on and found MY ENTIRE PROFILE DELETED! Everything is gone. Besides, building virtual buildings with blocks won't get you anywhere in life. This app is a waste of your time.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Great movie I am a sports movie fun. Love the story and excitement of the movie. Good acting as well
B004EF8ARM|5.0|The story is set during the industrial revolution of England. South and North represent all the contradictory aspects of that time. How the workers and masters have perceived the industrial business, and how the British people have responded to the rapid, revolutionary changes. The romantic story has many twists and turns, providing such an elegant female character. I bought the kindle version of the book without any hesitation, for a more direct experience with the author and the story.
B0016CVN02|5.0|Great traveling music.  We have it on our motorcycle MP3 player and listen to it all the time.  On a long trip it sure makes the miles go by.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|and at a great price!  I will, I will conquer it!  Simply a lot of fun to play and then play again.
B0000669JL|5.0|Marley beats makes me feel like I'm on vacation all the time. It's relaxing sounds and Buffalo Soldier is an all time favorite.
B004J713JW|5.0|The HD filming with the vast crowd and special guests can only be matched by Joel's vast repertoire of classics.,. A must-have disc/
B00000JBFW|5.0|This is one of my favorite DP CDs and have listened over and over again.<br />Downloaded into my smart phone.
B0042JH05I|4.0|Even though Collins appears to provide a perfunctory performance, it offers enough variety to keep the interest of the viewer. Most songs are continuous , without a lot of unnecessary introduction, which is desirable.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|Sure think I will enjoy this as much as Surfing with an Alien. His guitar work is great and really makes me sway to the sounds.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it. It keeps me busy while my son is gone. Wish gems were easier to get. The graphics are very good. It's easy to understand
034580404X|5.0|I Loved the books, I couldn't put the books down. They are very intense, but I really enjoyed them. :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|This works great.  My only concern is the advertisement that keeps popping up before you start each game. Not happy about that part.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I enjoy this series.  Reacher will give the bad guys what is coming to them and then walks down the high way.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|One of my favorite movies that I just had to have on blu-ray. Shipping was quick and the product was as described. Great movie! I highly recommend to Action Fans!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Reacher reminds me of old cowboy movie heroes.  An absolutely average man is minding his own business and ends up in a fight to right a wrong.  He cleans up the problem and rides off into the sunset.  End of story.  I like it
B009JBZH54|5.0|Ummmm...It's The Dark Knight. Enufff said. It is of course amazing! The product arrived quickly and was as described. I recommend the Dark Knight as one of the best Trilogies out there!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun game but it needs more levels though, it has a simple plot but great puzzles. Also good graphics.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Great book, funny and a little naughty. It is on  of the best books i have read. You should read it.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. A little slow in the middle, but overall it was a good movie. I enjoyed that it was a different take on the genre
B00CSSMT6A|5.0|NOTE: This is a review of th e 2 disc CD version: NOT the MP3 version.<br />Just as I remembered it from the three record set. The remastering sounds fantastic and I get the same girly-screams listening today as I did then. A CLASSIC and a MUST HAVE...if you only have ONE Paul McCartney record, get this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's got everything you want and some surprises that will make you clap your hands and wish that you had been there!!!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|There is blobs with eyeballs and it is a lot like the game cut the rope. It's fun for sure
B002KJX4IE|5.0|great sitting around and need a good laugh movie. micheal keaton over the top. the suiside people have to be public servants. gotta love it.
B00001SIES|5.0|This album is great, you can feel the emotion Matt put into each of the songs. My favorite is Muscle Museum.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I decided to watch this movie and cannot believe I made it through college without anyone saying I needed to see it.  It is a beautiful presentation of a very moving story.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I got all the way to Level 20 and it froze and will not load. Very frustrating. Obviously they need to rework the program.<br /><br />'
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I can search for music on my device by song, album and artist. When I use it to search amazon for music to purchase, I cannot search by artist. Such a little thing yet exceptionally frustrating!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like it. works well and in a pinch. nothing more to say. I would recommend this app. to anyone.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed this one and found it difficult to put it down. I would have liked the ending to have been less rushed. Seems like Card just threw a lot of detail and time in one last chapter. But hey, I am almost done reading Speaker for the Dead (book 2 of the quintet) now so the ending was good enough to keep me interested...
B006LSZECO|4.0|There are twists and turns, but the ending leaves you slightly frustrated.  I had a hard time getting into it, thinking I had it all figured out, but once I got to the second section, I couldn't put in down.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|Dido is my favorite pop singer, her first two albums are on endless repeat duty and I have lots of her remixes. I preordered her CD from Amazon.uk because it was released earlier and I avoided listening to any of her singles from this album because I wanted to hear the whole thing at once when it was released. When I received the CD, I set aside an evening for this \\"event\\" and pulled out my high grade Denon D7000 headphones. I had high expectations since I had read it was going to be a more electronic album...I always liked the songs where she sang on Faithless' albums. Somewhere at the 30 minute mark, I fell asleep....nothing caught with me. I kept expecting it to get better but very few songs even registered with me. This dashed my hopes she would continue her brilliance of the first two albums.<br /><br />Well, I'm a Dido fan so I kept listening, and gradually, something clicked. A few of the songs got stuck in my head and I started looking forward to another listen. It took quite a few re-listens so this is definitely an album that needs time to simmer. There are a couple of songs that I do want to skip over (Love to Blame, Lost) that don't do anything for me. I even like Let Us Move On which has a rapping sequence (which seems to have more of a Faithless vibe). So it did take a while for the album to shine for me....but it shines brightly overall. Not many of the songs have a melody where you want to sing along, but many of the songs may still stick in your head long after you play them.<br /><br />Reviews of music CDs are usually very hard because it's such a personal thing whether the music resonates with you. I'm writing just to say the CD is very good and is a must for a Dido fan. I'm hoping she'll continue to make more albums and maybe get back to some of her roots that made the first two so listenable, but I think this album succeeds to add to the vocabulary of Dido's style.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The hunger games was an awesome story, not quite the ending I was expecting. But it was still a great read.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I enjoyed the story, and I can't wait for the final book in the trilogy!  I really enjoy reading about the developing relationship between the main character and Maxon, but I wish she would make up her mind!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Fun but superficial read. I enjoyed the twist at the end but I believe the author extended it too far. I would read a continuation just to see where the story goes.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Great game. feels like your actually flying a F-35 Fighter jet just wish you didn't need to buy planes you didn't earn
B009LDD54K|5.0|I began watching this series after season one. I bought the first two seasons and will soon own the third season. This is five times better than the Sopranos! The life like costumes, the music, the scenery are so original as to be there as the series develops. The characters are all so fabulous and the history so close to what really happened during prohibition that it is difficult to separate the late 1920s in your mind. If the producers and actors choose to let this run the course through mid 1933 there could be many more years of this outstanding series to be seen. If I recall, at the end of the third season the time was just starting out in 1925, and Rothstein, a real life mobster has just been busted by the government as Steve Buscemi's character evades the trap set for him by his enemies. I simply cannot wait for the premier of season four in September!<br /><br />Stephen Courts<br />June 20, 2013
B007L96VCY|5.0|I have always regarded this as Paul's best solo work, ever!!!! I love RAM and would place it with my all time favorites, some of which, are: Beatles,:White Album,.. Queen's,:A Day At The Races,.. T.Rex,:Electric Warrior, Bowie,:Ziggy Stardust.....RAM, was a great album!  Band On The Run, wasn't too bad either.....but, I think Paul needs to Stop making crappy albums...I for one, haven't bought a McCartney album in a while, At one time I owned all the Wings albums, hoping they would be as good as RAM!! NOOOO WAY!....TOO BAD, HE CAN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING NEW, WORTH BUYING........All Things Must Pass Away......
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I have found this to be an enjoyable experience. The amount of powers the cards give you means you can take on just about any challenge. Found both paths to be very detailed and fun to play. Even common cards are useful in late game play, so don't ignore them.

1400069807|5.0|Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us is by Michael Moss, a Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist. While Salt Sugar Fat may seem like a nutritional guide, it really is a look at the history of the convenience food industry and their use of sugar, salt and fat in their products. Moss takes us inside companies like General Foods, Kellogg, Coca-Cola, Kraft, and Nestle, and shows us the development of some famous products. From the lab research to the marketing campaigns, Moss delves into what the food giants do to entice us not only to try their products, but to crave them and  keep coming back for more.<br /><br />Part of this requires finding the bliss point for the food. Moss writes: \\"For all ingredients in food and drink, there is an optimum concentration at which the sensory pleasure is maximal. This optimum level is called the bliss point. The bliss point is a powerful phenomenon and dictates what we eat and drink more than we realize. The only real challenge for companies when it comes to the bliss point is ensuring that their products hit this sweet spot dead on. (Location 515-518).\\"<br /><br />Of course it is sugar, salt, and fat that people enjoy and the food giants would not have products without these key tastes. Combine the bliss point in the convenience foods with clever marketing campaigns and it's no wonder people are deceived by what the labels really indicate. It is not the presence of sugar, salt, and fat in foods, but the large quantities found in convenience foods that may end up spurring a national debate on health.  Diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity are all linked to the highly processed foods and their phenomenal amounts of sugar, salt, and fat.<br /><br />Yes, we all knowingly buy the soda, chips, cookies, and cheese that may be undermining our health. One of the questions may be at what point are the food companies responsible for the unhealthy amounts of the sugar, salt, and fat in the things we are buying? Aren't we responsible for our own choices? But aren't they also responsible on some level for the deceptive advertising on products? Or the marketing of these products to children? I think these questions have actually been asked for years with no satisfactory answers.<br /><br />While I'm not going into specifics, I see enough examples of unhealthy lunches being provided to children by parents who, I truly believe, think they are providing a healthier lunch than what the schools could provide. The sugary drinks, convenience yogurts, snack packs, prepackaged meals, sugary processed fruits....  While I can't hold the food giants responsible for parental choice, I can't help but wonder if these highly processed foods teeming with salt, sugar and fat were not available wouldn't these kids be taking a healthier lunch? Of course, looking at the other side, these foods normally do ensure that the child will be eating some lunch. Obviously, I'm not going to solve the questions here, and we all need to accept the fact that the food giants will not be giving up these three key ingredients.<br /><br />In the epilogue Moss writes: \\"It had taken me three and a half years of prying into the food industry's operations to come to terms with the full range of institutional forces that compel even the best companies to churn out foods that undermine a healthy diet. Most critical, of course, is the deep dependence the industry has on salt, sugar, and fat. Almost every one of the hundreds of people I interviewed in the course of writing this book--bench chemists, nutrition scientists, behavioral biologists, food technicians, marketing executives, package designers, chief executives, lobbyists--made the point that companies won't be giving these three up, in any real way, without a major fight. Salt, sugar, and fat are the foundation of processed food, and the overriding question the companies have in determining the formulations of their products is how much they need of each to achieve themaximum allure. (Location 5662-5668)\\"<br /><br />Will this book change me? It may certainly make me more intentional in the grocery store. All of the processed convenience foods were originally imagined as occasional fare rather than a staple or all inclusive part of our diet. Salt Sugar Fat may be part of the clarion call that sends more people back to preparing most meals from scratch. However, I think even Moss would admit that to expect people to give up all convenience foods will likely not happen, and in the end he doesn't provide any answers to the problem.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended<br /><br />Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Random House via Netgalley for review purposes.maximum allure.

B0094M30I4|5.0|So much fun, great special effects, terrific acting (even when the characters are over-acting, it adds to the film).  I love Tim Burton movies, so perhaps I'm prejudiced, but I enjoy all the crazy, outlandish things he does.  Depp is delightful as the Mad Hatter, and he gives real depth to a character which might otherwise be dismissed as a flake.  Mia W. as Alice is wonderful, and of course Helena Bonham-Carter is unrivaled as the horrible Red Queen.  Anne Hathaway is a great choice as the White Queen and a perfect foil for Bonham-Carter. And, really, could anyone else play Absalom, the wise blue caterpillar, better than Alan Rickman?  I think not...

B001E6X4W0|4.0|This movie is beautifully shot and stays pretty true to the novel (which happens to be important to me), and thought at times it seems a bit &#34;over-acted&#34;, each of the main characters brings something unique to his or her character.  Kirsten Dunst is amazing as Claudia, Tom Cruise is very good as Lestat (like the author, I had doubts about his casting, but he pulls it off pretty well), Antonio Banderas is perfectly tragic (and a bit creepy) as Armand, and Brad Pitt is sensually stunning as Louie (though seeing the movie now (2013), I have to keep reminding myself that, yes, he WAS that young once).  My only real criticism is that I think Brad Pitt should have studied a bit with another actor or coach who was experienced in narration, because his skills in that one area aren't nearly as impressive as his acting chops (at least not in this, admittedly very early in his career, film).
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I can still remember bopping the fire button on the Galaga arcade machine a million miles an hour -- killing aliens.  While this isn't Galaga or really an attempt to clone it,  it satisfies my urge to shoot aliens at a high rate.  I can't believe this guy writes this app on the bus on the way home.  It would be great if you could save the game, but I haven't got tired of it yet.  I even spent 90% of a 2 hour flight playing it and was never disappointed. You like shooters, you need this game.

B004GYY714|3.0|Downloaded Tunein and used it immediately after installing it and very much enjoyed it,<br /><br />I found it easy to use and very consistent in terms of delivery and performance. My problem is there's nothig memorable about it for me, enough that I am mindful I have it and choose it when I want to listen to songs o my cell phone. That's not Tunein's fault-the failing is mine.<br /><br />I have enough flavors of music on my cell phone and just don't use Tunein but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try it to see if it works for you.

B00CU8OVIM|5.0|This Tuesday was the release date for two highly anticipated hip-hop albums - \\"Yeezus\\" by Kanye West and \\"Born Sinner\\" by J. Cole.  How do they compare?<br /><br />Both albums tell a personal story. Neither album tried to be pop-friendly or has any party tracks. \\"Born Sinner\\" is MUCH more humble than \\"Yeezus\\". Whereas J. Cole refers to his humble beginnings and his struggle for mainstream success, Kanye talks about his fame and what he considers his greatness.<br /><br />Kanye's album is experimental and risk taking.  He lays his raps over beats that fuse acid house and industrial, with unconventional song structures. While \\"Yeezus\\" has sonically appealing elements, it wasn't that great lyrically.  Plus his ego is really overbearing (i.e. comparing himself to God and Jesus). The album was rarely soothing or relaxed.  \\"Yeezus\\" keeps up an abrasive tone.  The music is fitting for an art house, not your car or room.<br /><br />J. Cole performs conventional hip-hop that is influenced by Nas and Jay-Z.  His album is great from start to finish. The lyrical content is excellent. It has nice mix of topics, from relationships and girls to political and social issues. It has a nice flow and all the songs go together well.<br /><br />I like practically every song on \\"Born Sinner\\" - \\"Villuminati\\", \\"Rich N****z\\", \\"Forbidden Fruit\\", \\"Let Nas Down\\", and \\"Miss America\\", especially. \\"Villuminati\\" is the opener.  Right off the bat, Cole shows what a talented lyricist he is.  \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" features Kendrick Lamar and uses an A Tribe Called Quest sample. It has a really cool vibe. \\"Rich N****z\\" is told from the perspective of a poorer J. Cole, where he expresses his resentment for those who are rich (of course, now he's rich).  In \\"Let Nas Down\\", Cole talks about interactions with his idol Nas (Nas congratulated J. Cole as a rapper but didn't like his attempt at mainstream fame).  \\"Miss America\\" addresses social inequality of America.<br /><br />If you want to hear an established artist experiment a little, check out \\"Yeezus\\".  If you hear some quality hip-hop from a relative newcomer, check out \\"Born Sinner\\".<br /><br />Born Sinner - (4.50 out of 5 stars)<br /><br />Yeezus - (3.75 out of 5 stars)<br /><br />--Isa R Bufano (06.19.2013)rtist experiment a little, check out \\"Yeezus\\".

B006HL9G10|5.0|UPDATE: as of the October, 2013 update to this app, it does now suppress call and text notifications. Thank you to the developers for fixing this feature. Upgrading review from 3 to 5 stars.<br /><br />Original review: This is a useful app for timing meditation sessions, but unfortunately it does not \\"prevent calls and texts from being heard\\" during your meditation, despite the setting for that. That was one of the features I wanted, since I can set a timer without an app. I can also turn off notifications myself, but if this feature worked, I could do both with one function, as this app is supposed to do.<br /><br />The bells are nice.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This is not your typical zombie movie.  Zombies can change and become people again given half a chance.  Hey, they can even fall in love.  This is a pretty well done movie.  Not a classic by any means, but definitely worth a look.
B007SPPANM|4.0|It has been over 15 years since I first saw \\"Titanic\\" in theaters.  While age and cynicism don't have me as enthralled about the movie as I was back then (I was 21 when it came out), I still find it to be a very entertaining saga of the infamous 'night to remember'.  There are obvious flaws in this rendition of the epic sinking.  One is the focus on the young couple of Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio, in a role that swore me off his acting until \\"Catch Me if You Can\\") and Rose Dewitt Bukater (Kate Winslet).  For the younger audience, the tale of young, forbidden love is enormously appealing, even it's a particularly underwhelming love story.  It distracts from the many other captivating stories that could have been told (and were told in an earlier Titanic film, based on the Walter Lord compilation \\"A Night To Remember\\").<br /><br />  However, great plot and character development have never been director James Cameron's strong suit.  Where Cameron excels is in pure filmmaking that is able to create immersive transcendent environments and worlds (\\"Aliens\\"?  \\"Avatar\\"? anyone?).  The effects he developed in recreating an incredibly authentic 'unsinkable' ship make the audience feel the terror and drama as the Titanic's final moments waste away.  I still enjoy embracing this experience many years later.<br /><br />  The characters are largely hit and miss.  Aside from the youthful appeal of Jack and Rose, they are largely uninteresting couple; and, for all the talent DiCaprio displayed before and after \\"Titanic\\", his acting is pretty hard to stomach here.  Winslet does a much better job in a largely thankless role.  Billy Zane chews the scenery as Rose's controlling fianc&eacute; Cal, and Danny Nucci is one of the worst, most stereotypical caricatures ever as Jack's friend, Fabrizio.<br />  There are also major misfires with historical figures, such as the inaccurate and slanderous portrayal of First Officer Murdoch and omitting the heroics of Second Officer Lightoller.Cameron did manage get it right with the nobility of the ship's band continuing to play while Titanic foundered, and illustrating White Star Line executive J. Bruce Ismay's cowardice in escaping while so many others died.<br /><br />  While it may seem like I am eviscerating \\"Titanic\\", that is far from the case.  I'm only highlighting some of the shortcomings in a film that still remains a very compelling piece of entertainment all these years later.

1400069807|1.0|Wow, reading this is like watching paint dry. The title suggests it will be more investigative, exposing any variety of controversies related to Big Food. Well, I'll save you $20... here is the book:<br /><br />1) Food companies work at using the exact amount of salt, sugar, and fat to make a food taste the best. Similar to when you cook at home.<br /><br />2) Lunchables used to be expensive to make. Now they aren't.<br /><br />3) The companies don't care much about obesity and do care about profits. You know, like basically every other publicly traded company on earth. Shocking stuff.<br /><br />All the thematic analogies to Big Tobacco fall short.<br /><br />Meh. This really isn't a book, but a collection of short stories related to processed food that do not particularly illuminate anything novel.

B00BY8DIT2|4.0|I've scanned all the reviews and I am shocked that no one has recognized that the CD cover design pays homage to another great bluesman and the iconic album he released in 1965. Check the cover of [[ASIN:B000002P72 Live at the Regal]] and you'll get a clue as to what is on this disc - a jazzier, more soulful kind of blues that you would normally expect from the great B.B. King. Hart's voice is strong and Bonamassa shows his more soulful side. The blues rock junkies will hate this, but Joe is an artist and he sometimes may want to stretch a little and do a project like this. Open your mind and enjoy the ride.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|First of all, the Hi-Def quality is unsurpassed, 5 out of  5.  Excellent cinematography, wonderful and vibrant color palette and absolutely gorgeous scenery.<br /><br />As for story, it is a refreshing theme of several spirits (personalities) that basically have had multiple reincarnations thru multiple centuries.  For instance, you get to see Tom Hanks' character from pre-historic times all the way to the 21st or 22nd century (I forget the actual date).<br /><br />Its a different and rare storyline that really should be viewed instead of read about.  It is a must-have for movie collectors in my opinion...and should have been chosen as Picture of the Year along with Life of Pi.
B004K58GSO|5.0|It's a classic of John Wayne's movies. I have watched it for years and still like to turn it on.

I don't know how to describe it but I found that I was drawn into the creators and could not put it down. the plot got me involved as well. now I must read Shift Omnibus just out of curiosity. Well done Hugh Howey.
B00821OX98|4.0|Excellent special effects for a TV series. Focus not spread out on too many characters-able to get to know them before story moves on and gets too complicated.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I thought he did a really good job in this movie .  I thought he made a really good Jack Reacher and I kinda hope<br />He does a few more Jack Reacher stories .  Tom Cruise is a great actor and he can play any part in any movie.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|It was a suspense movie. I love Rooney Mara, from Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. I hope she does the other 2 of that series in the movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love how its detailed. More info then the other bug weather. Both are very good, but i like this one better.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I don't usually like this director's movie but this mystery had me intrigued. Well acted and kept me interested throughout
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I honestly believe that this application is a lot of fun. I really thoroughly enjoy playing this application. I think that you will enjoy this application as well, because I enjoyed this application so very, very much. Thank you for reading my review of this application,My Horse.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is a must have for any Stevie Nicks fan.  By far my favorite album from this artist.  My niece ended up 'borrowing' my original copy so I ordered a new one from Amazon.  Couldn't live without it, and apparently neither could she!
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Dancing and music tracts are super!  Very nostalgic situation. Comforting in the predictability of the plot.  Swayze is marvelous. and I loved how &#34;Baby&#34; blossomed in the plot.  Just relax and enjoy this!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks did it again....One of my most favorite writers....I never want to put his books down and never want them to end....I have to confess that I sometimes wait a couple of months and read his books again....
B007XIO9TU|3.0|This is an outstanding concert by some of the best talent in the Blues genre. The problem with this video is that Johnny's guitar and microphone are mixed In Your Face and you can barely hear the rest of the band. At one point Johnny takes a break to let the band strut their stuff and you can still barely hear them. It's as if whoever was doing sound wanted Johnny and only Johnny and was trying to eliminate the &#34;distraction&#34; of having other musicians on the stage. This probably doesn't make sense but I'm sad I bought a poorly made video and glad I bought this Johnny Winter concert.
B0051XI9FO|5.0|I bought this item for my 3 year old who loves both of the CARS movies. When he opened it, he was beyond thrilled. This toy is so durable, came in great condition, and i recieved it pretty fast!
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|About once - twice if I'm lucky - per year I discover a new artist I can listen to like the old days: over and over and over. This is the one for me this year. Lyrics are great, songs have real depth. Nearly perfect in my book.
140131046X|5.0|Love it!  Mitch Albom is a great writer, keeps you engaged.  Hard to put the book down.  Very well written
0525953728|4.0|There is a bit of self-agrandizing but, being in the situation he was in, I'm not surprised. Most of the book was about his career and how he got to be where he was -- before the mission. I would've liked to see more about the mission itself but understand that there may be a lot he cannot talk about.
1449437524|5.0|Not for the easily offended but for the dog lover with a sense of humor it is a great read.  Made me laugh, made me cry.  I bought it as a tribute to my buddy Bo who passed away in January
B0009PAVI2|5.0|I don't use glass filters much but when I want them, I want them with me! I got this to be able to take the most common filters with me on a 3-week European car trip where I would have a backpack/camera bag -- not my tamrac most-people-would-call-it-luggage camera bag. I carry it attached to the outside of the backpack and do not worry about my filters getting damaged. I've lost count of the number of planes and other vehicles my backpack (with this case attached) has bounced around on.
1781162646|5.0|I have a new favorite! Stephen King has been my favorite writer for twenty-five years, but Joyland just may be my new favorite. Why? A coming of age story reminiscent of \\"The Body\\" with the retrospective nostalgia of The Green Mile. There is a dash of what made Duma Key a memorable book and has real tense moments, mystery, the supernatural, carny atmosphere, emotional depth and so much more. There are also so many wise and memorable lines, I'm sure the book will be quoted in fifty years of so. A slim volume for Mr. King, Joyland delivered a punch that made me cry and will haunt me for years to come. I would recommend this to someone who says- \\"oh, I don't read those scary, freaky books,\\" and turn them on to the master of modern lit. A perfect summer read!
B00CHILW64|5.0|What a heart wrenching movie!  Based on a true story this story is a testament to human spirit.  My only issue with the movie is it did not address the plight of the Thai population and the devastation they suffered.
B009AP2G26|5.0|the story lines are getting pretty squishy, but as long as they keep singing with all the talented<br />kids and keep bringing back the oldies once in a while..I'll keep watching just to hear the songs!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|a simple but fun game challenging with a good pace looking forward to more and more levels hopefully sooner than later
B009GX69RK|5.0|Can't wait for the new season to get started!! Love all the characters, especially Schmidt!!<br />Wonder if CeCe's marriage will last!?!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Ok so I like this game but I don't like the fact that you have to pay to advance, other than that it's fun and a great time killer.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Just purchased Season 5....can't wait to watch and get caught up before the new Season 6 starts in the fall!!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Americanah.  I heard discussion on NPR and was intrigued as I have read other books by this author.  I enjoyed reading about the main character's torn allegiance to her home country Nigeria and the US where she came to study.  I have friends who have spent time in Nigeria and it seems that she was &#34;spot on&#34; with the attitude.  (of course being Nigerian helped)<br />Thank you for providing such insight.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|&#34;I love Matilda and she is nice and sweet to her friends and to her mom.&#34; I ordered to watch the movie for my little cousin and that was what she said about the movie.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have really enjoyed Hosseini's books and did enjoy this one as well.  But, for some reason it was not as exciting as the others.  I always find it very interesting to read about this part of the world and did enjoy some of the more feisty characters in this story.  It's just my opinion but I feel that Mr. Hosseini seemed more involved in the other stories of his other books.  This tale seemed like a tell from the outside just a bit too much.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read it quick an with great interest. It's not a  bad book but it's not as good a expected either. Somehow I thought it would be more psychological and well darker. It was more romantic, unreal romantic that is, than expected.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was horrible. I disappointed I paid for it and wasted two hours of my life on it. Midway through, my husband and I turned to one another and said, &#34;pretty lame, huh?&#34;<br /><br />Don't bother!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very clean game. great for all ages. very fun and addicting. very easy to understand. Sometimes I cant even put it down it always has my attention
B0081KZ20E|5.0|The movie of same name (original one, not the one with Bruce Willis) is pretty good too. Now onto the French Connection!
B0093FNZT6|3.0|I felt the story started out very strongly.  I liked the medical explanations regarding meningitis and germ transfer. The description given to the 'psychic' experiences was well stated and really interesting. But I would have liked a concrete conclusion and, of course, that is impossible.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Enjoyed the movie very much, recommend it to everyone, was surprised with the changes in the original, but it was a pleasant surprise. Thank you.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I love the Wizard of Oz and love the musical &#34;Wicked&#34; so I was excited to see this film.  It is so poorly done - from special effects, to the story line, to the writing, to the acting.  My husband and I sat through it and afterwards looked at each other and said &#34;well, that was a waste of time!&#34;.  Disney and anyone involved with this film should be ashamed.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Robin Hood is justifiably famous as an entertaining swashbuckling epic that the family can enjoy.  It is a fine example of film magic produced in the late 1930s and like its counterparts The Wizard of Oz and the more dramatic Gone with the Wind, it employed color.  Errol Flynn excels as Robin Hood while Olivia DeHavilland and Basil Rathbone provide excellent supporting roles.  The stunt work is generally quite good with a very well choreographed climatic sword duel between Flynn and Rathbone (ironically in real life I understand Basil was probably a better fencer).  Overall I highly recommend \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" to classic movie fans.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Had an HP  already printer already on my wireless network. Just downloaded the app and it worked. Have to admit I was expecting to have some issues but there were none.  Have not tested it outside my home on printers in places like Fedex stores.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great game for killing time.  various levels of difficulty, lots of different puzzles.  The forests & castle puzzles were beautiful.  I like how you can set different amounts of puzzle pieces.  Extra puzzles are not very expensive.  It's a really great app.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|Better than the previous album, I just wish there were 2 more tracks! Now time to finally catch them on tour...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Intriguing and really makes you think logically.  Lots of fun for everyone in the house.  Get it-you'll certainly enjoy it.
B000TEPE12|4.0|Always have liked his music. He always gives different interpretations of older songs that are spot on to me. American Woman is a case in point.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Of all the Kindle books I have read this is easily the best. The author has done an amazing job with one of the most enduring Science Fiction themes. I am eager to read the next in the series.<br />Update: Not to sure that the author has written a plausible dive sequence!
B008VIKLWA|5.0|My 6th grade special ed students adored this movie! WE watched the movie after reading &#34;My Life With the Chimpanzees&#34; by Jane Goodall and I really think this movie gave them insight into her world. PLUS- we all fell in love with Oscar and could not stop talking about how human they all seemed!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it , Its full of fresh ideas, projects, amazing place Im hooked ;) I have learned a lot from it
B00821OX98|5.0|This scared me almost as much as The Walking Dead.  I can understand the value the aliens placed on the young people - I can feel the heartbreak of the parents .
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was the best book ever it was very detailed and funny. I think everyone should read this book soon.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|I have listenend to all and own the majority of the QotSA discography--I'm missing 'Lullabies to Paralyze' and 'Era Vulgaris'--and often try to discern the core sound that is Queens of the Stone Age.  It's hard to pinpoint due to the somewhat heavy rotation of players backing Josh Homme, but I feel like it's somewhere between the self-titled debut, 'R', and 'Songs for the Deaf'.  Like most people, I'm sure, I was first introduced to this band when singles from the aforementioned 'Songs for the Deaf' received rather heavy radio airplay, and I went out and bought the album.  To this day, it's far and large my favorite, but I have a strong affinity to the other two albums I mentioned.<br /><br />This is a band I hate to love, largely because Homme is such an a-hole (do your research on his fallout with former band Kyuss) and also because I feel like this band is somewhat inconsistent and unstable, but it's hard to deny Homme's musical genius.  With '...Like Clockwork', I feel like Homme, after a six-year hiatus from writing QotSA material, has gotten back to (what I feel is) the band's basics.  This album is heavy, laden with Homme's signature guitar sludge that you can almost feel.  This is owed, most likely, to the re-release of the band's self-titled debut that was followed by a tour of said album where it was played in its entirety each and every night.  It's easy to understand why these guys are time and time again labelled \\"The Kings of Stoner Metal.\\"<br /><br />Something else this album has in spades in superstar guest appearances.  Whether it's Dave Grohl on drums, former bassists Nick Oliveri and Alain Johannes, Trent Reznor, or even Sir Elton John, this album has a little something for every QotSA fan, both long-time and new.  If you're like me and have a hard time getting over 'Songs for the Deaf', key tracks to look out for are \\"I Sat by the Ocean,\\" \\"My God Is the Sun,\\" and \\"Smooth Sailing.\\"  These, to me, were the major stand-out tracks.  The rest of the album is solid--heavy, but solid--and makes for a nice re-introduction to the world of Queens of the Stone Age.lbum is solid--heavy, but solid--and makes for a nice re-introduction to the world of Queens of the Stone Age.
1577314808|4.0|There are many books that I have given high ratings and have the intention of going back to read; this is one of the few books that I actually started re-reading immediately after I finished the first reading.  While I admit that I don't agree with everything that is written in the book, a great deal of the book makes sense even from a Christian perspective (which is also why I don't agree with everything in it).  I'm still on my second reading and I'm intentionally reading slower this time around, but I am consciously and actively applying the suggestions/steps.  I can't honestly say that this works--yet; which may be that red light, but at the very least I can say that I tried and it is quite interesting.  This also is one of those books that requires honesty with self and the willingness to throw out old mindsets...a LOT of old mindsets.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Great cooling power, quiet, and seems to be keeping temps where they should be.  Installation was kind of a pain due to the fact that i had to take my motherboard completely out in order to install it.  The directions were pretty useless, but luckily i found a video online showing the installation process.  Keep in mind this thing is huge, and i am unable to put the side panel back on my 6.75&#34; chasis, but not a big deal for me.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The show is fantastic! Somebody made a big mistake....could have made a lot more money on Sy Fy  fans! Too bad!
B0000264PW|4.0|It is good stuff but I like the older Europe before they became famous, still, some great music on here.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|The movie was clever and funny.  It is a movie you will want to watch again. It is filled with surprises you don't expect.
B0000074LY|5.0|If you are a true Twisted Sister fan you know what this is all about. Dee still can sing and write great songs!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a great game. it is a good workout for your brain. some puzzles are easy and others are challenging.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|What a great way to while away the time waiting for those who are always late. Great fun for the kids too.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Loved this film....full of surprises, witty, charming and full of creative imagery.  Very appropriate for family viewing, upbeat, no violence just the threat.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My wife and I really wish there were thousands of episodes of this series.  Good writing, directing, and acting make this intriguing, easy to watch, and addictive.  More of this series are needed......NOW !<br /><br />Bob Morton
B001DM1VXE|2.0|Depressing,...could not get into the theme, especially in black and white.  Guy was either autistic or bipolar and the lonliness he lived was too dark for me.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Marley will forever be a motivator for me.  His story and talent are phenomenal.  I watch the DVD on a regular basis when I need encouragement.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Got this on a whim and glad I did.  I work in an office with tight deadlines and lots of background chatter.  Having this to help block noise and conversations helps immensely.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|The writer seems to know my innermost thoughts when it comes to my own ups and downs with the writing process.  It is a very interesting read and has helped me very much.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Best mlp game I have ever played its fun and exciting you will love it I promise so get the game and have a blast!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Despite the crap harlotwood churns out nowadays (charging us a million bucks for a twenty five cent movie) and basically stuffing them with nothing but sluts and cussing and swearing--this one is different.<br /><br />I got mine through Amazon, it is better than most the SF made nowadays...it ISN'T great, but is good enough for what I paid for it.<br /><br />Therefore, I recommend this with my famous 5 star rating and tell you 'it's an okay popcorn movie, buy it'.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is such a good show that it is too bad the language is so disgusting.  I hear so many negative comments about that.  One assumes lawyers are supposed to be very intelligent, but their gutter language is  totally out of place!  They need to clean up their language! And get a new designer for the women's wardrobe.  Their fashions were so much prettier the first season (and better fitting, not so tight it made them bulge through the bust and the rump).  The guys dress fantastic!  The women deserve beautiful fashions, too.<br />Looking forward to the new season and hoping these are better this year because it really is such a good show.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was a riveting book.  I love how the past and the future are intertwined in a story that keeps you wondering what will happen next.  Love love loved it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Lots of fun and I couldn't put it down. Ends with a great twist that will keep you reading to the end.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I do like this one very much.  It just appeals to me.  It might be a four rating for some and I still like it.
B0060D0XE4|5.0|This is a very family friendly movie, and my kids watch it over and over. No bad language and teaches kids about super heros and how everyone is a hero in their own way.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|However, as with this one you either had to buy the program to get full enjoyment of the game and I don't want to do Facebook things.
B000GOZ0ZK|4.0|I don't usually like this kind of movie, but I have to admit I enjoyed this one. There were a few \\"oh, please\\" moments, but overall it was outstandingly well-done, within the limits of the monster movie. So, I gave it four stars, but that is in the context of very moderate expectations of the genre. It's not a serious film, but it's fun to watch.<br /><br />And it had an ending that contained a strong element of poetic justice, which is always nice.<br /><br />Saffron Burrows is a cutie, and her presence is a plus in any movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to buy and read my books thru my phone.  It is very convenient.  Thank you so much.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it really makes you use your gray matter! easy to understand but still challenging<br />recommend for anyone who wants to stay sharp
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Good game if you are into Diablo champions of norath or boulders gate. I suggest buying for those who want a fun game.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|This was my favorite Season Premiere ever!! I loved to finally find out how Guinan and Picard met!! It suddenly made sense when she said &#34;I like bald men because a bald man was kind to me once&#34; love love love!!
0143123173|3.0|This is the first Longmire book that I have read. There are parts of this book I really love; the parts with the Old Cheyenne are wonderful. There are some colorful characters and the setting is interesting.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that of a dialogue problem - there are times when it is just too difficult to determine who is saying what.It makes for tedious reading when one has to go back and count \\"so and so said this so the next line must be said  by so and so.\\" This is,I think, a flaw that the editor should have caught;it's an easy fix.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have loved taking the ride with Gideon and Eva and am totally ecstatic that the ride isn't over!! I was not ready for it to end! I have LOVED the evolution of Gideon and how he has softened but remained the POWERFUL MAN that commands Respect!! I just hope that the readers don't have to wait a year to see where the journey with Gideon and Eva will take us NEXT!!! PLEASE READ IT IS WORTH THE MONEY AND THE TIME!!!!<br />IN LOVE!!!<br />MArisol
067942850X|5.0|All older folks should read it to understand the younger ones. Everyone in their lifetime would like to just escape and just live adventurous but, there is danger out there and to do it alone is not a good idea. Life is meant to be shared with someone.
1594204217|4.0|Lots of reference in this book to: Catching Fire by Wrangham, which you've got to read!<br />But, I loved Pollan's other books too: Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food.  I liked this one<br />is better than In Defense of Food.  Good &#34;food&#34; for thought.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Great little app. I like the bright colors and style used. Very accurate. I recommend this to all tablet users.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|very funny! great to rent from amazon. very easy. great selection of movies to pick from. will rent more movies from amazon
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|The color and effects were great and the story line stayed true to what you would expect from OZ.  Great Movie for whole family.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game because it makes you think instead of just pointing and clicking. If you enjoy puzzles you will like this. I was sorry when it ended.
B001EC2IXK|1.0|Newman is almost always good because he was a man of integrity, which fits his character Luke perfectly. The part and the person are one. Here he plays his standard 60s outsider again, and he's attractive in many ways, and the men come to idolize him.  The problem with this film is that is much too long, unfocused, and for many long stretches just not entertaining.  Sure there are some cool lines, and some good ole boy dialog, and even some pretty sunrises (filmed in Stockton CA not Georgia).  But it is also full of cruelty, beatings, whippings, and this fairly standard prison story becomes, at the hands of the director and writer, something odd with undercurrents of masochism, sadism, martyrdom, and homo-eroticism. It is all very weighty and too much. The barracks scenes are stagey and awkward, as is the embarrassing scene where Luke talks to God (gospel of Luke, get it?  sheeesh...) So in the end the sum of all these parts does not make a very coherent film or a very good one. Below average waste of time with a star just for Newman's charisma.
B0044WSF5M|5.0|Great movie, came on time and obviously enjoyed it.  Will be part of my collection for awhile! thank you. Cara
B008EL25LE|3.0|This is a match 3 with beautiful graphics and what could be an interesting premise but it is TOTALLY RUINED by a less-than-lame storyline. The story is nonsensical, stupidly crafted and just silly. It's a shame they couldn't match their wonderful graphics with a great story. For the lame story, I give it only 3 stars. Too bad; it's very expensive.
0446547573|5.0|Great book. Loved all the other books, and this one compared. i would highly recommend this to anyone who is a NS fan.
B000FC146C|5.0|This is the second time I'm reading this book.  I read it about 30 years ago,before the mini series, and I still couldn't stop reading this.  Wonderful mini series, wonderful book!
B009AMAGXK|3.0|The movie is not like the book.  They either left out a lot of stuff or they moved around certain events in the way they happend verses the book.  Also, the movie doesnt have any leading up points, they just jump right to the point and plot.  It's not a low budget film but its not hollywood either, in between.  Overall I'd say its decent.  It has a few good effects.  If I hadnt read the book, I would have given it a bit better review maybe.  I'd say rent the movie first.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Whenever I try to turn on my Kindle App, it tries to load and sync and then it &#34;Force Close&#34; itself.  This has been happening every since it automatically updated Kindle last week (second week of June 2013).  My Kindle App for Android used to work perfectly until the update and now I can't read none of the books I've purchased.  I've uninstalled and re-downloaded and re-installed Kindle App numerous times all to no avail.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|great. This is one of my favorites movies. The blu ray and DVD combo is the best way to go.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome and fun you also can do alot . you also can get animals and win a ton of things like acorns.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|I'm not to sure about it there has been so much about it maybe it's me but for some reason I felt let down by it.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Forget about the price this game is completely worth it. I have spent hours playing this game and consider it the best game you can buy for the kindle fire. The graphics are great and if you are a fan of the final fantasy series you will love this game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If you read the book you will know what I mean. John Green uses beautiful language to tell this story.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very good show with an up-lifting plot and lovable characters.  The para-legal and Harvey's secratary are a stitch!  It's free if with Prime too!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|enjoyed the puzzles, finding clues n opening the elevator on each level. not super difficult, but can b a lil tricky here n there. def want more rooms thou... took less than an hour 2 solve the 10 rooms...
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I've been waiting to see this movie, since I heard about it on Superherohype.com. Then I saw the movie in 3D ,with my mom and sister. Right before my surgery the next day,and man this movie knocked our socks off.It was great to see Iron Man ,Thor,Hulk,Captain America,Black Widow,and Hawkeye. Kicking ass and saving the world together, the only question that I had was.Where was Giant-Man/Ant-Man and Wasp,in this superpowered melee? Anyway Avengers was by far the best superhero movie of all time. And Marvel Studios is already working on Avengers 2,Ant-Man,Captain America 2, and in an unrelated note X-Men days of Future Past. So DC Comics and Warner Brothers, better get a move on and start working. On the Justice League, Flash, Wonder Woman,and other DC Comics superhero movies, cause Marvel Studios is kicking their ass hard. I later bought the Avengers dvd from Amazon, for a good price.Which was great, it will be a welcome addition to my dvd collection.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I have found within this book misspellings, missing words and duplicate words.I believe the biggest fault was of the transfer to e-book and no proof reader!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this game is so much fun. lots to do better than farmville. give this game a try no glitches. love the movie.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|First, let me say I didn't realize how much this movie is geared for children. It's way too long, way too slow, and the acting was way too flat (except for the Wicked Witch).
B003U53GK8|5.0|The back and forth switching from one time zone to another had me thinking this was lunacy, religion and fluff to extend the season story. However, I could not leave it, as I knew the characters and their lives.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Good old fashioned cheeky humored monster flick with fantastic costumes, special effects and fight scenes! We really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />And, I just want to add, there is none of that shaky camera style of filming I find so irritating and impossible to watch;)<br /><br />(40-somethings who love monster flicks)
B003U4ZQRK|4.0|I am so into the characters and story that a little repetitive boring hurrying back and forth in the woods did not deter me. After all, there was always the chance that the monster would get them out there. The crazyness fits the story; because you never know how it will end.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|The book itself was slow, the story okay. I am glad he came out on top at the end of the day and was true to himself and his history. Had to be tough.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I don't know what else to say about this that hasn't already been said before. It's smart, it's compelling, it's enthralling, and has twists and turns you'll never see coming. This is the must-have graphic novel.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Adobe Reader for an Android tablet is just like home; that is just like the 'real thing' on your PC or MAC.  Allows you to read all those pdf files easily and is fast.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I was a moderate & occasional Dr. Who fan in the 70s & 80s but I am just loving the recent revival by Russell T. Davies.  Well Done, Sir, Well Done.  Allons-y!
B005K17RU0|4.0|AccuWeather is pretty quick on a tablet.  It shows you several views of what the next few hours will bring and allows you to pull up a map if need be.
B000003CMB|5.0|I got this CD for my Dad, and he loved it! It's a great Allman Brothers CD and well worth the purchase.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|When facebook sees that you are on an Android it switches to mobile mode.  This product allows you to view facebook in full mode on a tablet.  Very handy..
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I love to read about the indians and what they had to go thru, it is a great book, highly recommended
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Who doesn't like OZ.  I can still remember vividly the first time I saw it as a child in the 50's.  This new new version was very entertaining.
B005HED08I|1.0|It not the sitcom; Its Amazon ......it constantly drops and also buffering....Amazon has to clear this problem....Its constant throughout all programs.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Let me start by saying I've been a Daft Punk fan since their inception and I have to say that this is my favorite Daft Punk album. It really showcases how they've matured into a different style of music. I can understand why hardcore EDM fans don't like this, but try listening to it as just a fan of music in general. This is by far their best produced album, infact besides Aja by Steely Dan this might be the best engineered album of all time. It's meant to be played on expensive stereos, which unfortunatly most people don't own anymore in the age of MP3s. This album brings music back to a time when sound mattered.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I already had a review from my son, who said this show was so good and as soon as I got Amazon Prime I started watching from the beginning. It captures your attention as a mother, wife and lawyer/office worker. She has a million and one things to see to as a mother taking care of two teenagers who really need her guidance and love. Her mother-in-law takes up for her son non-stop and Alicia has to deal with her also as she steps in to take care of the kids while Alicia works at the law office.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Allows you to set your alarm to your music, allows multiple alarms to be set at the same time, and has many different layouts and options. Is definitely what I was looking for.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|I purchased this set for my grand daughter and she hasn't stopped listening, singing, dancing...The video is excellent as well - quite a performer!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Love this movie! Watched it a lot when I was a child it's great to see it again. If you haven't seen this movie watch it you will not be disappointed.
B00957T6X6|4.0|Enjoyed them a great deal, but a bit wordy at times.  Make sure to mark the family appendixes as you will need them.  Huge number of characters.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle, and it comes in handy just being available when you happen to need it.
B009AMAGXK|3.0|Making a movie from a book of any length is always a problem. Many times they fall short of the original story just because the have to cut so much of it to make it a \\"movie\\" and not a \\"mini-series\\". On very rare occasions a movie can be better than the book, but this is not one of those.<br /><br />I think this movie is an excellent reproduction of the material in the book, for better and worse. The strong acting, by supports and leads, improves the whole, but they really can't make it shine because they do stick faithfully to the source material.<br /><br />The flaws of the book are faithfully reproduced: characters who maintain only two dimensions (whom even the leads can't infuse with enough life to make them more than passingly interesting) in a non-short story format, and an abiding sense that the authors think almost everyone inhabiting small Southern towns are idiotic caricatures rather than real people.
0525953728|5.0|I read this book, cover to cover, in two days.  What excellent reading; it makes me proud to be an American!  Once I started reading it,  I just couldn't put it down'
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Somehow, the very campy elements that make the original Wizard of Oz so charming ring hollow in this production.<br />Although the special effects are remarkable, and some of the individual performances are really quite good, the overall production seems to try too hard at times, and totally miss the mark at others.<br />It's worth the $3.99 rental, but no more.
B003SI7OQ4|1.0|really awful don't bother with this it is no good fo you to watch this stuff ever. bad for your brain. content i s too u nplugged fro reality , scary and takes the kids 9imagination out fo the equation
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love looking at photos even if I did not photograph them myself. And that is where Evernote steps in. I can store what I like and when I nead it there it is.

B00499NHLC|5.0|I've loved Sherlock Holmes since Basil Rathbone so I love this modern day version.  I find I have to turn up the volume to catch all the English words. For some reason I always have to listen to British movies a bit louder. The guys are good looking, Sherlock is eccentric ant the plots twisted.  Lots of fun to watch!
0446572985|5.0|A great book, already read it.  Gave it to my friend to read it. I think she will enjoy. Great!
B004UXUX7S|5.0|From the opening scene through the end this film was hauntingly beautiful.  I grew up on Oahu and the soundtrack alone brought memories flooding back, not to mention the exquisite scenery, and familiar landmarks.  The story, although sad, was not depressing.  It was a poignant glimpse into the everyday lives of ordinary people struggling to come to terms with accepting that life is not unfair - it is just life.  I read somewhere that 'life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it is about learning to dance in the rain' - and this family learned.
0446573027|5.0|I ordered this book and realized I had already read it.  I gave it to a friend to read. Great Book.
1907590099|4.0|Offers a great look at the intellectual side of using psychedelic drugs from a brilliant man. Worth a read if spirituality and mind-expansion interest you.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|a decent app, not my favorite but I like it. wish there was a help button for those harder levels
B00C061HZY|5.0|The music speaks for itself, but the packaging and pressing for this LP is beautiful as well. Sound quality is superb, and the packaging is beautifully minimalist.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I definitely would recommend this book to my friends.  It is an excellent book about the journey of how an entrepreneur build their company and the lessons learned.  Very down to earth with no business jargon.  It is great to read about a successful company that is still fun and customer centric.  Love to get the perspective of its employee as well.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Interesting character development, excellent period depiction;  very relaxing to watch;  all seasons are great & get better as stories develop.  top notch if you like period pieces.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|Had a crush on him since I was 5 years old.  :-D Now I can relive the fantasy any time I want!
B000W93CHC|5.0|I read this book a few years ago. It was the first book I bought for my brand new Kindle and I couldn't have chosen better.<br /><br />I won't go into the plot, except to mention that it takes place over a century after The Pillars of the Earth, and it maintains the main storyline of its predecesor: same town, same corrupt church members and government, the brave hero and heroine who only manage to get together after years and years of suffering all kinds of misfortune, all of it cleverly fitted into the real historical backdrop in which the book takes place.<br /><br />I've read some comments that the story is repetitive. That may be so, but in my opinión, that didn't make the book dull at all. If anything, I believe that repeating a story as complex as TPOTE and maintaining the integrity of the characters without letting the story fall apart is nothing short of heroic.<br /><br />I've read many of Follett's books and he often recurs to the same formula, but the truth is that I have yet to be bored by any of them (Eye of the Needle, A Dangerous Fortune, The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End). The guy can write, and that's no secret, and World Without End is just as good as any of his other best sellers.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Enjoyed this game, kept moving and was still challenging as it progressed.  This game did not leave you hung up with no way out as some games have done.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Kanye is great! His music unique. I just wish he would of made more tracks. But it's still was dope.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|This is a futureistic comment on todays gaming culture and one possible outcome. The detailed references to '80s culture is a little tiring but the author did a lot of research or has a great memory
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I got stuck on one of the levels, but after a good nights rest, the answer became clear and I was able to complete the puzzle.  Really enjoyed playing...can't wait for more.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is a continuation of the &#34;Thrones saga&#34; and is a rich in detail as the rest. The number of characters is getting a bit daunting and hard to follow so I hope the future plots combine som of them
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Very resilient girl. Courageous storyteller. She pre warned reader of skipping around, but I felt that brought me to her way of thinking and not just a way of writing. Well done.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I liked this book better than &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; by Flynn. Gone Girl's characters were endlessly frustrating and unlikeable, and Sharp Objects was just a bizarre book that was too dysfunctional to feel believable. This one I liked. The development of the main character was stronger than in Flynn's other books, and while the ending was a bit canned/predictable, I wasn't disappointed in it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this series, I'm fairly new to it, as I just read it for the first time this year. But I have fallen in love!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great series.  I enjoyed this book as much as the first.  Highly recommend and can't wait to read the next one.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Waiting and wanting to see what happens next. In the end true love wins. Great book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|What an ironic title for Vince's last book. I am heartbroken to learn of his passing. I feel like i have lost a close friend. I have read all seventeen books and all are 5 stars in my book. He was a good man,great story teller,an imaginative visionary, and a patriot. My prayers and thoughts to Vince and his family and loved ones.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Total brain teaser! Great way to kill time! Makes for a great time and is totally addictive! I wish there were more levels that were free though!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very fun. Easy for kids to play. Does not require additional purchases to make upgrades during the game. Love it. Works on ipod, android, ipad...
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|This movie was to scary (in parts) for kids, but the acting and writing was like watching a disney show sitcom...not sure who would enjoy this.  I certainly didn't, and finished watching it only because I paid for it, but felt relieved when it was finally over!
B008BM9L72|1.0|The mere popularity of this book encouraged me to waste time and money on it. This is the worst writing I have ever had the misfortune of spending time on. I cannot believe the the average woman believes that this book is difficult to put down. I wanted to throw it out the window.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is a very dark (literally and figuratively.)I really enjoyed this film and recommend it if you love horror films.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Even after reading good reviews in a number of magazines, I was taken aback at the maturity of this novel. It is hard to separate your expectations of content from this author. The storyline was gritty, real and bitter sweet
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game it's addicting fun and cool but the weapons are a little expensive but still I like this game it's cool
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The character development was excellent.  I felt that I really knew these people and could feel their pain.  The book was  a fast read and much enjoyed.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Not sure if I liked the way the saga ended. Wish it could go on. Seemed a bit predictable that she would end up with Sam.
B0048WQDIE|4.0|I thought I could not laugh at WWII,  but this satirical glimpse at war antics made me chuckle in spite of myself. The basis of the  &#34;catch 22&#34; concept originates with Heller in this long tome of crazy military Keystone capers.
B000SEIBB8|4.0|We are not the first ones who need to solve a problem using computers.  Many others before us experienced similar problems in the past and we can leverage their knowledge and experience rather than reinventing the wheel.  This book provides a list of known problems in specific domains together with a recommended approach or solution.  As expected, this book does not capture all known problems but focuses on a common subset.  With that said, the solutions described here will help you understand why software is developed is a particular way.<br /><br />Together with a recommended solution to a given problem, this book also provides a common language.  For example the term &#34;Flyweight&#34; has a specific meaning in computer programming and it can be Googled up.  If each team that makes use of this patter refers to it differently, then it would be very hard for everyone to exchange ideas and communicate.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I thought it was a Good Disney Movie!  Special Effects were OK and it is Rated G!  The Grandkids enjoyed it!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|They shouldn't release app's for small and tiny devices if they can't create easy downloadable and easy to understand accessibility for them. This was impossible to figure out or understand. Don't do things like this to people who are not tech oriented or are brain injury survivors!
0865478007|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Boldacre shows how trials for drugs and their perceived usefulness  can be manipulated - unpublished data and outright data suppression, trials stopped early, trials extended, ghost written journal articles, etc.  How doctors are influenced by the drug industry, beginning in medical school and continuing throughout their practice.<br /><br />Goldacre is himself a practicing physician and this book stems in part from his outrage at having prescribed medications  when he thought were safe and effective after reviewing the available published data, only to find that in some cases the drugs were not only ineffective, but worse that nothing.
B001AQT0RC|4.0|I won't go into a movie review because there are plenty of others that did a great job. In summary, it's an excellent story with great acting. Most of the special effects still look good by today's standards, but you'll know it's not a modern movie for other reasons.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer was very good. I did a direct comparison between the DVD and this Blu-ray. The level of detail they pulled out was amazing. Better than a DVD upconversion on Video and Audio is excellent. If you can get this under ten dollars, it's well worth it.
B0091Q82L8|4.0|aNYONE WHO LOVES the Who will love this live cd. I was a late comer to the Who Generation and am glad I joined...won't you?
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Really the definitive package from the presentation of the original episodes to the extras, if you love the original series you will love this. Nice touch in that you can view either with the original or the new special effects. So if you are a purist you can be happy to view them as they were originally made, in all their HD glory. I like most of what they did with the revised effects with a few minor quibbles. The Doomsday Machine is a standout as an effects-heavy episode, we now have a proper ship not a half melted AMT model.<br /><br />The one thing I do not like is the Menus which are confusing and a little ugly. I REALLY liked the old DVD &#34;Bridge&#34; menu which was simple and beautiful.<br /><br />The packaging is OK, not as neat as the old DVD clamshells, but they take up less space and are easier to open. I also miss the old DVD's color front image of the characters, these are just the standard silver with a label, nothing special.
B005LCECU6|4.0|Where can you get a 3 person band who recently was honered by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The answer: Rush. Rush has been able to last through the good, bad and ugly periods of their life. A true testament to a great Band.
B008602KQI|3.0|While the film was relatively true to the book, the formulaic nature of all three of the books (hard to believe they are making a sequel) creates a very predictable tale.  I did think Jennifer Lawrence was a strong bit of casting, but the other characters were not very engaging.  Opening set up was also very drawn out.  A good film for a rainy afternoon, but not memorable.
B000002J1Y|4.0|Great band that has lasted and maintained integrity over all these years. They are good live and the way they write their songs which are sung by Jon Anderson and Chris Squire is the best. Order your today.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you consider yourself a gamer at all you need to read this book.  The concept is a great and the execution is perfect.
0553103547|5.0|HBO has done a phenomenal job with the series, but the books are better.  I recommend watching each season and then following it up with the book.  It will fill in all the blanks and you'll get a better feel for the characters.
0756404738|2.0|After reading \\"The Name of the Wind\\", I thought \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" would be, at worse case, a decent book.  Unfortunately, the second book seems to be nothing but filler, with no attempt to move the story and plot forward.  It was a total waste of time and money.  I hope that the author will do better with the third book, but I will not rush out and buy the book when it is released.  I'll wait and see what the reviews are first.
0061122416|4.0|I read this book the summer after I graduated, but figured I would give it another go. And surprisingly, I liked it a lot more this time around. Can I just say, that's one of the things I love most about reading? That you can take the same book, spaced out 5 years in time and have a totally different take on it. Almost as if it's a measure of how you've changed over the years.<br /><br />The thing with The Alchemist, is you really have to go beyond the story, which isn't very typical of books today. I remember reading books in High School that were dripping with symbolism and other such literary devices. The books of today tend to focus more on the stories and the characters. Sure, there are important themes to every book, but the style of writing just isn't quite the same. And though I love me some contemporary fiction, reading The Alchemist, so heavily peppered with pertinent life lessons (albeit a tad on the trite side), was a nice change of pace from the norm.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keeps you thinking would be nice if you could get clues if you get stuck. Great way to stay entertained.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is a very convenient app.  I don't have to go through multiple steps to find out my battery power.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This one is even better than the first! I hope you make more sequels! Keep up the amazing work! Thank you!
0762445262|5.0|Very cool piece for the home or for the office or for a modern replacement for your vintage mego playsets!
0670026638|5.0|This book attracted me because of part of a review I happened to hear on the radio, and the subject matter seemed very appealing. I am fascinated by Japanese culture, and the book deals with that. It not only deals with the contemporary life of a Japanese teenager in Tokyo but simultaneously the life of a writer and her botanically inclined artist husband living in British Columbia. The connection between the two sides of the Pacific is made by the discovery of a diary and some other papers apparently set adrift after the tsunami of 2011. I usually read more nonfiction than fiction, but this plot felt made just for me. The elements that kept me reading late at night were life in Japan for a very unhappy young woman, life for a writer living on a remote island, and her husband's fascination with plants, ocean currents, climate change, and his keen observations of all. This is the only book by Ruth Ozeki I've ever read, but she writes extremely well. I enjoyed her sense of humor, careful depictions of daily life on both sides of the Pacific, complexity of viewpoint, character creation. The book is a rueful, absorbing, and truthful look at our lives today and the links and gulfs between ourselves, other cultures, and the natural world. I highly recommend it.
B005ZO6NRA|4.0|Certainly had major differences with the book but entertaining to watch.  Good if you like the action and adventure type movies.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A book told in several points of view.  I loved how the characters revealed the story and the connections in their own way.  I highly recommend this book.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I've always been a fan of Political Dramas, like the Practice. The Good Wife reminds me of the Practice with a few twist in the story line
1400069807|5.0|I had heard a review of this book on NPR, so I knew the nature of it. As previously stated, this is NOT a diet/nutrition book, or only in a roundabout way. This is about the systematic manipulation of our tastebuds and our purchasing habits by an industry that has done so in a ruthless and calculating manner and with almost unlimited resources. I exercise and thought I was doing a fairly decent job of making thoughtful choices, but I have been snowed by the massive marketing machine as much as those who choose blindly, relying only on what they like. I CANNOT look at food the same way. It's not a case of, \\"Well damn, I can't eat that.\\" It's more like, \\"I have no desire whatsoever to eat that.\\" Knowledge is only power if one has the power and authority to actually use it. Since we each get to choose what and how much we eat, knowledge, in this case, truly is power. Once you know, you can't not know.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I would give it a 5 but there are several issues with this game that I am having...<br />1.) friends don't show up<br />2.) ran out of quests<br />3.) Doesn't update<br /><br />Otherwise it's an ok game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for the next one! Goes by way too quickly. Keep looking around and be persistent. Lots of neat effects!
B008GGA5EQ|1.0|This was not erotic nor erotica it was just plain disgusting. There was no story, no flow and it did not make any sense at all. Worst book I have ever read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great resource for Bible Study,can view dozens of versions at 1 site and the price is right. I like it

B008VBYN80|2.0|I have no interest in playing this game. My daughter downloaded it by accident. I'm sure it is a great game though.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Amazing book. It is a great addition to the series. I could not put the book down. I am hungry for more books for the series.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Great album,  a lot like the  old Black Sabbath.buy this album and you won't be disapointed. God is Dead rocks.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Another masterpiece by John Grisham. Just brilliant. The action never stops. This is the best book I have read in awhile. Hope Mr. Grisham will write another book for the series.

B005HEPOKU|5.0|I enjoyed it then and because it is easy to view I like it now .The Kindle is working fine,too.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Wonderful adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs book. Full of action, it will keep you fascinated from start to finish. Wish Disney would make other John Carter movies.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Was looking forward to this movie coming out for some time. I grew up watching the Wizard of Oz so there was some lingering anticipation. The cast for the most part did a really good job (some better than others) but the cinematography was awesome and the imagination of was really good. Didn't run too long or short, just the right time. Only thing that I was not crazy about was Mila Kunos as the wicked witch (her transformation...was expecting something a little more hideous rather than what she was).
B00CWY76CC|3.0|fun little puzzles. more of same would. be nice.  the puzzles are fairly easy if you are observant.  I wait for updates on this
B00COHAUD4|2.0|I have the hardest time watching scary movies without...getting the crap scared out of me. This was not the case with this movie, from start to finish. At no point was a startled or on the edge of my seat. The only positive was having Jessica Chastain in the movie providing some acting ability. I literally wanted to just turn it off several different times, but since I paid for it I forced myself to watch it.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The acting is good, the special effects are amazing, but I felt (personally) that the plot dragged on for too long.  You want the main character (&#34;Oz&#34;) to just get to the realization that he needs to change (and do it).  There are several points in the film where he professes to want to change - or promises that he will - but then doesn't.  The characters were well done and the eventual battle with the witches was quite lively.
B003EYVXTQ|3.0|I liked the movie because of its nature, but it is very slow to build up and never really gets intense.<br /><br />The quality of the actual DVD was great.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I actually like the Die Hard movies, but this film is just a sad excuse for a movie.  It should have been called The Die Hard Avengers (as no one ever gets hurt and bad guys act so poorly).
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have played this game for years & love that it is available on Kindle.<br />Challening and fun. Haven't been playing long on Kindle.<br />Would like to change the tiles to something I recognize more easily.
B00CBRADU2|3.0|I wouldn't buy this film for my collection, but I have to say that I was impressed.  This was not a meaningless Arnold vehicle (at least I didn't think so).  It was a fun way to waste a couple of hours and feel good at the ending.  As with many action movies, the plot is thin, some of the action is not believable, but a decent popcorn movie.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Enjoy the convenience of playing where ever I am. Best solitaire game to keep you company.<br /><br />all my family & friends play this game & enjoy it very much.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I wish I would have read it 2 businesses ago. My next business will be BIG and will be organized more in line with many of the principals listed in this book. Basic fundamentals....Systems do work.  Thank you very much for your insight Mr. Gerber.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Puzzles are too easy and too small. Can't remove it from my Kindle but I would if I could.<br />It is my eyes....not  probably the game.
B003O6QCPO|5.0|Did you ever have the opportunity to set around in a jam session when the band is just picking out a tune and trying something new?  I did a time or two and this Album takes me back to another time and place!  It is like I have a front row seat and a beer in my hand!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this show, it reminds me of Downton Abbey, while not at all being like Downton Abbey. I'm not even sure what pulls me in exactly, I just know that I love the actors and cannot wait from episode to episode what will be happening to the characters and story lines.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Nothing like the movie, and I was expecting a lot since it was such a great movie. But the book was even better.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I first heard them on  -  The Jay Leno show -  I made a point to remember their name, so I could check them out over the internet -<br />I just wish they had more music. They are one of my favorite bands, now.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Good movie, made me laugh!  I could relate to many of the problems faced by this family!  Paul Rudd is great in this movie!
B0053TMP24|5.0|The adventures of Percy Jackson are fun to read and find out what happens.  You can hardly ever tell!My only complaint is that the books are not very long.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|But the lack of plot coupled with a terrible musical score makes this the worst Tarantino movie I've seen....very disappointing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a super fun game! I really loved it. It's really fun and entertaining, plus I love the fact that it's world tour, so if you update it it's place(country/region/whatever) changes and gives the customer a different scenery and different colored trains. I easily bore of a game after having one for a while so I guess you could say that it's more fun for me to play this game. :p
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This item was a good read.  I just kept coming back for more.  This author is doing a great job.
B00BFV1JZI|5.0|One of the best trilogy's I have read in a long time. I could not put them away. Great way to spend a 7 hour flight was with mocking jay.
0375413405|5.0|This is a great book to help the novice learn cooking techniques.  Would recommend it to anyone interested in expanding their cooking talents.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I am totally hooked on Fringe. The show gets better with each season and the acting is fantastic. The plot twists are hard to anticipate. It keeps me on my toes.

B008JFUO36|3.0|Oblivion is one of those movies where so many scenes are a potential bathroom break and if it were edited more aggressively could have been collapsed down to about an hour. The film opens on a 2 minute voice over from Tom explaining things to the audience, followed by a dialog desert for the next 30 minutes, then it twists into a frenzied, quasi love story that taps into Total Recall territory. It's a strangely soulness film, presumably to reflect the loneliness of living in the new world's reality, but as a result it's hard to connect to any of the major characters.<br /><br />Aside from the beautiful apartment in the sky that would send anyone with vertigo into a constant state of anxiety, the production design is fairly derivative of other sci-fi (Total Recall, Wall-E, the Matrix, etc.) Without giving too much away, there are fairly major plot holes and when they finally drop the big surprise, it's pretty clear that somebody thought that ripping off \\"Moon\\" as an action film would be a good idea. Although Oblivion looks good and it's a little more introspective than a typical Cruise blockbuster, it's ultimately a bit vapid and is easily forgettable.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I was disappointed with this movie...  I literally counted down the days till Cloud Atlas was available on DVD but after watching the first five minutes of the movie I found myself dis-interested and going onto the Amazon website to sell back the DVD. I watched the entire movie but I should have purchased the $3.99 instant video versus wasting money purchasing the DVD (Note: I purchased the DVD because I thought the movie was going to be \\"deep\\" or \\"exciting\\" and I may need to rewind scenes but that did not happen...).<br /><br />PROS: 1) Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are GREAT actors in general and I liked the versatility of the actors within the various time periods 2) Interesting overall theme of karma, past lives, we're all connected, etc. 3) A few good scenes in the movie.<br /><br />CONS: 1) Most of the good scenes were already reflected in the movie trailer 2) The movie was way too long (should have been two hours instead of three hours) 3) Too much switching back and forth between time periods, which was a bit confusing and disconnected 4) the overall theme of the movie was not clearly communicated in the movie 5) the movie needed more action scenes considering it was a 3 hour movie 6) The movie would have been more successful if it was edited to a Rated PG-13 movie instead of the current Rated R with unnecessary cursing, nudity, sex scenes, etc.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I was hoping for a more interesting story line... but I did like the visuals, and the acting was good.<br />Fun enough.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|Very good writing.<br /><br />Imagining Anna Hathaway as Emma Morsley helped a lot to make it a nicer experience.<br /><br />Although it has a somewhat sad ending, it definitely was a beautiful one too.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is fun and challenging, I would definitely recommend it to everyone! The bright colors are also enjoyable. This was a great buy!
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I really like Bruce and the character of John McClain but this was just a hot mess of explosions. Barely a plot, acting was virtually not there and I was bored. Skip it! Pretend it stopped  with number 4.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book, liked better then movie, I read book first then movie, but the book was more intense
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This is a fantastic, well written romantic comedy, with twists and turns, almost disappointments, intriguing characters.  Can't wait to see the film.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Enjoyable family program.  With a nice theme and content for the entire family.  Very few issues with flow and positive message
B0061JPYX2|5.0|I believe Amy was a talented singer gone too soon. I'm sure she had a lifetime of music within. This was one of my best purchases for this year so far
B004K00NMG|3.0|No special looking about the blu-ray.  The movie was just okay.  My daughter watched the whole way through but I'm not sure how many times she will watch it again when she can choose something else.  The main reason we bought it was $5.
B003M0H4NG|4.0|I bought the disc because I heard that it was a milestone recording and I like some of his other stuff. I like the second disk best because the music to me was more structured and melodic. I would think this is a must for Miles Davis fans.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I feel as if this book could have been a lot longer but it should've been at least a little longer. It needed more elaboration in some parts that I would've enjoyed. It was a very good book, don't get me wrong, excellent read, but parts of it seemed glossed over that's all.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Book had a lot of twists that I liked, kept it interesting. Had a very unexpected ending. Pretty good read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging, but not to hard! found myself getting stumped a time or two, but kept looking. glad that there are no hints because then it would be to easy.

1608862801|5.0|My 10yo son and 8yo daughter love this book. They read it themselves, and out loud to their 6yo brother & 3yo sister. These are fun reading books. My wife isn't fond of the whole Adv. Time. but they are very excited and play with the toys and read the books all the time. Their mind is energized as they play make believe and use the stuffed characters to make all sorts of scenarios for hours on end.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|We've become addicted to The Tudors. The casting, costumes, and story are all superb. The quality of the sets couldn't be better. We have been reading quite a bit of English history and the storyline is right on.

0307352153|4.0|I should start by saying that I am an introvert--one who fought against being an introvert for many years as I was continually told that I needed to change, that I needed to \\"come out of my box.\\"  So, from my personal position, this was an incredibly freeing book to read.<br /><br />Cain starts by examining not introverts, but the extrovert ideal.  When I first started, I found this a bit awkward.  However, as I got into the book, I realized that this was necessary to set the foundation for her examination of introverts.  And she does examine them from every angle--nature versus nurture, cultural influences, even biological influences.  This book is packed with information, but Cain is able to present it in such a way that it is easily readable.  There were times that I felt it dragged just a bit, but that happened when she discussed areas (such as business) for which I don't have much interest.  Other people may find those sections to be the most interesting.<br /><br />I've seen many bloggers reading this book, and I know it has shown up on more than a few \\"bests\\" lists.  And I'm happy for that.  Cain has an important message to share and I hope that people do read this book--introverts and extroverts--and take it to heart.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I did not see the movie, but I heard so much about it, that I felt I needed to read it.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.<br />It was so well written and to think it was the author's first novel.  Even if you saw the movie, this book is well worth<br />reading.  I highly recommend it.  I couldn't put it down.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love playing this game!!  It is challenging and I have a great time trying to beat my own score..
B002VPE1WK|5.0|You just cannot beat this extremely spacious bag for the price.  Lots of room inside and ample pockets in the inside cover.  I would like a few more pockets and a zippered gadget area, but I cannot fault the bag for their absence.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|To be honest.... I did not expect much.<br /><br />IT IS AWESOME!!! Oh so funny. It will make you wonder if you wrong about the villains in other horror movies.
0553386794|3.0|Characters: B+ Some really great ones. My favorites are Tyrion Lannister, Robert Baratheon, Sansa Stark, and Sandor Clegane.<br />For all the wonderful characters, the story is diluted by a lot of really bland ones. I found it very easy to confuse the many different incarnations of \\"Trusty old knight in his 50s.\\" Ser Rodrik, Ser Barristan, Ser Mormont, Ser Brynden Tully, Ser Vardis Egan... they were the same to me. (I mentally used Sir Tuxford from the /Gummi Bears/ cartoon for all of these guys: [...] )<br /><br />I like that everybody has good and bad points. I like that women have useful roles and credible character developments. I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters on the Eastern (Dothraki) continent storyline. They seemed written halfheartedly.<br /><br />I had to take notes on everybody to keep the characters straight. It felt like there would be a final exam or something. Not fun, and it took me out of the book.<br /><br />World: B. The farther south we go, the less I care. The Wall and the Others seems NEAT and very imaginative. The idea that each major castle is powerfully fortified in a very different way was cool (high on a mountain, twin castles straddling a river, between three rivers, biosphere food supply, etc.) Once we get to King's Landing I feel as though this is very familiar fantasy territory. And the Eastern Dothraki stuff just felt...yawn.<br /><br />Mood: A. Home run here. I love the grittiness. I love how Tyrion embodies the realpolitik grittiness and Sansa demonstrates the perils of a sanitized/idealistic worldview. I think that's why those two are my favorite characters so far.<br /><br />Mechanics: C+. The long seasons are a cool idea, but how would castles other than Winterfell with its greenhouses have enough food during winter? The longer-than-Earth years are also a nice touch. But I hate the grade inflation with all the knights. Every knight is a great swordsman. 60 year old knights kick ass. 30 year old horse lords kick ass. 16 year old flower knights kick ass. They're ALL SO TALENTED. C'mon. There hasn't been a real war in a decade, so some of these guys surely have sinecures and are hoping nobody will call them on it. I reject the idea that a corrupt and dissolute kingdom is 100% staffed by the feudal version of Navy SeAL knights.<br />Also, there is no way any of the Southron kingdoms would continue to pay military taxes to the Night's Watch when there is no apparent threat from the north. They Soviet Union had nuclear missiles, which are way scarier than zombies, and just 15 years after it collapsed most European nations started witholding NATO dues. The Others haven't been seen in 8,000 Westeros years, which is like what, 10,000 Earth years? Nope.<br /><br />Plot: Incomplete. 800 pages is just nuts, and almost nothing gets resolved. /The Godfather/ was 500 pages. /Dune/ was 500 pages. And yeah they both had sequels, but in both of those novels there was clear progress and a satisfactory ending. I use those two novels because all three of these books have a lot of characters, a lot of morally grey areas, and a lot of scheming and murder as dynasties grow and change.<br /><br />Style: B-. Functional. He's no Tolkien or Rowling, but he's not a hack, either. The mystery murder subplot is well done. Tyrion has some great gallows humor. Catelyn narrates her marriage honestly and clearly. The writing didn't dazzle me, but neither did it make me cringe.ck ass. They're ALL SO TALENTED. C'mon.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this story and love the things they say to each other. Sex is steamy and the story kept me interested. I am sick of Eva's mom, annoying and needy. I hated the ending, oh wait, there wasn't one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can you escape is a fun and entertaining puzzle game. The levels get progressively more difficult.  I look forward to more levels.
B005I6EU48|5.0|Great item. I think it is a perfect thing for the kindle fire. I carry mine with me all over the place. If I should drop it at least the case will protect it. It looks just like you are carrying a book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was amazing and a must read so beautifully written and much better than the movie! I cried happy tears so much
B0050AV5MW|5.0|The book in itself is incredible. It's good to have all 4 books in one file and perfectly separated.<br />The only thing that doesn't seem to be working is the time remaining feature in some of the chapters.<br /><br />But definitely get this!!
030758836X|1.0|I bought this book over three months ago, and I found it extremely difficult to read because it was distasteful to read about a victim who is relentlessly being treated unfairly.  Little did I know then that he/she is never vindicated.  The ending was such a let-down after so much drama.  I felt the author copped out.  To take your readers on a suspenseful roller coaster ride in the hope that in the end there is some vindication for the victim only to reveal an ending that was not just anticlimactic, but unrealistic -- even more so than the events leading up to it -- and a bit idiotic (I mean who does that???), is cowardly.  I did not like this book, particularly because I don't like pointless books.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is very fun game to track your vichale flip and how much fun  and to see it try and it the hill and do flips and air drive
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read Khaled Hosseini's other two books and enjoyed them both so I was excited to read this book.  It started out horrifically, as his books tend to be, but was not nearly as difficult to read as the other two.  I couldn't put the book down as he wove the stories together.  It is not as tragic as his other books, but it is just as interesting.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found it to be mildly entertaining but the fact is it is totally and truthfuly Not hard enough but enlightened
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun, kids and adults alike use logic and deductive reasoning to solve puzzles, sequences, riddles.... so much fun!
B005COO1X6|5.0|typical Stephen King short story - no long back story just 'here it is'. main character (or two) and has a beginning, a middle and an end.
B00821OX98|4.0|I really enjoy the show. It starts off quick, then hits a little slow patch to build characters and then is right back into it. Worth watching if you're into sci-fi
1476734941|3.0|While the author cites several studies where people have lost weight by fasting, what seemed obvious was that there were no long term studies of people's health after they were on this diet for a while. What concerns me is that the author says its okay to eat whatever you want on the five off days. The reason for this is in the study he focused on, dieters still lost weight when they ate what they wanted on the off days. He does say later that you should be sensible, but really doesn't say how. Eating unhealthily for 5 days a week can still cause problems and it seems the author doesn't address this. I seriously doubt fasting for 2 days will negate the effects of eating how you want the rest of the week even though it may help drop a few pounds. For me, I'd like to see a plan that takes health just as seriously as weight loss.

B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I love that the movie is populated with actual opera and musical talent. Good story, great acting! Further proof talent is ageless.
B0064QNS62|1.0|Very slow responding game on my kindle. The controls for the character are very complicated and the story line is nonexistent and boring.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very thankful for the Bible App. Provides easy access to several versions, bookmarks pages and has several neat features including highlighting. Happy to have it on the go.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written historical fiction.  It provided a fascinating look at life in the early 1900 when there appeared to be a much greater distinction between classes with little, if any, opportunity for those born into poor families to better themselves.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|A decent watch. The action could have displayed  Cap's strength / abilities better. Don't expect to be blown away, but you will not be bored watching eiher.

I had stocked up on most of the Asian ingredients so I was ready to go. I keep the book out on my kitchen counter since I use it so much and it is also a conversation piece.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and not too hard.  The graphics is pretty good.  It seems to have lots of levels, and the advertising is not intrusive.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|Like most media about zombies, World War Z is really about the humans.  Max Brooks nails exactly what humans will do and how they will react in the face of extinction.  The forthcoming movie appears nothing like this book (which probably wouldn't play well in a movie).  This book is about hard choices, cold decisions, and the fallout from that.  There are no villains, even the zombies are not villains in that they are not cognizant enough to be evil.  They are victims that must be killed.  In this book, the story is about people, and their sometimes unfathomably chilling stories of survival during the apocalypse.  It will make the reader think about what they would do, how they would act, and what-or who-you would sacrifice for survival.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The relationships of these characters  are intertwibed skillfully and interestingly. I do find this done well in his books. It gives one  insite into the hardship of making a good living or just scraping by existence.  Regardless, the desire to keep family and friends in ones life is important.  Sadly, corruption isfound in all socities and the poor suffer the most.  Yes, i reccomend this is a compelling read.I found it hard to put down.

My card was charged and I got a receipt for the purchase, but nothing changed in the app. I was just scammed out of $5.99. I've been told that there's nothing to be done. What? Was I supposed to know that in-app purchasing didn't work? Thanks for taking my $6.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|If I hadn't read the book, I think I would have liked it better.  Too much was changed from book to movie and I think the story lost it's charm because of it.  His other books were portrayed better when made into movies.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I haven't read too many King books but the few I have read I have enjoyed. This book is highly entertaining. I have two reservations about the book. One possible ending is just too grim and the butterfly effect throws the world into chaos and misery which is unrelenting. The eventual conclusion is more to my liking.<br /><br />As to the Kennedy assassination, I disagree with Mr. King's assertion that Oswald acted alone. Given the volumes of evidence to the contrary, Mr. King is in a shrinking minority that holds this view. Having the assassination as a back drop to a time travel saga is nice touch. For readers who are into either the assassination or time travel, this is a good choice.

0596805527|1.0|This books is repetitious, non-linear, rarely reflects on JavaScript as a language, with pointlessly complicated examples. The author feels the need to stuff his own personal experience into every chapter, even where it is pointless, and constantly references different ECMAScript version standards without explaining why he does so. No context, too long, useless scribbles, this book is just awful.

B001L83PLQ|5.0|I liked the book because it took me from page to page, wanting to know about the characters, what they felt, thought, di, and what happened to them.  There's nuance and authenticity in the way the characters, their relationships, and their situations are depicted.  It's also good for busting stereotypes of Africans.
B005DJREGQ|1.0|This is one of the worst shows that a parent could show to their young children. When gratuitous sex is acceptable as it is in this sitcom, it just shows how far gone the Hollywood establishment is.

1589795474|1.0|You want to save money - Then please don't buy this book. There is not a single thing that I learned from this book. The examples that the writer provides and his way of writing is absolutely childish. It is almost as if a kid wrote this book. I was really hoping page after page that I will get something valuable out of this book, but no didn't even get a dollar worth of knowledge, absolute waste of time.

B007HUD6OS|5.0|I've loved all of the Theodore Boone books and I have donated them to a middle school library in my area.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun, fun, fun! Great way to pass the time. Solid entertainment. Only wish stats were shown while playing. Otherwise great app. Again fun fun fun.<br />Mvass1
B005CAATXG|5.0|It's nice to hear a good rock band and with a lead female vocalist when everyone is going hip hop and alternative these days.  I really enjoyed the CD and think it's a great one to buy if you want to get away from the standard radio bands you hear all the time.
B009YQJ322|3.0|If you've seen The Raid: Redemption then you've seen this movie.  I still enjoyed though and the action.  I think Urban did a decent job as Judge Dredd.
0091947561|5.0|someone mention this book while on a plane ride, and i am happy i got it. actually i got two, one as a gift
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game just wish it would not take up so much space on my kindle fire. My son has it on his ipod and plays it all the time.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had heard of this show, but never saw it till i bought. This is a well written, superbly acted show
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The background story of the Dissolution of Firefly is as interesting and heartbreaking as the pilot episode, and worth investigating.  Joss Whedon's Firefly series was abandoned by its network before completion, and ignored the developing fan base.  That population was strong enough to support and justify the development of the SERENITY movie, thanks to Joss, his backers, and their incredible team!  The loss of this great concept TV series is soothed by the success of its actors in other series,  e.g. CASTLE, V, NUMB3RS, CHUCK.<br /><br />This delightfully written, filmed, and acted Western is a believable and barely predictable tale of thieves whom we grow to admire for their tenacity in uncertain times.  Joss tips his hat to Shakespeare, Homer, Chaucer, Plato, Socrates, Xiang Yu and other Eastern philosophers, in wit and rationale.  Each episode is a well-considered gem, sufficient to admire alone, but is best viewed in their intended sequence, as a graduated string of pearls from which to admire the pendant, and last to be appreciated, full length film: SERENITY.  This series and movie alone are worth the $80 Amazon Prime fee, for the repeated enjoyment of their superb construction, psychology, lighting, and well-chosen special effects.
B0068857QA|5.0|As a combat veteran I can assure all that this a very realistic and honest show which touches and exposes the shere chaos of war as well as the strength, wisdom,determination and utter humaity of combat. This is a must see for all!
B00112GVFO|4.0|very enjoyable movie, easy to follow with good character interaction.  Also shows how greed still is willing to sacrifice the environment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am far from a book reader but 3days after purchase I am done and can't wait to purchase book number 2!!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have been waiting for this book for some time now, but it didnt really meet my expectations. The language lacks flows and the story has the feel of an author hurrying to finish the book. To me it seems like a quick way to tie up all loose ends and finish the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app does all I need for my simple calculations. Big buttons are easy to use, and also to find.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was so excited when I got this book but disappointed with it. Though some parts were good,<br />some were redundant. Gideon still leaves Eva \\"up in the air\\" and does his disappearing, clam up act trying<br />to protect her. What happened to the Alpha Gideon? He was more like a wuss in this book. I like the first 2 books better. I like the characters so I will read the others, hopefully they will not be too prolonged and boring.
0802473156|4.0|This book is well written. The concept is easy to understand and relate too. After I had finished the book I saw a new perspective on how my loved ones may want to have loved expressed to them. Although I may not agree with everything in this book the basic principle seems to be a handy tool in any relationship!
1594489505|3.0|The women of Afghanistan have my sympathy.  I felt myself oppressed as I read this novel and grateful for the freedom I enjoy.  The story, I was surprised to find, was a love story although convoluted.  I was not impressed with the writing or the characters.  Hosseini obviously has talent and maybe struggled to find a follow up to Kite Runner.  I paid a little of nothing for this book and good thing because it won't be part of my permanent collection.  I felt that only the surface of the strife and tension in Afghanistan was touched and I would have preferred a deeper, more location driven story, although the ending was satisfying.
0805092447|5.0|Son wanted books to read to his expected baby in the womb<br />great book with great reputation.  Will be good for new baby also.
B000BS2MJS|3.0|This crazy novel just ends, just when the story is getting interesting.  I don't know what all the hoopla was about.  It is neither graphic nor obscene.  Seems the British censors just needed someone to pick on.  Why Lawrence chose to end the book the way he did is something I'd like to ask him.  No matter now of course.  But I would have like to have seen a sequel.
0064430170|5.0|Son wanted books to read to his expected baby in the womb<br />great book with great reputation.  Will be good for new baby also.
1400034205|4.0|I like Maugham's writing but this story is not as good as Of Human Bondage, which is outstanding and in my permanent collection.  I prefer Maugham's third person narration.  When he narrates in the first person, is seems shallow.  Like something is missing.  In the first person, it's difficult to see all sides of the story.  I think he tells a better tale in novels where the third person narration dominates.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Tintin was a thrilling and exciting movie. It gripped me with suspense. I loved the characters, they made me smile and laugh with them. The humor was very wittily added in at the right moments. The plot captured my attention; it was well written with emotion and action. I definitely recommend this movie.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|For a $50 watch, it looks professional and runs well enough.  I have a smaller wrist so the watch is a good size.
1614270198|5.0|Even though this is old news now a days it has some fantastic, supportive affirmations and great stories. Very convincing and totally makes sense.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Super fun and I love neon colors, by the way I think IF OTHERE colors were added such as neon pink it would be such a success. It definitely keeps you busy whn you're bored.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|Updates, updates, updates. When is Amazon going to step up and control the updates better.  Sometimes months to update this app after it updates the free version is ridiculous.  Fix asap.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Like this horse app very much. I showed my four yr old and she loves it. She laughs and screams when the horse makes a sound
B0060AY6FO|3.0|This is a nice diversion for Pride and Prejudice fans.  Continues the story of the characters we came to know.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Must play! Graphics r great. Game play runs great as well. I recommend this game for everyone! I look foward to playing the game more! I have one horse now and am already a champ.
B009YVBZO6|1.0|Nothing happens once I choose a station; my son loaded this on my Kindle, but I haven't been able to use it
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|This looked promising and since it was free I decided to give it a try on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\".  started it up, stopped working immediately.  Tried several more times, same result.  Uninstalled, reinstalled, same result ... stopped working immediately on start-up. The opening screen starts with a few use tips.  Tried selecting the \\"don't show this again\\" button to see if that would help.  No difference.  Can't get it to run for more than 30 seconds.  I think this app has potential so I will leave it in the cloud, but for now, it is certainly no good to me.
0440244870|1.0|I had been meaning to read this book for years, but never got around to it.  Now, it was available on Kindle from the library, so I got it for free.  I'm glad to say, it was worth every penny.  Seriously, I can't believe this book has maintained popularity through the years. From beginning to end, it is one unbelievable and repetitive tale after another.  As sad as it is to really be a shopaholic, the reader develops no sympathy at all for the main character in this book.  I couldn't force myself to like her.  I wanted to see her fail, but that never happened.  In spite of overspending, lying, dodging all responsibility, etc., she still comes out on top.  She gets some nice jobs, and of course, the cute and nice guy.  So predictable, so pitiful.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|The whole concept between these three films (one couple, filmed over a 20-year span) is captivating.  Add to that, smart, often surprising dialogue, attractive actors, and wonderful locations and it earns the stars.  I watched it backwards, beginning in a theater with the latest film, Before Midnight, and then went to Amazon to find the first two films.  It was great fun to see some of the references in the last film emerge in the earlier ones, and even more engaging to see the actors age and mature.<br /><br />Everyone can identify with people who connect briefly and then move on with their lives.  These three films allow us to imagine our own re-connections.<br /><br />Why not five stars?  I found Ethan Hawke, while likable, not the most interesting male lead.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Interesting idea and fascinating photos but did not love the book. Just okay, kind of tedious. I Hated the ending, must be planning a sequel.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|One disc had issues, but other than that the rest were okay. Series is excellent and addictive. Would recommend to those who have not seen the series or those that have!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I found the story very engaging and fast moving. I think I have found a new author to follow on my Kindle.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My 7 yr olds review: This game is very fun.  It requires strategy and imagination. I like pursuit mode, because your helicopter follows your balloons wherever you go.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game. Very addictive. Make your senses go wild i just love it. I really recommend this game you wouldnt regret it.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I thought all the actors did a great job, but I found the storyline too boring.  I was also expecting something more spectacular in the way of special effects.  As mentioned ...... all around just boring.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|at the first time i downloaded, this game did not working at the login, but after a day, i turned it on and this game login very fast and no problems, thanks gameloft, and i will buy more games soon!
B000V4NX04|5.0|If you think the latest revelations about the NSA spying on all of our calls, emails, and browsing activity doesn't have consequences, then you're not paying attention! This film shows the real human consequences of spying, and how it hurts everyone, including the spy!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I enjoyed this movie with Matthew McConaughey.  Just love him as a performer.  I do hope he does a sequel soon.
1400069807|5.0|Very eye opening. Michael spills the beans on the very dirty politics that go on in the food industry and just how the public is being hoodwinked into thinking that we are eating healthy when in fact we are slowly poisoning ourselves.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil does it again! I've read everything of his I could find over the past 12+ years. Not to mention listening to the audio book versions in the car. Looking upspeachesand interviews on YouTube, and NPR. So,my opinion may be biased, but yes. Read this if you would like to experience a little more Magic in your life. If you'd like step out of your life for a spell. Or you just enjoy good writing.
B001MSMULG|5.0|If you are going to read Silva's Gabriel Allon series (which I HIGHLY recommend), do yourself a favor and start with this book (the first)  To be clear, the order of the series is:<br /><br />The Kill Artist (2000)<br />The English Assassin (2002)<br />The Confessor (2003)<br />A Death in Vienna (2004)<br />Prince of Fire (2005)<br />The Messenger (2006)<br />The Secret Servant (2007)<br />Moscow Rules (2008)<br />The Defector (2009)<br />The Rembrandt Affair (2010)<br />Portrait of a Spy (2011)<br />The Fallen Angel (2012)<br />The English Girl (2013)<br /><br />Do be careful though, these excellent books are addictive, and you may find yourself immersed in one of these stories after another!
B000URDE2Y|5.0|some of the best guitar and sounds i have ever listened to great rock n roll  a blast from the past
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Good read, zooming through as it reads very fast, Cornwell does it again. I am amazed as i have been reading her for years, still fresh.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I didn't buy this mic because I was counting on it. I just thought maybe I'd get lucky and find a great value mic. Not so. I've returned it, and hoping that the replacement at least works.<br /><br />Upon opening the package and recording with this mic, I noticed a lot of crackling sounds, and very low audio levels. I discovered that the wiring close to the connector and to the mic were both faulty, so if you bent the wire slightly, you could complete the circuit and hear audio. Mind you, this is a new product, in the box, so how the wiring is faulty is beyond me.<br /><br />Hoping that the replacement at least has this issue fixed, and will re-rate if so.<br /><br />Bottom line, for now, don't waste your time or money.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|This could've been a really great movie along the lines of Van Helsing, but they tried to make it a horror movie with gore.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game it really makes you use your brain. can't wait for some new rooms to escape from, lol
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|this app is really great my kids enjoy playing as well as I do its fun entertainment for the whole family and it teaches them about the ocean such a great app
B004U8VX2M|5.0|This is the second time around for me to watch the entire series. I just love the story and the characters.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is a great book.  If there could have been more in this trilogy I would have bought them as soon as they came out.  So sad that the author never knew how much people enjoyed the 3 books in this trilogy.  I will say the Swedish names in the series were a bit daunting but by book 3 I got used to them.  Loved this book.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really enjoyed this read 3/4 through and thought it was going to become a favorite. But then it faded, like many books, at the end when the author was trying to bring it all together. Family is the message.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I think every woman and man should read this book.  I think that the ideas I got from this book are invaluable.  It's genius.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I saw the preview for the upcoming movie and decided to read the book. I loved the characters and the story was engaging. Now I'm on to the rest of the series!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|something different from word or number games. makes you think outside the box so to speak. wish it had more levels
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This is an excellent piece of software to share data between devices and among friends.  Would recommend to anyone with more than one device and/or wanting to share data/pictures/etc with friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is awesome. I love the simplicity of it. although there is only one problem. it needs more updates.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Incomparable story, characters, plot, scenery and actors!  Bravo Masterpiece Theater!  I became a fan the first time I watched it, and my enthusiasm in the telling of this English aristocracy drama only increases.<br /><br />Beware!  You will be drawn in within seconds to this dynamic and engrossing epic tale.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|wasnt as good as i had hoped for seems like all the best parts were in the previews not my fave movie
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show. It goes against everything America was built on but on the other hand the type of society we are moving toward. The characters come alive so well, the clothes are amazing. It's a fun escape.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I loved this movie. The quality is fine and the movie itself was well done.  I am a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs.
B003B02O0A|4.0|Native son Grisham is wonderful on southern life,  manners and mores, and law in action. The plot has a couple of loose ends, but great writing, emotional involvement, and colorful characters make this a great read.
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|Had a lot of potential, but it just didn't really have that amazing moment.  It wasn't bad, but I wish I had rented and not bought it!  A one time watch, in my opinion.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|This was a gift and the person I bought it for really enjoyed them. It looks great. She said she had to be careful with the cases because I guess it can scratch the disks.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|I am not good at writing reviews, but I love this movie. I know this movie by heart. It might not be a Disney masterpiece, but it is one of my favorite Disney animated movies.
B005K17RU0|5.0|No matter what day or time, AccuWeather is always available and always accurate. I reccomend it to all my friends and co-workers...even my x-wife!
B00821OX98|5.0|I love this show I am addicted to it love love love this is a keeper. The cast is great as well .
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It is a excellent book, learn about life, is very interesting for any people who to know what can happen inside the others people, how do they think, and how it is their actitud.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was another great book from my favorite author. My only complaint is that I read it so quickly and I wish I could live in a world with the Hempstock ladies just a little longer.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|The add free version isn't worth the money... you should just get the free one. I don't see why they want you to pay 3 bucks for no adds. I would only pay a buck for no adds.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Terrific story...would recommend it for family night at your house.  One of my favorite baseball movies - always makes me smile...
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|I have never reviewed a program before, but I was so excited for this one that the disappointment prompted me. After downloading, no matter which way I try to install the actual Install vs Cancel option, at the foot of the permissions page, does not work. I try touching anywhere in the Install box, and no response. Cancel is the only way forward. Too bad as this sounds great. Running a Droid 4.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|Not a story often told about the assassination of President Lincoln....I thought the story was well crafted and told in a manner to make one think of the lengths a person or persons are willing to go in order to get what they want....regardless of right or wrong or truth or justice.....
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a fun game. It has cool graphics and the tasks are just the  right level of difficulty. I definitely recommend for all ages.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Awesome show. Always leaves you wanting to see the next episode! Can't wait for next Sunday. Never thought the Aliens wpd go rebel!
B0001EFTVA|5.0|This movie is not sold with enlgish voice actors... it only has  english subtitles. now if this doesnt hamper your ability to enjoy a film go ahead and order it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I highly recommend this trilogy.  It's a good read.  A good love story, but men may like it as well.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie is way better than the reviews say.  It's exciting and moves well.  We loved it from beginning to end and it ended way too fast.  Can't wait for the next installment of the story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put it down and was looking forward to book 3. Definately a chick book and a little kinky at times, but very good.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Definitely worth the price I paid for it. Commentary was great and the special features kept me happy for days.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read these three books faster than I've ever read any book.  Just couldn't put it down.  Can't recommend it enough.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I really enjoyed this game, very addictive. Just wish there were more levels.the background music was good as well, not too annoying like some games.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!  Very authentic period set show.  The characters are convincing.  The twists and turns are not outlandish, they are very believable.
B0091REZMW|5.0|nice game like it a lot like to solve mysteries. explore. new things. I wonder how many people are playbill this game right now.
B001NA6096|4.0|The movie is so 90's it is funny. Falls right in with the rest of the era, Reality Bites, Slackers, Clerks, Dazed & Confused.... perfect generational flick. The lines can be cheesy as Ethan Hawke states what is going to happen or why he is saying a certain line at that point in time. really this was new for the time, but now with reality TV so popular, this appears old fashion. Watched this because the 3rd in the series just cam out and never saw the first two, but will now be watching all three.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love dragons and this game is a great way to kill time with some of my favorite fantasy creatures.
B001O4QP3W|5.0|I remember first listening to this album in 90s. My friends and I were driving back from the CD store and Building Steam with a grain of salt came on and the beats were so unique that we just looked at each other with disbelief.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|I couldn't figure out anything! The day before I found how to change it from a camera to a video camera. But the the next day I couldn't
B006LSZECO|5.0|This one keep's you reading and turning pages one right after the other.This is one you think you have it figured out.But then come&#34;s a twist you did not see coming .Great ready don't start you les you can read all night long as I did.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Super duper fun great he was graphics and check u learn many facts and its fun!! Btw this is coming from a teen because YOLO!! Lol
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The story line of this movie was somewhat difficult to follow initially, and Daniel Craig plays an outstanding James Bond for the most part.  The Bond movies are interesting to watch, due to the multiple locations of the filming, and this movie lives up to the exotic locations for Bond to operate in.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Works Great with my Kindle Fire HD, I can choose full version or mobile version, keeps me logged in and looks great!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Movie was interesting in the concept of bring fish to a part of the world that is harsh and not friendly nature wise, to salmon who need specific temperature of water and water flow.  The acting was OK and the story line was believable.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Others have described the plot.<br /><br />Arnold acts.  Yes, he acts . . . like an actor.  He does a great job.<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot, action, cars, etc . . . but I loved seeing Arnold act.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Other than the first 15 minutes car chase scenes, the movie moves along at a slow pace with a story line that is hard if not impossible to believe.  Bruce goes through the motions, but the majority of the movie is filmed in darkness, which is not easy to watch for a long time, as this movie moves through slowly at best.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This is not Shakespeare.  This is an action flick.<br /><br />I can not ruin the plot since the plot is cars, explosions, guns & action.<br /><br />OK, I enjoyed the movie and had a blast.  It's so bad I watched it twice.
B00821OX98|4.0|Beginning was very interesting to see how the human race would react to an alien attack the 4th season really gets good
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|While I like Jeremy Renner and the idea behind this movie I think that in general it only rates 2-2.5 stars. HOWEVER, I don't care what the movie was or what it was about...Gemma Aterton gets it to 4-5 stars!
B00821OX98|5.0|I thought this was just another one of those alien invasion shows. This one is different and keeps me interested. I definitely recommend.........
B0013N4AT0|1.0|How can anyone listen to this? The vocals sound like Cookie Monster's initiation into a Satanic cult. Why listen to a hellish nightmare? What could motivate anyone to do so?
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I've only seen 6 episodes and i'm already hooked. I intend on purchasing it when it goes on sale and i hope it does soon.
B007HACDLK|5.0|While reading this novel I heard the news of Vince's passing. I am reminded of all the great hours I have spent in his and Mitch's world. I will miss them and all their team mates. Rest in peace.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Season #3 was probably the best season of Fringe. This was a very original series. To bad it was canceled.
B000FC146C|5.0|I have read this book for the second time now.  I would recommend for women but be sure you have the time to get immersed in the story because it is hard to put down.
B007P6VM04|5.0|The music of SMASH was often thrilling and I have purchased ever available track on iTunes (along with subscribing to both seasons of the show as shown without commercial breaks), but, like some of your other reviewers, I do find it irritating that some of the songs have been reserved for special outlets like Target. The show's two seasons were the best television I have seen on a commercial channel in years. I will mourn for the loss of future episodes of the show (and hope for a release of the songs of \\"Hitlist\\" in proper sequence, as in the recent case of your \\"Bombshell\\" release--although \\"The Right Regrets\\" certainly did not belong with Bombshell).
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I now own this because my grandson Cooper wanted to watch it one evening when I was babysitting.  Coop and I watched it twice that evening and got up the next morning and watched it again!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have been an Ebay junky for about 7yrs. I love that all I have to do is one tap and I am able to view the items I am searching for on a large screen, my phone was nice but the Kindle is better.
B00003CXIP|5.0|\\"Stand by Me\\", based on Stephen King's novella \\"The Body\\", is one of those movies that I never tire of watching. Set in the Pacific northwest in the late 50's, four boys (Will Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Donnell) go on a search for the body of a dead classmate. Their adventures and trials on the journey are multilayered and can be enjoyed on many levels. The photography is stunning. The dialogue is crisp and funny. Well written, well acted, and beautifully told. There are no wasted scenes so pay attention from the openning shot. A young Keifer Sutherland is great as a teenage hood. Richard Dreyfuss does a cameo and narration. I show this movie to my middle school students and they love it. The \\"R\\" rating is for vulgarity. Pretty tame stuff by today's standards. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!
B008BU75IQ|1.0|This is a big disappointment after how good the first two in the series were.  Totally boring and nothing to it...if you hadn't read the first two you would have absolutely no interest in the characters.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This was written by a friend of mine's husband.  Sorry it took me so long to purchase it!  Is reputed to be the best account of the war ever written.  I believe it!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app does exactly what it claims. You can track what everything on your tablet is draining from your battery. Plus, you do get a battery bar at the top for a quick view of what you have left. Very happy with this.
B004IYWN7C|4.0|My kids love the Disney classics, so they loved this one as well. Seeing Goofy, with a son was a little more relatable to them and they totally got a kick out if their adventure.
B00338QENI|5.0|Overall a beautiful story! This book was assigned by my professor, and I am glad she assigned this book. Never been a reader, but this book opened a new window...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is awesome and i like that you can get coins and you can also find the best way for you is to say don't think that you are not laid to go on people's daily
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Not very well written, but it gave a good story about how life REALLY is in N Korea. Many people should pay attention to what is going on over there! Sad lives for so many. I hope this man is having a great life here in America,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I've finally finished it it only took me 5min for each lvl so yay I love love love love love it so much you should get it to if you get bored easy or if you need something to do I highly recommend it

B00BN3ECTS|5.0|Great movie is a good date night movie or good movie with you friends.<br />Nice movie to see with your family
B008S4FZHI|2.0|I just love Patricia books, because once I started I could never put it back. This was not the case. The story has no interest and all the things that Scarpetta usually  do, she doesn't on this book. The thriller is in the last pages and the conclusion is quick. I only do not give one star because it is one of my favourites writers.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was excellent. It kept you guessing and you can't put it down.  The twists and turns had me on the edge of my seat.  I love this author and his works. He never fails to deliver excellent entertainment. I have read all of his works and search him out in hopes that he has something new!
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|The Master is an amazing film in many different ways. Technically it's perfect, the setting, the music, the acting, the scenery is all lush and realistic. The acting is also phenomenal, particularly Phoenix. The story is what trips a lot of people up, hell the first time I saw this in theaters my mind felt scattered for the next couple of days trying to piece everything together to little avail. Finally got around to watching it again and it's still really damn complex all around.<br /><br />Freddy is a world war 2 veteran who aimlessly wanders into random jobs until he wakes up on a boat run by 'Master' Dodd, and Dodd senses an unspoken comradery between him and Freddy. Throughout the film Freddy is encourage by Dodd to adapt to their cult and drop his impulsive habits. Their relationship isn't mutual though, Dodd regards Freddy more as a dog or a son then a friend. Possibly due to his usual nature of being around yes-men and passively ordering people around. Near the end as Freddy makes the most progress to being a reformed member of the cult he finds that he simply can't do it and resumes being his usual self. Dodd, while acting passively condescending to Freddy, also admires his free spirited nature towards everything.<br /><br />Another relationship that isn't shown as in depth is Dodd and his wife Peggy. While Dodd is the leader and showman of the cult, Peggy is the one who's really running the show behind closed doors.She is the first one to basically ask Dodd \\"what the hell is he doing here\\" regarding Freddy, since everyone else never questions or doubts their master. So in regards to power and control: Peggy>Dodd>Freddy. However Freddy isn't interested in playing ball, despite his best efforts he eventually realizes that the cult isn't for him and drops out, much to Dodd's dismay. What's ironic is how in the beginning Dodd and Peggy regard all naysayers to their cause as \\"scared\\", yet Dodd is clearly intimidated by Freddy's apathy during the end and threatens that if he leaves again they'll be mortal enemies.<br /><br />God damn this movie, I could go on and on, so I will. Similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's prior movie There Will Be Blood, there are many themes in play throughout the movie. Unlike There Will Be Blood, The Master's are much more subtle and the movie is like a giant onion where you keep peeling layer after layer off the movie. But the main thing I saw in The Master is multiple contradicting dualities in human nature. Most notably Freddy's impulsive nature vs Dodd's intellectual nature, and various layers of the relationship. I noticed some people criticized this movie for not having a 'likable' character, which wasn't the point of this movie. Instead it shows all of these dualities and contradictions between many different people trying to work together. Instead of taking sides, Paul Thomas Anderson shows them all on a level playing field, and letting the audience decide for themselves regarding the character's motivations and such.<br /><br />This movie is mind wracking, and is perfect for watching and discussing afterwards at a coffeehouse or something. You can tell Paul Thomas Anderson purposely made the film this puzzling and complex without a very satisfying climax to the Master. Unfortunately therein lies the problem with the Master, it's not so much a film as it is a two hour rorschach test like the cover hints at. I've been on the fence regarding the Master for almost a year now, and I still don't really have a clear decision whether I liked it or not. What's certain is that it's definitely something to watch if you're a voracious movie goer and want something to chew on for days, weeks, or months afterward.ns that if he leaves again they'll be mortal enemies.<br /><br />God damn this movie, I could go on and on, so I will.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Wow. Okay. I really didn't know what to expect when I first bought Silver Linings. I knew JLaw won an Oscar for her performance in the movie version, and I knew it dealt with mental illness. What I didn't know was how amazing this novel is.<br /><br />It talks about life. It is driven by the characters, and their struggle, rather than the plot. You're as clueless as Pat for the entire novel. This book can totally consume the reader in one of the greatest recent books I've read.<br /><br />I'm absolutely floored with this novel. For me, it's up with Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" and \\"Beatrice and Virgil\\", and Arundathi Roy's \\"God of Small Things\\". This book will make you think, and think about others, because you really don't know what someone is struggling through, when our society places so much of a stigma on mental illness.<br /><br />I already want to read it again.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Game and story are good. Control of your character is good for a kindle touch-screen interface. Though, I'd rather pay $3-5 up front for the game than to get it for \\"free\\" and then find out that purchasing gems for use in the game is all but a requirement in order to make it past the first few missions. These gems must be purchased using REAL money. If I'd had to pay a few bucks up front with no further or future need for $ to be spent on/in the game I'd have given this game a 5 star rating with a stellar review.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have the paperback books and wanted to download them on to my tablet.  I have read them a few times.

B006Y5H74W|5.0|One of the most engaging shows I have ever watched.  As soon as I finished watching the finale on Amazon Prime, I purchased the DVD set.  Something I will watch over and over.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I personally really enjoyed this film. Yes, the acting could've been better and the graphics and visuals more stunning but, if you let yourself be a kid again you will enjoy it also.<br /><br />Others have addressed the violence issue and yes, if you have sensitive children who are easily scared then stay away from this movie. I let my five year old watch it with us and she loved it. No nightmares or fear. Granted they don't show anyone being eaten but there is no doubt that is what is happening.<br /><br />Yes, this movie is predictable throughout most of the movie and we obviously know what happens but try not to let it distract from your viewing experience.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|Family movies are rare, but this one is particularly good.  Our young grandchildren enjoyed it, as we did, too.  Recommended!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I decided to read this after watching the movie. This book blows the movie out of the water!! Mental health has such a stigma about it and this book is a step in the positive direction!! Love it!
B003VW54QO|5.0|I love this movie, I have since the first time I saw it with my father at the drive-in. I now own it and have watched it many times. Howard Hawks directed a Great cast, John Wayne is pretty much playing himself and that's okay here, it works. Dean Martin is excellent, maybe the best I've ever seen him. He has the character of Dude nailed, I think this is his picture, you can't take your eyes off when he's in the scene. Also Walter Brennan is perfect. I've always been a fan of Ricky Nelson and he does a nice job here. A couple of Wayne stand-by's, Ward Bond and Harry Carey Jr. Claude Akins as the bad brother of powerful John Russell. Last but certainly not least the lovely Angie Dickinson as Feathers. She had done mostly TV and bit parts before this. My only complaint about the movie is they made Ms Dickinson Wayne's love interest. They look ridiculous together. She's young and pretty, and he's way too old for her and has a big gut. There has always been talk of this being a Hawks/Wayne counter punch to \\"High Noon\\". I don't see it that way, but I don't know. I didn't like Wayne's politics and have heard many stories that he wasn't a very nice person, at times cold, mean, single minded and a hypocrite, but I watch his western movies because they are entertaining and I enjoy them and for the most part ignore the person. He made a lot of good movies, and a few great ones,  \\"Red River\\" and the \\"Searchers\\" come to mind. And of course \\"Rio Bravo\\" one of my all time favorites!

B008XG1X18|5.0|It is great on my android.  I can see everything just as upon the computer.  The start instructions were a little sketchy but I figured them out.  I would still recommend as a great app to use.
B008N1LL42|2.0|the movie was just ok, nothing so great about it, would not want to see it again, and would tell my friends save the money
B009K86D86|5.0|Interesting, will probably never look at a hamburger the same way again. Like many documentaries it has a distinct point of view, bt at least some other views were heard.
B008M721MS|3.0|The messages just won't send!! A lot of the time the video chat pauses up and cuts out chunks of what the person is saying. Overall I guess it's an ok app...

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book began with an interesting premise that was great food for thought.  I liked the characters and their interactions.  Would recommend it.
B002RSDW80|5.0|This is a classic movie. I would recommend it for all food lovers and cooks or chefs. Julia Child is hilarious too!
B006IYG5HE|4.0|My first Harry Hole novel was The Devil's Star, the third in the series. It wasn't essentiaI, but I wish I'd read them in order (The Redbreast and Nemesis first) since there are some ongoing threads. The Redbreast was more difficult for me than The Devil's Star, mainly because it had more characters to keep track of, especially with the story moving back and forth between two eras -- WWII and present-day. It helped that I made a list of characters as they were introduced. I didn't make a cheat sheet while reading The Devil's Star, but I didn't find the cast of characters as challenging. Also, the Norwegian names in this one seemed more difficult for me to keep straight, e,g, men named Gudbrand and Gudeson and a Gudbrand region (I think), as well. One last comment: Nesbo states the name of each (it seems) neighborhood Harry goes to or through, which was distracting to me since I'm not familiar with Oslo -- do I need to remember the name of this neighborhood or can I ignore the name?  This is only an observation and not a criticism, as I assume the names provide an added richness to his Norwegian readers.  I probably missed some detail, but I agree with reviews that say the writing is outstanding.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Excellent plot, much of the story is unknown to the main character and the reader until the appropriate moment.  The reeader and the main character are off track until the end.  Good character growth too.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is MY favorite app. I want to apologize in advance for my attitude which is probably rather apparent in my review.  First: To all the whiners who say that its awful because: \\"the car flips over when i hit a bump\\", or even: \\"its boring, theres only two buttons\\", USE THE CONTROLS TO FLIP THE CAR, yes there are only two, BUT, because of that you should be able to figure out how they work very quickly. The Gas pedal/button on the RIGHT, makes the car flip COUNTER-clockwise, when you accelerate; the hood of the car like real cars goes up, when the vehicle(in app) is airborne, it will continue to spin that way. The LEFT button/brake pedal is the OPPOSITE. The car spins CLOCKWISE! The brake is also reverse, once the vehicle stops.    The entire game can be completed without any in-app purchases. Vehicles, maps and car up-grades are bought with in game coins. These are available to buy with real money, but THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED! It is a free app, the developers need money some how. Coins can also be earned by doing stunts, passing distance missions and driving over the coins littering the track. The stunts are: flipping, back-flipping, neck-flipping and air-times. The first two are self explanatory, neck-flipping is achieved when your driver hits his head and AFTERWARDS the car flips over, that requires approximately 270-360 degrees, depending on the cars position prior to the flip. Air times are probably also self explanatory; but you have to be in the air for about two seconds before the points start counting. It starts at 25, then 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 2000 and up, those values might not be completely accurate as I haven't been able to play the game in a while. The points count as coins. Each car has four different upgrades, they all have engine, tire and suspension, and then a fourth which varies by vehicle. The basic car, (possibly the most versatile) (the jeep), has FWD as its fourth,(so does the monster truck and the diesel 4x4) the dirt bike has better tilt control, the race car has advanced down- force, the tank and semi have upgradeable MPG's. There are others, but i'll let you discover them.  Yes the coins can take a while to earn enough for purchases, but keep playing you will get better and be able to earn more each time. I've gotten pretty good.    I will not demand you download or not download this as most reviewers do, I will tell you what the game is like so YOU can formulate your own opinion as to whether it is worth your time. I enjoy it still, so I will recomend it you. If you have any questions, make a reply to me. [...]  Have a nice day. :)
B00CHS31DG|5.0|Whether you believe in ghosts and spirits or not, this app is pretty fun.  We have had the strangest things happen with it, including words coming out that were in direct correlation with questions we asked! Creepy!  We also watched a blue blob on the radar move between two closets depending on whether we opened one or the other. If we'd go to one, the blob would move to the other one. Open that one, and back it went.  I would not advise using this at night when you're all alone. No matter what you think, even if you believe all this stuff is bunk, it can give you the shivers with some of the words that come out of the ether. Cool app.
B005FWO3QK|1.0|Dear Sirs.<br /> the best operas to be watched on DVD. Unbelievable. Amazing. Marvelous. five stars is not enough. However tonight  when I reached disc 8 (Sigfried 3rd act) the disc did not work, it is not readable using several equipment I have at home, which proved to be absolutely useful for the rest of the discs. I am trying to reach costumer service since three ours ago, but it is impossible to contact you. Could you send me an e.mail telling me what to do. Thanks a lot.

B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|Once again Khaled Hosseini has written a compelling novel about Afghanistan. The characters are complex and the stroyline keeps the pages turning. If you enjoyed The Kite Rumnner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, this story is a must read too.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The story line was OK but the acting was really quite bad. I was expecting some parts of the movie to be a visual treat but the photography and special effects really fell far short of what they could have been,  It was actually an uncomfortable movie to watch and I suspect some small children might find it frightening.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|hisvwas a great game. I wish it had more levels though. it kept ur brain thinking and I liked that. five stars automatically ;)
B00AYB1GAS|5.0|Superb visuals and sound! I really enjoyed this outstanding photo essay. I highly recommend it for viewers of all ages.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I was so excited to see the movie after reading the books, but was very unhappy watching the movie. Ethan was so corny in the movie, I almost didn't finish watching. The character I loved the most in the film was Macon. He was the closest to the book. It was just sad how so many important characters were left out. They could've done so much more with the movie... It's a shame.
0425263908|5.0|This book absolutely blew my mind, I finished it in less than three days and it took that long because life gets in the way! Day's vocabulary is expansive enough to make this book not feel repetitive, and oh the sex scenes are well described, I can't wait for Reflected In You to arrive at my doorstep! I definitely recommend, it's an awesome read.
B00CFSWMYM|4.0|I feel like Austra is heading in a new direction on this record, but does not manage to fully commit to the course. There are a couple really lovely tracks that turn out to only be snippets and it gives the album a somewhat unfinished feel. However, it's still a very worthy sophomore effort with some luminous moments, and doesn't deserve the panning it's received here thus far.<br /><br />There's something inherently mournful in Katie Selmanis' voice, and much of the lyrical content on this album is fashioned to match. The instrumentation and arrangements, however, lean more towards a sort of danceable, electro-baroque pop, diverging somewhat from the synthy, verging-on-darkwave tone set by her debut album. The vocal harmonies are really gorgeous, especially on \\"Fire,\\" which is an extraordinary track. The incorporation of the live instrumentation allows the use of the midi sounds to really stand out, and there's a midi choral theme used in this song that is especially affecting in contrast with Selmanis' deeply heartfelt vocal delivery.<br /><br />\\"Hurt Me Now\\" is also a stand out. There's a definite Kate Bush influence surfacing in Austra's music, and I am a hunnit percent behind that.<br /><br />The hard-hitting beats and instrumental dynamics throughout the rest of the album are surprising and fresh. I don't think they sound too similar at all, as one reviewer suggested. Certainly no more similar than the tracks within \\"Feel It Break.\\"<br /><br />This album is a grower and warrants repeated listens before a true appraisal can be made.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I started looking at the DevOps culture from my experience in trying to bring Continuous Delivery to my ILOG Jrules Builds to allow the business to change business rules as often as required. The first thing I found when looking at DevOps was the 2009 Velocity Conference of &#34;10 Deploys a Day&#34; and then talks by Gene Kim on the principles and practices of DevOps. Gene's theories really resonated with me as I could see how I could implement his patterns in the everyday work I perform within my development stream. From there I had to read the Phoenix Project and have shared it with my colleagues at work through a presentation of Gene's theories and study of high IT performers, so hopefully they will end up purchasing the book as well!!
B00COHIFQS|3.0|Worth the price of the download. This movie had a strong premise, and the beginning is very interesting. As with a lot of current horror, the over use of CGI makes it less effective.

B004X6PRO6|2.0|I give it 1 1/2 stars. It just went on and on. A very lengthy, questionably accurate depiction of a culture. The switch between first person and third person was confusing and just didn't make sense. I couldn't maintain interest across time. Wouldn't recommend.

B005MMZ63C|3.0|It has been years since I had seen it, and I remember why.  It is just a strange movie to me.  I understand the meaning and I like Orson Wells as an actor, but it was just too bland for my taste.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Don't want to spoil it for anyone but the last episode was a shock to my system. Wasn't expecting it. Can't wait for Season 4.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|I liked the attention to detail in the set, but it lacked sufficient character development to make me care about any of the characters.  Lots of female nudity, which I don't have a problem if there's equal amounts of male nudity.  However, that's not the case.  In fact, the effect of all the nudity is demeaning to women, especially given the amount of violent and gratuitous sexual acts that are performed with completely naked women and fully clothed men.  Ridiculous!  I had heard so much about how wonderful the costuming was, but as a costumer, I am not all that impressed.  Again, it appeared the main function of many of the costumes was to reveal as much of the female form as possible.  The amount of violence is overwhelming and they don't hold back on the buckets of blood when beheading people.  I really don't understand why this has become so popular and it makes me worry about the direction the world is going if that many people like this sort of thing.  Are we to become complete immune to senseless killings?  Reading this is one thing because the reader can edit their own mental images into more appropriate settings.  Seeing it in HD is too much.  I'm sorry I wasted my money on this.
B00CX1TPF0|4.0|The special effects are really cool on a large flat screen tv, but even if you don't have one, you'll still enjoy it. Better than what I was expecting.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|With zombie mania sweeping the world it was refreshing to watch a film that used the popularity of the un-dead to address deeper issues. Yes the movie was funny and heartfelt but more than that the movies over all theme was the acceptance of all races. Completely entertaining and well acted by the two main characters as well as the entire cast this movie addressed issues of racism and bigotry all the while keeping the audience hooked on the story of two young adults from entirely different walks of life coming together in a Romeo and Juliet style love story.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|At the time of this writing, Cloud Atlas has garnered provoked nearly 900 reviews here on Amazon - there's very little I can add that hasn't been said before. The reviews run the gamut from 1 star to 5 stars. As you've seen, I'm in the 5 star category - not a film \\"classic\\" but rather a film that deserves to be seen; and must be seen.<br /><br />I stayed away from Cloud Atlas for a long time, fearing Matrix 3 version 2.0. And while there are definitely some Matrix-y things in one particular story thread (some of the costumes, hairstyles, visuals, \\"Neo-Seoul\\" etc.) there was only one meaningful and important connection between The Matrix trilogy and this film: the visionary skill of Lana and Andy Wachowski who, along with Tom Twkyer, have created a visual feast for the eyes and a thought provoking movie for the soul.<br /><br />This is a hauntingly beautiful film - there are images that linger long in the mind, and return over and over again. Yes, at some point most people will cease to care about the much touted  inter-connections and relationships between characters and situations.  I think that is a good thing. At some point, just fully immerse yourself in the flow of this brilliantly edited film and follow it to its illuminating and emotional core. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />As many have said, the cast is superb - with far too many performances worth singling out.<br /><br />Just wanted to get one more 5-star review into the mix. I think this film should have gotten a lot more attention than it did upon its release.

0743270754|5.0|Goodwin is first class. I read her biography of Lyndon Johnson and was equally impressed.  But in Lincoln she has clearly outclassed even herself.  As one reads on the characters seem to become part of one's life and history is re-lived personally.  But what characters!  The world does no longer produce such leaders.  Maybe the cause was so great and the call so unique that nature of itself called forth such outstanding leaders. A great biography, a great writer.,<br /><br />Louis Cilia

B008K6HN8I|5.0|So nice to be able to access my WD MyBookLive Personal Cloud Storage external HDD via wifi on the KindleFireHD.  Love them both and this app does the job, no USB cord required!
B0095VPBFY|4.0|CPU arrived as described including heat sink with no damage once so ever. Easy installation and runs well on my computer. Integrated graphics is great and I'd suggest to for individuals doing light to moderate computer use, including watching videos, etc.
B00B769XB8|3.0|The movie is pretty much what I expected that's why I didn't pay to see this on the big screen.  What really upsets me is that I found out after the purchase that you only get either the UV copy or the digital not both as one would expect.
B00CCCF4NW|5.0|This is the first album I discovered by Jon Hopkins, and I was blown away, being aware only of his involvement in Coldplay's Viva la Vida and Brian Eno's Small Craft on a Milk Sea. These 8 tracks are immaculately crafted, and reflect the work of a producer and composer at the top of his game.<br /><br />From We Disappear, there is a heavy, quasi-abrasive immediacy to Jon's techno which is also accompanied by almost constant - but thoughtfully applied - metamorphosis and progression. Like Fennesz's noise-guitar symphonies, beautiful (and occasionally, slightly eerie) melodies can be glimpsed through the storm. Often he indulges his inclinations towards the sheer beauty of warm field recordings coupled with acoustic instruments - such as the sampled creaks of wood joined by placid piano, as in the beginning of the title track. There are lengthy, spacious and reverberating passages accented by field recordings which conjure more of a physical place, allowing the listener to become more immersed in the sound (see \\"Breathe This Air\\"), but this is not an album of meandering and repetitive ambient music.<br /><br />The merging of traditional and modern, organic and electronic has been discussed many times over with regard to recent techno and house albums (see Leland by Francis Harris and [[ASIN:B007RL6XSI Forest]] by Christian Loffler). Hopkins continues to blur the lines between modern classical, techno, and ambient, making an album that incorporates all three and more and yet manages to make merging these apparently contradictory moods and styles seem natural.
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|As a fan of the orginal As a fan of the original I tried to go into this with out judging it without constantly comparing it to the classic.<br />But the movie is kinda boring, and personally I like slow movies but man-oh-man the movie is dull. The acting is worse then the original, it's very wooden and robotic, and it's simply not scary. At times it takes itself way to seriously, witch it's really weird at times because some of what is going on is really stupid. The blood and gore is good but nothing and I do mean NOTHING is entertaining besides that.<br />This is a bland remake, it's not awful but it's not great either, I'd say about average for a horror remake
B0036JU6CY|4.0|I like it. The stunts are really good and not too unbelievable, and the storyline actually isn't half bad. It's just seems a little unnecessarily gory in some places, but hey, it is what it is.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Story was weak. Lots of special FX but they didn't support the story line very well. There were times in the movie that just lagged.
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|It's a great album! A must buy! You won't regret it! And why you're at it go buy a ticket to the anthem world tour.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been playing minecraft since it came out in 2010 when i heard about the pocket edition first.word in my head was awsome
B009FZFONO|5.0|Terribly addictive. I would have hated it to wait a whole week between episodes. Don't start the series at all unless you have free time or no need for sleep. ;)
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I was completely addicted to the new York version of this game... loved playing it! Then suddenly,it was this horrible japen version. That one was -5! Then just as suddenly its Miami,  & also not anything like the first game I down loaded! Not nearly as many boosts, jetpacks,  mystery boxes or fun!
B002J2PB10|1.0|It was stupid and it had very bad acting! Really!!  It was shallow and not worth the $2.99.  Watch Cable reruns instead
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is one of the best Sherlock movies. Benedict Cumberbatch is simply amazing as Sherlock... he is Sherlock. Martin Freeman as Dr Watson is co complementary... you can't think about one without other. Every movie from the series is very involving, the way how Holmes's thinking process was presented in movie (captions)  is one of the most brilliant thing ever done.<br /><br />In summary: great acting, great stories, I can watch this series many times and never get bored.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Runs great on my Polaroid PMID701c. Please add Benji Bananas to the Amazon App Store Fingersoft. How I know about Benji Bananas is I own an iPad Mini and I looked up Hill Climb Racing on the Google Play and it has Benji Bananas on the Google Play Store and the iTunes App Store
B00BC24NT4|5.0|What I liked most about the book was its frank look at the damage  that highly placed officials (loose cannons) can do when allied with contractors who lack integrity.  Also, the further damage that comes from covering up government mistakes.<br /><br />I look forward to what I hope will be a sequel.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a phenomenal book. I wish I could give it 20 stars but I can't. This book made me out my life in perspective. This book had changed my life forever.
B00A5FPQBI|5.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it and I can watch it over and over... I loved all the characters and especially the background music.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|i got it and not to crazy about it. its alittle hard to understand at first. i still dont grasp it.im not sure if i will keepthis app.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Interesting read, good theory, I was just hoping for more substance at the end.  I was hoping for some good practical action step ideas I could use, but overall it's an interesting read.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|it is a thing you have to use to and understand on what your doing. i got it so i could take notes. i think i might of got the wrong app tho.
B00578FKVE|5.0|This show was very well made.  I would say that the quality is almost movie quality, and the story lines are great.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Greg hefley Reuters in cabin fever books 6 of the diary of a wimpy kid.I recommend this story to all the diary of a wimpy kid book's because Greg started his long winter in trouble.Greg acsentley vandilised his school and he is in trouble.Then a storm happens and he is stuck in his house and they have very little food.Greg dose not want to show his face around the police station so he will not get in trouble.But he has to go to the police station to group of a toy.He paces the church he goes to to see if the money he asked for on the giving tree was their.so he racks the leave and he was found by the cops and they didn't arrested him. People thought he was a hero and on the news paper he made earlier in the book he said he did that.I really loved this book and I hope you do to.
0345803493|4.0|This was a gift for a cousin because I could not find my copy and she wanted to head the series.  The book was fine and in good condition.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I would recommend this game to anyone that likes uno.  It is just like the regular home game.  My kids and I love this game.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have had ringing in my ears for as long as I can remember and because of that I have had problems sleeping for just as long. I made my own combination of sounds (and was able to save it) that zeros out the ringing and allows me to fall asleep much faster than I have in YEARS.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Mystery manor is just okay.  I really wish the energy refilled faster.  I love hidden object games but I would like to be able to advance levels faster.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|However, ever since I downloaded Tunein with all its access to loads of different radio stations all over the world I use this a lot less. But it is cute how you can select different sounds and yes it might help someone to fall asleep.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game<br />Not only does it keep me busy but my grandsons stay busy now when they come over
B00BDAP66E|4.0|This is a good app to manage your pages from a mobile device. I have 2 pages and it helps to be able to manage the pages from my phone.
B00D41H2PS|3.0|I liked the format/layout of this game but some of the puzzles didn't work.  After re-downloading 3 times I just gave up.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app to have to be able to pin things from my kindle and my mobile phone. Very easy to use.
B003ELKNH2|5.0|Added scenes were amazing and added a lot to the story. I can see why they were cut for the theater due to the length, but I am glad that they were restored for the DVD.
0061124958|5.0|This is such a wonderful story of unconditional love, believing in oneself and ones friends, and deep friendship. Every child should have this classic tale in their library!
B003DWU98U|3.0|This movie required some deep thought as to what is &#34;really&#34; going on.  The entire movie takes place in less than a 24 hour period in the characters lives. Even after the movie ended I found myself with questions that required a trip to the internet to get some clarity on.  It's worth watching if you are patient and like to think deep thoughts.
B005HSL626|5.0|The subject says it all. Both my son and daughter use it on a regular basis. I have to admit, I've burned some time on it too.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|It's sad this is called music.  Using explicit language to this degree is not entertaining.<br />Listening to this makes me ill with no positive direction.  I guess the ones who love this must relish feeling angry, depressed, and negative.  This guy has major issues!
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Leading role acting was weak which made it cheesy. Could have been a much better film if the acting was better.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|La Carre is such a good writer.  I could not put the book down; but I shouldn't be surprised.  I felt this way about all of his books.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Not bad got what i expected it follows the classical girl with magic powers not knowing what she wants and no big surprises.
B002UXLY2S|5.0|This is the 2nd purchase of this album (the 1st died in a car crash).  Since I listened to it all the time, I decided to get the MP3 version.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Good action packed movie leaves it self open for a sequel or maybe straight to DVD and I would actually watch it again.
1400067820|5.0|Very special, very good, profound, excellent. Best of the best. One of a kind. A must read, pure knowledge. How wonderful to have all this knowledge at my fingertips. How lucky I am to have read this book. Super smart.
1881273873|5.0|This book offers a lot of examples for people in their dating relationships, friendships, and family.  I wish I had read this a year ago before I started dating my girlfriend. I think it would have helped us avoid a lot of issues.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Makes you use your gray matter.  Not impossible to do, so it keeps you interested. Looking forward to going further up this crazy building. Like the different rooms, but makes me feel like a Peeping-Tom.LOL!
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Interesting and well developed plot...The title of the movie can be misleading, but the surprise that you get at the end of it all is worthwhile.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was amazing I'm in love with this book! I have it a good rating because it is go good!
B0058FW06Y|4.0|This movie has gotten a lot of bad press in regards to the veiled objectification of the female characters.  However, as much as I want to call it distasteful and chauvinistic, I have to temper that opinion against a story that has a great deal of emotional and psychological depth.  I give kudos to the writing and editing staff for making a movie that could have easily shown brutal rape and torture scenes in depth but chose instead to imply the abuse without the need to show it in all its gory detail.  For that alone I appreciated the movie.  But I most enjoyed the parallels between reality and the inner battles we all fight to survive when immersed in horrific circumstances.  I can say I liked the movie enough that I might want to watch it again, if only for the insane fight scenes which feature some pretty amazing special effects.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Ok contestants, you are going to re-do Northern Exposure in a SyFy genre, and eureka!  EUReKA is born.  It is unique with just enough quirkiness, and has a wonderful blend of humor to balance out the drama of whatever catastrophe is happening today.  I'm half-way through season 2 and am starting to wonder how long the writers can keep coming up with a new, solve-able catastrophe for each show.  But who really cares as long as they do?  The characters are engaging and the acting is good to great.  All really good SyFy shows have an underlying commentary on the human condition of some type and EUReKA does come up a little short in that department in a few episodes.  The commentary is not absent, just a little weak sometimes.  But that's my only real criticism at this point.  Still watching and still loving it.  EUREKA!  I found a new show to watch compulsively!
B001O53BK6|5.0|This is a great film without unnecessary sexual and drug scenes. Great for the whole family or the want to be musician, very inspiring!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Good book overall. So many characters and story lines  I had to start a list to keep track of them all though.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|There is a problem though. After several months, When I tried to open the program on my Kindle Fire, it would not open--it had a black screen and then went back to home page with the icon.  I had to uninstall and reinstall so I lost all my points, friends, etc.  What a pain.  But the game is really fun.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|If you like Star Trek you'll live this series.  It's a British series,  and has humor  and an  intriguing story line.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|This is one of Miyasaki's masterpiece.  My kids and enjoy all his movies.  The vibrant colors and characters that he introduces to his stories are just loveable and awe inspiring.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Sometimes there is a classic book or movie that for some reason you put off reading it or viewing it.  This was one of those books.  I thought it was a great book and could not, at first, figure out where he got the title.  When it was explained in the book, it was an awha moment. In the middle of reading it on my Kindle, the Kindle was stolen.  It took several weeks to order a new Kindle and finish it.  The cool thing was that when I purchased the new Kindle, it opened up to the page where I had stopped reading on my old Kindle, which was very helpful.
B00A1XOPE8|2.0|Fantasy needs complexity to stay in the mind.  Character development was non existent ...which is sad because the concept has depth.
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read every book by Mark Higgins Clark and look forward to the next one. She is my favourite author.
B007N85POS|5.0|We all love angry Birds. This edition is awesome and has SOOO many levels, Unlike most games that are &#34;free&#34; but require money to REALLY accomplish anything, you can beat this game without money
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This show has been consistently good writing and each show centers around a different perp.  I was not happy with the replacement of two of the main characters but it works well even with major changes.  Try it, you'll like it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|A TV endeavor that offers sophisticated plots, human interaction, plus realistic and superior acting.  This is a series that any thinking viewer would appreciate.
B000GCFD72|5.0|I love reading new ideas about parenting and parenting with unconditional love makes sense. Would buy from this author again.
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|The movie was ok at best.  More of a visual spectacle. I fell asleep more than once.  life of poop more like it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is the best hidden picture game. it keeps me guessing. I will definitely recommend this to my friends. hands down great game.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I liked it so much I made my husband watch an episode to see if he liked it. Now we are both hooked!! Watched two seasons in only a few weeks!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|tehilla's ratings<br />this is a wonderful app whoever does not have it you should get it<br />my friend has it and I want it badly<br />(I played hers)
0142405809|5.0|Donaldson's charm soars with this one. She has a terrific way of creating emotions and personalities of creatures while staying faithful to who they are - without anthropomorphizing.  This story talks about big dreams, fears and a resilience that can be explored and highlighted with the bravery and ingenuity of even the tiniest creature. The accompanying illustrations are lovely.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|One of the most captivating series of books I've ever read. I can't wait for Winter now, so many questions so much to resolve. If you haven't read this series you surely need to. If you like a good suspense store with a really thick plot this is your series. So much unexpected happens it is hard to imagine the ending.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|A little advanced for my 4 year old but she claimed I was the best mom ever for downloading it for her.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An excellent look at how DEVGRU operates, in the field and training.  If this field of literature appeals to you, buy this book.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Always full of surprises, interesting characters, plot twists, interpersonal relationship dynamics, and lots of interesting sci-fi gadgets to keep you wanting more!!!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Two minor complaints:  the book is too short. I should have mitt been able to blow through it in three hours. And, although it's advertised as his first adult novel since Anansi Boys, it could just as easily be classified as YA.<br />There is nothing wrong with YA. Plenty of great books in that category.  It just wasn't what I was expecting.<br /><br />Otherwise, The Ocean at the End of the Lane was a very entertaining read.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|Its ok I guess I haven't played it much so I don't know how to play it very good and I don't get far with it befor my shark dies.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Just a repeat of the previous stories nothing new or great in the book so it really is just a change of scenery
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Its ok I just can't seam to hit much of the stuff to get to far I hope to get better at it as I go along with it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Epic is a great game. My kids love to play it and so do I. Also it's free can't complain about that.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this I play it all the time its as good as Cubistry it gets you hooked so you can't put it down I find myself playing these two games all the time so get these two and you can't go wrong.
B004T9T2AC|5.0|I started reading this book. It's very interesting. When I finish reading he book, I'll read it again, marking the most important things and making notes. I guess this is the best book I bought since I started with Network Marketing (LYONESS).
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this its one of the best games that I have got so far you can realy pass a lot of time playing this game and its relaxing.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Love this POV. Refreshing light, sexy, and funny. Giggled like a school girl, and panted like a woman enthralled! The only thing is I was slightly....VERY SLIGHTLY disappointed with the ending. I fell like all this build up then.....oh......maybe just me.<br />I will definitely read more of Emma Chase's work! : )
B006CDCWDM|5.0|Perfect--everything: Service, delivery, and the book itself. Glad it was affordable.<br /><br />Make this process easy by not imposing limits such as word limit.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|If you like the lovable, sympathetic serial killer, this season doesn't disappoint. Another well-written, expertly directed and acted series of episodes that make us fans of a killer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|horse is the experiance of owning a real life animal!! it comes with awesome challenges to help you earn money to buy new horses or tack !!!! this is really an awesome game
B000XUBF3I|5.0|Marla is that calm voice that puts you back on track when you feel overwhelmed. Baby steps keep you on track.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Really well done.  Enjoyed every minute.  Acting, photography, story line, story telling, all top notch.<br /><br />Highly recommend.  Don't let the length scare you.
0440237688|3.0|We read this book in our summer school class this year. As a collective group we decided that the book was very extreme and stressful towards the end. During the reading of the book the community was too controlling and the lack of a true family (grandparents) was a turn-off. One student stated, \\"Through out the 180 pages, there was no true meaning of who 'The Giver' was until the middle of the book. Then at the end, The Giver faded away with out significance.\\" Another student stated, \\"It was unclear whether Jonas was alive or dead at the end.\\" For us, this fact ruined the book.<br /><br />What we did like was that the community members were able to share their feelings. The children were treated as adults at twelve. The way that the author describes the memories was descriptive. The most descriptive memory was \\"when Jonas first experienced color.\\" The relationships between Jonas and the Giver and Jonas and Gabe are very similar. We enjoyed the fact that both Jonas and Gabriel could rely on someone else.
B006INDGFE|3.0|EXACTLY the same as the 1st one! But still funny in some parts.  Don't expect to be shocked by anything though.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I loved this book! It includes so many elements of my favorite books -- a grand mystery, ghosts, secrets, twisted relationships, unexpected revelations, and an enduring fascination with the written word. Diane Setterfield successfully transported me to the moors and filled the world with fascinating, surprising characters. I would lay the book down to go on with life, but Margaret and Vida stayed with me. I am looking forward to the next book by this marvelous author.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Took a little while for me to get used to. I am on a kindle fire. It starts you out with a tilt feature and I found myself dying a lot but when I switched it to touch movement anchor fire it got a lot better. One thing I didn't like was it offered a dismantle option at which I thought it would give me some stuff that I put into it back. so that I may build up another armor. To my surprise, it didn't. get squat ..!!!! Other than that,  it is a lot of fun.....
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I desperately wanted to know who would win out in this trilogy and with this final book I found out.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Gripping, excellent show. I enjoy the fact that it feels like it is from the early 2000's. Watched in three sittings.
B001HVZO9S|5.0|Just what I wanted when I ordered it. There is nothing more to say about it. Its a movie, thank you
B003K16P50|3.0|This is the one time that I liked the movie better.  Perhaps I would have liked it better had I read it first<br />S<br />P<br />O<br />I<br />L<br />E<br />R<br />The book had a very different ending a much sadder ending and perhaps that clouded my judgement. I just felt the hero had grown a little learned a little but in essence nothing had changed for him or it got worse.
B004GYY714|2.0|I ordered this app in order to tune in to radio stations and programs in different areas. Since I downloading the app to my Kindle, I have been unable to access any stations.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I really liked it but thought he tried to cram too much in one book.Should have completed the saga with this book.
031620157X|5.0|These are the words of my well read, funny, and brilliant 12-year-old daughter.  She thought it was well written, with great characters and a bit of mystery, &#34;it was really good, I loved it&#34;.  I will read it when i get a chance.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best of the Awesome and additives game ever since the angry birds came out but the key last level is in the air vent.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|After reading The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, the moment I saw this was coming out I pre-ordered it.  It is my favorite of the 3 now!  Truly one you won't want to put down!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I liked the tribute to the earlier films. Overall the action was great, though for some reason it didn't feel like too long of a movie. If you love Bond then you'll like this.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this short series.  Talk about having a difficult life!  The situation was further compounded by unfounded stigmas from placed upon her by her father, her village and society as a whole.  This is a movie about love, endurance and selflessness, but it is also tragic.  I must have cried for a good 5 minutes when the movie ended.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very entertaing. I didn't read the books so I was on the edge of my seat seat ever episode waiting to see what happens next. Can't wait to watch the next season!
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie funny at the beginning sappy at the end as per the usual hollywood format. 1 more
B005PK57IK|5.0|Best soap opera ever. Excellent writing, amazing casting, the actors are all very good, and the question foremost in my mind? What will Christine Baranaski be wearing in the next episode? That woman can dress! Alicia? not so much, but then she's not at the top of the food chain either. I like the women in the series, how they interact in the workplace. Personally, I've never seen women interact like men, but I'm all for it.  If Julianna Marguiles is the new Mary Tyler Moore, we have much to be thankful for. How does she do it?<br /><br />I cut the cable, got rid of my TV about 14 years ago because I was so frustrated with the lack of quality entertainment: seemed to me the better the picture got, the worse the content was. While watching The Good Wife has made me run out to buy a flat screen TV, I'm impressed. Half a dozen shows like this one and maybe I will. Although, I have to say, it's great fun watching them back-to-back on Amazon.
B005HSL626|2.0|I got this for my 5 yr old and the adds were awful. Even for me the adds were a bit excessive
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn died yesterday (6-19-13)<br /><br />I will miss reading his books.<br /><br />He never wrote a bad book!<br /><br />Goodbye, Vince.<br /><br />Goodbye, Mitch Rapp
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|We love Hook and my 5 year old thought it was awesome!  Family Vegan pizza night and a movie was complete!
B0038P59A0|5.0|Good, funny, and brainy movie! Great action too! Can watch it over and over again. Music is good too. If you can, watch it on big screen tv.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It is bold, complete and tells me everything I need to know if a juffy. What took you so long
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 of Downton Abbey was so incredible! I loved their progression through WWI and the evolution of all of the relationships and friendships on the show. These characters are so wonderfully written and so perfectly portrayed!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it!!!!! I love these kinds of games but you have to have a good memory. I'm just awaiting more levels
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What will happen to the girl on fire?  The President Obsessed, and the two young men she's involved in?<br /><br />Great read and has so many twists and turns.
B003G4W49C|4.0|My husband loves these books. I hardly ever see him read anything,but he read this book so fast I had to wonder so I started reading it. It's a good book. It has a way of drawing you in and it's a good read.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A really good action movie with a sci-fi plot. Great for an evening at home entertainment. Story is plausible given our current regime and could happen sooner that you expect!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  I have it on my android and was very excited to see it on the kindle aps as well.  Some of the levels are extremely hard and there are a few I have not been able to finish.  If you love Crossword puzzels, sudoku, word searches, or word games give this one a try.  you will be pleasantly surprised at how you loose all track of time with this one.<br />Kim
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was a good story. I will never look at poetry the same way. There are some universal messages in it that  make it more than just another e book.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|As a software developer and business person I was deeply interested in finding pearls of wisdom that would contribute to my own success as an entrepreneur. Steve Jobs was a genius at enrolling good people to work his ideas and vision into reality. His choice of Walter Isaacson to write his biography is a good example of this. After reading this book one is left with an acute desire to create excellence wherever your focus is applied in the physical world. You might go crazy and burn out trying to deal with all the people and circumstances screaming &#34;no possibility&#34;, but with a good idea and unstoppable intention, one can put the ball where it isn't, make something happen, squeeze out a contribution, and do so against all odds. If this is what your up to, Steve Jobs has shown us the way, and Isaacson has put it into words.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Watched it with my nephew when he was 4 and now watched it with his daughter at age 5 (24 years later) and it is good fun for a family to watch together. The story is timeless and both scary (at times) and funny (most of the time), so most kids probably will love it.
030758836X|3.0|An ingenious thriller, a great crime novel, fiendishly clever, a psychological whodunit, a mirror to how we live. That's all hype, though in this case I don't doubt the sincerity of the hype even if I don't understand or agree with it.<br /><br />The reaction to this book is somewhat polarized. I could indulge in a bit of hype myself and say that people love it or hate it. And then there are readers like me who don't hate it but are simply bored. The writing is good but I don't find the story or the characters compelling. As thrillers go this one has more than its share of twists, turns and dark revelations, but the roller coaster ride, as it were, feels too clever by half and contrived. There are plot holes and implausibilities. I don't care about either of the main characters, Nick or Amy, not merely because they aren't likable. I don't need to \\"like\\" characters in order to enjoy a story, but I do need to be interested in them or intrigued by them. The entire interest of this story is to see what happens next, and ultimately to see what happens at the end. That's not enough for me. As I said, the writing is good, but the good writing in this story struck me the same as watching good actors in a bad movie. Or, as my blunt and earthy grandmother used to say, it's like putting poop on vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />This story certainly has some psychological aspects, but only for the sake of thrills; there is no \\"insight.\\" It is most definitely not \\"a mirror to how we live\\"; the characters are far too aberrational. Some of the characters, such as the police and the lawyer, are cartoonish, but maybe that was intended as humor. Those who say that this story is \\"ingenious\\" are referring, I think, to the clever planning of one of the characters. But I found nothing particularly brilliant or - more importantly - amusing about it. We are all familiar with the \\"perfect murder\\" genre. It's probably safe to say that thousands of stories have been written on that plot, in which a very clever protagonist(s) plans and executes the perfect murder. Sometimes the protagonists get away with it and sometimes they don't. One of my favorite perfect murder stories is the play by Ira Levin, \\"Deathtrap.\\" (Made into an excellent movie, by the way)<br /><br />What I will say in this paragraph contains spoilers, so don't read it if you haven't already read this book. I think that a primary reason I did not enjoy this book (besides all the reasons mentioned previously) is because one of the main characters is a sociopath, while the other main character seems to be somewhat of a dolt. What can I say? I'm just not into sociopaths. An author can make a sociopath say or do anything without the burden of making sense. I understand why many people find sociopaths thrilling and chilling, but it's not my thing, either in books or movies. This is why I am bored with wildly popular movies such as Silence of the Lambs. \\"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.\\" Ho-hum; yawn. The sociopath in this story doesn't eat anyone's liver, but still, when there is a sociopath in a story all bets are off. At the conclusion of the story there is no satisfaction at figuring out or understanding a sociopath, even if a reader tries to think like a sociopath. A reader can feel afraid of a sociopath, but that kind of fear feels derivative, like feeling afraid of the bogeyman under the bed. An author can make them as evil and clever as she wants, but that doesn't make them interesting as far as I'm concerned. Time magazine said, \\"It will make you have a good hard think about who the person on the other side of the bed really is.\\" The Columbus Dispatch said, \\"It's a study of marriage at its most destructive.\\" This is just more hype. Gone Girl is not anything like a study of marriage. It's not even a study of sociopaths. One of the main characters just happens to be a sociopath, because only a sociopath could do the things this character does. I suppose the most compelling part of this story is to see who wins the final battle: The dolt or the clever sociopath? I don't care. I'm giving the book three stars because, even though I don't like it I can recognize that it is a decent thriller for readers who are thrilled by clever sociopaths.<br /><br />At this point I will confess that I've read about two-thirds of this book and I'm giving up. Part of me wants to finish so I can see how it all winds down. But my better judgment is telling me there are more interesting books to read. I like to read a couple of thrillers each summer. Gone Girl was supposed to be the antidote for another disappointing bestseller, Defending Jacob (which I managed to finish, to my regret). I'm still looking for a thriller that will keep me on the edge of my seat, and as far as I'm concerned, Gone Girl is gone, and good riddance.ling part of this story is to see who wins the final battle: The dolt or the clever sociopath?

B00D1DBO1C|5.0|I have tried several calendar apps because the standard app that came with my Samsung S2 was too buggy and would forget reminders. It was also not able to do repeat reminders in case you missed the first one. The Business Calendar ( paid version ) does everything you need to do and replaces the standard calendar unlike the other apps that only integrate with the stock one. Try this free version first.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I was looking for a new author to read who wouldn't attempt to be over the top, in the gutter, or pre-teen and yet still had good, intelligent words to keep me involved in the story.  It may not be the perfect story for some (I have yet to find a \\"perfect\\" story in any genre), but I found it to be a very good read.  Some parts made me sad, some laugh, and others made me think.  These are good things to look for in a good story teller.  I'm not certain I'll be reading the \\"Slab\\" books, but I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel or series for \\"Blood Song\\" - as long as Mr. Ryan continues to let the stories flow and follow his talents and abilities instead of a hasty path to the pressures of fame as so many other good authors have fallen on in the past.
B00DBSZT7C|4.0|The overall movie is pretty good, definitely worth watching.  I really enjoyed the theme of the movie but I think they could have done a better job with the fight scenes.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and must say I was very surprised about the rape scenes. Very realistic. Movie is worth the watch.
068981528X|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed it.  Humorous :)<br />Even our son who doesn't really enjoy reading much, loved this one.  We even bought one to mail to my brother in law in Africa :)
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I am a big Tom Cruise Fan. He does a great acting job as usual but the movie is predictable. Nothing special about the writing. Not as good as Collateral....<br />Worth the watch if you rent it cheap from Red Box. Just not a movie that makes me go &#34;O Wow, what a great movie.&#34;
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Just a vintage side-scrolling platformer taking me back to the days of Mario. Crisp graphics and above-average background music aide the solid gameplay. I had to go into setting and enable classic fixed movement pad because the default was too difficult to get used to. However, I can see why they went that route.
B00000IQV6|5.0|What can I say Robin Williams is a true master actor. He is great in this movie. The writing is great and it's based on a true story!!! Loved it for sure.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|You either like the movies or you don't.  My review won't change that.  I did purchase this in conjunction with the prequel trilogy, and like I wrote on that review, it was a very cost-effective purchase for a classic film series.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|This series is excellent. Each episode is very creative and keeps you interested. Good to see competent writers. I bought everuy series.
B002MFULQO|5.0|Though I wasn't alive in '63 to experience this tragedy.  However, I am somewhat of a history buff, and this case has always fascinated me, and Oliver Stone's interpretation of events (if accurate) makes for a compelling movie.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Very pleased to be able to view these 'old friends' once again (especially without commercial interruptions) and feeling that they are fresh in their own way even today.  Technological advances have come a long way and budgets have grown to accommodate these advances.  The original Star Trek series began the process . . . which has grown seemingly with no 'tribble' at all over the decades!
B00C4QMHK4|3.0|Even without any members of the brat pack in this movie, I still consider it a classic 80's flick.  &#34;Meet me halfway&#34; is the theme song of the film (I think from Kenny Loggins, he of &#34;Footloose&#34; fame).  There is also the portrayal of WWF's &#34;Big Show&#34; as the villain of the film. Not a great movie, just a classic 80's.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Just love. A great product of our cultural industry. Entertaining, well crafted, quirky characters, everyone exactly where they need to be,
B000PMG16U|5.0|I don't think there's really a reason to rate the movies (you either like them or you don't), but as far as the purchase goes, I feel it was a great deal.
B000FCK65W|5.0|If I was stranded on an island with a little library this would be in the collection. You can grow anywhere you are planted.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|If you love the franchise, then you'll want to add this to your collection. The studio made a rush to end the series and therefore the finale wasn't as satisfying as it could have been. Buy it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a series! I've never seen like this before. I absolutely loved it and am anxiously waiting for Season 4.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|If you have to be talked into buying this, then you're not really into quality science fiction. Enough said. Buy it!
B005F2BBLK|5.0|This is a great and fun movie to watch! I love this movie and I haven't been able to stop watching it!
B0058SNI94|5.0|I was one of those people who hated crocs and &#34;assumed&#34; they would not be comfortable.  I absolutely love these shoes.  I received them the day before I left on an international trip.  I wore them for the first time running through airports and could not believe how comfortable they were and absolutely adorable to boot!  Also wore them hiking through castle ruins, up and down steep hills and up old uneven steps - my feet felt great all day!  I can wear an 8 but sometimes need an 8 1/2, I got the 8's and they fit just fine.  I am going to order them in another color I like them so much.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Stuck on level 7 need hints! This is an awesome game, frustrating at times, but I find it to be very relaxing .
B00COQKE2M|2.0|I have a difficult respecting Ronnie Radke even though I have a ton of respect for his talented band mates. His two records with FIR were both incredibly mediocre which means that there were a few good songs that one could listen to but the rest were just fillers or throwaway songs. The few songs on this record that I recommend are: Born to Lead, It's Over When It's Over, Keep Holding On, and Game Over. I respect the idea of trying different genres of music and diversifying a scene that is too similar but this record is all over the place, a complete mess, no order, just chaos. I'm not a huge fan of rap music nor dance music so my opinion might be bias meaning that I could just not like the influence of those genres on this new record because I don't have the ability to judge a music style that I don't like nor have experience listening to. Some of the guitar solos on this record are quite good, some of the breakdowns are epic, and some of rhythms and drum beats are both catchy and technically impressive. However, Ronnie's vocals are poor, his screams lack depth, and his rapping is very cheesy. The lyrics aren't that great on this record, the messages aren't all that inspiring, and the overall tone is messy and uninspired. If FIR makes another record, I will most likely listen to it but I'm not going in with high expectations which is what I went into with this record. Some people may love it, I really don't care, it's a matter of opinion and mine has been stated. I do however recommend the new Escape the Fate record which seems to capture some of the essence of their first record with Ronnie, so some people might like that better.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|\\"Adults follow the path; children explore\\" was the line that grabbed me in Neil Gaiman's new masterpiece 'The Ocean at the End of the Lane'.  What I found amazing about this book was that, unlike most of Neil's books, I had read a lot of hype and internet blogging in anticipation of his first \\"adult\\" novel in 10 years, and had a pretty solid pre-concieved notion of what I thought this strange-titled book would be about, but I was wrong.  It was nothing like what I thought it would be about, its better.  I was thinking 'Neverwhere' meets 'Graveyard Book', but its more like 'American Gods' meets 'H.P. Lovecraft' (for some of you that analogy will make no sense).  There is a stronger feel of good vs. evil in this book than any of his other books, and even his usage of good and evil, largely being someone simplistic and apathetic about the world and humans, gives them that very alien feel, much like H.P. Lovecraft did with his Elders and Old Ones.  I honestly don't know if Neil had any Lovecraftian influence on this, perhaps it is just me, because I am such a huge fan of anything Gaiman and Lovecraft, that I am forcing the two together to please myself.  All I know, is that this is probably one of his best novels, certainly the best since Neverwhere (too hard to compare the too, so I won't even try).  Neil said that when he started this book, it was intended as a short story for children, and ended up a novel for adults, and you can certainly see that in the plot and characters. The only small gripe I have about this book (which is the same gripe I have about most Gaiman books) is the length.  Its not a very long book, in fact, I read it in about 8 hours.  But, I will counter that with its SOOOOOO GOOD, I read it in 8 HOURS, and only put it down because I had to eat!  Its really that good.  So, the BIG question:  Who will like this book?  You will, any adult that has ever been a kid and thought life was unfair, which, by my count, is just about everyone.  Unless you have HATED everything Gaiman ever wrote, or you just don't like good books, then you should buy/borrow/rent/steal this book and read it.  Ok, review over, now its your turn...e HATED everything Gaiman ever wrote, or you just don't like good books, then you should buy/borrow/rent/steal this book and read it.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Such a great read! Loving the crossfire series. It was hard to wait for this novel, but it was worth the wait. Can't wait to continue the journey of Gideon and Eva.
B00C7LB20C|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie. Aaron Eckhart played a  very good role. Good movie with lots of action.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I would recommend the book to book clubs.  I believe it will provide great convesation and discussion.  The many personalities the main character was subjected to during her life were so lacking in empathy and understanding or truly caring for the child that it is a wonder she survived.  Of course, the flowers were so interesting and the meanings.  A truly good read.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is an entrancing series.  You can't help but be drawn into the story.  I can't wait for season 8!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was quite entertaining but it was to short. Would like to see more levels. Definitely challenges the mind.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Stressful and not funny. We turned it off after about 45 minutes. I don't want to watch that for fun.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|This blu ray edition comes with a dvd copy . The special features are awesome with indepth coverage of the history of westoros and the rise of each major house.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|fun entertaining an engaging. I think it is good for anyone who likes tycoon type games. also has some interesting artwork
B005544TRQ|5.0|Witty!  I very entertaining show that is fun to watch.  The shows characters develop very fast in season one that allow you to relate to all episodes.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I'd have to place this work as one of  my all time favourites. It's a quick read because I had such a hard time putting it down.
B009K86D86|5.0|Very informative, filled with information that everyone should hear at least once to make properly informed decisions.  Excellent show to watch
B00BETX5PS|1.0|I have watched ALL of the James Bond films from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan; and now Daniel Craig. I understand this was supposed to be a &#34;pre-quel&#34; but it was AWFUL for all the reasons all the previous ONE STAR reviewers have given. I'm not going to bother to list everything wrong with this movie, read a handful of the most recent ONE STAR reviews and you'll see why it's AWFUL. If you HAVE to see it, rent it for cheap!<br /><br />Those who are giving it 5 stars must not have ever seen any of the older James Bond movies; you know where they actually have Bond girls, plots, and storylines along WITH the action. I wonder what Mr. Albert Broccoli would think of this movie...
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Very sweet love story with a unique twist. The VoiceOver/internal monologue was hilarious. Actors had great chemistry; and who doesn't love a happy ending?
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Most of us know the story. We already know who wins, who loses. With that said, this version strays pretty far from the all-familiar fairytale. I cannot really go into too much detail, otherwise I'd have to put spoiler alerts all throughout this review.<br />The acting was pretty good, everyone did a fine job, the characters were believable in their individual roles. Ewan McGregor (swoon) was, as usual excellent.<br />The music was great and fit the mood and scenes.<br />The special effects were very good, maybe not awe-inspiring-blow-you-away kind, but they were still very good.<br />For parents:<br />I understand why this film is rated PG-13....while there is no 'bloody' scenes (people get stabbed but you see no blood), there is a heck of a lot of very gruesome and violent scenes....yes, I know it's about giants vs humans so it is to be expected - but some of the scenes went a bit too far in the gore factor (just my personal feelings on it). Pretty big body count.<br />There are some use of foul language as well, what many call 'mild bad words', but they are few. There is one scene where a giant makes a sound/says a word (like in another language) that sounds like the 'F' bomb, not saying that is what he said, but the word so closely resembled it that it took me by surprise.<br />I would not recommend this film for anyone under the age of 13/14 (even then it's still questionable), so the rating is fitting.<br />It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really great either.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game. I just got it and haven't stopped playing for 3 hours. I may need an intervention for this game in the near future
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|was pretty good.  I liked the trip back tp Oz. it's a better take on a voyage to OZ then the movie many years ago return to Oz
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Loved this movie because I could God's divine hand.  No way could these people have survived without His miraculous power.
B00BJ7G1VK|5.0|I am enjoying this book. The recipes seem very easy to do and the stories are in line with the recipes.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A healthy length, but full of adventure and a lot of wisdom!  I would recommend this book for men or women.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|You can only play it a few minutes and then it wants you to purchase the ability to play it longer. I dumped it.
B00C4SUEJI|5.0|The greatest thing about finding an artist you trust is expecting the next record. The arc from 'The Creek Drank The Cradle' to 'Ghost on Ghost' is a long one and an organic one. &#34;Woman King&#34; was a turning point for Iron and Wine and that 5-6 song set showed a shift from acoustic based tunes to opening up to larger themes.
0553582038|4.0|Fool that I am, when I finished A STORM OF SWORDS I thought the worst was over. After such an apotheosis of misery, GRRM had to pause for a breath, cut us some slack, mix some good times with the bad. I hoped he'd start dragging us out of the cesspit of misery he'd made of Westeros, that we'd reach the end of the dark tunnel and see dawn ahead.<br /><br />Apparently, I am an idiot.<br /><br />As Tywin Lannister would say, GRRM has taught me a sharp lesson. I'm too deeply invested in this series to stop reading, but I expect nothing but pain and grief from future installments. If you ask me, A FEAST FOR CROWS was darker and more painful than A STORM OF SWORDS.<br /><br />It starts slow; it felt like reading A GAME OF THRONES all over again, with GRRM building up his stories from scratch, getting his characters moving and sending them out in the world with new challenges. The beginning of a new act, a new arc. The pace picks up around the halfway point, and then? Well, a friendly warning: brace yourself.<br /><br />Quick FAQ: A FEAST FOR CROWS takes place directly after A STORM OF SWORDS ends, but only follows the action in Westeros, around King's Landing. The main POV characters we read from are Cersei, Brienne, Jaime, Arya, and Sansa. We also have a new plotline based around the Iron Islands, and one set in Dorne. The other main POV characters (Jon, Dany, and Tyrion, for example) appear in ASoIF #5, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, which takes place during the same time frame as A FEAST FOR CROWS.<br /><br />On one level, I probably should have expected a dreary sort of book. The War of the Five Kings has lulled to a halt, and winter sets in by the end of the book. Westeros is a cold, ruined landscape. It's burned, pillaged, and frigid. Our characters wander through storms, through forests of hanged men, through burned villages. They are on impossible quests, fighting losing battles, and some of them know it. There are more deaths.<br /><br />I don't know why so many reviewers seem convinced that nothing happens in this book. If you ask me, a ton of stuff happens. There's a rushed feeling to some storylines (every time we meet up with Arya, for example, she's in a new place with a new identity, and I would have loved to spend more time with her, watching her evolve), but there are some major changes to the game board in this book, and to characters that i cared about.<br /><br />On another level, I think GRRM makes some actual, quantifiable, not just me whining about my poor feelings mistakes in this book. He introduces two new major plot-nodes, the Iron Islands & Dorne. That's cool; I love this world and I'm glad to explore more and more of it. But he hops from POV to POV within these plotlines. The Iron Islands story gets three different POV characters; the Dorne story gets four. It's hard to attach to these new places and people when GRRM keeps hopping from head to head.<br /><br />The other thing that really bothered me is Cersei. I didn't expect to like Cersei. But she'd always been 9 parts horrible and 1 part truly magnificent. I found her to be shortsighted and vicious and a lot of other bad things, but I didn't think she was foolish. The Cersei we meet in A FEAST FOR CROWS has no redeeming qualities. Not one. She's not funny, she's not smart, she's not good. GRRM dives into her POV but she emerges shallower and less nuanced than she'd started out, and that's a shame.<br /><br />A FEAST FOR CROWS really bummed me out. It's such a sad, dreary book, with such low lows and so few highs. I sort of wish I could stop reading, but instead I'm going to start A DANCE WITH DRAGONS.seem convinced that nothing happens in this book. If you ask me, a ton of stuff happens.

B007WFR0QS|3.0|Lovely voice, some great tracks but others drag. Would be happy to try her next cd.<br />A good, strong voice.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Just like the original game, but kind of hard to use the controller though on the screen.  Use on kindle.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I like that he has a different plot than all the other romance books out there today. I like all the twist and turns but very emotional.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I'm a hobbyist, so I just needed something that would let me do bounce flash but didn't cost a lot. The SB-400 is perfect for that.<br /><br />The actual lens moves up and down--the flash head doesn't move at all. It's a compact light that slides into the hot shoe, locks in place, and is quick to fire. When on, you can only put your shutter speed up to 1/200.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was fun but kind of difficult! takes lots of memory and i had to look up some help to figure a few out! there is one problem which is that there are only 10 levels available currently!

0062014536|3.0|Just finished this... And I dont even know how to rate or review it.<br />I, unlike others, did not think Requiem was slow. I enjoyed reading it all. And I enjoyed reading Hanas POV, also. but... thats about it.<br /><br />I did not like the \\"ending\\" which really did NOT end a trilogy.<br /><br />I did not like the triangle... and lack of romance.<br /><br />i did not like the lack of action until the last 1/4 of the book.<br /><br />But mostly, I just didnt like the ending... I wanted some conclusion and closure. and I didnt get that!<br /><br />So, this is my tiny little review... bec I dont know what else to say other than im disappointed.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|LOVE this show...what a great escape from reality. The only problem is now we have caught up and have to actually wait a week in between episodes.
0062059963|5.0|I have been waiting anxiously to get my hands on a copy of The Elite, ever since I finished reading The Selection! And it did NOT disappoint!<br /><br />The story starts right where the Selection stops. There are 6 girls left, including America, in the running of trying to win the heart of Prince Maxon and becoming the princess. America continues to care for Maxon, but her heart still feels for her first love, Aspen, who is a soldier there in the palace.<br /><br />There are more rebel attacks, one so severe that America was almost captured. I have a feeling the rebels will be a bigger part in the next book (*crosses fingers*) So there was constant action.<br />By the end of the book, there are only 4 girls left... one of them going out in a very tragic way. (don't worry, she doesn't die)<br /><br />I will say that this book actually made me tear up a few times. Once when America receives recognition and praise from her father, after she did something most people would condemn (but she felt strongly about) and another towards the end when she is saying goodbye to one of the guys. (no spoilers here)<br /><br />Really, I don't even think she made up her mind about which one she wants. I mean, I think its clear, but its so hard to be sure since she wavers so much., and I cant blame her. Aspen is great and steady and she knows he loves her. But Maxon is great in his own way (though I don't like him now as much as did in the first book)<br /><br />This book is grittier. Some crazy things go down. And I still cannot wait for the next one. Just found out theres a little novella... so Im gonna try and find that.<br /><br />Review by Theresa M Jones at TheresaMJones.com
B002ZFQD04|2.0|I bought this CD/DVD combo and was real excited to sit down and watch when....The DVD didn't work! I was thoroughly disappointed. It was either from another region or was totally blank as it wouldn't even play on my Playstation 3 which we all know plays Blurays! I sent it back and got a refund. : (. The 2 star rating is for the CD which DID play but had to send it all back nonetheless.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting account.  The writer was very careful in not giving away information that would identify his Seal Team members.  Powerful presentation of the intense training, dedication and skill of Navy Seals.  Even though I knew the end of the story, it is a hair raising account.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I rented this for a plane ride to the west coast.  Kept me entertained.  The story line was a bit odd.  As a pure Sci-Fi lover, it was good for a watch.  I definitely would not have paid full price in the movie theatre to see this one.
B00B7G3NFU|2.0|Kind of played like a bad TV movie.  I think the idea behind it is interesting and John Hawke's performance was very good, but Helen Hunt was her usual cold self and her Boston accent snuck in and out.  Not well put-together.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I don't know how I ever overlooked this book since I have read every other one. I was not disappointed.<br />ENGROSSING,interesting characters, attention grabbing details and of course so well written. Grisham makes his characters so real it is easy to identify with them . Miss Calli is not only warm,loving and a wonderful role model but also a great lady. Willie Traynor .editor of the town's newspaper, brings the sleepy town of Clanton to life when he demands justice when Danny Padgitt promises to get the jurors if convicted. You can't wait to finish the book,and then you are sorry when you do.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have watched this series mant times and for me I am always entertained this is one of my all time favorite show I hope it continues to be well written.
B008JFUORW|3.0|Synopsis:  Alan (Zach Galifinakis) decides to purchase a giraffe, but his recklessness inadvertently causes his father's heart attack and subsequent death.  Fed up with his immaturity and drug abuse, his family decides that he needs to go to intervention.  Alan agrees, but only as long as Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) take him to intervention in Phoenix, Arizona.  As the men are on their travels, they get sideswiped by Black Doug (Mike Epps) and crime boss Marshall (John Goodman).  Marshall abducts Doug for ransom in an effort to get back millions of dollars which were stolen from Marshall by Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), who has broken out of Thai prison since the end of Hangover 2.  The men are tasked with finding Chow and getting the money back, which sends them on a wild goose chase that sees them chasing Chow across the American Southwest and Mexico.  As the men chase Chow and attempt to get the money, they reconnect with some of the people they met previously, such as Jade (Heather Graham) and her growing son (who was an infant in the first Hangover movie.)  Will the men find Chow?  If so, will they maintain an allegiance to Marshall or help Chow along the way?  Will Doug get killed before the ransom is delivered?  What crazy antics will Chow get them into this time?  And will Alan ever grow up?!<br /><br />This was the movie that Hangover 2 was meant to be:  A comedic action film that threw twists and turns along the way.  The reason that Hangover 2 was a flop was largely due to the fact that they tried to apply the action formula that was perfected in this movie to the exact same story (more or less) that was told during the first film.  Though the movie was critically panned, I laughed harder that this than I did Hangover 2 and found some moments to be as funny as the first.  Perhaps the reputation of the second movie made movie critics too cowardly to give this one better praises, but the reputation this one has is wholly unwarranted.  No it's not a classic, but it's certainly not a dud, either.  In the end, you have a very serviceable sequel that would be a slightly above-average film to watch even if you hadn't seen the other two.<br /><br />I recommend this for fans of the other Hangover films, action movies, and comedies.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy are fantastic in this series.  What a pairing.  I have nothing but good to say about this series even if it doesn't get extended, I loved it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of my 2 favorite bingo games.  You can play for quite a while every day on the free credits.  It also has a free tournament every day that you get 5 free games in and 1 free daily spin on the slots.  It has a tutorial room that you can do first and learn what everything does, which is very helpful to me.  It's fast enough that it keeps my attention, but slow enough that I can easily do 2 bingo cards at a time.  I haven't tried doing 4 cards yet.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys bingo.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book so funny. It's a good book for kids. I laughed at every page. Please get this book so funny
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Surprised.....I was not sure that to expect but was wonderfully happy....did not realize something like this could be made...Super...<br />Duper....
B000I9YX06|5.0|Am a big fan of Will Smith. This movie did not disappoint! It's exciting, edge of your seat, entertainment. Great price!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|One of the greatest movies I have seen in awhile....Happy to be able to watch the whole thing without any interruptions.
0142000655|5.0|The descriptions of the lands and scenery were amazing.  The story kept you intrigued by the way it intertwined the different families.  The characters were all very interesting.  It was hard to put the book down, but it was too long to read all at once.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love these kinds of games makes you think like you are a detective. I cant wait for more levels to be released.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It will not let me update the app sit it is a good app  so it is good app  I love  the first it lets me update
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The books were very good. But I can't believe how it ended, didn't even say if another one is on the way.<br />I give this book 2 stars.
B009CVELHG|1.0|I sent this back.  The only thing grand about this film is the title.  The title should be Less than Grand Hotel.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I luv this game! I think its for all ages. LOVE IT! Its a adicting though. Every five minutes i check to see if the other person is ready to play. XD Lol.
B00B0X4PIO|1.0|I love the way this author writes. Beautiful stories. Any recommendations of similar books (Have read  Kite Runner & A thousand splendid suns ...loved them too!)
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Best restaurant game ever.  I play it for hours and hours. I think I'm a real Chef.... lol I'm addicted.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Fun and wholesome, shows the never give up attitude works, keep your dreams and visions and opportunity will come to you
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I'm obsessed with Downton Abbey and love having it on blue ray!! You can see just about every wrinkle in the dowager countess' face! Such vivid colors and very reasonable in price. Love it - and it was hassle free!
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|I am very disappointed with this CD. I specifically order it to try the advertised Z Plus App, and now it turns out that as of today the App is not available for Android. I wanted to listen to the new version of the deluxe edition and have the opportunity to download all 24 songs in DTS Headphone: X, which reproduces a cinematic multi-speaker surround sound experience using only headphones (any headphone).<br /><br />DTS Headphone:X presents a whole new way to hear mobile entertainment over headphones. But Android users like me will have to wait.<br /><br />If you are an Android user and DTS Headphone X is your main interest you better check if it is available before you order the Deluxe Edition.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|I didnt get to watch this season on tv so the best way to watch it was buying it, I would have had to pay double in store so amazon had a lot cheaper price, That's one reason I got it. The ending was shocking and suspenseful. a great buy for true fans
031603441X|5.0|Best rock (and of the best of any genre) autobiography.  Keith does use a ghost writer but he supplies him/her with such fantastic material who care.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I love Sanderson. You can always count on his work to be compelling and interesting. I am looking frrward to the next edition.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I needed to see where Jack Ryan was going to end up.  The last time I was up to date was when Bear and Dragon came out.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I loved this book! Cornwell make the time period come alive. I was transported back in time with the characters and the story plot.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written by a doctor giving some medical aspects of death along with an easy to understand view of heaven.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|You'll finish the game in two evenings or so. The puzzles are fun although it is a lot of searching instead ofcactual puzzling. The atmosphere and (sort of a) story are very well done.<br /><br />Overall a pleasant experience, but a little short to  finish.
141659521X|5.0|I was very upset to hear about Vince Flynn's passing.  I have every single one of Mr. Flynn's books and have enjoyed each and every one of them.  Love his Mitch Rapp character.  My thoughts are with his family.  He will be sorely missed by his readers.  He was such a great writer, his books always took you on a trip.  If you haven't read his books, start at the first one and keep going. You won't regret it!
B003INBNXO|5.0|I don't even know where to begin.  Big Budget, Story, actors, and everything comes in place really well.  If you are a fan of Donnie Yen or Martial Arts movies in general...this is a must!!
B000KFB4PK|1.0|I wish I'd read the reviews for this - I usually do, but LEGO prides themselves on quality products and my son fell in love with it reading about it in a LEGO book. It seemed like the perfect watch.<br /><br />It came and it is super cute, though it felt a lot cheaper than LEGO generally does. The kids were ecstatic, and had a lot of fun putting it together in their own way. My older son especially was excited to have a watch and has been staring at it telling me the time all day. However, he complained that it kept falling off. Unfortunately, though I know he's been being careful, it fell off outside and he can no longer find it.<br /><br />If you want something fun and cute for a few hours, or to add a few extra unique pieces to your collection, get this. However, don't count on it as a functional watch at all.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|This was another great Donnie Yen movie.  It's another great piece of work.  Well done.  Any martial arts fan should check this out.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|I don't know if it was the music, the story or the fact that I am sick with a flu bug, but I blubbered like a baby during the second half of this episode. The lead up to the wedding was masterful and the emotions evoked by the actors got to me. Loved it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read some reviews and was very afraid of being disappointed.  I had waited so long for this one!  I thought the characters developed so much more.  Everyone had a surprise!  You really saw their many sides.  I am excited that there are more to come.  The way these characters are developing, this thing could go on with more twist and turns then a rollercoaster!  Can't wait to see what's next!  Hurry up Silvia!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was really fun to play. like every one else said it was easy and went by quickly. I can't wait for the other puzzles to come out!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I love a good family drama. This story was very well-written and I enjoyed the different ways it was told (courtroom, narration, etc).
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I have never read a mystery like this one. it reminded me of Groundhog Day in some ways. I couldn't put it down. You kept wondering where it was going? Lots of twists & turns. It lagged a couple of times but all in all very good
B004P8A7J2|5.0|Once you wade through the Directors show off, the movie does a delicious job of portraying the culture.  Of course the culture had to spin off many actual experiences, however I tend to think these aspects portrayed, represent the common experiences of the typical person involved in the drugs of this feature.
0345525558|5.0|Our book Club had a wonderful discussion of what love means in different family situations. One lady had adopted several of her foster kids, and had much to contribute. The rest of us were so well informed by this book, and now can relate to the real issues that kids bumped from home to home must feel. Plus, it was fun to learn the horticulture and the meanings for using particular flowers in a gift bouquet.
B004Q3UL56|5.0|This was a real story, with real people, a real and believable plot, great ending.  Five stars for real. Loved it.
B000AS4L16|5.0|A true document and a must have for people who really want to know what happened in the darkest period of human history.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's such a great book, with a different and great reading rhythm. Didn't watch the movie yet, looking forward to!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game. it got a little harder as you went along.  i cant wait for more rooms.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|GREAT GAME LOVE IT<br />SO MUCH FUN IDK IF U CAN MAKE THIS GAME ANY BETTER BEST GAME I EVER GOT ON MY KINDLE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT U DO NEXT
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Doesn't work on Fire HD. Keeps freezing. Hopefully the bugs will be fixed and I can really see what this app has to offer.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is lots of fun.  I love these types of game in general.  If you are like me and like to create your own world and environment.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|Judas Priest has been part of my musical life since my neighbor and I saw the cover to \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" in the LP rack way back in 1976.  I have been a huge ...no massive fan.. of the Priest ever since.  They are one of the most important and legendary bands of all-time.  PERIOD.<br /><br />Now I have been on record here that I was not a fan of the music and tours that followed since Rob Halford returned to the band in 2003.  I didn't care for \\"Angel of Retribution\\" and really disliked \\"Nostradamus\\".  I also thought that \\"Rising in the East\\" sounded tired and ..well...old.  Especially Rob.  The show I saw on that same tour was disappointing as his vocals were stranded and harsh.  The other thing that I noticed was that when Rob would tour with his band Halford, the live performances were honestly crushing what he was doing with Judas Priest.  I never had one issue with the tours over the past several years with that band.<br /><br />So I was a bit uneasy about this new release.  Farewell tour or not I wasn't expecting too much at this stage. Also without K.K...whom I think (along with Brad Whitford) is one of the most under-rated guitar players in metal, I wasn't sure it would have the same classic Priest vibe to it.  Oh my goodness was I wrong....and thank God for that!  This is a flaming hot, brilliant and powerful set.<br /><br />So what's the difference from all the other tours? Simple..Rob is singing his lungs out.  After shaking my walls with this recording...that is the most enjoyable show I have heard from Priest since the 1990 \\"Painkiller\\" tours.  It was just one killer song to another and Halford was just off the charts good.<br /><br />As far as the DVD video and stuff...yes..there are some serious editing issues..(watch Scott Travis during the drum intro to Painkiller)..they clearly took different footage and moved it around a bit.  But in the end...I am not too bothered with that aspect.  The colors are very strong and the Tom Allom recording...iswell....PRIEST LIKE!  As one would expect from the man who captured and help create the Priest sound all those decades ago.<br /><br />The stage is awesome, the songs great, and the performances recorded with power and clarity.  Not much more you can ask for there!<br /><br />If this is the last of the band live ..then what a send off!  (Honestly I don't want to see them out again and risk messing up what I have just experienced..but that's just me.)<br /><br />So, if you love Heavy Metal..and love vintage style, old school, in your face power....and most of all...Love Judas Priest, this is a must have item.  I have listened to the entire show three days in a row and never once cringe expecting a bad spot to show up as in shows from the past.<br /><br />Long live the Priest...and as they said..\\"WE ARE HEAVY F***ING METAL!!!!\\"
B000V39KDO|3.0|I have viewed 300 twice and after considering the movie, I'm left with the impression that the basic premise of this flick was just to display plenty of blood and guts. It isn't a horror movie, but the majority of the films action scenes remind me of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' more than anything else. Which is quite a shame, since the historical significance of this encounter should be a source of inspiration. Regrettably, once you've gotten over the gore, this movie has little to offer... in my opinion.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Saw it twice in theater had to own it fast. Such great acting. Reminds me of home. Ha Ha. Very funny movie with serious plot.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|Great date movie! Take your mom, More of a drama based comedy. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed it,. No nudity violence, or sex. Wow. Streisand acted without singing.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|The DVD was great, no scratches, package was sealed and nothing was wrong with it and we all love it.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Star studded Police yarn, from the 40ish. I won't say gangster yarn because its more police yarn. Date enjoyed more than me.
B0035G5IOE|4.0|We love this movie in my house.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|Impossible death defying, testosterone , manly man movie with very little change from the previous movies. Action packed impossible super human &#34;shoot-em-up&#34;, non stop action. WOW! What plot?
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is such a kick. I remember the movie from when I was a kid. What a blast!<br />Enjoy your self.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|when I try to open the app it just crashes. seems like a good white noise app though. also I think amazon should make better free app of the days.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Highly recommended for those who love good books.<br />Hoesseini is an excellent writer.<br />Always a good read.<br />Keeps your attention!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|It goes into much more than the TV series can ever do. It is a must read for teens to adults!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the very first page, I was hooked. I thought it would be a new age, deeply scientific read and I would need to be engaged intellectually at all times. Instead I was thoroughly entertained and intellectually stimulated without having to work hard at all. It was an easy read. The imagination and storyline intriguing. I recommend this book highly. I'm about to purchase the second book now!!
B009NY43NY|2.0|Reading this made me glad the series was finally wrapping up. Sookie books are always delightful, but all good things must come to an end.
B00821OX98|5.0|Not bad show...husband really liked it...sci fi guy ya know..he buzzed right through all available seasons and waiting for more.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|Wikipedia is great. But sometimes, you don't have a computer handy. Enter the Wikipedia app. It's fast, reliable and easy to use. Plus, it's free. I definitely recommend it.
B0000549B0|5.0|I could watch this DVD over and over.  It's a Jimmy Stewart movie that is a must have for every video library.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The writing, as always with Sylvia Day, was impeccable. Gideon was a little less intense than I remember him, but that could be because he's IN LOVE now and no longer just intrigued by the possibility of it. I think there was more that could have been done with this one, but think there is room for growth and resolution with the fourth. It was good. Could have been better, but I think that may just be a result of waiting more than a year and coming up with so many internal scenarios, only to see they didn't manifest as I thought they would. I gave it three, instead of four, because of the long wait and the possibility to have to wait another 6 months to a year for the final installment. Hopefully the fourth book fully delivers. Sylvia can spin a good story, I just hope she gets back to spinning with the feverish pitch seen in BTY and RIY.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I like this video so much that I went back on line and bought copies for people in my family.
B008JFUMHE|4.0|\\"The more you look, the less you see.\\" Four of the best magicians in the country are given a mysterious card telling them to meet at a certain place at a certain time. One year later they are known as the four horsemen and they begin to stage the biggest tricks of their lives, the first of which involves robbing a bank. When the FBI begins to question them the four magicians elude them and stay ahead of everyone trying to stop them pulling off bigger and more impressive tricks. I have said before that expectations have a huge impact on how much you enjoy a movie. If you have high expectations you are usually disappointed and vice versa. This is a rare exception where I had high expectations going in and still really enjoyed this. The movie has all the fun of an Ocean's movie with the writing of a movie like the Prestige. While this is pretty much a heist movie it has an original twist on the genre and the movie sucks you in right away and keeps you watching right up until the end, which seems to come too soon. The cast is perfect and the movie is very entertaining. I highly recommend this and it is one of the best I have seen this year. Overall, all the fun of the Ocean's Eleven series with a more serious tone. I loved it. I give this an A-.
B00BNPWBQC|5.0|If you are a fan of Primal Scream, ( in the US I call them the best band no one knows about).  then you will not be dissapointed .This disk seems like a natural progression from Exterminator. I do recommend you get the Deluxe version if only for the track &#34;Running Out of Time&#34; the horns and chaos are back as well with Producer David Holmes ( Exterminator ) and guest guitarist again Kevin Shields ( My Bloody Valentine). again the best album of the summer/year.<br />Fave tracks<br />1. Culturecide<br />2. Running out of time.<br />3. 2013<br />4. Goodbye Johnny<br />5. Hit Void<br />6. Sideman<br />7. heck all the songs I like, I haven't felt that way about one of their disks since 2000's Exterminator.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|\\"You're not just anyone. One day, you're going to have to make a choice. You have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be. Whoever that man is, good character or bad, it's going to change the world.\\" After the imminent death of the planet Krypton, Jor-El (Crow) sends his only son to Earth in order to let him live. From the moment he arrives he notices he is different. When another survivor from the planet arrives and plans to destroy Earth it is up to Superman (Cavill) to save the world. I was super excited (get it) to see this movie. I think that may have hurt my enjoyment of it a little. While the movie is very good and has a much deeper and grown up story then the ones I grew up with it just didn't have the feel I wanted. The writer and director made Superman seem very human which is a neat idea but that also seem to hurt the movie in my opinion. The fight scenes were exciting but after awhile they started to feel very repetitive. The fight scenes also made Superman seem anything but super to me, which is my biggest problem with the movie. All that said the movie is entertaining and worth watching but I think my expectations were just a little too high. Overall, a good movie but do not expect the feel of the Christopher Reeve movies. I give it a B.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I love how the use mostly the same actors in different story lines each year - can't wait for season three.
0399226907|5.0|Nice story, nice illustrations.<br />The board book has little circles cut in the food items the caterpillar is going through, and my 9 mo son loves touching those cut-outs when I read this to him.
B00C7KYXHW|3.0|The actor who plays Hannibal Lecter brings out the character well, but the main character- the young profiler- tries too hard to be intense and brooding and is almost comic. The blood and gore is a bit over the top, too. I would prefer more realistic character development and less splatter.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have been'm playing this with my 8yr old daughter and it makes her think and look outside of the box of what you see is what you.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|A compelling story, masterfully weaved with equal parts research and soul search. Perhaps even more dear to the divorced, to tip toe back toward commitment.
B004I744AS|5.0|this is the best on line dictionary I have yet to find! I especially like the option to actually here the word pronounced.
1601251505|5.0|This is a great game system and this single book is all you will need to play a very deep game. The core rulebook covers almost everything you will need. Later books to expand magic, equipment, and to add more details to your campaigns are good but everything is covered here.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It's fun because of all the level  ups and the challenges and some are pretty easy and some are hard I don't like the feeling when you get so close to to beatting the hard challenges and then you get zapted by a laser!
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I loved the first season, what a great show. Still waiting to get the second one when the price dips a little more.
0553801503|5.0|I HAVEN'T FINISHED READING THIS YET, BUT I AM A COLLECTOR & HAVE TO HAVE HARDCOVER FOR ANY BOOK SERIES I'M REALLY INTO. AS WITH THE OTHERS I ORDERED, THIS CAME AS PROMISED, AND IN PERFECT CONDITION.
0062082353|5.0|Very cool look into Chris Kyle's time as a SEAL and involvement in the recent conflict. Rest in Peace, sir.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Im back lol so anyways this game is Alright like I mean getting icons is kinda hard but they connected this to Facebook and stuff ans it is very fun so uh ya Cx see my nightclub story review remember Y.O.L.O. ~Swaggie123
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Have to start by saying wasn't easy and at times frustrating. But that's what makes this a 5 star review and the game so interesting. Wish gave the clues a little sooner because when you do get stumped it takes quite a while to get enough info from the clues to move on. But I will definitely look for future games! Great way to introduce your company and get us to come back and look forward to your future games.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game I thought it was a challenging yet fun game I would love to play more levels of this game
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It was recommended by my niece and I really loved it. It wasn't to cheesy for a love story, ending kinda left ya hanging.
B00CIP57Z8|4.0|This is a romance that has good  characters in the principle roles.  Perhaps it ended in the only possible way.  I enjoyed it and recommend it.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|A cult classic! This has been one of my all time favorites since childhood. and us still as good as when it was first released!
B00AEBB9EG|5.0|Three Days of the Condor has always been one of my top 10 movies.  It has seemed realistic in that the number of people involved in the conspiracy was small, no one (not even those involved) really quite knew what was going on (or  much cared), and everything did not end cleanly.  The character played by Max von Sydow is one of my favorite villains, and the \\"it will happen this way\\" (about not accepting a ride) speech one of my favorite speeches.<br />  One quibble though: ladies too, do not get in the car! : If someone comes up to you and points a gun at you, throw the keys away, scream and run!  You may get shot, but the people around will call 911.  If you get in the car with him, even if he looks like Robert Redford, you will likely die after some very bad things happen to you.  Do NOT get in the car!<br />  Given today's technology compared to the antiquated systems in the film, this scenario could very well happen; and in fact, the central mystery which everyone was trying to hide HAS happened.  This movie is a good human-sized adventure that is so engaging I forget I am watching a movie, and well worth the experience.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A great journey through time in which different flavors of love are put to the test.  The search and discovery of the true self of various characters, always surprising the reader by waking to new feelings.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Killing Floor was a story that captured my interest. Telling the story from the first person gave the reader a different perspective. You were able to feel all the emotions of the story as it unfolded. I found the violence a little too graphic at times but it was generally an entertaining book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool game very addictive. Recomend for anyone. Really? I have to write a paragraph? What is this an essay? Britt
B0097EWK3A|5.0|fun fun fun. interesting intrigueing cant get enough. wanna play the next one right now. one of the best ones I have played and ive played a lot.
B001EBV0NA|5.0|I sat terrified when I first saw this as a child, alone.  Mother walks thru the room, swirls her scotch and says &#34;Yeah, that can happen to you.&#34;  But wait, that's another horror story....<br /><br />Well...after considerable introspection and healing....I still find this movie engaging and shocking.  Most movies, especially horror just don't hold up -- what were once cutting edge 'special effects' or plot lines now seem quaint and detract -- which pulls you out  from the experience and forces you into a critical mode of viewing.  Not the case for this movie.  You can immerse yourself into the story and you don't come out....until the end....when the director and writer see fit -- when they cast you out the window, leaving you on the cold, concrete sidewalk that is life to draw your final breaths and beg for absolution.
B0013WI0PQ|4.0|Heartfelt movie about a boy put up for adoption who finds his parents through the sound of music. Beautiful movie! Makes me cry every time I watch it! A must see
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I've read all his books and none have disappointed. He takes us into a world we know little about and gives the human experience of a culture that is mostly a mystery to most of us.
B0086700CM|1.0|there will be times where there is no obsticals yet I die from a tree? or I will command a turn and the man will jump..... every time I played I lost very early due to glitches. poorly done game. not impressed....
B0097UO87U|5.0|This is a great album in that it shows how Jeff Lynne can take old classics and work his production magic on them to make them sound fresh.  Part of the reason for that is that he chose great songs, but the other ingredient is how well Jeff Lynne put his own style into these songs, often playing and singing all the parts.  To fully appreciate this album, find the documentary film about the making of this record where he explains the process, etc.  This definitely provided that ELO fix that I'd been wanting for all these years.
0810995212|5.0|A beautiful  and inteligent book. High quality ill. ,excellant research on a facinating topic. Truely Leyendecker was one of the greats.
B00DBSZT7C|5.0|Fast past, very gory, well made, and NOT for kids. Finally, the woman is the smartest of the pair! Cool.
B0028R765A|5.0|Watchmen is one of my favorites.  I only buy movies I want to watch over and over.  This is one of them.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|It took me several deep listens to get into this new release from Megadeth, and I do like it. To expect to hear the same \\"cookie cutter\\" approach to making a Megadeth album can be redundant.  We can't expect to hear \\"Rust In Peace\\" again and again.  And I understand that \\"Risk\\" was a disappointment, but this is a modern date 2013 sounding Megadeth, and truthfully it doesn't disappoint. \\"Super Collider\\" is a mixed bag of sounds and ideas which is refreshing to the listener.  Yes, there are heavy moments like \\"Kingmaker\\", \\"Burn!\\", and of course \\"Built For War\\", but songs like \\"Beginning Of Sorrow\\", \\"The Blackest Crow\\", \\"Dance In The Rain\\", and the title track suggest changing times which we all have to evolve with.  The cover song, \\"Cold Sweat\\" (Thin Lizzy) is very good, and the bonus songs \\"All I Want\\" and \\"A House Divided\\" are decent. I personally can do without the live recording of \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" (it just doesn't fit with the album.) I couldn't imagine Megadeth re-releasing their best known work from the 80's and 90's. And it takes courage to face and accept change. So take a brave step forward, and give \\"Super Collider\\" the chance it deserves!

B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is great entertainment.  It's not a classic but it's one of those books you can't put down.  Honestly, I read it while I'm on the treadmill and it makes my workout fly by!  I've read some of the other, more negative reviews and this book/story shouldn't be taken too seriously.  I do recommend this to anyone looking to escape reality for a little while.  :-)

B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This book is great if you are looking to break away from domestication you have been taught all your life. Easy read with clear concepts and simple practices to apply to everyday life.
B00C7JAAH0|4.0|i really like this album. similar to the other ones they have put out but a nice lil twist on some of their sounds.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I am only 1/3 into the book. Having a hard time, not written as the first 2 were. Moves around too much fast.
B006CUDDUG|4.0|I am no English major, but I know a great story when I read it. This is not a glamorized James Bond spy thriller. This is a story about the cruel realities of espionage. While fictional, it is clear from other accounts the Cold War was quite brutal for spies. This book brings to life the covert war that many of us thought was simply a &#34;cold war&#34;. It was anything but. Highly recommend this. I listened to it on the way back from Louisiana and it held my interest the entire time.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I have lived thru many presidents, Born at the end of Herbert Hoover's term. Love the different personalities and the ego trips of them. Good insight to their real self and decisions.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love them and use them almost everyday.  appointments, food, reminders, all kinds of things.  I can't think of any think else at this time.  thank you.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|This movie was OKAY. The idea behind it was very neat, but I'm not a big fan of the star in it.  Doesn't even compare to the usual Disney/Pixar or Dreamwork's movies that we love.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|he may be misunderstood by the other side of the justice system but he knows what's legal and what's right and how to use it to get justice..liked it..
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Always LOVED this movie and owned it, but my copy got messed up. I think we've seen this at least a dozen times. Can't wait until the second one comes out in a couple of weeks!
