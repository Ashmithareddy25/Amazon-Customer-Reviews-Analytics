0060734191|5.0|One of the best YA trilogies I've ever read. The characters are excellent, the writing is superb, don't miss this trilogy! There's a fourth book coming out next year (I hope so anyway).
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I had to have this to complete my collection so I ordered this one along with the previous one I ordered. I am totally satisfied
B00BOL22GY|5.0|awesome show, and I don't consider many show awesome.. maybe 4 or 5<br /><br />Great action, a great story, and a great story
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Would love to be in a book club to discuss this.  Everything happens for a reason.  Discisions you make impact others.<br />Very thought provoking!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|a great RPG one of the best ever! a must buy for PS Vita. hours of fun and hard to put down.
B00004T2EA|4.0|I'm afraid that I must disagree with the rather hyperbolic lead 5-star reviewer (\\"It's better than the Weissenberg... It's better than Argerich! Yes, it's even better than Horowitz himself!\\")<br /><br />\\"Better\\", of course is a rather subjective term. \\"Different\\" or \\"preferred\\" might be more appropriate. I would agree that Volodos demonstrates extreme technique, that at times, seems to border on perfection. Yet, to my ears, his playing - and the extraordinarily precise accompaniment of Berlin under maestro Levine - sounds unemotional, and ultimately uninvolving. There are definately moments when I said \\"wow\\". But when it was over, I had little desire to listen to the performance again - something that I did not say after hearing Yuja Wang's recent recording [[ASIN:B00EBJ624O Rachmaninov, Piano Concerto No 3 & Prokofiev, Piano Concerto No 2]]<br /><br />Frankly, I found Volodos' playing heartless, unemotional, and for me, personally uninvolving. Actually - not to dissimilar to my own response to the Weissenberg/Pretre performance. Precision without heart. When the lead 5-star reviewer wrote: \\"Argerich's performance, while fantastic, is simply not as well thought out, technically as perfect, nor as carefully prepared as Volodos'.\\" I thought, \\"Ay, there's the rub\\". Argerich's performance has something this performance lacks: spontaneity and spitfire. It isn't as \\"carefully prepared\\". It's heartfelt, of-the-moment, hellfire brilliant.<br /><br />A great performance by Volodos? Without doubt. One that causes a tear to fall from the eye at those moments of aching beauty written into the score - no. A performance by \\"one of the greatest pianists of his generation\\", well yes. But it remains to be seen if this is a recording for the ages - as are those by Wild and Argerich. I tend to think not. It's more of a performance for those who love Von Karajan's final digital recordings of the Beethoven Symphonies.  A thrill ride, but it's high-sheen perfection without soul.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I needed this for my Harry potter collection to make it complete. I already ordered the rest to complete mine.
1619695006|4.0|Not what I expected,  but very good writing and a very profond message.  Exposes parts of politics and relationships we try not to see or acknowledge.
B00631HASU|3.0|This game looks good..Music is ok..BUT if you have any degree of color blindness..As 30% of men do... it's difficult to distinguish greens and reds... would be easier if the colors were solid...but they are not.
B009RH973I|5.0|Really nice case. Easy to put on. Protects well. I bought this because I was able to see a demonstration of it online. That really helped me make my decision. It has met all my expectations.  The case is lightweight and has allows you to stand the kindle up while using it. I like to read this way.  I encourage you to watch the demonstration.
B006KAWI2C|5.0|I've owned many of the individual discs in the 1999 remastered booklet edition, but couldn't resist purchasing this massive ugly pink box at the ridiculously low price that it is currently being sold by amazon. I keep the box in my classroom closet shelf, and pick discs to play at appropriate times - what can I say? It's immensely enjoyable- even if many of the performances are not &#34;top drawer&#34;, the vast majority are not merely listenable, but enlightening. Even the earliest recordings by Rubinstein sound pretty good over my mid-fi classroom system - the Villa Lobos was more enjoyable in this context than on my high end home system.<br /><br />Not much of a review, I know - but it's Rubinstein's legacy. What more can or should be said? The Chopin - both from the 1930s and 50s - is timeless. The Leinsdorf Beethoven Concertos are noble. And the Brahms is sublime - right up through the elder statesman's final recodings. (Well, except for the mess with Mehta on Decca, also included in this set).<br /><br />Currently selling for around $100, this is a treasure trove not to be missed by anyone who enjoys musicianship for the ages.
0316055433|2.0|I actually had great expectancy over this book.  Though usually I am not one to buy a book because of all the publicity giving over it nor because of the gushing book reviews, I did in this case and I regret it.  &#34;The Goldfinch&#34; was sold as yet another masterpiece by yet another Charles Dickens (interesting plots, complex characters, etc), but this book is nothing of the sort.  It is simply a boring, meandering, zig-zagging 700 + page book that has no mystery, no character development, not even much in the way of art history.  You can read dozens of pages and nothing happens, just words that seem to spew out from an automatic word processing program.  It is a lesson in what NOT to buy, even when Amazon and all other book outlets make this a stellar read.<br /><br />Save yourself the money and buy something else with the $30.00 pricetag.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|A real Holiday Classic.  Something the whole family can watch.  I never get tired of watching it.  You can't go wrong with this.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Awesome!what more needs to be said the game is awesome and challenging! What fun it is highly recommended! True mystery!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game is similar to the Bejeweled games. I love the graphics and the challenge it creates to try to achieve your score higher each round. I love the random coins that fall when you get a good combination. Everyone should play, very entertaining
B000DWMN2S|5.0|My family and I just loved this film - amusing, entertaining, literate - with lots and lots of heart. Wish more films were as entertainingly thoughtful and culturally reverent as this one.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Super fun movie, enjoyed it more than the first ! For all ages. Lots of action and fun new Characters.
B000JIN3J8|1.0|Very dissappointed in the interpretation.  Won't waste my time watching it again.  If you don't want to read the book, invest in the audio book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its so much fun but I think it needs a little more things like creeper and zombie and smelting and spider eggs on creative but besides that AWESOME
0738212415|5.0|I really enjoyed drawing. The instructions were easy. My drawings looked great. I would definitely recommend this book as a great learning tool.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|Enjoyable, although not essential. It is somewhat miraculous however, in that it does provoke a complete re-examination of Dylan's Self-Portrait, something that I had thought was neigh impossible. Four stars because it holds up well after repeated hearings - although god- knows, its no New York Blood On The Tracks. How about THAT for the bootleg series? Or The Basement Tapes? Or the live Gotta Serve Somebody/Slow Train Coming concerts?<br /><br />Or Blond On Blonde out takes?
B00G3P6VA4|2.0|Maybe the most re^^rded attempt at a sci fi I've seen since my last MS3K weekend.  This incoherent, disjointed junker is destined for the robot review.  So many questions, conflicts, bad acting, crap script, and poor effects. Then add the complete inability to suspend disbelief.  Ugh.  I want my $$ back!!!
0061906220|5.0|This is the cutest book and we love listening to it on the computer. It is so funny and educational.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have been playing this game for three days and I am on level 5 (world) and I'm stuck. But THE BEST GAME EVER. You should try it it's worth the 99&cent;. Because all you do is dream up ideas and solve levels and if you have a good imagination this game is for you.<br /><br />Love~ kindle 2.00
B005LAIIJY|5.0|EXCELLENT STORY PLOT. IT WAS WELL WRITTEN AND WELL ACTED. I DIDN'T GET BORED. THE PRICE WAS GOOD. IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO RECEIVE IT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it because it's easy to play. I play when I have the chance to. When I do I take great responsibility for Brutus my horse. Thank you naturalmotion!
B00GIXWHZ4|2.0|Great! ...if it had ended after the first 30 minutes,  I'd like to be politically incorrect about how dumb this movie is.  However, it would be appropriate to do so considering I must recognize I was dumb enough to rent this seeing (and knowing) what the rating is.  I give up on this franchise.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I couldn't decide on 3 or 4 stars. The story is good and the writing style is good and it starts off good. The closer I got to the middle of the book the more it seemed to drag. I found myself wishing it was over. I like long books but this just got boring. Despite that it is still a book worth reading
B00006WKSZ|5.0|Jut nice. Worth every penny. If you like the Scorps, this is a great recording to purchase. It has it all there.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Received timely and in perfect condition. this is my favorite show on television.  When i am down this is the show i watch to get feeling good.
0679805273|5.0|Love Dr. Seuss!  I have been giving this book for years as a graduation gift to the children of friends and family.  I had the pleasure this year of giving it to my own son as he graduated high school and he loved it.  It is a great book about life in a playful and lyrical way that only Dr. Seuss can write.  This book is about believing in yourself as you go out into the world and taking charge of your own life when you are facing difficulties.  A wonderful read for both children and adults.
1452110581|5.0|I bought this as a gift, but read it before giving it.  It is so cute and funny.  The poems are very creative and true to point.... at least as far as I can understand a cat.  I am not even a cat person and I enjoyed reading it thoroughly.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book began well, introducing a fun, vibrant cast of characters. Though the cover and synopsis misled me to thinking this was a horror YA (it's even categorized as such), I got over quickly the fact that nothing remotely scary lines this story because I enjoyed the peculiar children and their peculiar take on time travel. Fun stuff.<br /><br />However, the climax lacks the fantastical flair of the first half of the story. I would've thought a story about fire-weilding, invisible, floating children would illicit a climax that joined all these forces to defeat the antagonist. But, surprisingly, the climax ends in a gunfight. A gunfight involving children that is. Although, now that I think about it, that may have been the most peculiar part of this story.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is a great game but takes a lot of memory. The people that say that it will not download even though they cleared apps and other stuff have not deleted the apps from the internal storage. If you want this app but cannot download it, get es file explorer( I think that's what its called) and delete the data from there. After this you should be able to get this.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Great movie, well done, nowhere near as campy as the 90s one.  Karl Urban does an awesome Dredd, and Lena Heady is awesome as the antagonist.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not sure how I've managed to miss reading this book for this long.  This is relatively easy reading, yet interesting, exciting, and very thought provoking.
B00GX50BD2|4.0|This was a very enjoyable watch!  Ashton Kutcher surpassed my expectations in channeling Steve Jobs - his demeanor, his physical traits, and his vocal qualities.  The history of Apple is a fascinating story, and this movie portrayed it well.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|I'm a big Boston fan. Pre-ordered this album (CD) in October but got the MP3 downloads before the disc arrived. Utterly disappointing.<br /><br />I understand bands evolving musically, but when the sound changes almost entirely you must realize fans will be put off. Just because Tom has that &#34;Boston&#34; guitar in the music doesn't make it the music fans want. I'm sure Tom could play along to nearly any genre of music out there ... maybe Tejano would sound neato with Tom playing along, or opera, or polka. It's not what this fan wants from Boston. I've heard Boston do The Star Spangled Banner, and it puts this album to shame.<br /><br />This whole album sounds like a horrible movie soundtrack. Simplistic lyrics, few time changes, no good hooks, marginal vocals, boring drum sequences, bloated production, and almost none of the driving Boston harmonizing guitar riffs that we desire.<br /><br />Tom, obviously you can write and record whatever you like, but that doesn't mean we'll like it. And including previously released material on this album makes it seem like we've been cheated even more. Not even a plastic jewel case from Amazon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this one is rock-a-bye baby, not &#34;Rock and Roll Band&#34;. This one will be an unplayed addition to my Boston collection.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like playing I don't like the time limit thing or trying to sell me more plays. Otherwise it's fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so awesome and I like how it makes you think of how you could win the game, I also like how it's really addictive so you think for a while with the satisfaction of the fun in the game.. if you like logic games you'll love this one!!!! It's also free so I  you don't like it you can delete and whatever...
B00CATSONE|5.0|What a great book. It is well written and I truly enjoyed the history lesson. I recommend this to anyone, young or old.
B00GX598FO|5.0|Oh man, I thought the 1st RED was hilarious, but they well out did themselves in this one. Loved the scene where the Asian hit man shoots 12 gazillion rounds at Willis and his buddy, totally leveling cars, cutting them ( the cars, that is ) in half with what looks like a Gatling gun.  Then he stops and asked the Willis character \\" Moses, you dead yet?\\" and Willis answers \\" Not yet!!\\". Killer man, simply brilliant.<br />Bruce's squeeze is funny and just cant wait to get into the action. Helen was as good as she always is in every movie she ever starred in.<br />So, yeah, I LOVED it. Who knew Bruce Willis could actually act AND be funny? Certainly not me....
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|One of the most most unique voices in the music industry.<br />Finally a cd that I own where I enjoy every song.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is not only fun but a great challenge.. just fun all around for any age.. very addicting l really can't shop playing...
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Was a steal to own the whole set at such a great price! Hours of enterntainment for young and old.  Very cool container! Hours of enterntainment for when you are free.
B00FLNQBTK|4.0|This movie was very funny.  I was pretty entertained throughout the entire show.  Plus, Jen Aniston looked great!  Rent or b!uy
B00E0NHP6K|1.0|This product did not fit my grandson's DVD which I didn't realize when ordering it.  Apparently the machines in Germany<br />are different from those in the U.S.
B00004W50T|3.0|Not my cup of tea. But it was purchased for someone that had followed this band in the past.  He is very happy with itl
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game just needs more dinosaurs.  Love playing this, creating the park is fun but there needs to be more dinosaurs so that the game never ends.
1400069289|1.0|I thought that this was a general guide book rather than a comprehensive discussion of how Starbucks was established as a successful business.  Not really useful for the average person.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I never knew Thomas Edison stooped to such low tactics to discredit Nicola Tesla.  A very informative read on the life of Tesla.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I am extremely lucky to read this. I would strongly recommend to read for anyone who want to know the genius who made astounding contributions to science and humanity.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has written another great book. What a unique look into the back room of a courtroom drama! This is a  riveting reminder of history. Well worth the time spent reading the story and then reflecting on it. Highly recommend this to anyone interested in suspense and mystery.
B00B7NPRY8|1.0|I first read this book in the mid 70's and again in the early 80's.  Loved it both times I read it.  However the Kindle edition is pure trash!  The movie staring Starring: Francesca Annis, Leonardo Cimino and Directed by: David Lynch is MUCH better than this version of the book.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this book except not to spend your money on it.  It is NOTHING like the original.<br /><br />I am still looking for an original copy so that I can enjoy the book once again.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|This was a good action film until the end.  Jamie was extraordinary and I loved the way it kept my interest until the end.
B008JFUORW|4.0|The third installment of what is promised to be the last of the series wraps things up nicely.  The focus here is on Ken Jeong's impish Chow and Zach Galifianakis' loony Alan and they run with the spotlight.  Good supporting turns by John Goodman as a vicious thug and Melissa McCarthy as a randy pawnshop owner.  Bradley Cooper does his best to maintain a straight face.  If you wait for the end credits Ed Helms' Stu experiences another physical indignity.  Future trivia question answer Justin Bartha as Doug does his best to be barely in the flick.  For those not offended by giraffe decapitation this film is for you.
B00GIXY4M8|5.0|The movie was great, and the story line was awesome.  It was action packed.  I highly recommend for Marvel fans.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good fun!  Just wish that the energy would regenerate a little quicker....but that's how they get you to spend money in the app. But the app itself moves fast and its fun to play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages. It is easy to play but challenging enough to keep it interesting.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This Is A fun match gems game that you cam play on your android tablets. It is easy and is for ages 8 to 80. Have fun game that you can play any where.Take withyou to all your appolntments.
B00122MWU6|4.0|I already know this album is incredible. What I was confused about is the disappointing way that a couple if the songs fail to make a smooth transition. Fight Test awkwardly fades out, leading to One More Robot trying to pick up. Same goes for Yoshimi Part 1. I find this to be a big flaw, costing the album one star.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have seen all the episodes at least twice!  Watching one episode is not enough, makes you want to watch the next one and the next one.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun and jangly.easy enough to start with, haven't hit the part where you have to pay for coins though. So we shall see
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I think the second and third book are even better.  Definitely worth a read especially since I think you can borrow them for free right now in the Kindle Library!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It is s wost fun bubble game for all ages only problem is you have to hit every balking to win all three stars. Not always easy to do. Good game to adults to.posy with kids without getting to bladed.
B00FKAA4DS|4.0|I dug it. Its damn creative with some of the best songs hip hop has seen in years. Every time eminem goes through a crisis, his albums are great. This one is in my top 3 eminem albums.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Just sheer fun. Holmes and Watson - well balanced ying and yang. You'll want more - my teenagers enjoy it as much as Dr Who. Two things we agree with them on.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Love the simplicity of bond in this one. Not too many gadgets...and they brough back a retro James bond CAR!!!!!!!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It's a very well developed game, very complex and dynamic. I can play it hours on end! The two things I dislike are the little variation of attacks, and that you can't move around the screen. Please allow nightwing to switch into staff mode!! But other than that great game!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great version! I saw a couple one star reviews stating that the cards were too small... I don't know what they're talking about. The cards are definitely big enough!
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Personally, I love 'em! I've been a Tolkien fan since childhood and I'm really glad that someone was able to make these great stories into great movies. Yes, they don't follow the books exactly, but the &#34;fill&#34; is Tolkien's writings or at the very least, in the spirit of his work. These movies (LOTR & The Hobbit) are very well made, entertaining, fun and exciting and are great for kids of all ages! I really love the extended editions.<br /><br />The Hobbit movies are turning out to be another movie making triumph! Many people complain about this or that, well that's okay, but I'll just select the version that suits me (extended blu-ray) and enjoy a few hours of wonderful entertainment. Thank you Peter Jackson and Company for making delightful movies of long loved stories.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Mr. Luttrell writes about his SEAL training. Any person thinking of SEAL training would do well to read his narrative. Reading it is exhausting and I know his training and repeatedly getting &#34;wet and sandy&#34; was too. If what's past is prelude then Mr. Luttrell's SEAL training was a small prelude to his experience as a lone survivor. I don't believe one can imagine such an experience; it must be lived through. Every bit of SEAL training conditioned Mr. Luttrell for the stamina, courage, endurance, and perseverance called for to survive in a mountainous environs the complete opposite of being wet and sandy. It's a terrific read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this for my daughter and she loves it!!! She won't stop playing it because it was so cool.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Always an intriguing read from John Grisham, I like the twists and turns<br />and character's in the story.<br />Would like more of Jake's future.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love playing my Bubble Blaze.  It challenges me in quickness, accuracy and ability to respond to the situation presented.  I am happy I chose to download the Bubble Blaze Game!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|wonderful<br />great for kindle just what I have been waiting for I might have even paid for this app happy all around
B00EVW04PE|3.0|We only saw half of the movie due to poor or slow connection, hence good for the first 44 min.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I bought this dvd box for my sister.  She borrowed mine once, and she fell in love with it.  So, this Christmas<br />she will have her own copy.  It hasn't been opened yet, but it came looking very neat in the clear wrapping<br />paper.  Many of the three sets I bought this year, I could not find anymore.  I only found them on Amazon, and<br />the prices seemed very good.
0525478817|5.0|I love this book, and this was a gift to my friend. I read it over again before giving it to her, and I wasn't disappointed. John Green forced me to look at life in a different way, and I think this book has that power to do that to everyone. As Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. said, &#34;Once the mind has been stretched by a new idea, it will never again return to its original size.&#34;

0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is memoir by Ishmael Beah who recounts his experiences in Sierra Leone during the civil war. The effects of globalization is present even in the small rural areas of Sierra Leone as the author describes  their  name-brand crapes (shoes), listening to hip-hop and reggae music on the Walkman, and drinking Coca-Cola. From feminist lens, gender differences are clear as the men are the hunters and protectors in the community, while women tend to domestic and familial duties. A question it brings to mind are why are U.S. and other countries still buying diamonds and etc. from war torn areas such as Sierra Leone while knowing full well where these likely come from? I think that we are involved in such conflicts because of our demand for diamonds and resources. We unknowingly continue to finance such violence so we may be able to obtain valuable resources and make profits. I would definitely recommend this book to any classes on globalization because I think it perfectly captures some of the effects from it. I would also recommend this book because I believe that the author does a excellent job of narrating his war-story and the conflict in Sierra Leone.

B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Didn't love it!  First season was way better! I am not even interested on seeing the 3rd season after this one.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is great and I enjoy playing. I haven't had any problems with it. It does exactly what is supposed to, so far anyway.
B00004VW0V|3.0|Not a fulfilling album, it has some lesser and some great songs.  Too used to albums by Cat Stevens with every song a winner.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|An excellent outing for three doctors!  Fan shout-outs, humor, adventure and a little teary bits.  If you're a Doctor Who fan, (particularly of the rebooted Doctor) you'll love this.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|ARTPOP is perfect! Her second best album (1st one is THE FAME MONSTER) Electronic Music is such beautiful in her album. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! You should buy it!
B00029D0B0|4.0|Just started building models again after a 30 year sabbatical.  This one is a little bit of a challenge.  Be prepared to put some thought and effort into the decals since they are plentiful and must be applied to raised plastic.  Might want to sand the areas down and then apply or try your hand at painting the details yourself.  Getting a little tired of historical models leaving the swastika off of flags on the decals.  I do like building the internal sections in sequence.  This is very much like it was actually done during the war.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Oh my God I love this game it teaches you that you have to be aware of thing and the world does not resolve around you
B00BWQW73E|4.0|I decided to read this book after looking at some of the press coverage on it. Amazon.com is the kind of company that has slowly taken over and disrupted so many industries and I have been waiting for a book like this to provide some of the back story. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />It was interesting that the author met with Bezos and Bezos joked about what &#34;narrative fallacy&#34; the author would choose to write about. That was an interesting foreshadowing by Bezos and it is the real limitation to the book. The fact that Bezos refused to be interviewed for the book is the elephant in the room, it casts a shadow over the rest of the book. So, while I was entertained reading the story, there is always a part of me that is wondering whether the author is taking some liberty in drawing certain conclusions or leaving out a material fact.<br /><br />All that being said, the book was very entertaining and I doubt there is a better source of material available on Amazon.com. It is an inspiring story to read about Bezos giving up his lucrative career and moving to Seattle to start Amazon. He saw the incredible opportunity in the internet and he risked everything for it. I was also impressed by the focus of Amazon on continually re-investing the companies cash flow back into its business, instead of focusing on the short term and harvesting profits. Bezos is a visionary and this book provides some good context to understanding the inner working at Amazon. In addition, much of the book uses Bezos own words in describing his philosophy and the book provides good examples (e.g Prime and AWS) on how his philosophy was implemented. I enjoyed this book.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|If you like Sting, then you have to give this album a try.  It's different, but still Sting.  He wrote the songs on the album for a Broadway Show to release in 2014, called the Last Ship.  I was lucky enough to attend 1 of 10 performances of this new album in NY during October 2013.  Sting and the other musicians and vocalists performed this album for 3 hours, with much explanation about the motivation behind the music and songs.  I think it's one of his best, and I'm a huge fan (who doesn't like musicals.)
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|grate quality item. dispatched fast. but be wary as it only works on some DVD players,  because of regions. overall a grate item
B00C2IJJMS|4.0|300 Is a good movie.  Some love it, others dont care for the over the top greys and reds, and odd creatures.  But at its core 300 has a good story that is just being told in artful and unique way.  It is a good watch.  And the blu ray steel book is always a plus.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game  Play it all the time recommend it for everyone can't wait for pet recuse to come on the kindle
886613578X|5.0|I buy this every year - or have since I realized it existed, anyhow. Why no additional color covers? This is a fantastic planner w/my highly preferred laytout. Also wish it came in plain ol' large in this format/layout, too. Moleskine shines, however - still does loads of things best, and I'm not subtracting starts for my personal prefs... and I always know what I'm getting when I order this, so that's excellent, too!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book was like comfort food. It was a little predictable, but warm and enjoyable, none-the-less. If you're a John Grisham fan, there isn't as much suspense as in some of the others, but it was nice to catch up with Jake Brigance and his family from A Time to Kill.
B00594XOZU|5.0|YESSSSSSS KIK IS BACK TO KINDLE FIRE HD!!!<br />Add me! howtolove09137.<br />Don't listen to the bad reviews. Lol is awesome!! Lol
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is a very well designed &quot;freemium&quot; game.  There is a large selection of characters and upgrades, and you can pay to unlock them faster, or just grind through the game.<br /><br />This game is so good, I made some in-app purchases just to support it.
B005EHILV4|4.0|On product excellent and meets expectations, it was delivered on time and very good quality, practical and functional for my daily use and meets many needs
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Using it now for Holiday assortments - excellent! No problems with it, so many free aspects -- a real value, and I can order direct from Amazon via links, usually, if I want to purchase music, too!
030759565X|3.0|I bought this for her beautiful apple pie recipe, so no regrets there.  But her style generally is a little more presentation-oriented than I like (this is personal, obviously).  I was hoping to get some good tips from her &#34;regular food&#34; (as opposed to desserts), but they all seem like party food to me.  Anybody can make anything taste good with some fresh, carby bread and a dollop of sour cream.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|This app gives you a feel of magic for starting players<br /><br />If your a fan of magic I recommend you get this game as you'd probably be a pro at it.<br /><br />Currently there is not much selection as there are about 300 cards but you get what you get.<br /><br />If you've ever played yugioh you'll notice some cards such as spells range or are common staples between all decks<br /><br />Warning though.. you can only create 2 FREE characters, the others you must buy with game good and later runes, so be sure you know who you want to pick as you won't be able to delete later..<br /><br />Another thing is, more rare cards are hard to get as you need to buy them with runes so it takes a couple of days of matches to get one or two rare cards in your deck.<br /><br />All in all its a fun time waster, if your interests in a new kind of card game where you don't fuse cards together to make new ones. This is the one.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Found myself skipping parts just to move it along.<br />Plot was rather predictable.  Speaks to younger readers than myself I suspect.
B00AEFXLBQ|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is simply adorable as the iconic Holly Golightly! This is probably her most iconic movie role. I absolutely love this film! It's a classic. I am so glad I was able to find it here, for a good price. This film is probably one of my favorites.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|fantastic show! very Jane Austenesque. the characters are brilliant, Richard Armitage (Sir Guy - Robin Hood series; Thorin - The Hobbit) is stunningly handsome and brings true charisma to the role. he is John Thornton stepped off the pages of the book.  Daniela Denby-Ashe is spectacular and very endearing. the perfect heroine for the brooding gorgeous Armitage.  The chemistry is undeniable between these two.  Brandon Cole (Mr. Bates of Downton Abbey) portrayal of Mr. Higgins is outstanding.  He lends a warmth and intelligence to the character, making it easy to see why our main characters find it easy to have him in high regard.  Best money I ever spent
B0055B7IPE|5.0|There's a scene in the early part of the movie where a little girl sees the house pass through her bedroom by the colorful reflections the balloons make on her room.. That look of surprise, wonderment and joy is the embodiment of this film. The inexplicable depth of imagination and intellect that created a cartoon storyline that is as inspired as this one hasn't been matched since the early Disney days.<br />The brilliance imbedded in the character of Russell, although wiser than his years, is emotionally youthful, sincere and just hysterically funny. The entire movie from beginning to end is refreshing, intelligent, thought-provoking, imaginative, surprising and most of all unexpectedly delicious. Every member of the family can truly enjoy this film, and not just once, as you might very well find that it is a very good movie to watch when others fail to impress. One of those movies that you have in your treasure vault that gets taken out maybe twice a year or so to sadden, then gladden and finally delight in the most beloved way.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have a question......I have chromecast and works great with Netflix YouTube but it says I need to get an extension to work with HBO GO.  I downloaded the one market app n downloaded chrome but I'm still having problems cause I can't get into chrome web store.  Someone please help me. I'm subscribed to HBO GO also so it works on my Kindle fire hd 2nd gen but can't cast it.  Someone please give me instructions on how to get the right Google chrome and get to the webstore.  Yes I have it on my pc.  I have Google Cast on pc and sync to phone/tablet.  I even bought Google sync on kindle app. Thank you.
B00CKDYWYA|2.0|I kept reading this book, but a lot of the time I never enjoyed it. Too many misfortunes in one family and repetive sex scenes on the life of a courtesan, became boring.<br />Bringing in the Granmothers early history late in the book was a mistake, as I had lost interest by then.<br />Yes, the story does cover a lot of what was happening in China in the early 20th century and I wont take that away from the author.<br />The book is too long, descriptions too involved and seemed very repetitive.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|I have always wanted this movie ever since it first came out. I am so glad I found it here, and for a cheap price, too! This movie is perfect for any Hannah Montana fan, or a fan of Miley Cyrus pre-2013. It is a heartwarming movie perfect for people of all ages to enjoy. Miley has to choose between herself and her alter ego - should she give up Hannah Montana completely, or should she continue the pop star lifestyle she has enjoyed?
B002ZG97M4|2.0|great casting and story. would be a perfect movie except the music sucks! hate the remakes of classic songs beloved from the first movie with Kevin Bacon.  The dancing in this one is spectacular and if they imported the old songs or chose better ones, the movie would be much better.  After watching this I went out and browsed for the original Footloose and bought that, just to remind myself how good the music was.  I Need a Hero has been ruined, just like Mariah Carey's bastardization of Def Leppard's &#34;Bringing on the Heartbreak&#34;, some songs just shouldn't be touched.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome product.  I can't believe I waited so long. I wish I did this a long time ago.<br /><br />FYI<br />This product will work on your with your home wifi network (router) so have a good speed. It will tax your system if you have a slow speed.  You might see disconnections or lags.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have never read more beautiful words in my life. A book has not moved me, to laughter, to tears, like this book has, in a very long time! I will never forget this story!
B00EKR61FM|5.0|It is so pretty! It's like a book, but ten the CD's are in the book:) blue ray is awesome!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|A compelling, multidimensional bad-guy, two beautiful and interesting women, and intense action make this is one of the best Bond movies ever.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|This book took several efforts to read. Possibly the translation left gaps that my mind had to fill, or maybe just the writer's style was hard for me to understand. I did finally settle down and finish it - thinking somewhere it would justify the reading time....it did not.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So fun! My 3 y/o and i are playing this together and really having fun. We have been stuck a few times. Great FREE game!
159448385X|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! Such a good plot line, I loved this book! I was reading it for school and we had a month to read it but I read it in three days :)
B00005LOLD|4.0|Very different from the book, but a very enjoyable movie nonetheless.  Marlon Brando again proves he has the chops, but it was a little odd seeing 'Khan' in yellowface....
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Excellent new angle on a love story. And refreshing to pair rational and emotional thinking this way. It is a sweet story about self discovery and how you have to give up what is safe and secure to get to the unknown world of being in a relationship with someone. Regardless of whether you are a rational or emotional person. It is also really hilarious situational comedy in many instances.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|So much talent, hard to believe there is no music.playing in the backround, only drawback is that drummer boy is not included in this album.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Sad...<br />..............but good I guess the ending shouldn't have been that way this should not have died....:( poor four..<br /><br />Forever disappointed
B007R11DKQ|5.0|What a wonderful story and great acting. This is for kids and adults alike and I've already watched it a few more times.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|It is OK. A bit tedious and the format does not work so well now. What was cute with a 25 year old seems tedious in a 50 year old. It just seems to me that a person that has not developed at all is less interesting. And very predictable story line and outcome. Not worth the read really.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Very clever and unpredictable comedy movie. Some of the scenes we could not stop laughing. I'm going to ask for a copy for Christmas instead of renting every time I'm down and need a pick me up.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|That's right, I love, love, LOVE Google's Chromecast!  It is simply the best electronic device I have purchased in years.  So much so that I bought TWO of them so I could use one in my Family Room and one in my Master Bedroom.  Set-up only takes a few minutes, so simple, the connection works flawlessly, and you can stream ANYTHING you want to watch from your laptop, smart phone, or even PC if connected wirelessly to your TVs.  My wife and I cut down to basic cable years ago because we watch almost everything online for FREE.  Why pay a subscription or extra for a DVR option when you can wait a day and watch almost anything online for free?  Less than $60 on Amazon has afforded us extremely easy access to streaming media in two rooms of our house.  It's AWESOME, highly recommend!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is so well written and acted. I don't watch TV much at all but this series is well worth my time.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I can't believe this game has been around for so long!  I played it on my phone four phones ago, and I found it for my kindle fire just a week ago!  I can't stop playing, seriously.  Great job, Trese brothers.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Extremely enlightening and well written. Contains an incredible amount of useful and interesting information.<br />The research gives a credence to many of the behaviors that are observed every day that appear counter intuitive.
B0031RS69G|5.0|Another great disc world book! Few books make me laugh out loud, but dis world books always do! From the Unseen University to the Night's Watch, always a great read.
B003Y5D776|5.0|Plays nicely with linux, and provides the stereo input to my laptop that I need for some scientific work with Backyard Brains equipment.
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|The song with R. Kelly is the bomb! There were a few others that I wasn't feeling at first but I sure they will grow on me
B004TI5N38|2.0|The story is contrived and unbelievable. Baldacci has written some good stories but this is definitely not one of them.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Very entertaining  the story line is fresh, fast moving, keeping the reader turning those pages.  Keep the stories coming guys.  Love your work.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Omg she looks like a regular girl! I didn't think barbie made those. She has a good job I can explain to my 3 year old neice. The girl hunts food for her family. I love this doll. My neice spent all day shooting her dolls bow and arrows.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun and easy...but I run out of lives fast and have to wait too long to play again...but still fun!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is great and I am so happy it came to the Appstore. It is also great for the Xbox 360 .
B001NHNG64|5.0|This book was full of suspense and action.  A lot of twists and turns.  A little slow in the beginning but the last two this of the book I couldn't put down.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I love this classic. So many familiar songs come from this movie.  A native St. Louis County suburbian, I enjoy imagining how people lived back in the day when the World's Fair came to St. Louis in 1905.  So much history came from that era.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Good game but I could not play it because I am visually impaired. My grandson like it. Fun and easy to play.
0786958731|4.0|The game itself is great, but the packaging is horrible! My &#34;miniboss&#34; Dragon figure was bent so badly as it sat in the shippers store that even after a week of trying to bend it back it's simply impossible to fix. The dragon is permanently leaning to one side and the wings are bent worse than I could even explain. I am going to order the mini from a better store and just throw this one away.  Two other miniatures are bent to the side as well, but after days of bending them back I've managed to fix them two at least.<br />But, as I said, the game itself is fantastic.
140006922X|1.0|Lively writing style, but faux &#34;scholarship,&#34; The author's PhD is from UC Santa Barbara. Dies this university know legitimate scholarship dies NOT involve cherry-picking data so what's included supports the author's thesis, and contradictory data is discounted or arbitrarily written off?  If this book were more legitimately labeled historical fiction in the spirit of Dan Brown, I would have given a higher rating.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|A clear concise explanation of the value of checklists to aid in correct completion of a complicated many step process.
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|Very clear graphics, easy to pick things up. Nice fun game that you don't need a degree in science or math to solve the solutions. Just need to stop and think about it  and you should be able to figure things out. Got stuck with bike petals but eventually figured it out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is so addictive! Can't stop playing it...def worth the download, and if you pay on tablet, you can switch between computer, cellphone and have full set of lives on each device it's awesome!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Saw them on sing a couple of songs on Saturday Night Live thought I'd take a chance on an album. So glad I did this album is great ,blues, rock ,soul, this chick can sing it all.
B00425S1H8|4.0|Works ok in Window's XP running in VMware Fusion on our 2013 iMac running OS-X Mountain Lion. Use it to connect to a real time PCR machine in the lab that requires a good old SERIAL port.<br /><br />It works just fine, but you will have to find your own driver at the manufacture's website. If you are using a Mac based system only use the Mac driver, if you are using Windows on you in VMware fusion, use the Windows driver installed in your Window's XP virtual machine. If you are using a regular PC install the Windows driver of course. So I cannot give it a 5 star, because those not used to finding and installing their own device drivers may be stuck.<br /><br />This is an excellent solution if you have a device that requires a serial connection and your new computer only has USB ports.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I frankly feel that there cannot be enough reviews discussing the illegality and disgusting business practices adopted by Amazon in selling a cheap, Korean knock-off in place of the actual controller.  This is advertised VERY CLEARLY on the official Amazon site by the official Amazon store as being the real-deal but from the moment that this package is opened it is very clear that this is not the case.  Folks, I sincerely hope that you are paying attention to these reviews and save yourself some money.  Bad reviews on this product are hard to find.  According to the home page for this controller, there is only ONE bad review; yet when I link to it, I discover hundreds of reviews that warn me that this product is, indeed, fake.  To put this as bluntly as I can, where the hell were those reviews before I purchased the product?!<br />However, passing this cheap knockoff as the real thing is not just irresponsible, it is criminal.  I will be demanding a refund for this piece of junk.  I hope that you save yourself the $35.00 and go buy the real deal somewhere else.<br /><br />Update:<br />I also encourage you to read the negative reviews of this product.  There are some great explanations and excellent information in them about the process that Amazon uses to organize their reviews of a product.  This will help you navigate the website more successfully and prevent you from purchasing products like this by accident.  I do believe that the current practices that have been adopted by Amazon are quite shady (i.e., the reviews of the product are often deliberately misleading) but I will also say that when I complained about this product, I was immediately refunded with two letters of apology.  Now, that could be great customer service or real fear about possible legal repercussions.  Either one is possible.  I will say that I have considered more deeply my opinion of Amazon since my original review (which has been edited) and while I am still not thrilled with being duped, Amazon is still significantly better than any of the other large online retailers who, consequently, have managed to avoid the state tax bill that Amazon recently got slammed with.  So, all things considered, I am willing to cut them a little slack; especially since they addressed my problem almost immediately.  I will merely advise all of you (myself included!) to educate ourselves so that the online marketplace becomes less buyer beware and more beware of buyer.  Good luck out there.Amazon is still significantly better than any of the other large online retailers who, consequently, have managed to avoid the state tax bill that Amazon recently got slammed with.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is very addicting. but I keel getting g stuck on levels for what feels like forever. if you will excuse me ... I need to get back to the game now.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|To anyone who likes a good story.  As exciting as book one of Clan of the cave bear.<br />HOWEY IS A MASTER STORY TELLER.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Fun game, plays well on a tablet. Having some issues getting multiplayer to work but other than that, a good solid game.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love this game but lower the prices. I love doctor whooves but the rare chance of me getting him is insane. make the mane six less ok. I want them so bad but who would pay $100 for rainbow dash and the others. good game bad prices
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Just like the game.  The product is great fun to play and has several different types of 'Uno' one can play.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I love the Marvel Comics movies....I love Thor, because, well, who doesn't love Thor, but Loki is such a pleasant surprise and keeps this movie very interesting..
B00BD99JMW|5.0|If you liked Divergent and Insurgent, you will like this book as well.  It is the same style, the same high-action plot lines, and the author does a great job of not making it totally predictable.  I think a lot of people rated this book low because they didn't like author's plot decisions, not because the writing was bad.  I thought about not reading past Divergent because this book was rated so low.  Don't let the stars get you down.  It's as good as the other 2.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|instead of downloading tempel run u can download this hectic fun game to play at any time with or without wifi
0525952926|5.0|The story of each character is very captivating. I loved this book, the settings in varios parts of the world, and the historic background information about the period of time.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Only interesting if you like courtroom drama.  I enoyed it but it's overrated.  One of Grisham is enough for me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is a very touching story. I enjoyed reading of the young girl and her journey thru wartime Germany. Her trials in life and how she coped with death and hatred. If you like historic novels you will enjoy The Book Thief.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was an awesome book. Not really a sequel to A Time to Kill, but a lot of the same great characters are in it. It kept me interested until the last page.
B003B02PF4|5.0|Best read for just relaxing.  This is the third time I read it.  Love the Italian scenes.  And they all lived happily ever after.
B00ECYZ7T4|2.0|This book is designed for the reader, using Lightroom 5, to perform prescribed editing changes to sample images provided by Adobe Creative Team.  The idea is that if the reader or user of Lightroom 5 follows these editing instructions on the provided sample images, they will achieve the same or nearly the same results with their Lightroom 5 as the writer of the Classroom in a Book achieved.  The results couldn't be farther from the truth.  Even with professionally calibrated dual digital displays, my results were completely and noticeably different from that of the author.  I tried using a different computer with Lightroom 5 installed with exactly the same results.  I could find no support for this problem from Adobe's Website support pages.  For this reason, I found the interactive portion of this publication to be useless.  And since the primary instructional value of this book is in the interactive use of the supplied sample images in accordance with the author's instructions and his expected results, I find this publication to be of little value.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|Awesome... This product arrived on time and in good condition.  Great product. Makes it so easy to keep the legos together and stored away.
B00CD4RPWM|2.0|Never have read a graphic novel before and don't think I will again. The characters weren't as I pictured them at all, especially Claire. The extra character of Kenneth did not really add to the story for me either. I found the print very smal and hard to read, but did appreciate the translations from Gaelic to English. I guess I'm not the graphic novel type, especially not by this artist.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love this game! The scenery is beautifully done. Seems like you constantly have to upgrade though. Would recommend this game.
B004GYY714|2.0|I guess two stars is adequate for an app (the free as well as the tune-in pro) as the pro version worked great for more than a year and I loved it. Two weeks ago it suddenly gave me the message that it had stopped working and I had to force close it. I removed it and got the free version which worked for two days and quit working too.
B006FE83UE|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all times. I have watched this movie from the day I received it in the mail. I thought I would never find it. Great price received on time. Thank you thank you thank you...
B0017I1FO4|4.0|Second Chance (5 out of 5) this song got me hooked on the band Shinedown. Since then I bought all four of their albums and consider them as one of my favorite bands. Believe me, when they have their fifth album out I'm buying it.<br />Call Me (5 out of 5) this song is extremely addictive, catchy, and emotional.<br />What A Shame (4.5 out of 5) this song has fantastic message along with it. Of course, the song is catchy, well written, and rocky.<br />If You Only Knew (4.5 out of 5) this is a beautiful love song. It nice to hear a soft song from a hard rock band.
0374531269|3.0|This memoir takes you back to your own childhood and comparing it with Ishmael's. The story is based around a third world country where there is not much but people are happy with what they have. Right when I began reading the novel, questions lurked my mind such as, \\"Do other third world countries deal with this type of dangers too?\\" and \\"How would I have felt if I was in Ishmael's position killing and taking revenge on others for what they did to my own village and friends or family?\\" Ishmael is a 12 year old boy who gets his childhood destroyed and made everything disappear that had meaning in his life. Throughout the story, Ishmael learns to fend for himself and grow up as a child soldier while meeting new friends and family along the way. Since Ishmael's village was raided by rebels, he was forced to retreat and run for safety and escape. As he walked and headed out for his journey, the villages to come also were attacked by rebels and he is back to square one. He is a strong person and has his guard up to whoever he meets. He takes charge when he joins an army and gets the name of junior lieutenant and decides that he is a soldier for life until he goes through rehabilitation. There, he meets more people and is able to reconnect with family he didn't realize he had. The people Ishmael meets definitely helped shaped his new life of not being a child soldier anymore. Ishmael gets the amazing opportunity to tell his story and change the lives of others and inform them what harsh lives people were forced to deal with back in his hometown.<br /><br />It was a heart warming story that really strikes you how much a young boy could have dealt with in those many years of danger. I enjoyed the stories he told and how honest the writing was. Definitely a recommendation for any history class!
1602377782|5.0|great value & lots of inspiration really worth the value & lasts the whole year through who would've thought geez
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Hunger games meets the Bachelor! A great read! Suspenseful, romantic, action packed. I really enjoyed this book and am awaiting the sequel
B003F9G8B8|5.0|I saw the film in a theatre and was so impressed by the creativity of the concept. Putting together things that really in the intellectual world do not match up - like sports and politics - can leverage enormous energy. Look at the Boston Red Sox and their response to the Marathon bombing. It was not their sports triumph that was significant, but the way their effort to over come adversity and honor those who had through no fault of their own encountered adversity on April 15th brought the city together.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is truly a classic and deserves every letter of that title. If you have  seen the original movie this one is different I  many places but, you must remember that the book came first and not the movie. I would recommend this to anyone that loves classic stories or the Oz universe.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Love being able to watch Netflix on my older TV. Its pretty cool technology which lets you use your phone as the remote and put the movie on TV without having to drain your phone batteries. I wish there was more support to let you project your computer to the TV. If it could do that I would give it 5 stars.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I find this program extremely easy to use, and is similar to what I know about Rosetta Stone, but free. I can use it on my Computer, tablet and smartphone so I have the program to practice pretty much everywhere I go, when having some free time.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Fabulous movie, they've begun to go back to the traditional Bond, tongue in cheek, action movie It's sheer entertainment. Daniel Craig suits the part well- he's  a true Bond in the making.
B008J05EL8|1.0|It does not make since that I purchased the officesuite Pro 7 and had to buy Officesuite Font package this should be part of PRO as this is what pro means.  how can I do office work without the FONT package, this is misleading and I fill this should be part of the Officesuite Pro not a another purchase.  jut don't make since.

B002KJX4IE|5.0|New to Amazon Prime and wanted to see how it worked.  Chose this movie because I knew it was good.  Enjoyed again... First time in years that I've seen it.  Loved it all over again.
B00G3Q6VPS|2.0|Robo Singer Galore. Ok, usually I truly enjoy the sweetness and uniqueness of Britney Spears, however on this effort, she sounds like a robot on a video game soundtrack. Not impressed and the cover art is a boring black background.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I have watched this movie several times and enjoy it just as much each time. I think the characters are fabulous, even more enjoyable than the original. It has stuck to Star Trek ethics. I didn't like the original Khan movie, but this was excellent! I look forward to the next Star Trek movie. They have come up in quality in a big way!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Easy to read, fast paced, and it had an overall more mature quality to it when compared to the preceding novel.  The book provided necessary details one might not notice just seeing the movie.  I think this is in the teen section of most stores but don't let that discourage you.
B00F5FEZTC|4.0|I like the simplicity of the compositions -- reminiscent of some of his early ballads.  His mature voice lends itself well to reflective songs.

B001BANK32|5.0|This is a classic Stephen King and never fails to scare the bejebbers out of me no matter how many times I have read it.  If you are a fan of Mr. King it is a MUST READ !
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is addictive. it froze in the beginning. be carefully you can use real money.it asks your birth date so it can make it appropriate for you.
B00EDUTGB2|4.0|This was a great way to print off of the Kindle Fire HDX.  It made it easier to print documents and web pages.
B000FBFML6|5.0|I can't say it often enough, Robin Hobb's books are great! The whole Tawny Man series takes the fool and the assassin through some amazing adventures and I got to go along!
B00BATG18K|1.0|Having read other Amy Tan books I was so eager for this one that I pre ordered it---before readings reviews. BIG MISTAKE!!  I am a third of the way into it and bored to tears.  So, after reading others reviews I've decide not to even finish it!!  I've decided I'm old enough to do that although it's never easy.  I feel sad all the hours of work that had to have gone into it but--sorry Amy, you've missed the mark with this one.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This is a great action/zombie movie. Parts of it might be a bit too disturbing for young children, but for any mature/adult zombie lover this film is a must.<br />It isn't similar to the book, for those of you who were wondering.
B005USZML4|2.0|It really was written for teenagers, sure did'nt sound like Grisham.<br />going way back it read like Nancy Drew or Tom Swift  (Can you guess my age?  Ha-Ha)
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Strangely addicting. Interesting puzzles.  Good way to kill a little time. Good way for me to tune out my wife's nagging. ;-)
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Bah - yuck. Watched first 5 minutes and dumped it.<br /><br />Gratuitous soft-porn PC junk. Don't waste your time. Sorry I did, even a little.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I love the game but the updates are making the app nearly useless. I normally play while commuting, but the app has started shutting down when my phone doesn't have internet, which is any time I'm on the subway. Also, I got a popup when I started the game today promoting another app, and I couldn't see any option to close the popup without downloading the other app. This is really unfortunate that the updates are making the app so unpleasant to use, because I really do enjoy playing the game.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|My most favorite movie.  I have been known to watch this one even when it is nowhere near Christmas.  A true classic great!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun! does require thought at higher levels and limits the number of times you can fail...which can be good but frustrating!
B008G3N71W|1.0|This book is totally trash.  The author demeans women. The sexual explorations of the main character are disgusting. This author seems to be trying to write a novel similar to Shades of Gray but lacks the ability to write a story with a plot.
B00GRLVE24|3.0|I can access my gmail account, but it only presents my files on drive as most recently viewed instead of by the folders i have everything organized by. so its very very hard to access the info I stored.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|All the games I get never last. Yours, however, keeps me checking it daily. I've had it for months now, and I own so many exciting dragons. Even as I type this a double rainbow dragon egg is coming to my park. I recommend this to kids ages 6 to 12. They will LOVE it. But I also have a few helpful suggestions. First, I would find it exciting if you could make it so players can have a human character and ride in their dragons to the places you mention in the dragon description, going on heroic quests and earning treasures. Second, that character should be able to collect weapons and accessories as they go on the quests (the characters should also be able to ride Kairos). Third, I need more islands. Mine are crowded. I don't like to wait to level up and have more available. I think an unlimited amount should always be available. I hope those suggestions aren't offensive. You're game is perfect; I know that I won't abandon it for years. I also hope that other readers will find this helpful: Dragon vale is a game that kids will enjoy. They'll be checking it daily, and it'll be hard to keep them off. I hope that whoever buys this game will love it like I do. Enjoy!
0062290797|5.0|I have just started reading this book and can't hardly put it down. I highly recommend this book. R.I.P. Chris Kyle!!!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|My Android tablet (HTC Jetstream) originated in Canada but is in use in the United States since it's purchase.  This app is for the English language only if it is either United States or United Kingdom...NOT Canadian English.  I'm sure it doesn't take a lot of work to add Canadian English to the list of recognizable languages.  Since I cannot modify my device's language, my only hope is that someone at Amazon will fix this small-to-you-but-huge-to-me problem.
B00CQ5R18G|5.0|Excellent book one of her best , I really enjoyed it .the storyline kept me in suspense throughout .superb.loved it all .
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This was a beautifully written novel with an unforgettable main character and an unusual take on German life during WWII. I understand it's considered a YA novel, but I thought it was beautiful.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app every single day, multiple times per day. I love the daily devotions and the options to set reminders and divide the bible into reading sections. Great app!!
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|I made an advance purchase ($199) as a gift to my daughter. She received a complete set of BLANK discs. No problem we'll return and replace. Wrong! The &#34;seller&#34; has no stock. We can only get a return of the $199 and re-purchase at current prices of $350-400. Did on line chat with service rep. She was as sorry as she could possibly be but can't change anything. So if I understand correctly, if the seller sends out a batch of sets with blank discs (or missing discs per a previous poster), and is out of stock, we all pay the greater price.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book touched my heart and soul. It is staged during WWII in Germany...a time that has always interested me. This book was different though. It includes many different people, but mostly it is about the poor German families caught up in this terrible time. We seldom think about how the war affected good German people. You see this period through the eyes of the &#34;Grim Reaper&#34;, the narrator of &#34;The Book Thief&#34;. I gave this a 5 because this is a book that will always stay with me and impacted me deeply. I highly recommend this book!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|The CD was so good. It was in good condition. It played well. The price was also great. Was good hearing this legends music again,
145210655X|5.0|I got this book for my husband for father's day.  He love Star Wars but I think my 5 year old loved them more than he did.  They both laughed and she loves to look at the pictures.  Cute present for the Star Wars enthusiast.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The book is great.  The audio book I also bought is pretty terrible. [...]  In the past the book syncs up without issue to the audible book.  I use the actual book with the Professional Narration to navigate rather than Audible's because the coarse Audible controls don't let you navigate to a position within a chapter very well at all.  In fact the Audible navigation control is very poor in almost every aspect.<br /><br />The audio book which cost $50 Feast for Crows seems oddly priced since the actual book that cost $10 and all of the previous Professional Narrations cost about the same as the book.  I tried re-downloading as several of the posts on the Audible site  recommend. No luck still getting No Professional Narration for this page (on chapter 7 of the book.)  It then asks if I'd like to continue and goes clear to the end of the book.<br /><br />If Audible is an Amazon company... why aren't purchases visible under my purchases?  I suspect because the product is typically poor and would get low reviews..
B00631HASU|4.0|First of all, if you're familiar with and a fan of, the well-known PC game: Zuma, then I'm willing to bet you'll most likely enjoy Sparkle HD, as well. If not, even more so...Although, Sparkle's basic look &amp; game play is nearly identical to Zuma, the over all game as a whole, does have it's own style due to an added story line feature that involves collecting 'Amulets' as you proceed through higher levels.<br />You could actually receive your 1st Amulet before you've even tapped Play! I was able to receive mine by locating the 4 &quot;Secrets&quot; that are &quot;hidden&quot; in different areas within the game. To learn more about this, be sure to read the How To Play section.<br />Sparkle HD played well in my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot; with no issues with freezing, lagging or crashing. The games high definition graphics, as well as the colors appeared sharp and bright. There's an option for adjusting the volume for both music and sounds effects, too. There are no obtrusive or excessive permissions and, no In-App Purchasing for those of you who dislike and/or, want to be in the know of these things.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Sparkle is currently compatible with most tablets, only. This is probably due to the way the game appears on a much smaller mobile phone screen. Personally, I don't think I'd be able to see all the important details that you'll need to on a 3.5&quot; or 4&quot; inch screen.. $1.99 isn't too bad of a price if you really enjoy Zuma type games...but even Zuma is only 99&cent;....
B00631HASU|1.0|I mostly do not want sound or music in my games as I am often doing other things and find it distracting. Although this game has controls for volume, they do not work on the 8.9 Fire HDX.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great read.  I never wanted to put it down.  Each chapter kept you hanging so that you wanted to start the next chapter.  I loved this book, and can't wait to read the next one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a very fun game and a little bit challenging I definetly recommend this game its so very fun :)
B00BAXFECK|2.0|I thought this book was over rated. It did have some interesting components and even a few nice insights. But overall it was way darker than it needed to be to make the point. It was way too depressing to wade through the repetitive trials and tribulations before a very weak resolution.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Preston and Childs continually weave ripping yarns that keep you glued to their work. This Pendergast novel is no exception. That they manage to educate along lines most folks haven't considered is just one of the bonuses. Erudite without crossing the line to pedantic. Bravo.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|I'm hooked on Twilight and all the rest of the movies.  I always judge by whether I would see the movie again or if I it was so good I would buy it, and I did both.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great story, great sex. Mimicks Fifty Shades of Grey a bit without the innocence. Eva can be a bit stronger though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a very good game to play when you are bored, but sometimes it freezes alot, but it is a good game.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|use it every night to sleep. all the sounds are very realistic. I like night and river. brest that u can combine sounds,
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Like the popping of the bubbles. Challenging and lots if fun. I like banking off the wall. Kathy G.<br /><br />.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A wonderful story by a wonderfully gifted author.  Grisham never disappoints.  He sets up the characters and gives descriptions that put you right into the book.  Who would have thought a contested will could be so riveting.
0375831002|5.0|Good reading.  It is inspiring, and I love books as did the people in this book.  I fully recomment this book!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a pretty good game, my sister made me get it to play with her. Overall, a fun horse game!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is a all around good game and would rwejchdhsk is s sisid idbfhd Dod d did dj as as a saws
B001NLKT60|3.0|Very interesting read. Exciting and fun Perfect time killer. No big Literature Work though. It does have a few mistakes in terms of places and events, but then again, &#34;who cares&#34;?...
B003UYUP58|4.0|It is fantastic but too long.  It is clearly written and explains scientific methods very well.  I recommend it to all medically trained people.
B005V2S7FW|1.0|last pass for pc is free this is not. if i could give it 0 stars i would. just not worth paying for
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game for kids.It's fun and I like how.the have the aquestria girls on this game where u can play the main music.Also u can pick your character in different outfits.Like twilightsparkle in her first outfit,next her ears,the her dance dress,and finally my favortie the dance dress with the ears,wings,and tail.It's a great game.
B00G922EA2|4.0|You just go through and find objects to use to get to the next area.  Kind of cheesy.  Not difficult to find or figure it out.  Glad I didn't have to purchase the full.
0385344333|5.0|As a fellow major, I appreciate some things more than maybe some civilians would.  Reacher can see the difference between the law and justice.  They aren't always the same.  The character could sometimes be more sympathetic to his friends' desires.  BTW, what a disappoint to see Tom Cruise play a big man in the Reacher movie.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Nice game but it needs some changes .  It requires way to much time to get some items..  also some quests  take way to much time to be able to expand .  For a free game  this company wants you to spend money to get crowns to expand.so much<br /><br />For being free.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Good graphics, but the weapons are very expensive and the hunts do not pay very well... it's very hard to buy the better guns. You should pay out more for the hunts, or lower the cost of the weapons.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love everything about this era. The actors make you feel they are truly living this life which pulls you into it with them. Can't wait for MORE!
B00FKNBBUA|5.0|She sings so many songs that I like. She's a great singer. It's Christmas time so I wanted some Christmas music!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Followed along with the movie but definitely had more in the book. Great read, could hardly put it down! Excited for the next book!
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Very predictable.  The murdering children story line didn't thrill me either.  I don't plan on watching any more in the series, although the special effects were good.
B00FEN000S|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It looks great.  It looks really, really great.  This is a fun movie that never forgets what it is supposed to be.  It is a movie about giant robots fighting giant alien monsters.  If that premise intrigues you then this movie is a must see.  There is a plot and some character development but the movie never forgets to show the viewer a good time.  Great fun all around.
B00338QENI|5.0|Five starts says it all. it says I have to add more words, obviously Amazon does not believe in pithy brevity.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|good but what about the glu points to much money.be nice to get sum free glu points.the. game is good tho.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Worth the money. It is fun for all ages. Perfect to scream yolo while playing. YoloSwag420 am I right or am I right?
B000004166|3.0|This is a great recording by a great artist.  I would have given it 5 stars except that there was a problem with the case.  It was impossible to free the first disc from the case.  As hard as I tried I couldn't get it free until the first disc finally broke.  I have been getting cd's for many years and I never had this problem before.  I would hope that you could replace my broken disc.
B0080K3RGQ|5.0|I could not belive that vegetarian recipies could be this fun. And delicious!<br />Great book and the healthy food is a bonus for you body!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It's a really really great game! And it's challenging ! The direct robots saga and the different modes are very interesting and enjoying.. smis more points to be won though !
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Intriguing!  All of it.  The plot, the characters, the twists, turns, and how we ALL are connected to each other OR NOT.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is a cool game. I'm glad it is now on the fire. I side loaded my original version but this is better. I'm glad I have it on my kindle.
1596597682|5.0|This audio book explains how people can change the way they react to challenges by changing their approach and reaction to the problem.  It has impacted my own thinking and reaction toward challenges.
B00008IHN1|5.0|to find these movies have saved me so much TV movies made my day can just sit back and enjoys them once again
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was one of those compelling novels I didn't want to put down.  On first sitting I read nearly a quarter of the book.  I loved the points of view narrative structure between the husband and wife giving an effective character development while the story unfolds.  There was no way to predict what would happen next and I read this book in record time.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Well done.  Chris Kyle was a great person and this book revealed the depth of his character.  Modest, respectful and committed to his country and team members.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />We pick up at the end of the 75th Annual Hunger Games, where Katniss is taken out of the arena.  She finds there are hard truths in life and what consequences have arisen after certain plots have come to pass.  Some close friends have fallen into enemy hands and are in constant danger.  Other friends are close by and plotting to bring the Capitol’s control to an end.<br /><br />We see her rising up as the Mockingjay, a person to help lead the rebellion to a head.  This is a journey of physical and mental growth.  Death is all around in situations, both those who are good and the enemy.  What is the price of hope and love in dangerous times?  When one allows vengeance into one’s soul, what does that do to that person?  After you kill an enemy, are you sure that it will quiet all those negative emotions towards him/her?  What if it doesn’t?  This book made me think about such things and parts of it were touchingly sad.<br /><br />Even after war and fighting is done, there are no total winners or losers.  Everyone is changed because of what they have seen, heard and experienced.  I came to see it as Katniss continuing on with life in a way that had not been planned.  The epilogue helps bring closure to show how she moved on and what she got from doing so.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|One of the best movie musicals ever made and one of the highlights of the 1970's. Liza and Joel Gray are sensational. And this Blu-Ray print is a knock-out. A must have in any library.
B00BR9VF7K|1.0|It was interesting that I had a confirmation for purchase and the next day when Ms. Munro won the nobel prize my order was \\"mistakenly\\" not available. So sorry!<br />This star is not for the book but for the seller and its unethical practices. It was not a direct Amazon sale but from a private seller.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I initially went searching for a good set of headphones for some international flights coming up and of course the Bose were the first I thought of!<br /><br />But after some research I decided to order a set of these in &#34;used-like new&#34; condition and they came packaged in way that makes me think they had never been opened!<br /><br />But anyway, they have amazing sound quality that can blow me away with just the clarity and sound quality!<br /><br />I don't think these will be ideal for canceling out the noises of an airplane, but considering I use these headphones frequently in my own home (they sound that much better than my $80 computer speaker set up) and are comfortable to wear for hours on end.<br /><br />Do your own comparison and take into consideration your needs and uses, but don't be afraid of getting junk from these headphones, I have been overly impressed and plan on using wax ear plugs with these head phones just in case I end up on an especially noisey flight!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun because I can spend bananas,  unlock new costumes and earn tokens. I can also update the game to unlock new locations. Awesome game dude!
B004IFYN2E|5.0|Terrific Blu-Ray print. The stars are sensational, the twists in the plot hold your attention and the scenery in Venice is spectacular.
B0058ZZBVK|4.0|If you've watched The Good Wife that and Suits are of a similar genre. Both are about law firms, both focus much more on the inner workings of the firm rather than the cases, both portray law firms that are on the verge of bankruptcy, law suits that will put members in jail, mergers, and takeovers . In both there is little courtroom drama. But the fact that they are similar isn't the whole story.<br /><br />Suits is better directed, has better sets, and the writing is superior in my opinion. I also like the actors and characters in Suits more than The Good Wife. I had to watch the whole first season of Suits, and half of season 2 before I was drawn fully into it. The smart and surprising thing is many of the loose ends from the first season are opened wide in the second season.<br /><br />I much prefer the courtroom drama over the focus and struggle of the law firm, but Suits does it well enough to hold my interest. The brash character Harvey Specter begins to show he is human in the second season. The smart Mike Ross expands his shift to honesty while crossing the line from time to time.<br /><br />I find Suits to be a compelling series and I look forward to more episodes. I just wish the constant bickering and pyramid building would be tempered in both Suits and The Good Life. Alas I believe that is the main focus of both series so I don't expect it to go away. I would be much more pleased if the writers would focus more on case discovery and courtroom arguments. I'm sure this type of back-stabbing exists in the legal profession, I'd just rather not be this exposed to it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This innocuous little game is evil. It sucks you in with all its pretty graphics and then 4 hours later your legs have fallen asleep and your kids are banging on the door needing to use the bathroom.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a haunting book--one that you keep thinking of even after it's read.  Keeps you on your toes with the timeline that switches around.  With the character he chose to narrate the story, you get an interesting perspective.  Quite a flair for the narrative.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|You just can't go wrong with the Muppets!  Christmas Eve has to include listening to &#34;one More Sleep 'til Christmas&#34;.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Didn't have incredibly high expectations for this on the Kindle Fire but it really looks terrific.  My only issue is keeping other family members from hogging it.
6305364648|5.0|I will always love this movie! It will always be one of my favorite older movies. If you havent seen it, you really should! It is funny, action filled, and just all aroung wonderful! I am so glad I finally decided to purchase it. Highly reccommended. Arnold and Jamie Lee... how could you go wrong?
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I thought this book was a light fun read and I would recommend it as such.<br />I gave it a 4 because I've been reading Mr. Rhees since I was 8 and I knew who the culprit was I just didn't know why.<br />Mr. Rhee was board game we played as kids. Much better than clue.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Looks great on my parents' tv with their new blu ray player. They've seen this movie a lot, so was great to watch them watch it again with such clarity.
B00F031X62|5.0|It's Jimi Hendrix and it's a live performance finally released, what more do you need to read?!?  I have it in my collection with my other Jimi Hendrix discs.  I had all of Jimi's original LPs in the '60's which I bought from Mushroom Records near Tulane University.  Whether I walked or caught the Feret Street bus, I always enjoyed going to Mushroom.  Everything smelled good and that's where I discovered my appreciation of older women; but that's another story all together.  Buy this cd and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The cd arrived with some other items in tow and all were packed safely and the box arrived sooner than it stated it would arrive.  The Postal Service is doing a great job deliverying my Amazon shipments!  I don't know about you and your city but the Postal Service is kicking all sorts of delivery butt in my city.  I hope they continue to do so becasue I'm getting my Amazon shipments quickly and safely.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|I am still absolutely in love with Tommy-Lee Jones, but this movie seemed to put me to sleep. I tried watching it three times, and I just could not get into it. I dont reccommend it but that might just be me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|You dont need to buy add ons to have fun. Great game everyone who wants a simcity type again should get it. its also FREE!! Challenges also give you rewards.
B009NXD6JM|5.0|It is a  Classic and will be hard for anyone to top it.  Hepburn was a bright light in the Hollywood sky.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  In fact, now that I have finished it, I really want more. More maps or worlds with more of everything. I got it when it was the Free App of the Day but I would gladly pay for more!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I loved it. I thought that my hopes were too high going in because I heard such great things, and I am not really that into movies with witches and stuff, but it didnt dissapiont me. The witches make-up was a little rediculous but it was still a good movie. I do reccommend it! And Gretel is a sexy bad a**! I wish I was her haha. Enjoy!
B00005LIN0|4.0|This is the first one I bought and it was a little like the first one,Almost like it but it was different.But I will keep this one also and add it to my collection.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|You can't do everything on this app, like add PayPal...can't truly update your profile but it's good enough.  Wish we could have an app that wasn't just an app. Full site capabilities, but on our devices.
8866135704|4.0|I enjoy the quality paper. moleskine bindings will last the whole year. I like a Week over the two page spread, but I'll probably get one size up next year.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|If I could give this movie a negative star rating I would.  I cannot believe I just wasted and hour and half of my life and four bucks on this trash.  Brad Pitt was always an adorable but lousy actor...he is a worse producer.  I mean really....... Rabid Zombies?
B0062P3392|4.0|This was a very good movie and another one that I went and watched it at the show.All the actors did a good job doing this movie.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|This movie requires multiple viewings!  Great if you're a video buff, not so great if you're looking for quick mindless entertainment.
B000TDIEX8|5.0|Best all inclusive Rocky sound track album out there.  Includes music from all of the movies including an unfortunate rap version of Gonna Fly, but hey, the rest is solid including voice clips of movie lines.
B00CPLGFM4|5.0|So fast. Although statistically the CORE I7 are faster, the I7 that I spent way to much money on is not worth the cost difference. Overall cost VS. overall performance is awesome.
B00407PNY2|4.0|I went to the show and watched it twice and I liked it then and I have always been a fan of Steve McQueen, and when I can find them I buy the ones I liked when I was growing up and I still like to watch them at my home.
B00003CWPR|5.0|It just deserves this rating. Great cast, and directors, great sexual stuff, with just the right people. Nice and edgy where it needed to be.
B00BQ4NLC8|4.0|Such a gripping story and so well written, I could not put it down! I was sorry to finish it.
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|One of my favorite movies!  A timeless love story.  I can watch this movie over and over again.  It's a perfect addition to my collection.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Only one of the most original, impressively filmed productions.. e.v.e.r. Audrey Tautou is amazingly sincere, innocently beguiling and immensely entertaining.
B000T433CO|5.0|happy, fun, sexy, great music, especially cruising down PCH with &#34;sleigh bells ring, are you listening&#34; like there has never been a sleigh  anywhere near Malibu ever. Loved it. Super cast. Great director.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Super acting based on super writing with a believable plot.  This is the lawyer version of &#34;The Departed.&#34;  Special effects have almost no role in this very believable and suspenseful movie.  No excessive nudity for a first date either!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I think it's is important that you are going to do something with you guys are going<br />g th assisted Gaussian
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so fun!!  can't stop!!<br />super addicted!!  so glad I can play it on my kindle!!<br />everyone should be playing this game!!
B0033H7VI6|4.0|I bought this knife to bring with me hunting or in the woods where I would need a versatile blade for cutting, chopping, skinning, carving, etc.  The blade itself is great, very sharp and sturdy.  I haven't abused it to really see how it keeps an edge, so only time will tell.  The handle leaves a bit to be desired as it is not very grippy.  The sheath is pretty good, and comes with a small compartment for a sharpener and other necessities.  Overall, it may be a little too big for my purposes.  This hunting season I kept my Cold Steel Recon 1 with me (awesome knife, by the way). For the price, however, the SCHF9 is an excellent buy.
B003Y5H5BA|1.0|Too much unnecessary profanity, could not enjoy.  The profanity used did make the movie funny.  I will never watch again.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|This book is a book  club recommendation.  I am still reading it!<br />I am enjoying the story line and another piece of history.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />The first 20 minutes or so are very gripping.  The rest is a character study: not at all what we expected, but still a great movie...<br /><br />and it's a very good study of addiction, which give it twists that make it unguessable.  Washington's tragic character is so well written...<br /><br />...up until the last few minutes, when it had the typical American movie feel good ending.  Acting, storyline, characters...all good and believable, but the last twist and then the ending!  Barf!  We were so disappointed!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|One of my favorite Hitchcock films and Gary Grant at his finest.  Only time I have ever seen Eve St. Marie play the part of a seductress and she is impeccable.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I watch Nashville primarily to hear the music. The show never fails to disappoint. Give me more Lennon and Maisy!
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|An American Story of greatness and tragic ending. He created a bench mark for the rest of us to meet. Beautiful story.

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I have watched this movie 4 times now.  I enjoy the action and the cleaner more mentally prepared James Bond.  This guy is the Daniel Craig is the best of the Bond men.  He brings a certain new kind of charm to a part that can easily be over-played.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|No matter how you feel about Kanye West as a person, you can't deny that he is making some great music and taking risks.
0425266060|2.0|Way to much sex very unenjoyable series prefer fifty shades of grey without a doubt I felt as if every page was sex and far too descriptive
B005SCSL56|5.0|This is an awesome book and when I started reading I couldn't stop. I highly recommend this book. Best book.
B000I9U9X6|5.0|This is a classic.  It shows Hepburn at her best.  Good movie for all generations.  I like the twist on twist the plot has with the couple and their cars.

B007QS5K0E|5.0|after reading great reviews of alter products and being a huge ToX fan, i made the decision to import the milla and jude alter statues. after receiving the package in excellent condition, i put the statues side by side. while the jude statue looks great, it comes nowhere close to milla. guess it's in the pose haha. all the features on the statue, from her detachable sword, clothes and hair, are well painted and detailed. definitely also looks better than the banpresto figure from the ToX collector's edition, which i have too. overall, am very satisfied with this product.
B00285K1KE|5.0|EXCELLENT Picture & Sound quality......I just found out that Blueray movies, etc. are of DIFFERENT Visual (& Audio) quality, and it is BEST to Google: \\"Blueray quality of (your movie here)\\" There's a Great site, called \\"HIGH DEF DIGEST,\\" and it will review the VIDEO & AUDIO of that movie, etc. BEFORE you waste your hard earned $ on the Blueray version. I checked \\"HULK\\" before I ordered it. \\"HIGH DEF DIGEST\\" gave it an EXCELLENT review, and sure enough, it looks/sounds as beautiful as they said it would. :), On the other side of the spectrum....I purchased the Blueray version of another movie I love: \\"Sideways\\" (with Paul Giamatti,) I watched it. It was unacceptably \\"grainy\\" and \\"washed out\\" throughout most of the film. I looked it up on  \\"HIGH DEF DIGEST,\\" and again,they warned against those very things. Luckily, \\"Sideways\\" was on sale for only $10, so I didn't lose out much. But I am going to give my Blueray copy of \\"Sideways\\" away to anyone who may want it. Great movie, but I already have it on a regular (Non-Blueray) DVD, and believe it or not, its quality is actually BETTER than the Blueray's. \\"HIGH DEF DIGEST\\" will sometimes tell you as much. Also, according to them, \\"Superman Returns'\\" Video quality is \\"HIDEOUS,\\" which is why I returned it, before even opening the box that it came in. But back to the beginning....\\"HULK\\" is Excellently presented on Blueray. Just as \\"Star Trek ('09)\\" was....just as \\"HI DEF DIGEST\\" said it would be.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This is a phenomenal series that really shines in 1080p glory.  Follow the Starks, Baratheons and Lannisters as the battle for the Iron throne begins. Extras include audio commentaries from the cast as well as a neat history of the seven kingdoms.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|A classic!  Just as good as when it first came out. My kids are  enjoying movies I grew up with
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun for all ages, and so very addictive! It can get frustrating, but the challenge is what makes it great.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I really like this little amp. I'm not some huge Audiophile or anything but these really gave my Sennheiser Hd 558's a good little boost. I like the 2nd setting best boost the bass just enough and everything else makes them more apparent and crisp.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Lose weight safely, slowly and for sure! If you have a growing belly, you should read this book and learn about what bread really does to your body.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love the book, it is great for all ages!<br />I chose this rating because I absolutely love the book!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like Facebook but it is more difficult to use on the Kindle than on computer for me.  Probably will get better as I get used  to it.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|kindle fire hd 7 (last years model).  Doesn't work.  Took a long time to download.  Long time to &quot;install&quot; but never runs.  Also had the &quot;fills up your drive&quot; problem.  Downloaded master cleaner from the store to remove it.  Would be great if that gets fixed.

B00AC8ZA3M|2.0|If you are a fan of the Halo games I suppose you might find this simplistic &#34;movie&#34; interesting. If you are not then I think you will find this video a waste of time.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|We started using this app a few months ago and now we use it every night. We have found the tune that helps us to fall asleep more quickly than before. It also has white noise tracks that are fun to experiment with. I recommend this app to most anyone. No complaints here.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I chose 1star because the book is not so enjoyable. I also didn't like that because it was bad. _ Allie
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is Facebook. I use it to see whats going on and what people post and what companies post to. Great way to share many things like food, politics and mutual likes and dislikes.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|We got this and the other Indiana movies for our 8- and 14-year olds to watch, based on fond memories from when they were originally released.<br /><br />As many people have commented here, Indiana has a lot to answer for - the template laid down by the first movie and its sequels, based on serialized shorts from an earlier movie era, has been copied and copied and copied ever since. Most of the summer releases of the last decade, although more sophisticated and filled with better effects, are often variations on a theme of Indy.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that overall, they still look good. The original is best, but they all hold up.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|Bought this for my grandkids and they love this dvd.  Jack Black is the best and the price is right!!
B00EKWTLUO|5.0|The music is amazing!  The percussion and violins create that intensity you feel while watching the movie.  I could listen to this over & over....and sometimes do while driving.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love to use this app. 140 characters or less to state your option. Good to talk about many issues from Breakfast to Immigration. Can even use it ti share pictures of your food.
B00D2I8E46|4.0|Costello's most inspired recording in a good long while.<br /><br />You could argue that Costello's most inspired releases of the last decade plus have been with strong collaborators - Bacharach, Toussaint, and MacCartney. The Roots are another inspiration, and there's some dark gems on this unsettling, angry album. Costello's sounds relevant again.
1449410243|5.0|Great hilarity. So many laughs and so many more good bits you find every time you flick through it! Definitely a good one to have on your book shelf or coffee table!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Wish there were more life options but still a fun game. Lots of fun for everyone. Plenty of levels that make it hard to complete.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|How could anyone complain about the greatest adventure series of all time? Not every film is at the top but you can't go wront with this collection.
B00631HASU|3.0|This app downloaded to my wife's kindle fire hdx and runs fine. But it will not download to my nexus 7 2012. Game has good graphics and sound. As a zuma game it is pretty good, but since it wont download to some tablets, gotta dock it a star or two.
0307887448|4.0|When I saw &#34;Wreck It Ralph&#34; in theaters, I thought &#34;Why did nobody do something like this before now?&#34; Video game nostalgia has been quite popular in recent years, and I was surprised it wasn't being capitalized in the same way super heroes or old cartoons have been recently. Ready Player One is a mediocre sci-fi novel that cashes in on video game (And overall 80's) nostalgia like no other.<br /><br />I enjoy reading/listening to predictable sci-fi novels while I work. &#34;Ready Player One&#34; constantly came up as the &#34;You need to read this&#34; lists, so I decided to read it. There are many things I like about this book: gratuitous pop culture and &#34;nerdy&#34; references to video games and the 80's in general, a world that I understood due to my knowledge of MMORPGs and other video game conventions, etc. Everything I like about good sci-fi books is found in this book.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like about this book is the same thing I didn't like about the hunger games trilogy (Especially the last two books): The situations depicted exist SOLELY FOR THE SERVICE of the story, not the other way around. In other words, I had a hard time suspending my disbelief at certain points that the story emerged out of the author asking &#34;what would be the repercussions if &#34;xyz&#34; happened?&#34; Rather, it felt like the author asked &#34;how can I feature &#34;pop culture reference xyz&#34; in this story?&#34; There is nothing wrong with this, because in reading a work of fiction we all are being pandered to for the joint agreed upon purpose of finding a temporary escape from reality, to a certain extent. But the level of pandering featured in this book started to cause the illusion to break for me. I wish I knew this ahead of time so I could sit back and enjoy it more. As long as you don't mind blatant nostalgia pandering, you will no doubt find this book entertaining. It just didn't &#34;change my world&#34; like it no doubt did for many video gamers who read this but hardly read books.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I have yet to find a King novel deserving of anything less than 5 stars. This one really made you think at the end because at first I didn't understand it. Then it dawned on me and I certainly don't want to spoil it for anyone.<br />I've read some critique of Mr. King as he's \\"was good but . . .\\" or \\"he's writes silliness now . . . \\" or other such  things. One guy told me once that he didn't like his work because it wasn't \\"believable\\" and he felt as if it was just made up BS so he felt like he was being lied to. I had to laugh hard at that because just the genre itself connotes unbelievable, made up stuff. Like there would actually be a clown that lives in a storm drain. Or a portal in a diner's pantry leading to the past. LOL It's fiction. If you want a horror story that's non-fiction go read George W Bush's biography. Just the way Mr. King described the flatulence of the Gypsy's victim in \\"Thinner\\" I could almost smell it myself.<br />IMHO Stephen King has gotten better and I will always be his #1 fan.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I know some critics just didn't want to see another Superman but this movie pulled it off. A great script, fine acting, excellent direction and an abundance of amazing special effects. The speed of the battles was impressive. Superman in this movie is a true SUPERhero.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great read!  One of Steven King's better books and a great follow up to The Shining.  Hard to put down once you get started!
0061122416|5.0|One of my favorite re-read books. Each read, I get something new from the words of Paulo Coelho. See for yourself.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I can't believe this app is free! There are so many great features and it really is proving helpful in my pursuit to learn a new language! HIGHLY RECOMMEND
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Usually DC characters tend to fall flat on the screen, if not in the first installment of the series but subsequently. Not so with this Batman triple play. The third in the trilogy is riveting. Great script, acting and direction.
B007REV4T8|4.0|While still flawed in some minor aspects, &#34;Skyfall&#34; impressed me more than I was expecting it to do so after Craig's disastrous first two films, which I have to blame on the directors, writers, etc. rather than Craig himself. I hated &#34;Casino Royale&#34; and did not like &#34;Quantum Of Solice&#34; for continuing off that mess of a movie. But &#34;Skyfall&#34; brings Bond back, the Bond we used to know and love, with some new, great elements brought to the table as well. While I do criticize a few minor flaws in the film such as Q being young as he is (Q has always been older than Bond) and the scene where he kind of lets that girl get shot by the villain (in older films, Bond always saved the girl) I have little to no more complaints about it. He begins acting more like Bond in this film again, rather than the immature crybaby he was in the last two, it brings good ol' Q and Moneypenny back, well as showing the interesting transition between the two &#34;M&#34;s. The action scenes and story are both well done and the climatic battle at Bond's house is one of the greatest moments in Bond history! It was even kind of cool seeing the gun barrel sequence at the end of the film instead of the beginning, too. There were many good things I enjoyed about this film and will be adding it to my collection which consists of every single Bond film minus Daniel Craig's first two. I do so hope and pray that the series keeps going in the direction that this movie started in.

B005MMY9A8|4.0|This movie made Thor jump off the pages and come to life. Very well done! Just how I imagined him.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Iron Man keeps going strong. This is a somewhat different take as we come to see the ravaging effects of the &#34;Avengers&#34; movie on Tony Stark.

B006YTTVHO|3.0|I always love reading these kind of books so I liked it. it really depends on what you are looking for.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|Great gift idea, family value overall good. A little more emphasis on the ghosts purpose, as well as detailed movements on present and future ghosts.
B00BGI08GG|2.0|I wanted to like this series but it just doesn't have it. I watched the whole first season and I thought it was derivative in the worst way. I really didn't care if &#34;Arrow&#34; died. You can't have a superhero show if you are bored by the superhero and the scripts.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is a sad,but uplifting and inspirational film all-rolled into one.I happen to also believe that this was the film that really shot Liam Neeson into super star status,What really boggles the mind is how one nationalty of people hates the other nationality so much that they want to wipe them out,and why? Just because they are different?But we have to understand that the Jewish people gave more to us then the Germans ever did...Like the Germans never gave us the Bible or Albert Einstein for instance.I also think that this story will always fascinate people..the story of survival,the perseverance of the Jewish people among many others that they tortured,who the 3rd Reich felt were undesirable,I also really loved the little girl with the red dress it is almost like a little sign of hope seeing it here and there in the movie..
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The author took me into every scene.  I'm the type of reader who like to saver every word and I don' ever rush a book. I hate when a story, this great ends.  It was that good, for me.  Thank you Markus Zusak !
B008Y212PI|5.0|Really addicting logic game. I love these nonogram puzzle type games and this is a good one. It includes lots of puzzles plus hints are provided if you are stuck. Recommended.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Might be the best written television show of all time. The characters are so real and the world they live in is brushed-stroked carefully. You know the people, love some, dislike others, but they are real people struggling with life both &#34;upstairs and downstairs.&#34; Brilliant series.
B00B1EGP44|5.0|I really enjoyed this film,actually I like versions 1 and 3 the best,but since it is a trilogy..I plan to buy the second film  in the series here soon...I also understand that there is going to be a 4th Jurassic Park,that it is in the works and I am very interested in seeing that here soon to see how it compares with the orginal 3
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Every business owner should read this. A lot of what made Jobs a ..ck is what made him amazing at what he did.
B00E8S2KV2|4.0|Not the very best of the Tolkien/Jackson series or franchise, but much better than the &#34;theatrical release,&#34; the Extended version actually makes more sense! There are some bizarre plot holes (you got to read the Mad magazine's take on this, priceless), but it is a visual delight nonetheless. Also, I am usually not a fan of all those &#34;extras&#34; and &#34;featurettes&#34; and whatnots, but I must admit I was mesmerized by some of the techniques they used, the dedication and all. Take a look at when they finally got to finalize Azog's looks: a few weeks before release! Recommended
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King is in fine form. The characters are tightly drawn and realistic. He handles both children and adults with aplomb. If you enjoy excitement and good plot points I recommend King's book highly.<br /><br />Frank Scoblete author of Confessions of a Wayward Catholic
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Love this HBO series.  The cd's work grate, they work perfectly with no problems.  I am happy to add it to my collection
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was inspiring.  It revealed to me that Tesla imagined ideas and actually made them a reality.  He was a great man that was occasionally swindled and doubted.  He seemed to be driven by discovery and providing for a better society.  It was unfortunate that such genius was at times overpowered by men like Morgan with money and influence.  I guess it's a reminder that even geniuses will be taken advantage of if they do not completely consider the consequences of bad business agreements.  There's more required in becoming successful than imaginative genius.

076781326X|5.0|This is part one star and part 5 star.  The show is 5 star, this cd is 1 star...  Bought this over a year ago and just got around to viewing it.  Only by reading these reviews about disappointing it is, did I find out that you have to play both sides of the DVD!  Like a lot of others, I played side 2 first (can't read the label, too tiny) and thought I had half a movie!  Weird.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|For me an office suite should come as standard, Android and iOS provide one, but on Kindle you pay.<br />Once you do pay then it works, although keeps nagging about the font support (more money).
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a fun game so far, with interesting backgrounds, challenging enough, and extra game puzzles. I can play for just a few minutes at a time, which is great for waiting on a school bus to arrive.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I am a big fan of Gillian Flynn. I think she has a truly creative talent and it has shown in all her works from the very first one right up until whatever she wrote yesterday.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A good read.  I would classify it as a &#34;beach read.&#34;  A little confusing at first, as the story goes back and forth between characters/families, but once you become &#34;acquainted&#34; with all of them, it becomes effortless.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When the movie, The Shining, came out I did think it was scary. (I am that old that I'd seen the movie when it first came out).  Then my book club suggested that we read it as our October read. Very appropriate.  The book put the movie into perspective that I had not picked up on when I first watched it. So I watched it again. Then I realized Dr Sleep was a sequel and was not able to put it down. I listened to this book to and from work, along with Whispersync, I continued to read at home. I just could not get enough. This is, by far, the best book sequel I have ever read.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|The app is opening and closing shortly after opening and it is not responding to the touch. I am frustrated. I spent a lot of money in this app therefore I would not like to reinstall it. I really wish that the problem could be fixed. Without me losing my investment.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Loved the movie. The reboot of this franchise has been terrific and it does take writing, direction, acting and ll other aspects to pull off a new and better Star Trek.
B00H1KX87E|5.0|Love, loss, a Russian setting paired with the emotions true to the time period. Now, add in love again with more loss and then you have this wonderful book about the triumph of human spirit.<br />Anya has her life mapped out with Victor, but as things do, it doesn't work as expected and instead she ends up married to Yuri. Packed away and shipped off the middle of nowhere--far away from Moscow life-- her loyalties are tested in the harshest of ways. You need to read this one, and find out for yourself exactly how far a person can go when determined. The human spirit always triumphs, especially with such a talented author at the helm.
006202406X|1.0|So extremely disappointed with the ending.  I can't see my self reading these books again and if a 3rd movie is made, I don't think I could go see it.  Why would I do that to myself?  For once I am hoping Hollywood will make changes to the book.  :(

B0042U94UQ|5.0|Love the movie...SO fun and even meaningful about what it means to be a family. Making of the movie extra really interesting.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't put it down...the &#34;what ifs&#34; are echoed through out all of our lives, I didn't need a reminder of that, but the paths the characters took/avoided had me rooting for them to choose one over the other...page turner indeed!

B000063Y8F|5.0|Best garlic press out there. Mince garlic wonderfully. The best part is that it folds out for easy cleaning. No more grabbing the toothpicks to clear out the holes.<br /><br />I always peel my garlic before I press it, so I can't speak to the &#34;even presses unpeeled garlic&#34; claim.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Anastasia is so annoying and clueless it hurts my sensibilities to read her thoughts.  No one in real life could be that naive and stupid and even though this is fiction I would like a modicum of plausibility.  For those that are looking to be shocked, there isn't even any S&M that's shocking, mostly pretty plain vanilla sex scenes.

B00BPDR3F6|5.0|An epic tale, wonderfully researched, and brilliantly written.  The characterization is rich and this story of science, especially botany, beautifully integral to the story.  Do not miss this jewel - its praise is much deserved.  Elisabeth Gilbert's greatest work - yet!

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very few situations where this can be used. Sent it back as the Apple TV and Roku are better investments and better thought out.
B008220C38|4.0|One of the greatest love stories of all time.  I saw the film clips I knew I wanted to see it. The list of actors and the unique adaptation of the story was worth buying it and having it in my collection to view whenever I want.
B00AEBB8H4|5.0|It cannot be difficult to envision Alfred Hitchcock, staring with astonishment at the mis-use of a new photographic system, at the stage bound artificiality and (intentionally?) dead sets of WHITE CHRISTMAS, and thinking he could take his own VistaVision camera and big moose negative to the south of France with one of the world's most beautiful women and the best, * and best looking actor in Hollywood and make a better picture asleep in his chair. HE DID! Burks won the Academy Award for Cinematography. He should have had a coronation.  *David Thomson
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie. The animation is great and the story is wonderful! WeI ordered this for our grandchildren who live in different states so they could watch it in their homes!  I'm sure they are going to love it as well!
B007HJ8LOE|5.0|My favorite Italian language film. The subtitles are accurate and do not get in the way of the movie. The dubbed version has different direction and is not as good. Beautiful story - great history of the film industry and the social mores of the time period - the educational aspect does not interfere with the love story at all. It is a film that can be studied and enjoyed at the same time. The end of the movie features the best montage of film kisses from the early era of film. The music is perfect, putting the viewer in the moment and memorable.I've never seen the director's cut and wish that Amazon would put it in prime video for viewing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I could not but this one down. At all. All of the characters were endearing. Even the evil ones. Only negative thing I can say about these beautiful stories is that the indecisiveness  of the protagonist can get a little annoying but all in a wonderful story.
1449305172|4.0|Clear, concise, most importantly PRACTICAL advice w actual steps you can follow, instead of just endless philosophizing on the process. It's a short, quick read perhaps better suited to checking out from a library, and I imagine most of the info is available on his blog, but I enjoyed it & learned some good lessons to apply to work & personal projects.
B00G5G7K7O|5.0|This is an amazing movie, by far the greatest story Disney has told. Olaf (the snowman) was the cutest little guy ever and he said the most funniest things
0804148767|5.0|I just finished listening to the unabridged audio book, featuring an amazing performance by Samantha Bond. Having enjoyed it so much I was sorry for it to end, I decided to read some reviews and was a bit surprised by all the negative ones out there. One reviewer thought that many readers seemed to have some trouble with the unexpected situation we find Bridget in these years later, especially Mark Darcy's role in this book. Yes, I was jarred by it. Yes, initially very disappointed. But I feel that Helen Fielding told the story in a realistic way of how we might imagine the somewhat older and (slightly) wiser Bridget living her life under these circumstances. I want to give further info, but I don't want to spoil it, either. I will say that I missed Shazzer a bit, but absolutely adored the new eccentric bohemian friend, Rebecca, and actually, I thought all of the new characters were well thought out - and Roxter is just an incredible man - kind  of a cross between Mark and Daniel (the best parts of Daniel, that is). In this latest installment, Daniel seemed more of a stretch to me than what Fielding chose to do with Mark Darcy, actually.<br /><br />Since this book seems to have a Love/Hate affect with it's readers, I would make two recommendations: Firstly, if you are a fan of the first two books, give this one a chance, and try to let go of the happily-ever-after expectations you had from where she left off with Mark Darcy (I know, it's hard. I mean, I kept picturing Colin Firth!). You will not be disappointed by the unanticipated romances and moving moments that Helen Fielding creates for our Bridget. My second recommendation is if you are on the fence about it, choose the audiobook over the book. Samantha Bond's read had me laughing so hard - she's absolutely brilliant with all types of voices: women, men, children. I'm guessing I would have given the book 4 stars, but Samantha provided the 5th star. Oh, one more recommendation: this would be SO fun to listen towith girlfriends, especially single mom girlfriends.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Not only fun and amusing, but very practical help. I learned a lot about the field of memory competition, which I had never heard of before.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|simple yet fun game. all ages can play and enjoy this game.I play anytime I have time to burn and can still offer a challenge without driving you crazy. worth it
B00DDBNJF6|1.0|Someone better get this straigth: you CANNOT  mix offers for the standard CD and the Lux Box set and confuse people like that! Fix it and reinstate the Box set offer at a normal price. This is totally un-amazon, this is a rip-off
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|It is the top show on TV.  The characters are fantastic, the story always keeps you on the edge of your seat with the right amount of suspense to really hold your interest, and the sets and makeup are the greatest!!!!!!
B00028HBKC|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  It's a great history of our Lord Jesus Christ.  You will love it as much as I do.  I love watching it when I can again.  I've watched it many times.  Never get tired of it.  I recommend it :)
B00DQR26EC|5.0|It's a great little game which has both the old game tropes which org fans have  come to love and a lot of fun me  humor combined with a more dynamic battle system makes a great game
1611761565|1.0|Unable to download after purchasing it.  And customer service was lousy.  Could not resolve the issue.  Only sight where I couldn't download this product.  Don't buy it from here.
B000L9EKL0|1.0|In a word -- okay, in two words -- &#34;horrible acting.&#34;  Oh, and did I mention &#34;no plot&#34;?  Well I will:  NO Plot!
B0001I561E|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and she loves watching it over and over again.  She likes laughing when watching this movie.  I recommend it for your child/children :)
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is an awesome action packed movie with a plot that is good for the young and mature, Disney would do well to do a sequel and do a more effective job advertising its release.
140006922X|5.0|This book is a great read. Full of historical and scholarly references. I learned so much. Always best to have real information and not just interpretation of events by those who would like to have control over our beliefs and profit by that power.
B006ZS4SXQ|5.0|I bought this model because it looked like a challenge, and you rarely see a Lego model with a remote control.  My 8 year old daughter and I spent many hours of quality daddy/daughter time assembling this kit (she did one step, I did the next). I am hooked on Technics as an adult.  I watched my 8 year old pack a limited-slip differential gear box - twice.  Insane!<br /><br />I have to say you need to be patient and careful.  One wrong move (put a piece in position 3 instead of 4) and you may need 2 hours to find the issue, then another hour to undo, then another hour to redo (thats 4 hours for one mistake..).  That being said, the instructions were easy to follow, but long..<br /><br />At the end of assembly we were not disappointed in the finished project.  It is super cool to play with.  It is powerful.  It is not complicated to drive (dual independent axles work synchronously somehow).  It looks awesome.  We love it.  Indoors only (as box says).<br /><br />I am told Lego only does one or two Technics projects this complicated each year.  I suggest getting this now since production could end at any time.  The follow on model (crane) is cool, but has no remote.<br /><br />If price is no option for you I suggest the \\"tweaked\\" and upgraded version of this model, Lego model 41999.
B000AP04OM|4.0|Received as described. My little great niece loves this movie and  now she can watch it anytime she wants to. Thank you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is the second game I've had on every device I have owned. Not like a lot of games that try to make you pay, you can earn acorns very easily. Love this game!!
B0060D123K|1.0|Appalled that Disney excised the emotional heart of the movie &#34;When Love Is Gone&#34;- will NOT be buying. Horribly disappointing.
B008QOI0ZE|5.0|You will enjoy watching this classic much more in this clean, unspotted, unedited  version with no idiot late-night hosts or commercials for personal injury lawyers to interrupt. I hadn't seen Dracula whole and straight through for years. It will make you remember why this is such a classic.
B00BFV1JVM|4.0|Great read couldn't put down, the characters were great & the story was gripping all the way to the end.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Good read.  I have enjoyed reading the first 4 in this series.  I plan on reading all of them in sequence.
B00571F26Y|5.0|well written...easy to understand...extremely informative....something I have begun to follow.Easier than I thought..go for it and feel the difference fast.
B0091XT22O|5.0|Another one of those movies you rarely get to see straight through.  Still creepy and disturbing after all these years. It may not be what Stephen King thought it should be, but then again he knows Jack about making movies compared to Kubrick.
B002BRRTUO|4.0|Funny, but really cheesy.  Music by Queen is hilarious.  Costumes and sets are wild.  FLASH! Ah-aaaaa!  HERO OF THE UNIVERSE!!!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I like the first 4 books in this series.  I will purchase more for the summer and hopefully finish all of by the end of the summer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game glad it is finally available on kindle. Wish there were more help to pass the harder levels .
B001NHNG64|4.0|Reacher is a hero you can believe in.  I rank Lee Child up there with Patrick O'Brien (Master and Commander) and Bernard Cornwell (Richard Sharpe) as authors of terrific series.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Lots of issues and cannot sea trade with out being on facebook; that is a feature that should be corrected.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Love the entire King & Maxwell series.  They are all great... I loved the TV series, however, it was canceled. too bad.
B00AEFY6ZQ|3.0|It was ok, but it wasn't as good a story line or acting that I remembered.  I love John Wayne's movies but this one wasn't as good as the others.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|because I think once I understand how to use it I will be as happy as I am with my Kindle. My friend is actually the one who downloaded it as she said I had to have it in order to return books to the Overdrive program Wish I knew what to do next as the explanation is like reading Greek  to this old lady. I know I will find someone a lot smarter than me to show me how it is just a matter of time.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I first read this book in 2007 when it came out. The whole time I'm reading it I thought to myself this HAS to become a movie. Such a great story of heroism, it really defines what it means to be a Navy SEAL. I'm reading it for a second time before the movie comes out. I've read many books about SEALs and their missions, this is my favorite, and the best written.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Series is great and lovely.. It is a easy read and you will laugh so hard that you sides may hurt as mine did.  Buy it!
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|People forget that Arnold was an actor before he became a politician and this movie, though a little flawed in story and acting is still a very fun movie.  If you never grew up watching Arnold Schwarzenneger movies in the 80's and 90's you wouldn't understand but he has a certain sense of humor, iconic catch fazes and moments where only movie magic can explain what you are seeing. If you loved watching Commando, The Running Man, Red Heat, Total Recall or Last Action Hero you'd understand that, while not the Terminator or Conan, he has a history of making movies just like this.  I recommend a watch of you loved any movie I mentioned, this is just a fun, Friday night popcorn flick!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is a page turner! The author's characters are some of the scariest people you never want to meet. Her use of the metaphor is unparalleled and I like how she builds her stories by alternating character's points of view.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It works very well and I can use it anytime. I think it's great and convenient to use. Its perfect.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|White Nights has some incredible dancing in it.  We are glad to have it in our library of films.  Great movie.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|If you ever liked the Mad Max trilogy you can't pass up upgrading your set to BluRay.  I know some people complain, &#34;Well I own it already on DVD, why should I upgrade?&#34;  Well here is the reason, you love it, why not?  Why not get crystal clear picture?  Why suffer through the pops and scratches the DVDs had when they digitized the movie from VHS? Look, I am a consumer, I am just saying that you paid for the nice 50 inch flat-screen plasma with dual surround sound, why wouldn't you upgrade some of your favorite movies?  Come on... buy it... you know you want to.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Due to the 30 minute wait period, it has taken me many tries but I still cant complete it! overall,  it is a very addicting game.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It's awesome easy to use and I can look up anything. It was easy to upload and use for someone like me.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game for when it sitting around board. Sights are every forgiving especially with the ducks.<br />Love it . Need another like it.
B001IFZL50|5.0|Wow!  Why didn't this get a second season?  From the makers of the Wire, this is amazing!  I am not the reviewer who will tell the story of a movie and kill it for everyone, I am the guy who will pimp a good show. So, if you are looking for an action pact show, where soldiers go to war and kill everything they see, doing heroic deeds and kicking butt, this isn't actually what you will get.  In fact this series has the opposite effect, taking the glory of war out of people's minds and showing the gritty, bureaucratic mess it can actually be.  Showing from the eyes of a well trained, overly qualified, special unit in the Marines who are sent out on missions that are not what they trained for because of the egos of their higher ranking officers.  This shows the horrors of war, how the people on the ground see things different from those who give the orders back at HQ.  If you enjoyed The Wire, you'll love this.  Like I said, this isn't an action packed show, it is a developing drama and like The Wire, it takes a bit of time to get to a point but it is all very much worth the time.
B0029VT3UQ|5.0|Almost stopped watching after the young boy and woman started their affair. But came back after getting over the shock and really got into movie. I had never heard of this movie. The actors are some of my favorites so I knew it would be good. Wow, it made me think and stayed with me for days.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I don't like this because I can't seem to get it to work for me. I am not good with app's.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|can anyone please tell me how to get past the very beginning where you enter your name? I payed for full version but unable to play. looks like a wonderful game driving me crazy...lol uninstalled and reinstaled still no luck.
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|OMG is the first thing I said when opening the box...This 10' figurine is so life like and it looks AWESOME in my walking dead collection. If anyone is thinking of maybe getting this TRUST me get it..its worth every cent.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|You gotta' listen to this guy! If you're into bluesy guitar artistry, you're gonna love what he does. He put's on a great show too.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It wont work on kindle Fire. It says it's logging in, but then it says there's an error. This needs to be fixed asap
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game.  I do like like the fact that it's linked to Facebook, however I LOVE the fact that I do not need my personal friends or family to advance.
B00FXEL00W|4.0|Very believable characters made this a very entertaining love story. Easy to read and well written, I enjoyed the story and the relatable characters.
B00280LYIM|4.0|Started out fast and interesting. The idle started to lose me a little. Just seemed like un necessary information and  I thought about reading something else. Then Riordan brought it back to his non stop fast pace story. The last couple pages make me want to start the last book.<br />  Overall I have to say I tend to lose interest after the third book as writer tend to be repetitive .  I am looking forward to starting book Five with no chance of repetitive actions. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it slowed down a bit. Who knows may be it ties in to the last book.
B0013E5HEG|3.0|Good product that will work for any table. i was smaller than what I had expected. please read the size.
0142004413|5.0|Life through the eyes of children...<br />In the same league of To Kill a Mockingbird.<br />Thoroughly entertaining and very funny.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|Things haven't changed since the time this was produced. When you look at how political correctness works in our society today, the movie becomes as relevant to our time, maybe even more relevant in our day, than it was back then. We've progressed along the collectivist path, that the author of this story was trying to depict, in some areas of our social/political relations, to the point of making this work, a scary prophecy of our possible future. I really hope I'm wrong!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a fun game, I spend a quarter of the day playing it. Other quarter, I spend watching doctor.Who. it's my favorite show.(that's where I got wibbly wobbly timey Wimey
B00CWY76CC|4.0|At times I couldn't find the item's needed to compete the task but came back the game after awhile and bingo things clicked.
B00GII9UCW|4.0|This album proves that Billie Joe would have been a rockstar in any decade... even the 50s or 60s. He has great harmony and control over his voice. The addition of Norah Jones is nice too, but I am a Greenday fan so that was the real draw. I also grew up on old music my parents listened to like the Everley Brothers so it was a good fit for me. There is nothing modern about this. The songs stay true to the style of music including morbid subject matter. It is good for an occasional listen but not necessarily one to put on the heavy repeat playlist.
B008JFURII|5.0|We had fun watching this. We had just seen Red for the second time a few days before. I am glad we ordered this.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This is not a beautiful story.  Germany & WWII is harsh and cruel.  The story is the child's connection with each person who steps into her life.  You will learn to love every character in this tale and especially the father. The detractor was the style of the telling of the story because the &#34;teller,&#34; whom you will recognize right away, broke into a thought or feeling which was annoying.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challenging, fun and a little confusing. I would reccomend to anyone who likes startegy games. cant wait for updates soon.
141694737X|4.0|Cute book but like all 'lift-the-flap' books, you have to be careful that the little ones don't rip the flap.  Other than that, I highly recommend this book.  It has a cute storyline and even though you have to monitor during reading, they love to see what is hidden under the flaps.
B00170DEM8|4.0|Fun movie. Fred Astaire is the best. The blonde who plays Bing Crosby's love interest is a fabulous dancer- very elegant. She didn't have a huge career, but was very good. If you love old movies, this classic is a must for the Holidays.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|Jason Statham makes this plot work.  The story of the real Bank Job could very well parallel this movie plot.  No matter.  The photography is very 70's.  It felt like watching an old movie, but, with modern actors.  Every little event could unravel this robbery.  Luck plays a large part here.  Even MI-5 gets trashed.  Everyone's secrets are up for exposure by the robbery.  National Security is implemented.  A simple bank job creates a tangled web of intrigue.  And, the basis for this movie plot actually happened.  Enjoy.
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|Another cat and mouse game with international conspiracies to review at present  day and thirty years back,<br />Young jack Jr works with the campus, s o m e old delta force and So in trying too unravel 30 years of MI6 NO5 googling and convolution while moving yo the brink of war!
0679809015|5.0|Great first book for little ones.  They love turning the pages and you don't have to worry about it falling apart.  Much sturdier than some other kids books.  You won't be disappointed
B00631HASU|3.0|I have the kindle fire hd.  The game does have good graphics and sound.  However, this is just another connect 3 knock off.  I did not see anything exciting and new with this game. This is still fun to play,  I would still grab this while it's the FAOTD.<br /><br />No Wi-Fi required.
B00CBKVGGY|1.0|Could not watch the movie beyond the first 5minutes, and those 5 with 3 interruptions. Internet connectivity was flawless at the time. Movie may be good, but distribution through Amazon is a disaster.
086571701X|5.0|This is the guide book to Aquaponics and the Aquaponics community. Sylvia Bernstein has done a great job with covering the subject thouroughly. Everytime I refer back to this book, I learn something new. Well worth the money.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|game is fun and entertaining I would recommend this game to anyone if you like hunting games for sure yes indeed
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Book 1 of three was not as clear as I read it but was exciting.  Book 2 was a little bit better Book three was ok.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Whet use to work great now is always broken.  Deleting an email then finding it still there.  Very laggy, sometimes will not load, and changes to the interface making things arrows to move to the next email hard to find or nonexistent.  It's like the team doesn't fix whets broken and goes out of there way to break what was working right.
1476729085|4.0|It was fun and different. I felt that the &#34;vehicle&#34; of his autism disorder was unique and sweet, and made Don the main character lovable. The vehicle also got a little stale after a while, so it's a good thing that this was a short read. You can read it in 2-3 days and just smile.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is great... another great work from G5! The graphics alone are stunning. I can't to dive into more!
B00G32TD98|5.0|Love scary movies. I am very difficult to scare. I didn't think much about this movie being very scary until I had to go into the garage by myself after seeing it and I got spooked. Good job!! Lol
0062082841|5.0|As a fan of GdT i pre-ordered this sight unseen.  What I received was beyond my expectations.  It is a page turner lavishly illustrated and with plenty of photographs.  A perfect gift for any follower of GdT or fan of the genres.
B0081ISUOG|4.0|I gave it a 4 star rating.I thought it was very easy use. I liked the various displays and you could customize to your style.

B004HWYTP4|1.0|Couldn't even watch the whole thing. Love Bruce Willis but he must of made this movie because he had a contract or something.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Love this! Emotional folk rock. I can't get enough of this group. I play this while I am in the kitchen baking.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Suspenseful; page turner - Patricia Cornwell does it again, the story line - the characters...excellent.  Hard to put down -
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Injustice is a great game. It's a lot of fun and it has mad  me like dc better than marvel. I just wish that I could sell power up cards and characters in the store. It would make  the game a lot better If I could get coin for my unused Harley qwin or sinestro power up.

B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Predictable storyline, but very funny and entertaining.  All of the actors did a very good job bringing the most out of each scene.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am a sci-first and fantasy nut and the book gave me everything I love about them, can't wait to read the second installment, Orson Scott Card was a writer beyond his time I'm glad I discovered him, next the movie : )

B00AB65SVE|5.0|Hilarious as always!  Love this show! Great extra features, fun for the whole family!  Great buy! Highly Recommend for every one!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game. Not only is it totally free, but it has multiple layers and it keeps you interested.

B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|As expected, Peter Jackson does a marvelous job!  Having not seen the theatrical release, I wonder at the bits added to this version.  The only things that stuck in my teeth, as it were, was the Goblin King singing as if this was a warped musical -- true, the goblins en masse were singing as per the book, but not with rock 'n' roll accompaniment.  This reader pictured it more of a thumbed nose-style of singing like &#34;Naah naah naah naah naah!  We caught you, dwarves!&#34;  Also, the Goblin King seemed extremely erudite and well-spoken -- again, I pictured more of a brute, like a mobster of sorts, but, alas, Peter didn't call me to ask my opinion.  The trolls were absolutely hysterical, but a bit over the top -- can't picture a troll reaching for a handkerchief in his pocket or using the epithet &#34;cakehole&#34; -- but the scene was funny.  My only other criticism would be Bombur -- his fat make-up/costume seemed a bit overdone when he would sit and he came across as too slobbish for my tastes.  Other than these three complaints, the rest of the film is magnificent and will be unparalleled anytime in the near future except by Peter, himself.  I especially appreciate how he has already woven history from the appendices into the storyline.  All in all, a delightful experience I will watch over and over, though the Fellowship film has my highest marks.  Can't wait to see what he does for the next two films!
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|The game is good, but the price is too high. If it is posted as free it should be totally free.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is so fun! I love how all the pieces are in that little tray although it does make it a little difficult to see if the piece goes in that spot or not... the game is really fun though
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|Great movie, had only seen it once and decided just to buy it.so I can watch it over and over.

B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I've always loved the Piano Guys, but this CD was even more amazing than I expected. I don't know how they are able to put so much feeling into their music. The songs on this CD are some of the most spiritual, uplifting, and beautiful Christmas songs I've ever heard. I absolutely love it and am so grateful to people like them who share their amazing talents so that others can be blessed by them. I'm so glad I bought this!<br /><br />(I haven't watched the DVD yet. I really just bought this version because it was the same price as the CD alone so I figured I might as well buy both.)

B006OZKX02|1.0|The Bluray will not play because of different region code. In response to G-Diddy...not everyone knows what bbfc stands for nor do they know to even look for that, hence we live in AMERICA.

With all that said, I will now know to look for this symbol on my future Bluray purchases.
B00G5G7K7O|5.0|I took two out of my three daughters to watch this movie. (my 3rd daughter is 1) All 3 of us left the movies talking about this frozen for hours! I even downloaded the theme song let it go on iTunes before i made it home! Its refreshing to see a disney movie based on true love between sisters. The movie is about two sisters who are love each other so much they would do anything to protect each other. Its great to not only see a female hero but to see she's the sister. Fantastic role model characters and examples for my girls. This movie is great for all ages, but i would highly recommend it to parents who have multiple little girls. (My family has nothing but girls) Im a mom of 3 girls and this movie hit home for us. I can't wait until it comes out so my toddler can see it. My 8 yr old is already begging to see it again and has frozen on her xmas list. Now i know why all the Elsa and Anna toys are selling out!<br /><br />Ps the snowman is hilarious in this movie!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It's only ok because of the boring sex scenes.  They go on and on in a most unrealistic way and are so repetitious is gets boring.  It could have been a good book had the author had more imagination but she just didn't grab me with this one.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It was a great read but I thought the ending with the nasty son socializing with the African American family was not realistic, he was so mean and hateful and the mother and daughter so nice and honest.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|May be the best kept secret of Beatles recordings.  Live music is the only way to go, as it happens.
B007SGM084|5.0|Amazingly enough I completely enjoyed reading this. To see Christian go from a cold/hard hearted person, to the man he eventually becomes. Yes he's damaged but that doesn't mean broken
159184617X|5.0|The book ties together several interesting (and some unknown) parts of Ive’s upbringing, education, and design philosophies. The book also provides some tales into Ive’s interactions with other Apple executives, work with Steve Jobs, and design techniques for the original iOS Devices like the iPhone and iPad. During some parts of the book, you may feel like you were actually in the room when decisions were made.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book is a good book.I liked how eveyday was labled and day is very different.This is a book who deserves superior ratings.<br />(Reviewed by a kid)
B00C9G22R2|5.0|Some reviewers on here talk so much with too many in depth details they sound way to arrogant with their reviews.Why not just watch this really great movie and judge for yourself  Bottom line here is this movie is a beautifully directed and amazingly photographed movie. Although this story has been done in two other films so far starring Donnie Yen this movie does ad a separate story line not dealt with in Ip man 1 and Ip Man 2. I own over 600 martial Arts dvds, I consider myself knowledgeable of many movies of this sort. The action is stunning, the fights are very well styled and choreographed as well. If you liked Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon and they way the story unfolded and the way the images were shot then you will enjoy this beautiful movie.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I have spent the last 5 years on my personal quest for knowledge about nutrition and the policies of our government regarding our food freedom. I have never seen so much good advice condensed in to one place. I felt the author did a good job of making some complicated scientific ideas accessible, and it's so refreshing to find something that was truly written for the good of all people, and not just for profit. This book will put the power of people's health and wellbeing back in to their own hands and out of the hands of the greedy and corrupt government and mega-corporations.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love the Piano Guys.  It was everything I expected it to be but in a Christmas Album.  It puts you in a Christmas mood and spirit.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The only part that kind of stinks is the lack of storage and the amount of time it takes you to build up the storage allowance-unless you spend crowns.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|I have two son's ages two and five and we all had such fun reading this interactive book. I cannot wait to purchase more like this. It is worth every penny. The graphics were impressive , the story line was entertaining...Wow how things changed from reading when I was a child!
B00DE76PM8|4.0|Just what I needed in Santiago, Chile. Patagonia seems harder to manipulate, but that. may be due to the rugged area.  Zooming in makes it difficult to figure out what you're looking at. But everything needs tweeking from time to time.  Very helpful and free. Thanks!!!
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|excellent movie. right up there with good fellas and the godfather. everyone does a good job. you'll enjoy watching this over and over again. nice story plot. nicely done.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Hilarious made me laugh out loud and its a good book to read for any age u should read it 2book
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|The graphics are great and the game play is for the most part smooth I play this game slot more than I thought I would.
B002ZM74Y6|4.0|Lot of great acting by some big, and not so big, names.  If a viewer doesn't mind a lot of harsh language -- which the movie paints as typical of the wise guys -- it's a very good movie.
0790729709|5.0|My daughter the 5 year old fanatic loves this movie lol so i decided to get her very own. Happy!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is a lot of fun when it works! I find that the app is very slow at times and makes the game not work right!
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|Every time i try to buy a gun it says &quot; Transaction Failed! &quot; and there is to many hackers in this game i cant even get any kills.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked this book.  In its weirdness, you find truth about relationships and how your choice of who to love is not always ideal. \\"The cool girl\\" euphemism, was so comical, but so true. READ IT!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|really enjoyed getting caught up on the season....love this series; with all the death it's really all about life being worthwhile or not!
B008XG1X18|5.0|What's not to like beautiful pictures and glorious scenery great ideas to do now or someday down the road Thanks
B000I0QL82|3.0|This movie has always aggravated me.  Basically, it's a film about rivalry, Bing and Fred scheming to get the girl(s) to the point that it really doesn't matter who ends up with whom as no one's motives are pure.  Bing is jilted by a shared partner (Virginia Dale) in a dance routine with Fred.  The romance involved is a figment of Bing's imagining.  As a replacement of sorts, Bing comes across an ambitious singer/dancer (Marjorie Reynolds) and hires her part-time at his club Holiday Inn.  Fred gets dumped then drunk and ends up at Holiday Inn where he and his agent (Walter Abel) conspire to relieve Bing of his discovery AND takeover the Inn for their own purposes.  They are not satisfied until they have everything, Bing's music, the girl, and the idea of the Inn for a movie, leaving Bing with nothing.  How they got a romance out of this tangled web of deceit is anyone's guess.  I watch this film every Christmas and every Christmas I come away feeling sorry for Bing and hating Fred.  But I do love the music.  And as a singer, Fred makes a decent hoofer.<br /><br />Shot in glorious black and white with a few amusing moments and not a little frustration from an overly plotted plot.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Haven't read Grisham in a while, but this was worth the wait.<br /><br />I look forward to the next Grisham book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love Facebook the pictures etc and my friends comments etc also I never know what's going to come my way and I like that thanks Facebook
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|It is a good game, and me being a long time fan of this game I was really starting to get mad at the co-opp mode it was saying we lost when no bloons passed my defense's but it showed they passed my friends, the first time, no biggie the second, third, and so on, I started to get mad. Good game but could improve on the co-opp mode.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Because it stretched my mind further than heretofore. The idea that I am creating my world when I am conscious is very compelling, the idea that the same world disappears when I am not conscious is difficult.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|These were a gift for my son who was deployed in the army and hadn't seen them.  He and his wife have totally enjoyed them!
B00G32OER4|5.0|I was skeptical, but really surprised. It's the best movie I've seen in quite some time. It kept me on the edge of my seat.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Thanks for the distraction, and the very discriptivness of a Love Affair only to be found in the written pages of your trilogy. Kind of scared of the movie, could never be a s good as the book's, and how I imagine Ana and Christian. Thanks for writing ......untill next time. I would recommend this book to anyone over 18!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|this is a good fun game for your kids it gets them something to do I like it ill play it every once in a while
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|Very disappointing. Nothing witty or clever in this movie, just a lot of cheap jokes that might make a kid laugh but will have adults rolling their eyes. Pixar this is not. That being said, the character and set designs were cute.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|It is so clever and unique, I wasn't familiar at all with the storyline. What a great concept!!! Halloween meets Christmas, and things don't go as planned for the pumpkin king. The animation is great!!! It's almost like a musical.  &#34; What's this, what's this.....&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this app is so great I love it I am so addicted to it. I love it I wish that it was
B009P5S11G|5.0|I am totally in love with this CD. I have known of Rihanna for years, but hadn't heard her music. I will order more of her work.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoy playing solitaire, and this lets me cycle through the stack as many times as I want on single draw, unlike the Windows 7 version. That was a big positive for me. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.
B00DVZ414C|5.0|The lyrical respite is both refreshing and energizing. The folk sound was thriving in my childhood and it is great to hear, again.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|Fantastic story!!! It's a must read for sure!  I couldn't put the book down, I read it straight through.  I want a sequel so bad!
B006OAB2XO|5.0|Ethereal, tribal, echoes, dreams, haunting, centered, bio-feedback, rocking, dark. Reminds me of Cocteau Twins sometimes. Reminds me of industrial gothic, bubble pop, being weird, being true to self.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wonderful for teen to adult. Once you start you can't put it down. I read straight thru all three books.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the movie.  This is the second DVD I ordered -- this one was for showing at my place of work.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|The people seem like real people you could like and care about.  The stories are pure fantasy but have elements of real science that make them at least possible if not probable.  Just a fun show to watch.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|The game is fun but the only time I play it is when I am waiting for legs on candy crush.  It would be a little better if it changed up like the other games but I do like that the lives refill quicker.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|I'm happy to have all 8 movies for a great price. However, I've only watched the first two discs and each of them has a spot where the DVD consistently pauses just for a second. I'm thinking I should return it. Did anybody else have this problem?<br /><br />My DVD of The Hobbit did this when I bought it too. I traded it for a different one, and it still did it. Are DVD's getting more carelessly produced or is it just me?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderful book, nice ending!! Glad Christian got his heart in the right place! Thanks for a great story!  Waiting for the next one!!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I feel it just doesn't have enough effort in it. I mean there's nothing bad about it I just think there can be a little bit more added.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite games to play,  it's a challenge every time. The developer made the game play quick and fun. I would recommend it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hands down the best anime/cartoon movie of all time! The story, the plot, the characters, the score, the dialogue, the everything! Words cannot express how much I love this movie and this review will do it no justice. This is a movie you need to see as it is truly an original movie and truly a marvelous movie. I love it and I couldn't help but see this movie and get it, especially when it was on sale. This move is so amazing and it captures one's spirit.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter for me is access to a genre of people of my choice,in my case the music industry.As they say get it from the horses mouth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is my favorite game in the world! The only problem is the loading. It takes forever. Please fix!!
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I truly enjoyed Return to Oz.  I have read all 15 OZ books written, .  To fully appreciate this Return to OZ you must be familiar with all the Oz books.  to know who Tick-Tock, The Wheelers, and all the other characters NOT in the traditional Wizard of OZ movie with Judy Garland.  I was looking forward to more characters like Button Bright, and the Shaggy Man, but then it would have been a longer movie. .  Some say the movie was &#34;dark&#34;, but knowing the books the lands that Dorothy visited were in turmoil against OZ and it didn't seem dark, just more information about the other lands. If the Return to Oz was marketed as  a look describing other parts of OZ with new characters and more story, it could have been the first in many new movies about Oz.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|This book had me at hello. I was totally absorbed into the characters and their stories. Could wait to read the next in the series the minute I finished this book.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|A real life description of how chefs, and all restaurant cooking members behave.  Wants you to really think about eating out.  Even if a small part of the experiences were accurate, drugs, alcohol, physical abuse, name calling, etc. still unbelievable.<br /><br />The description of how Anthony Bourdain became interested in food and cooking is very interesting. A page turner to find out what the next kitchen would have as examples
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Great story with three dimensional characters and individual back stories. I read it in a couple of days. couldn't put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first, thought it was too easy, whoa was I in for a surprise. Very challenging indeed. A must have game.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Absolutely hilarious. Allie Brosh has created another extraordinary blend of humor and seriousness, and never once losing my attention ever.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Cute, but hard to read in texting format. Story was good, but it was easy to put down. Not a page turner.
B00BATG18K|1.0|Amy Tan wrote one of my favorite books of all time - &#34;Joy Luck Club&#34;. I've read everything she's written, and found those books to be satisfying reads. So I eagerly looked forward to &#34;The Valley of Amazement&#34;.  What a let down! The mother /daughter female leads were annoying, the sexual details filled too many pages, and the denouement was completely unfulfilling. These women tried to manipulate the men they loved, failed, and stubbornly chose to repeat the same mistakes over and over. The misery resulting from their choices made me want to shout at them &#34;What did you expect, you pig headed woman?&#34;  There were some well written supporting characters, but the story was depressing. Sorry I bought this one.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I've only just discovered Gaiman, and I'm 2 for 2 -5 stars about him.<br />The story reveals an accessible and easily digestible feel-good fantasy realm you wish you could read more about. Gaiman uses several names e.g Hempstock from other books, and I wonder if this is the same magical realm referenced in other stories. Looking forward to reading more of his work!
B0026977EK|3.0|I expect a funnier film but I guess you never know with woody allen<br />I'm not a fan but i love some Of his work<br />Like midnight in París
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was wonderful to revisit these memorable characters and Ford County Mississippi. This was a wonderful addition to his list of great novels.
1452110581|5.0|I LOVE this book. I LOL at every poem. If you love (and at times, want to strangle) your cats, you will love this book. My favorite is about the gift in your bed. Just read it.
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|I was afraid of purchasing this collection (The White Box) during Cyber Monday because of the past reviews about faulty DVDs, etc. Well, my collection of discs were perfect and there wasn't any problem at all.<br /><br />Something important to notice is that I'm talking about the new White Box released in 2013  and not the Red one (2006). That Red Box had some problems according to the reviews posted some years ago. Sadly, The White Box's amazon page appears as a New Item of the Red Box DVDs and this has made that comments and reviews are mixed in the White Box product page. So pay attention to the details if you want to get the right product here.<br /><br />The White Box contains 10 separate boxes for every season with 4 discs per season. There's no a 60-page booklet at all as the previous release and this collection doesn't include the 2 music CD's with the soundtrack. However, the price is worth it for remembering good times. By the way, all episodes are presented in full-screen format and the quality is acceptable taking into consideration that this tv show was produced a long time ago. If you want high quality,however, think about purchasing the Blue-Ray collection.
B005VPRDAY|3.0|This box was chosen for a five year old girl whose name I found on a Christmas tree. I am disappointed that I see no wheels listed as contents. Also I was expecting at least one toy person from the write up. But Legos are always a reliable toy.
0891419063|5.0|if you saw the movie pacific, then this book is worth reading. it fills in about sledgehammer, where the mini series left off.
1400032717|5.0|The narrator of this story has autism (more likely Asperger's Syndrome) and his view of the world is fascinating.  There is nothing to tell us that this is the way children with autism actually comprehend the world, but as the parent of a non-verbal child with autism, it was like an insight into our son's feelings, and I didn't want to book to ever end.  I don't think, though, that having or knowing an autistic child is a prerequisite to loving this book.
B00CWV8X04|3.0|Kind of like a Mamet thriller, minus the psychological depth, and featuring some disappointingly retrograde sexual politics, &#34;Side Effects&#34; doesn't rate with &#34;The Informant!,&#34; &#34;Ocean's Eleven,&#34; or even &#34;Bubble.&#34; Handsome photography, put to little use.
B00005R23Z|5.0|.<br /><br />Possible spoilers<br /><br />I give no apologies for this review, it is completely biased one, first things first, and this review is about the `superbit' circ 1998. If this review is found next to another format version, please ignore.<br /><br />A genetically inferior man assumes the identity of an enhanced genetically tweaked superior individual in order to pursue his ultimate dream of space travel; by doing this, he has committed the “crime” of using a “borrowed ladder” – by using the genetic profile of another person. Gattaca is in many ways is one the best films seen. Just as people have been judged for centuries by the colour of their skin, their class or religious persuasion Gattaca predicts and explores the future where there will be a more subtle discrimination. It being a science fiction film helps make it more effective by allowing us to feel the emotions of the characters with little of our own history getting in the way. A haunting musical score goes well with the feeling of the film, with stunning visual backdrops and the very clear use of tinted lenses makes each scene vibrant eye candy.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke as Vincent does a sterling job of displaying how the odds are stacked against from his very inception! This is someone whose life is limited before he even tries. However, just as fascinating were the theoretically superior characters; Vincent's girlfriend, brother and his genetic original who suffer from the lie that genetics can perfectly predict a person's life.<br /><br />This disc plays well on a number of first generation DVD players. The colours are solid the sound is excellent; please note I did not try out the various sound enhanced systems, i.e. 5.1 Dolby, as I do not have this equipment. That said, the Superbit DVD was played on HD DVD player, and HD Flat screen TV. The experience is mind-blowing; I cannot see the difference between picture quality on this DVD and some of the newer HD DVD releases. OK HD DVD is a defunct format, but it shows that up scaling this DVD gives it 'Angelic wings'. Is it worth buying? The answer is yes. This Superbit​ DVD makes a fantastic film, even more mind blowing.<br /><br />Some years ago at a film event, I asked Ernest Borgnine, who played the janitor in the film, what he thought of GATTACA. In a rather dismissive way, he said he did not get it. Well that is his flawed genome. If you would like to see a sci-fi film that is based on curious characters and thought provoking circumstances - and not explosions, try Gattaca.

0143144766|5.0|This review pertains to the audiobook, read by Ron McLarty.<br /><br />The audiobook of Pynchon's &#34;Inherent Vice&#34; may be the best road trip aid yet devised. Maybe it's that highway driving is a sort of drug trip, and thus serves as a gateway into the mind of permanently stoned PI Doc Sportello. Maybe it's the way Ron McLarty's rough and ready voice navigates the range between Jade's massage parlor coos, Bigfoot Bjornson's V8 rumble, and several rousingly sung anthems of surf, cars and Vietnam. Or maybe it's that the covering of many hundreds of miles clues the listener in to Pynchon's essential road-ness: the comic names that go flashing by, the repetitions of cultural markers, like truck stops on the Interstate, the diverting conspiracies, never fully resolved, that branch like byways from the novel's neo-Noir blacktop heart. Whatever it is, this is a great way to lean back in your seat, reach out with your awareness, and let your cares drop away in the rear-view mirror.
1856868079|5.0|In short Yes it is worth it. The audio CDs are well presented and the narration is very good. The voice and dialogue for jinn are very well done. Some people will think that the central Character is less than perfect. But think - this makes the story, well thats my feel. The price tag is not too bad, if you wish to buy to hear more than once. If not try to get it from the Library, it is worth it.
B002GHHJU4|5.0|Great music from a movie that is better than I expected. This movie has a great blend of Music and the movie itself is much better than the critics rated it.
B00005EAYR|5.0|I' ve owned this recording since it was released here in the US.  It has given me countless hours of enjoyment and I think the interpretation magnificent.  I did read the critical reviews and couldn't agree less with their opinions...but then just like me they are entitled.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very good story, not afraid to be real in sorrow. A different. Perspective on these tragic times. I've read it twice in a month
B00CATSONE|5.0|Very well written. I  learned that genius/high IQ doesn't mean an easier more wealthy life automatically. Hard work,dedication to the point of obsession, is how you make it,and even then you have to be in the right place at the right time. Tesla was a fascinating person.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Best version of this album; you can hear things better and somehow Ezrin adds some balls to his production. The Ace outtake solo from Sweet Pain is interesting (though you can see why Ezrin wasn't satisfied with it)  and the original artwork cover is gorgeous. The 12&#34; lp version lets you see the artwork much better.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Excellent. Gripping. I would have given it five but there was one horrific scene that I didn't think needed to be shown in such graphic detail. Zombie killing is one thing, but human killing should be shown a little less graphic. Just my opinion. Overall... love the show and the unpredictability. This show is the most unpredictable show I've ever watched.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very interesting with a lot of good details about the events and political climate of the time. It increased my appreciation for the life of Jesus. I especially liked the discussion of his brother James who was honored by friends and enemies of the cause of Christ.
B0041KKYCY|2.0|Stupid. A big waste of money. the only reason I give it two stars was because of the inventive ways she killed the men. wouldn't really recommend this movie for anyone though.
B008K8U13K|5.0|I got this game on my kindle fire hd, to keep him occupied. It worked, so I assume the game must be pretty good.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Second best show on TV after Suits.  The best acting on TV hands down.  Just watch the transformation of characters between seasons.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|I had to watch this for a wonderful film class. So glad I was introduced to this movie. One of my favorites!
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I enjoyed this game. Had no issues with game play on my Kindle Fire HD. It wasn't your typical HO game and the storyline kept me interested throughout the whole game. Yes it is a bit pricey but seemed like I got my monies worth. No complaints.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Such a great classic game.  Great time waster and easily addictive.  Only flaw is there is no Exit button to close out the game.  Other than that, it's great.  I love all my Brainium games.  They are built with quality and no adware/spyware.
0385366450|5.0|The book is a thrill seeker. It really help my attention. I have listened to parts several times. The voices are also wonderful. Brings the book to life.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|great movie! it was sad to see the series end but the movie was definitely worth watching! it has the typical multiple level story line but it is pretty great movie
B000NTPDSW|4.0|This is a very good movie on Blu-ray and it was fun watching that movie with my friends, and family.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A great game Fun for all ages Fun for older kids too Good for little kids Really fun . Fun for girls and boys
B007G92QGO|5.0|This is an outstanding , realistic and brutally honest look at deviant behaviour in a refreshingly understated manner . The ending is breath taking - bound to imprint itself on your memory for some time .
B00GSZEBE2|5.0|I would definitely rate this 5 stars you get to make YOUR OWN death star! As the name says It you start with a tiny death star but soon you will wonder tiny? :) it grows to be a thousand levels tall remember, money is important do not spend it if you do not have to! ;)
B00EF1PM2G|3.0|Fairly typical teen/travel movie - along the lines of National Lampoon.  After waiting years for a Blu-Ray to come out, it seems to only be available in it's rated R, theatrical incarnation.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's fun. Some of the levels are outrageously hard and I'd get stuck for several days but in the end I'd make it to the next level. I love that I can ask other friends via Facebook who play too, for lives so I don't have to purchase any. The only downfall I have is that it occasionally will not upload to Facebook. Right now I can't venture on because it can't access Facebook and I need someone to give me something.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|These young people make those old Christmas standards come alive again. Look forward to hearing more from this refreshing group..
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|If you have seen the movie Dispicable me, and love the little minions, this game might be perfect for you!If you enjoy temple run, this is a little different but a little bit the same.I love this game and I hope you do too.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Nice thing about this is that you can compare something like 5 translations including a literal Greek translation interlinear of the bible as you read the Bible.  You can get a clearer understanding of any particular verse as you go through the Bible.  My favorite example being:<br /><br />King James Version Philippians 1:8 - &#34;For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.&#34;  Huh?  We are in the bowels of Christ???<br />New World Translation - Philippians 1:8 - For God is my witness of how I am longing for all of you with such tender affection as Christ Jesus has.&#34;<br /><br />Helps you understand the literal translation vs what meaning the writer was trying to convey.  I use this a lot!  Highly recommended.  It's also VERY easy to use. . . and it's free.  You can't beat that.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is a amazing game. Its good for all kids and even some adults. If you love to style hair this app is for you. You can take a picture,curl the hair and lots more. I recommend this app
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has done it again!  Sycamore Row is an excellent read. I couldn't put it down!  A perfect story of a mysterious, caring man.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Take my opinion this is the best app for sharing your pics &amp; it is just like instagram but you can't post videos!!!!
B00F2362IE|5.0|very cool game and very addictive :)  Not much to say besides the fact that is does not have apps if you pay for it.  thanks
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|From beginning to end the story draws you along, holding you captive, till finally you uncover the mystery.  Another success.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|very cool game and very addictive :)  Not much to say besides the fact that is does not have apps if you pay for it.  thanks
0061950726|1.0|Unfortunately did not like this book, what may have made is much better were a similar story that focused on the orphan trains that went to Maine or New England and take the story from there, rather than the midwest. The book did not capture the essence of Maine.<br /><br />The whole part of Molly being on probation and threatened with &#34;juvenile hall&#34; was too much of a stretch as no such facility exists in Maine.<br /><br />Could have been a much better story, but it was not.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|very cool game and very addictive :)  Not much to say besides the fact that is does not have apps if you pay for it.  thanks
0345545338|5.0|Great read, forget how much I really enjoy Grisham.. he is at his best in this book.<br /><br />I devoured this book..
B0055SWM08|5.0|very cool game and very chalenging :)  Not much to say besides the fact that is does not have apps if you pay for it.  thanks
B00EUUJID6|2.0|I was hoping this would be in Italian. Very disappointed that all the Christmas songs with the exception of maybe 2 were in English. I listen to these beautiful voices to hear them sing in Italian, not American. This was a huge disappointment.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|This is a materpiece with profundity and also high entertainment value. Recommended for everyone with even a passing interest for graphic novels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. It is challenging and fun to play. It is also pretty to look at.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A little slow to start but a complete page turner after that  many nights very late when I put it down.LOL
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|I love the Ryan characters and always the storyline. Jack Jr is becoming one of my favorite characters and I hope the stories keep evolving. I also hope that Mr. Greaney is part of this future. Mr. Clancy will be greatly missed but his legacy will be always be remembered.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I chose this rating cause I liked it and im disappointed cause I didn't get the code to transfer it to my computer
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I didn't like the book at all and especially the characters. I realize Theo had no one capable of proving<br />The support he needed, but stealing and hiding the painting when he knew it was wrong, made me not<br />Like him at all and only increased as the story moves forward. Drugs and violence,and all the other<br />Unfortunate deaths, isn't what one wants to read about for recreation. Worst book ever!
B00742GBDM|5.0|great acting, pure entertainment, delightful plot, engaging, easy to access, happy to watch it, wonderful, might watch it again, lovely
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|The author was down right blasphemous in her comments pertaining to God. For instance referring to him as &#34;some dude who gets his jollies from playing hide and seek.&#34; She made this reference in regard to faith being something we're taught to believe in in spite of not seeing....
B008602KQI|5.0|beyond my expectation with a good versus evil theme, the heroine wins of course but can't wait to watch the next  Hunger Games
B005K17RU0|4.0|Has the info I need when I need it..easy,fast and to the point<br /> Would like an on screen display for temp in the corner
B005PK553C|4.0|WOW, what great acting ! Everyone is so convincing , I really believe they are real people!<br />The ghost 'thing' is a bit far out, but it works after one ' gets it'.<br />I want to see season two, but it's not playing for me, no little arrows to click on?
B0057J72OG|4.0|Vinyl record sounds great. Sounds richer than the radio. Still digital though. I've listened to it several times and it's growing on me. I skip the &#34;coy&#34; song and the &#34;without you&#34; song. How hard is it to enunciate while singing slow lyrics? Say &#34;Without you,&#34; not &#34;Withou Choo.&#34; 1st track is the best. Sounds full and bassy on vinyl. All the techno sounds of I just wanna F come together very well. Lots of rhythm and lyrics in a small space. 2nd disc is like a freebie. You don't hear it on the radio and it's awesome. I hope David Guetta releases more vinyl. Reminds me a bit of the Black Eyed Peas double album The Beginning and Far East Movement.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Just like the LotR extended versions, this one was a good buy. I love the extended scene in Rivendell. I love the song the Goblin King sang too. Just overall loved it
B00DOPEGAS|3.0|In general the product was ok. However, the needle was so soft that it created pressure on my fingers. To prevent the needle from bending and breaking, I needed to use extra strength to keep the needle straight. I loved rubber band projects but could not work on them for too long. Meanwhile, the fact that the base was not adjustable really limited the type of projects I could do. By the way, the instruction was also very confusing. I ended up visiting youtube for demonstration.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This game is so much fun! My daughter and her friends love it. I have even played it a few times!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the most beautiful set of videos made of the Earth that I have ever seen. It is simply spectacular.
1250038820|5.0|Followed Brandon and his photos on Facebook for a long time, and they always make my day. I am so glad he gathered some of them into this book---and can't wait for him to publish a SECOND book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Interactive and keeps you interested. Once you grasp how to jump and move the game is a lot of fun.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Adults will definitely enjoy it!  Didn't see the first movie and wasn't aware of the great reviews for this one. Strongly recommend watching it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Although not as great as \\"A Time To Kill\\" it was great to see how Jake is doing.  I enjoyed the book,
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Fantastic book. Amazed by the grit, guts and determination required to become a Navy Seal. The reason for a 4 was just the extremely slow beginning. Great insight into what troops face in Afghanistan. What hero's these 4 were and are.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought it was a little glitchy but it is so cute!!! I love  the level when you go through the residential area!!! I love when you go through the houses and swim in the pool!!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|It' was the best!!! Josh Groban has a beautiful voice he is truly blessed.  I think this was his best CD every song was great.  It touches your heart!!
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I picked it up as free app of the day, a and my expectations were low. I've been pleasantly surprised by the quality and the detail of the game. It's satisfyingly difficult and engaging. I'm very happy with my purchase. Thanks for a high quality app!
B008RVAAPE|5.0|Ken Follett is a masterful story-teller and he picks up the story of Kingsbridge and the cathedral two hundred years later. Like Pillars of the Earth, the characters are as riveting and real and one grows to love them. Full of history with the king and the church vying for control, this story includes the ravages of the plague and how the town handled it. When one puts this very long book down finally one is sad to be done with this slice of English history, and very much aware of how the past has led us to today. More please, Mr Follett!
1616551631|5.0|The book is gorgeous and has lots of neat bits of information about the game. The amount of detail in all of the concept art is amazing. For a hardcover book full of all color pictures this is a great price. Always a pleasure to look through.
B00F87ZUYG|2.0|This season is a big disappointment.  Not nearly good as prior seasons.  Episodes seem like story lines are poorly constructed , lack  the ability to make viewer seem like they are part of the group.. (shallow & hurried)<br />I'm hoping it gets better..
B00F1W1S1M|5.0|The best concert footage dream theater has put out. The sound is clear although some better mixing might be desired.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Works well in an older car which has no auxiliary input.  Gear shift in console makes it inconvenient but still useable
B00280LYIC|5.0|its absolutely amazing<br />i am in the love with the perys character&#60;3<br />i love his witty humor<br />annabeth kicks butt
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I started out thinking the book was ok, but the more I read, the better I liked it.  It tells of a family ( and a few friends) who live<br />in constant danger in war- torn Germany.  There is an ever-prevent danger of being arrested for the slightest suspicion<br />of disloyalty to Hitler and any of his doctrines.  No one can be trusted to keep a secret.  Into this comes a young girl with<br />a love for books, a refugee who is Jewish and in hiding, and the girl's introduction into the dangers and heartaches of<br />growing up in a neighborhood that is rife with fear, death and suffering.  This story is suspenseful, touching, and informative.
159184617X|5.0|I love this book because it gives me an inside idea of what Jony Ive does when it comes to design..
B0055SWM08|3.0|Super annoying music.....<br />took me a few times to understand the concept ....<br />But I. Still don't get what the jewel collecting is supposed to accomplish!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This is nothing like Ender'sGame. High tension drama. I enjoyed the development of the characters and the slow build up of the plot. This is a great read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so much fun. This app is great for kids. I am doing this review and I am only 7!
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|I adored this movie!!! I will forever be appreciative of the fact that Disney finally acknowledged that the first guy you meet and relate to may NOT be your &#34;true love&#34;. What a concept! As a mother I also appreciated how the bonds of family saved the girls, and not true love's first kiss. I was becoming a little weary of the film during our viewing, because there is an excessive amount of singing hahaha, however, the end of the movie made it all worth while and was brilliantly redeeming. For once, the love of family, was the thing that saved the day, and not some mystery guy that magically solves all your problems. This movie brims with legitimate life lessons that I want my daughter to be aware of throughout her life. It will become a staple movie in our home. Wonderful and I would highly recommend it, excessive singing or not. hahah
B00632HWOG|4.0|This app works much better than the original Yahoo Mail, which continues to get worse with its &#34;improvements&#34;!! Wish they would use this to fix it!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is so much fun that I gave up playing all my slot games. The only issue I have is that it is too hard to get crowns. They should give more crowns when you do the tasks they have you do. Other than that I would recommend this app to everyone who likes these kind of games!
052118939X|5.0|This book was meant for those who are improving their knowledge and proficiency in English as a Foreign Language. In this book you move from simple explanations to a bit more, although good enough, complicated exercises and definitions.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Once again, this is my most favorite book that I could not put down! I wish it never ended! VERONICA ROTH is my favorite author with a tremendous series! I adore her books! I am, and will always be the #1 best fan for the Divergent Series! I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THESE BOOKS!!!!!!!!
0521675804|5.0|A great book for those who are getting involve with English as a Foreign Language for the first time. Very clear and basic explanations, simple to follow and great exercises as well. Works very good for regular students and self-students too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|oh my god. i love this app so much and i can't believe i waited this long to finally buy it. but i hate when it tells you that you're out of lives. :(
B00594XOZU|3.0|Kik works fine on Kindle Fire and my phone but the two don't sync. If using on one it boots you out of the other. Plus you lose your conversations on both. Too bad.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love to play this game. It seems so realistick with lots of different regions. I like to play this game every spare minute I have.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|no frills cleans fast and efficient what else could you ask for or want<br />app manager is my favorote tool
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|He did it again.  Grisham on Birgance.  Took it down to the wire.Loved it.  Hope it\\"s not the last of Jake.
B00F91H15W|1.0|This movie was an utter waste of my time-- it was like watching an extremely long music video. I usually enjoy Sofia Coppola's films but the appeal of this one utterly escaped me.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I Was Really Sad in the end here , I knew Tris would Sacrifice herself for her Brother and Survive<br />The Death serum. I almost thought she could survive a bullet and live Happily ever after with Tobias. What a reality check not all things in life go as we plan. Great Books!! Loved them all! Could not put them down.
B0063M22QO|4.0|easy and relaxing. allows mistakes .... always a good thing. will play this forever.  have been a fan of this game for a long time, will keep it a favorite!
0316228583|3.0|For literary merit, it was top-notch, with especially interesting character development. However, there was a dark, almost cynical approach toward humanity, even the least fortunate.  The book was too raw and edgy, perhaps, for my taste--prefer to view humankind in a kinder, gentler way!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|The finest game with out of move you loose. I have enjoyed so much I have not stopped!!! If you don't enjoy this game then find a faster one because it is not a fast paced game.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Is an excellent tool.<br />Awesome'.....'............<br />Easy to use and understand.<br />Great tool for the entire family. For all ages. Good advice for entire family.
B004T32SOK|5.0|Great app to store and use doc's and pictures across all your devices.  I have used Box and Dropbox and they are about the same to me.
B001EC2IT4|5.0|A favorite movie that was easily viewed through Amazon.  No problems with video or audio - or streaming.  Enjoyed seeing it once again.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Great app to store and use doc's and pictures across all your devices.  I have used Box and Dropbox and they are about the same to me.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Let me add my voice to the chorus of accolades given to this album.  I've been a Stryper fan since 1984 when I picked up Soldiers Under Command (anyone remember the red on white letters and Enigma logo on the side of their cassette?).  One of the highlights of my high school years was seeing them live on the In God We Trust tour. This album is the album that should have followed In God We Trust but couldn't.  Most agree that musically the wheels started leaving the Stryper cart starting with Against the Law and never really got re-attached.  I did enjoy some of Michael's solo work, and the reboot starting with Reborn was a step in the right direction.  But they never really circled back to pick up that golden sound - the melodies, the arrangements, the hooks, the production - that went on hiatus after IGWT.  That is, until now.<br /><br />Not only does No More Hell to Pay put the wheels back on the cart, they come with significant improvements.  Just about everything on the album is better than on previous albums.  The lyrics have matured and reflect the perspective of someone who experience a lot more of life than the four guys fresh out of Orange County.  Michael's vocals are more precise and smooth and strong (and OMG the man can still scream a chorus out thirty years after he started!).  The guitar work is simply the best they've done to date.  The production is reminiscent of Stephan Galfas' and Michael Lloyd's efforts, and, in some ways, is even better.  If someone told me Mutt Lange had a hand in producing one or two of the tracks I would not be a bit surprised.  To put it in context, the jump from their prior albums to this one is more significant than the jump from Soldiers Under Command to To Hell With the Devil.<br /><br />In short, No More Hell to Pay continues the sonic arc traced in their first four albums, and it is the obvious successor to those.  Even more, it exceeds their prior efforts in both quality and variety.  It reflects the 20-some years the individual members spent honing their craft, and the songs they've produced are nothing short of their best to date.  Well done, gentlemen.  Well done.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Very useful and user friendly app.  Not complicated.  I make quick notes all the time of things I need to remember.  I used to forget things and have to return to the store.  I would even make list and then forget them or loose them.  Now it's always with me.  I try to never make notes on little slips of paper any more!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|This is the second YA contemporary romance I've read from Rainbow Rowell...and she's now going on my insta-buy list.<br /><br />Here in Fangirl, with Cather, a prolific writer of Simon Snow (Harry Potter gets referenced in the book, but Simon Snow's a rather obvious similar literary character) fan fiction who is off to college for the first time-- away from her manic father and separated from her twin sister--we got another realistic portrayal of a socially designated &#34;nerd&#34; owing her nerdiness in a positive way. It's wincingly accurate about Cather's anxieties.<br /><br />She takes refuge in her fanfic writing, but a rough-and-lovely room mate, her room mate's boyfriend, and college life won't let her stay in her cocoon for long.<br /><br />Little by little, the story reveals part of why Cather has such a tough time doing things her socially outgoing twin is having no trouble with-- leaving her dorm room, eating in a school cafeteria, having a relationship with boys.<br /><br />While Cather does flounder in her relationships-- remember I said wincingly accurate?-- experiencing her misreading of boys' attention right along with her, and then her growing sense of how to handle her own feelings is endearing.<br /><br />And then there's lots of lines like this one Cather says to the roommate's boyfriend when he turns his 100-watt smile onto her twin the first time they meet:<br /><br />&#34;Oh, put that away,&#34; Cath said with distaste. &#34;I don't want you to get charm all over my sister-- what if we can't get it out?&#34;<br /><br />So yeah, snark, and nerd-fan girl references, and a romantic relationship that develops slowly and realistically and that you want to whack Cath over the head with when she doesn't realize, and a boy who has difficulty reading, works at starbucks, has a mushy chin, and wears a green Carhartt jacket and whose special power is talking to everyone.<br /><br />I love how Cath goes through feeling ashamed, and then proud of, and then just accepts her addiction to Simon Snow fandom.<br /><br />Kissing and some fade-to-black once Cath's shirt comes off means that this is fine for younger YA audience.<br /><br />This Book's Snack Rating: Werther's Originals, for the buttery, caramely softness of adolescent anxiety, opening to love and trust, and fanfic melting on your tonguen just accepts her addiction to Simon Snow fandom.<br /><br />Kissing and some fade-to-black once Cath's shirt comes off means that this is fine for younger YA audience.<br /><br />This Book's Snack Rating: Werther's Originals, for the buttery, caramely softness of adolescent anxiety, opening to love and trust, and fanfic melting on your tongue
B007TNS6JI|1.0|I got it I took 1 hr to see if it was a good game worth getting then it said I had yo delete minecraft just to get heck no
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|There is little doubt that Tom Clancy was a great author who had the ability to tell a story that held his readers attention and interest throughout his books. This final book in the Jack Ryan & family saga is and was a fitting final chapter.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game of  uno you can play with friends,earn coins,and have a winning streak..I just can't explain it just get it it's awesome!
031623480X|5.0|Excellent, up-to-date, cutting edge information for protecting your brain against Wall Street marketing and Big Pharma/FDA corruption. This is not  your usual &#34;better brain&#34; book. It is loaded with easy and inexpensive ways to protect your brain and improve your overall health.Of over 200 &#34;brain/health&#34; books in my library, this is now my Number One recommendation
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting, damn you.  I am not a person who plays app games much but this one got me.  I don't like the way you have to buy more levels or involve FB at a certain point, but I come back to it again and again.
0763660531|5.0|This is a wonderful, wordless story for children. My five-year-old daughter loves it almost as much as I do. The artwork is simply wonderful.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|OMG, I was hooked on this author and this book.  I immediately bought several more in the series.  It completely captured my interest and I literally couldn't put it down.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I wish region 7 would open up im still waiting and does this game end also does it have a trophy so far very fun stunning graphics
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game with lots of action. My brother and I enjoy the local multiplayer feature to get to compete with someone you know
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app was fun for the whole family! The animation, sound, and comedy astounded us! If you are looking for a good app, this is the one and only.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Betrayal is ugly. I only hope Katniss' spirit lives on through her daughter. Hope Collins finds another heroin. Looking forward to that.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great plot, it was hard to put down. I'm really looking forward to the next Nelson DeMille book, hoping it will have John Corey and Paul Brenner teamed together again!
B00DJZR46G|5.0|I have much love for Elton John, have been a fan since buying Goodbye Yellow Brick Road in my teens. Saw him in concert in March and it was the greatest concert I have ever been to.  His voice has gone through some changes, but it just seems more seasoned to me. This album proves his staying power. Will forever be a fan.
B00631HASU|5.0|I have this game on my computer & when I saw it was also an app, I decided to try it. I like it just as much as I like the one on my computer.<br /><br />Plays nicely on my phone. Am very happy that I saw this today.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Book is really engaging. But can't wait for the movie. Ending needs work. Feels uninspired at best. But altogether an enjoyable read.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I like this app better than the FB app that came on my phone. It lets me see FB like I do on my compute - I guess that is called Full Page.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This takes time to learn the hard ones but great game. One of few that have ever really surprised me with quality
B0007CYW5A|1.0|Supposed to go for about 7 Hours. Dies after about 30 min. Can I get my money back or another battery.<br />Very disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|almost seems as thought 2 and 3 were one long book.  glad she split it into 2. ending was a complete shocker
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I am uninstalling The Weather Channel app. It is not as informative or as user friendly with the latest update and now it is constantly crashing my kindle when I open it. Why didn't you leave it alone?
B003O86FMW|5.0|picks up beautifully from where book one leaves us.  continues the story with out being repetitive.  Big cliff hanger at the end.
8866137634|4.0|A solid Moleskine. For those who use Evernote regularly the 3 free months essentially pay for the notebook. Like other reviewers, I see nothing special in the &#34;magic dots.&#34; Additionally, a notebook covered in bas relief Evernote clip art is probably not something that will age well (&#34;Why does Grandpa's notebook have pens and elephant heads on the front?&#34;)<br /><br />This is a notebook that I will buy once every three months for the membership. Better to think of this purchase as an Evernote Premium subscription with a free notebook thrown in, rather than vice versa.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Incredible!  If amazon would allow me only one word, thats all I would need.  Adventure, trust and love.  What more do you want from a book.
B009Q6ADG0|1.0|Hi,<br /><br />Because there was only one song on the CD, which I paid 15 dolars for one song, it is not fair for me.
6305428042|5.0|Shipped right on time. The movie was originally sold on VHS, so it's not as though the quality is excellent or anything, but I was pretty impressed with how it looked on my laptop. I think the movie itself is hilarious and can see why it's a cult classic, but some people do find it ridiculous. I watch it every year on Halloween and thought I should finally own a copy of it instead of trying to catch it on the Disney channel...
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence's performance is near perfection in this film - she does the subject matter justice and gives life to not only her own character, but all of the others as well.
1467934925|5.0|Shipped quickly and I don't think there's any need to review Keynes. If you have an interest in economics, or need to read this for class, get it. The book is not very long.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|love it and love the artist. good collections of songs.  All the old ones ( songs ) and new songs which is what I wanted in a CD
B006GLM5EQ|4.0|Interesting with a touch of humor that seems to slightly soften other somewhat extreme scenes. The acting is fairly good, considering the material.
B00GX598FO|4.0|The movie was fun and packed with a lot of action.  I'm a huge fan of Helen Mirren and John Malkovich and I liked the first Reds.  It was worth seeing.
B00H1KX87E|5.0|If you've never read one of Julia's book, you're missing out BIG time! Anya's Story follows the life of a young high-school girl in the days during and before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The insights that are provided here are both boisterous and unbeatable. Big dreams, hardwork following laid down plans, the promise of a love that's to last a lifetime... and then DISASTER!<br /><br />What Julia has done here is present to us a carefully crafted masterpiece, deduced from the knowledge of her own real life experiences, with enough suffering, pain, dejection, yet still brimming, clinging on to a broken resilience in a manner that's enough to reduce you to tears.<br /><br />I'm trying hard not to introduce any spoiler here to clarify my points, even though I'm much compelled to. The memory of this book will cling to you for a long time. This is Anya's story.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|The game is defined extremely well. It has all the FreeCell features i want. The designers did not make the mistake of adding so many features that the game gets cluttered and complicated. There might be other FreeCell games that are just as good but I don't know how any could improve on this version because any addition or subtraction from the current game would make it worse.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|most people right a reveiw that is either loving it or completly trashing it. but im gunna right a reveiw that is honest in my oppinion.....the game is free which is good for the most part but all you do in the game is pay and pay... u get payed a certain amount of money for different types of hunts depending on what level your on but most of the time the game requires for u to have a more powerful gun so u either have to upgrade your gun or get a new one. which costs alot so its hard to get money because each time u earn it u have to use it all to buy something else so then ur broke for a long time untill u can get back by doing the old hunts that u have already completed again to make money... on my kindle fire it also freezes alot and it never does that with any other of my games. its really frusterating because then u have shut the kindle down and wait 5 minutes for the game to load again.. i may seem like im trashing the game but there are some good things about it. for one it has great grafics and sound. the hunts are challenging but not too chanellging.  there are also many places to hunt. u complete a certain amount of hunts to unlock a new region (Alaska. south Africa.  Columbia.  etc..) were there are different animals. so the game has its bad side but in its deffence pretty much every game does.. i still spend alot of time play it... that is when it decides it wants to work right.. i would deff reccomend trying it to see what u think.. i think its worth its flaws
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very intertaining movie with good values messages.  I would recommend it to all parents.  Although I don't have kids myself, I really enjoyed watching it on cable and purchased this for a friend with kids.
B00992CF6W|5.0|mindcraft now has a man that I do not ilke.<br />it dose not let me go in a lot of places
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Hysterical!!! Right up the with the &#34;Hang Over&#34;. Will bring tears to your eyes from laughing so hard. Must see.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is totally AWESOME, if you have ever played subway surfers, well this is almost just like it, but it is just Despicable me.
B00BB22GQM|3.0|Modern Vampires of the City is a slight let down.  The band is evolving in their song writing, but they are losing the essence of why I fell in love with them.  Gone from this record are the Afropop and Ska influences while there are less catchy sing a long pop songs on this one.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love this app! If you liked the console version you will love this app! I love dc comics and this game is perfect for me! It will be perfect for you too!
0307730697|5.0|One of the better biographies I have read in quite some time. Adam Brown was a true American hero and selfless patriot
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|Very good place to meet ladies I like it it's working good for me try it you will like it
B008RKGF1I|4.0|Great movie that really brings back fond memories.  On top of that, the music score is outstanding!  Not many movies of this generation have the PG-13 appeal and subtle sexiness of this movie.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|A book I couldn't put down... I love Nicholas Sparks, but this is by far the best book of his. Wonderful story line. Tears were absolutely shed which means I REALLY got into it. 5 stars!!!
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|I loved it..I'm such a fan of the Twilight Saga. .great gift for a fan..it's a beautiful set..no disappointment..All I have to say it's about time
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved it. Read it nonstop. I'm such a softie, I cried several times while reading it, but was moved and delighted the whole way through.
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|acting was credible and settings were authentiic and beautiful at times.  loved the sweet story and the fact that it is that rare movie that could be enjoyed by adults and/or families.  would enjoy a sequel portraying the  remaining years of mrs. potter&#34;s life.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this device to wirelessly send content from my laptop to the TV.  It works fairly well with Windows 7 or on my Android tablet, but will NOT work with both.  That is to say, the Chromecast can be configured to work with the Win7 laptop and then the Android tablet will not work.  Or, you can configure the Android tablet to work but then the Win7 laptop will not work.  Also, if you read the description on Amazon VERY CAREFULLY you will discover there is no claim made that the Android chrome browser will work with the Chromecast.  Thus, 1 star from me.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Great 70's classic sci-fi.  Has the typical special effects for the time period and follows the main character to question what the future could possibly hold if he goes outside the box.
B00D3NSDVO|2.0|By the end of chapter 7 one can see exactly where this book is going: boys' own, ripping yarn, characters (not in a good way); an all-seeing organisation called `The Division' (not quite silly enough - X Department would have been better) with a 29 year-old in charge who appears to be the best thing since sliced bread; sexual references in the early stages, presumably to grab the attention of the target market - teenage boys; little trailers and hooks at least every chapter, for those with limited attention-span.<br /><br />The book goes on, and on, and on.  As a beach book this was not bad, but when I tried to re-read it using more than half of my brain it became quite tedious.  However, I did enjoy even the second time around the way that Bradley tracked down our hero - somewhat like The Day of the Jackal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that was all that compared well with good thrillers.  I grew tired of the constant trailers and secrets; for example, not saying what vital items he bought in a shop, or owning up to a (not specified, of course) mistake.  Our hero was just too marvellous, even before the age of 29 he had solved just about everything, written the definitive book on how to do it, and had even chosen the perfect father to have.  I therefore found the comment &#34;I was OK with guns but remotes weren't my strongpoint&#34; particularly funny.
0061733199|5.0|best book i have ever bought.  super useful and plenty of information to help anyone trying to increase or brush up on survival skills
B00C81LYH2|5.0|It was in pristine condition.  It was packed well.  I get them for my daughter every Christmas.  She collects them so it is imperative that the box not even have a dent in it and it was absolutely perfect.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|PERFECTION. JEN IS PERFECT. JOSH IS PERFECT. SAM IS PERFECT. PERFECTION<br />I SAW IT 3 TIMES SO FAR AND OMF
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was amazing!!! The relationship between Travis and Abby was a rough one but a strong one. What they go through makes them stronger as a person and a couple. Words can not even come close to how much I loved this book. I've read it 3 times or more for sure though. Great book overall and I definately re omen it to anyone that's 17+.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|The feeling I get is that these Bonds with Daniel Craig were before the ones with Sean Connery in the actual timeline of the stories (disregarding all the modernization).
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought a second one just because it worked so well. But as always the future will tell if others get on board and make your took work better.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift, so I only relate the info I received from my grandson and his family.  they were very pleased.
B004DF3S7A|2.0|I had heard the first 4 volumes and really enjoyed the duets.  But the &#34;Best of..&#34; did not include any of the duets that Rod Stewart had on the original volumes.  The &#34;Best&#34; in this case were none of the songs that I would have picked.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Love this CD. Taylor has released some great CD's, but I think this one is by far her best one yet. This arrived to me on time and in perfect condition.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like that you can use your own music to wake up with. This app works well and is easy to set up custom alarms.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love this CD!! I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it. This arrived to me on time and in perfect condition.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app is very easy to set up even if you aren't tech savvy. Ease of use is important for me when I use apps.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|I love this show!! The DVD's run flawlessly and I tend to forget how much shorter shows can be without commercials. This arrived to me on time and in perfect condition.
B000WOT41K|5.0|I love the Cranberries and this is a great compilation if you love this band. I would recommend this album of hits!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|This man just keeps getting better and better with every CD he puts out. I highly recommend this CD. This arrived to me on time and in perfect condition.

B002AOWXQ8|5.0|Can't stop listening to this CD, I have this on constant repeat in my car. This arrived to me on time and in perfect condition.
B00FATEJYE|3.0|Hi I was really excited when I saw this app for Kindle Fire and as I waited for it to download I did not have enough space I deleted a few things still nothing I tried on a different kindle and I could not download it either is there anything you guys can do to fix it? Thanks c:
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Yet another fantastic season. i was sad to see this show end. But I am happy that I can rewatch this again and again even though it is played on TV. It's just better without commercials! This arrived to me on time and in perfect condition.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an excellent app for my calculating needs! It does everything I expect, the way I expect and I haven't had any errors.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|I can't stress enough that if you haven't listened to them yet then you must do so now!!! You won't be sorry! This arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B000RLKCMI|5.0|I love this movie and this is hard to find and rent so I ordered it through amazon and it scanned through with no problem,I finally have another one of my favorite movies. Thanks.
1423124111|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my brother whom loves the Disney theme parks.I looked through it a little when it arrived and the pictures are gorgeous! This arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B00466HM28|5.0|This product arrived before the due date on a Sunday morning (10:30 AM) . I was surprised but not as much as my son will be when he gets this. Thanks for having my products arrive on time for Christmas.
B002DPXSPO|4.0|This is a great Sunday afternoon movie. Doris Day and Rock Hudson are fine, and Tony Randall is fantastic as their neighbor.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great for me. I watch free movies from the internet on my TV with out wires. Plug it into anyone of my tvs and it works. May buy another one for my other tv. Thanks, it's a good product. Everyone needs one.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I began watching this, but became bored, perhaps it was not the right time. I turned it off, and may return some other day..
B004EBT6HE|4.0|Another interesting book by Ken Follett. Would recommend this book to any one who enjoys a fast paced and thrilling good story.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great game, by far the best game out there for the kindle and better yet its totally free. I couldn't have asked for anything better.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|This thing is terrible. I tried to use it on the original kindle and the response of the kindle operating system is so slow it's useless.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|As always Patricia Cornwell weaves Kay Scarpetta into a wonderful &#34;who done it?&#34; I both listened and read this book and both ways it was exciting. As one death after another unfolds we retrieve new clues to the one Kay is trusted to solve, and solve she does.  Aided once again by Marino, Lucy and Benton the truth comes together.
0071752854|5.0|This book is brilliant but be careful. Make sure you test it in your market. Remember that Oren's perspective comes from the world of venture capital...shark tank.
B00957T6X6|5.0|MORE!  I want more..... p....l.....e....a....s...e.......  I only wish I had discovered this series after ALL of the books were written.  I hate waiting.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I loved how it gave me a new view point to look from..<br />I'm not sure if it changed any of my beliefs but it definitely let me see and appreciate others! I wish more people wouldn't be so judge mental, read this book!!
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|who doesnt love Nemo!!! I ordered this because my original copy was missing. 3yo daughter loves this although I have to watch it with her  because &#34;Sharks are scary&#34; lol
B000OIZUW6|4.0|Have not finished it yet but it has been a fast read so far up to 22% in the old Kindle world. Guess they use % instead of pages.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This is hands down the best box set I own and have seen. It is very well made and worth every penny. I recommend this box set to any breaking bad fan. Much props to Vince Gilligan for making an awesome dvd package.
3836532441|5.0|I had been burned by pin-up books before and was apprehensive about this one. What I wanted was a book of portraits. Pin-up portraits are gorgeous and its not necessarily easy to find the classy, vintage ones. A couple books that I had bought before were mostly a history of. This book was perfect! Each chapter had their own &#34;girl&#34; with history about her life and a wide arrangement of photos from that model! This was exactly what I was looking for!
B005COO1X6|5.0|This is one of King's short stories that he does so well. It's not his best but I enjoyed it just as much as his best. Great plot and characters.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Incredible game!!! I'm 43 and love the battle games like this! My kids LOVE to play and watch Daddy kick some butt!!! Keep em' coming Kindle Fire!!! We need to see Marvel vs. Capcom next!
B002RKRGQ2|4.0|These Jeeves books are fun to read, and don't take much time. Good to have around for emergencies when something short is needed. I'm always reading something, but I especially enjoy these as a lightweight filler between more serious books.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It grabs you from the very beginning and you won't be able to put it down.  Heart wrenching but wonderful story.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Although the plot of this book is somewhat gruesome, I couldn't put it down. The author did a great job with giving the reader the necessary background of the living conditions of not only District 12 but of the tributes as well. Additionally, I could clearly see the division between the wealthy citizens of Capital and the poverty of the Districts. However what was so alarming and peeked my interest from chapter to chapter is how this dictatorship forced children who could really be friends, to kill each other for food. I would also like to note that the characters were carefully and skillfully developed. I really connected to the emotions of each. I loved reading this book. Each chapter left me wanting more.....I can't wait to read Catching Fire!!!!
B00GIXWHZ4|3.0|The movie was good but the video stream was poor.  Had a lot of digital breakup during fight seems making screen blurry.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|So many options to put you to sleep or just relaxing. Fun , brings real sounds to your ambience, zzz
B002QE3CTY|3.0|Other reviews said if you like The Hunger Games trilogy, you'll like this. Wrong. This book in comparison is slow and to simple in comparison.<br /><br />Good concept. Just meek in comparison to Hunger Games, Brave New World, and World War Z.<br /><br />Good for middle schoolers maybe.
6305128952|3.0|I gave it three stars because horses are one of my passions, although the ending is what did not appeal to my desired ending.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Everything came perfect and right on time! I am very happy with it but it is a Christmas gift so won't know exactly how great it is until after the holidays!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I gave it this rating because of the subject matter that it addresses; more specifically the personal battle that Whip has with drugs and alcoholism. I am going to school that is why I found the ending to be very rewarding and uplifting.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|A must movie for everyone to see. True documentary and he received awards for bringing the truth to the public.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love the game because you fight against the others.I also like it. Because they have jocker and it has batman
B004H1V5RU|1.0|Check your game before wrapping it up for Christmas gifts!  Ours did not have a ball inside making it unplayable!  Am returning it asap and hoping the next one I receive is fully intact.  Double check yours -
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is awesome...love it! I play all the time just wish people were always honest.  God bless candy crush.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire. The old e-mail app was always bogged down and it didn't sync right with my account. It would also freeze and I wasn't getting all of my mail. With this app I feel connected and can manage my messages easily without worry.
B00FQMVCEA|3.0|Fun for all ages! The digital copy was a pain in the buns to download...but the upside is great people at tech support walked my simple self thru the process and we love the movie!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was recommended to me as a fine historical novel. I honestly had no idea what to expect except that it was WWII Germany.<br /><br />From the beginning, I was enraptured like I have not been in a very long time. Imagine having Death narrate the book and actually feel sorry for him! And the writing style was very reminiscent of classic literature. The author writes fantastic prose in a way few authors can in this post-modern era.<br /><br />The characters were drawn in such a rich way. Death's grim humor and genuine concern for humanity caused the book to touch my emotions in a way most books cannot.<br /><br />I guess I shall never tire of WWII stories. It is a period of history that repulses and intrigues me. Although this is fiction, I truly found myself caring about the characters. Death's cobntinued foreshadowing of events to come were always executed at exactly the right time. I think this book can touch anyone who decides to read it.<br /><br />it does have some foul language, but I found that every use of it made sense. There were no sex scenes nor descriptive violence, but the book is harsh and real. Violence is there and unfortunately quite necessary.
B008K93302|1.0|I can't even find it on my kindle. Waste of money don't buy it. Anyone know of one that actually works?
B0082Z447U|5.0|I began reading this book because of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical version of this book. I am a huge Michael Crawford fan, and he was in the musical in England. I even have the soundtrack. I had listened to soundtrack once, but of course, I didn't understand it. I had read a couple people's reviews of the story, and I thought I should give it a try.<br /><br />I began reading this, and it did not begin slowly as so many classics do. I used to joke that classics were always slow for the first 50 pages. It was rare to find one that captured your attention from the beginning. I think this one captured me almost from the beginning. Wilkie Collins puts you right into the midst of the story, and you, as the reader, are not even truly sure of what is going on. You want to keep reading.<br /><br />My two favorite characters were Marian and Count Fosco. (That is actually ironic. You'll have to read the book to catch my meaning.)<br /><br />I liked Marian because she was such a strong woman. I love it when male authors--especially the classics--are able to write about strong women who really impact the story. And yet she remains feminine in spite of it all. The only sad thing is that she never marries. It's the wimpy Laura who gets married and has a child. Go figure. I guess strong women back then didn't get married. At least according to Wilkie Collins.<br /><br />I enjoyed the character of Count Fosco because he was so devilishly evil and yet so likable. I kept imagining how Michael Crawford would have played the part--he would have been ideal.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the mystery in the book. I did not have everything figured out--there were so many layers and twists and turns! Goodness! Easily the best mystery I have read in ages.<br /><br />I would say the only reasons someone would not like the book is that it is long, and it is written in Victorian language instead of our modern-day lingo. I would recommend this as a mystery and as a classic. I look forward to reading more Wilkie Collins!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Great app excellent gameplay and responsive controls. Would like to be able to eran more real gold without a credit card but otherwise no comolaints.
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King is my favorite author. The language is great. The sentence structure is simple but full of meaning. The paragraphs are beautifully map. And now he is teaching on witting. If you want to write better just buy it.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Great game play would like to see cheaper cards, getting power credits is almost a chore when u have to fight constantly to earn em. Overall good game alittle sad to see i need to console edtion to earn better items but its cool gives me more reason to get the console edition
630469654X|5.0|I'm a sucker for love story. This is my favorite one. The brilliant knight and the enchanted lady...they can almost touch but never can..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. Completely addicting. So glad that they brought out to Kindle.  Now I don't have to get tablet just to play.... thanks candy crush
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is a great program so you can read your eBooks in your tablet or android cellular phone. I just love it
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It is fun and stuff but the loading now in days is FOREVER im trying getting it and regetting it now so HAVE A GREAT DRAGON DAY lol bad joke like thefearowolf's jokes
B006MHWXMS|5.0|It is a great application than everybody must have in their android cel phones. Save time, paper, and trees. Love it.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 3 year old loves this game. She can't put it down. it's also great that it shows and teaches her about the Dr and medicine. Great app good job dev
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This is a great book. it gives you the basics, the science, the researchers, and example of the food to ear on the fast days. But I can stress enough: go to your doctor before doing this or any other diet. They might do a modification of the diet depending in your heath, age, and blood test that you have. Besides is the write thing to do. Buy it, learn as much as you can, go to the doctor and explain to him, get your test blood if need it, and follow the doctors recommendation. It works. Congratulation in getting this book. It is a life changing experience.
B00FCAJZTK|3.0|A bit of a stretch. Pretty good but it won't be something I return to often. I would highly recommend Spirits, recorded around the same time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It is a Stephen King Book. If you like him as a writer, you jus will love it this book.
B008JD7VZM|4.0|Bought as a Christmas present for a nine-year-old grandson.  It looks complex, but I am sure he will love it.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|It is an old book buy so good. If you believe in UFOs and extraterrestrial live, this book is for you. If you are incredulous or just curious this book is for you too..
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Not clear on how it works. There is no real point to it if the camera only can shoot towards you
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It is like having a notepad in your tablet or cel. phone. don't carry notes to the supermarket, food store, or any  store at all. You just need this app for to do list, food list or else.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love love LOVE this app!!!! Its awesome because I can just get music videos and audios for free!!! Even my favorite clogs I can watch without wifi!!!! I have this app on my kindle fire and it works great!!!! highly recomended!!!!!)
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|'A lot of people think this is some cliche' high school story when it isn't at all. In high school stories it's usually about trying to fit in but Twilight doesn't really care about fitting in. It's essentially an empire vs rebellion story in just a high school setting. Sure, our villain tries to use some high school drama stuff against Twilight but it's such a small portion of the film that I can't believe focus on it that much. When sunset shimmer learns that her cyber bullying plan doesn't stop Twilight she's off to her next plan. Boom Done and yet people still complain about it. There are some flawed moments but there not so bad to give it a one star rating People tend to see a school setting with humanized versions of the characters they know and love and make a bad assumption or go in to this movie with some biases. And for the record when I see this movie I don't see Hasbro trying to rival say Monster High or Bratz because those are shallow characters who seem to just care about 1 thing only and that's their looks. But I never get that impression for Equestria Girls. Sure not everybody needed to be in a skirt (especially AJ I picture in jeans as for RD SKORT NOT A SKIRT seems fitting. To me it shows athleticism and femininity.) I see the characters that we all know and love in a new setting. Plus the Bratz and Monster High characters always try to look sexy and the only scene I can consider to be sexy is when RD is shaving her hips in front of the camera THAT'S IT and if anyone else thinks otherwise then you know what...I can't help it if you have a dirty mind. So forget what everyone else tells you. Enjoy the movie and think for yourself.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|Saw this many years ago and just watched it again. I don't think I fully appreciated the first time the greatness of his nuanced performance: He IS Mr. Ripley, whoever that may be. Alert:The movie ultimately is very disturbing, so not a good choice right before bedtime!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is and always will be my favorite of all time. I was never a bully in school but reading this literally turned my life around and made me think about whose life you're affecting by what you say/do. It really made me stop and think, what if I was on one of the tapes, and what am I going to do to make sure I never will be? Amazing book. The 5 stars don't do it justice.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is a poignant piece of very well written literature.  I would not be a bit surprised to see this one become a movie.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|It really made me think about what I would do if I were put in that situation, and how hard it must have been for her. Amazingly written and just all around amazing book.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Poorly written, poor character development, there are tons of potholes and instances of retroactive continuity. The author seemed to have the conclusion the way it was just to be edgy when in reality it was extremely illogical. It was a real let down from the first two books in terms of quality of writing, not to mention the main characters completely change their personalities. Do yourself a favor and save the money for a better book and just make up your own ending, it will be better than anything Roth could have come up with.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is ev.er.y.thing. It hurts for the episode to end. If you're thinking this is all about zombies and can't possibly interesting for 4 seasons, think again. It's about the living as much as the dead. See what I did there?
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|The original graphic story, told from the dog's perspective. Completely compelling. Read it for yourself to understand why it is a classic.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I love this movie, it's like &#34;Black Hawk Down&#34; meets &#34;Predator&#34;, brings a sense of realism to alien invasion movies, very awesome
0316743003|5.0|Very enjoyable reading on the skunkworks aircraft by the theromdynamics engineer for the SR71 and later manager of Lougheed skunkworks.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|Beautiful packaging, great movie, one of my favorite Dracula movies, the case is awesome and a bit 3D, DVD's look like old coins!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can keep track of all my messages from my friends and family. You can also play some games that are on facebook.
1932907009|5.0|Insanely insightful, easily the best book on storytelling I've read, has been monumental in helping me figure out how to tell stories in an entertaining way
B009LGO88E|5.0|Works like a charm. Makes games like Resident Evil Revelations and Monster Hunter a breeze. My only complaint is that this thing wasn't built into the system to begin with.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Our family LOVES Chromecast!<br />It is easy to supervise what the kids watch and with streaming from YoutTube,Netflix and Pandora,we can access so many different entertainment options!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Easy to play.  Lots of fun, stress free.  Recommend for ages. Beautiful bright colors.  Wish you could earn all extras with no in app purchases, but very enjoyable to play.
B00CH3DBNQ|3.0|The writing is way too detailed to keep attention.  The research is wonderful, but remembering all of the names and historical events is quite taxing.
6305428042|5.0|Bette Midler easily stole all the attention in this fun romp.  Aside the fact that you'd think three witches - supposedly wise women - would lay low before they go on a rampage, the fun situations they get into is pretty good.  I especially like the deadpan delivery of Midler as she exits the kiln after a failed attempt to dispose of the witches.
B001F12J48|1.0|This was a waste of money. We were so excited when we bought our 3D television and then ordered some of our favorite movies to go with it. Very disappointed the normal DVD has far better quality. And yes we also have a 3D DVD player to complete the system.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|Okay, I'm a science fiction freak and the premise was KINDA all right but they lost my intense interest when they violated the conservation of mass rules (that the director of 'Terminator 2' worked so hard to maintain).  The tiny lizard sneaking into the back of the SUV was cute.  Having it later sneak into the bushes and turn into a beagle was stupid.  Later on, the beagle turns into ... well, watch the movie if you want but it left me thinking that it was a silly movie after all.  'Roswell' might have been short-lived but at least they didn't violate too many obvious rules on the way to their cancellation.
B00FTGYNUS|3.0|I'm going to start by saying that if you are a Pink fan, go ahead and buy this DVD.  As horrible as the editing is, the fun and excitement of her live show still comes through and Pink, her dancers, and her musicians deserve a lot of credit for all their hard work.<br /><br />That being said, during the first few songs I wasn't sure I'd be able to finish watching the movie.  Cut away after cut away after cut away!  There was never time to fully absorb the greatness of the performance;  some shots were perhaps two seconds before moving on to the next shot.  If I was epileptic I'd worry about a seizure.  I wanted to watch Pink and her dancers and musicians perform, not suffer through the editor's self-indulgence.  I don't need clever camera angles to be entertained, Pink is more than entertaining just standing on stage.<br /><br />The editor just needed to calm the heck down and let us enjoy the concert.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was beginning to wonder if there was going to b e a fourth book because there was so much to fix. I cried like a baby at the end. bitter sweet ending. loved this series.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I really love this movie and having it on amazon is even better! This movie has really different ideas on many things such as the environment and even religion. Look deeper within this movie and you will not be disappointed.
B008Y778ZG|4.0|Watched it again recently and, even though I knew how it ends, I still got as involved as the first time. I love disaster films and feel that this is one of the best.

B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is a challenge and fun.  I play it with my 9yo.  I wish you could skip all the talking among the characters...
B00BD99JMW|1.0|There are many issues with this book.  The inaccurate premise about genetics.  The dual narrative written in the same voice.  Simple holes like Tris learning that the  City was named Chicago but yet in the first book she states she lives in the place that was formally Chicago.  *Spoiler* I have no issue that she dies in the end but at least wrap up the other people and make them whole.
B007REV4YI|3.0|OK movie to watch on a slow day.  It had a part or two (Not well thought out or scripted)  that didn't make too much sense, such as the ending where, why would only three people defend a home out in the boonies, and not have an army instead.  Don't want to give too much away folks.  Didn't make sense to me, but overall this SkyFall movie was OK.  I'm guessing the Producers don't have a clue as to the intelligence of the viewers now days that nick pick apart the movies to find things that could have been written better.  Oh well, its still OK.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|When this app works, it is great. But I frequently have problems (which is frustrating) with it.  I am using it on a Kindle.  Is that a problem??
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|There was a lot of good ideas and applications in the first 2 parts.  But in the end Gladwell put his political view instead of  analysis on the Three Strike Law.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was ok. It wasn't as good as the first two books. Would have been better with a different ending.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Definitely have to read the 3rd book to see what happens, but I found the 2nd and 3rd books to be far inferior to the original Hungar Games book.  The twist in the 3rd book made it more interesting, however.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|White House Down has gotten a lot of comparisons to another action film where terrorists invade and take over the White House; Olympus Has Fallen. But the difference between the two is, one film is intense and riveting, and the other is a rehash of stale gags, cliches, non-threatening villains, and an overglut of action.<br /><br />I'll give you a hint; the movie where a limo crashes into the president's pool is NOT the good one. White House Down is an utter mess. From thinly drawn characters, to terrible, cliched villains, to generic action and stupid one-liners, this is not even a guilty pleasure. This is an overdose of explosions and violence set to a terribly thin political message and a complete lack of suspense.<br /><br />The villains are stereotyped, played for comedic relief (always ready with a glib one-liner and a movie reference...), and never fully explored. The heroes are ALSO stereotyped, played for comedic relief, and never fully relatable. As a non-American, I felt no remorse or sympathy for anyone in the movie, except perhaps Joey King's character (a bright spot for the film).<br /><br />The cast IS rather good, however. Good, that is, if you like Channing Tatum being funny and Jamie Foxx being Jamie Foxx. Maggie Gylenhaal and Richard Jenkins are decent, but Jason Clarke has no room to act other than being an over-the-top baddie.James Woods is rather fun, though.<br /><br />So in conclusion, a few of the stunts are winners and the cast's chemistry is entertaining, but this is a rote, unimaginative, overblown, typical Emmerich movie. And is that such  bad thing? 3/5 white houses down.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Great movie, even better on Blu-Ray!  We rented it a couple of times before grabbing it for a birthday gift for our son.  It is MUCH better in Blu-Ray, and has one of the best soundtracks ever, good stuff from Daft Punk, and with 'the dude' coming through in the older Jeff Bridge's role (Flynn), it is quite entertaining.
B007IQX1G4|4.0|I love Charlize Theron,  where is she now a days??  Such a great actress, she really dives into her roles with gusto.  You could totally sympathize with what she was going through.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I just received the Thule backpack for 17 inch Mackbook today and I absolutely love it.<br /> it is well made and of excellent quality material.<br />The size of the bag is ideal for motorcycle trips. You have enough space to fit ur computer, mobile, wallet, clothes enough for overnight trips.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so much fun because it is a challenge.  I can't get passed the Vector Battle. It's a great way to challenge yourself and also learn the skills of saving your bananas ($$$) and Gru Coins.
B00AW57L96|4.0|Makes you think about the &#34;what could have beens&#34;. Slow start but once it picked up, the book became a real page turner.
B004EPZ070|2.0|It ended wrong. I enjoyed it until the end. I love John Kransinski more than you could imagine, and his character, although the most likable and the least selfish, was just about the only character who didn't end up happy in the end. It wasn't fair, and it was wrong. I read the book before this, and I'm glad that the movie at least had some sort of closure with Darcy and Rachel. But in the end, the ending is wrong, so, so wrong. The womanizer (Marcus), ended up with the overpowering, selfish Darcy. And the spineless Dex ended up with the &#34;innocent&#34;, annoying Rachel. The funny and likable Ethan, whom is always looking out for Rachel, ends up alone in London. Great.<br />This movie ended so wring, and I can't stress that enough.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing!!! Can't wait to read the next one. One of those books that you can't put down. Recommend to all ages!
B00433SVP6|5.0|It's really  awesome!!!!!!<br />I really enjoyed reading the book and can't wait to see how the series is gonna end.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Disappointed!<br />Don't really care for novellas or short stores...always looking for a 2,000 page Stephen King book!<br />Will always look out for new books by King.
B000SUKPKM|4.0|Alot of classic Goo Goo Dolls on this CD, I'd recommend highly if their singles are what you are after, as it actually has alot (some other albums from other artists claim to be 'singles' albums but then you only get one or two, not so with this).
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Max Brooks set out to do something unique in the &#34;genre&#34; of Zombie fiction, deliver a personal and intimate portrayal of a world that fell to an epidemic, yet manages to recover. So many novels and films focus on the dissolution of society and the breakdown into a post apocalyptic world, but few (if any) try to take the optimistic approach of portraying a recovering and rebuilding world.<br />At times, the authors world views taint the characters and it comes across heavy handed whenever  the author insert has a conversation with one of the societal &#34;villains&#34;. Despite these flaws, the novel told from a myriad of perspectives is consistently enjoyable, even when you notice that many of the voices contained therein begin to sound alike.<br />If you're looking for an easy read that has some legitimately interesting and moving moments set against the now popular &#34;Zombie Wasteland&#34;, you could do far worse than picking up &#34;World War Z&#34;.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|The technique used in this app in teaching a language is great. Learning anything, you should practice everyday, but you don't have to spend hours a day. With this app, you can learn a language with even just fifteen minutes a day. True beginners can learn. If you know the language, you have the option to skip the beginners lesson too.
B0037V88JO|5.0|I saw this film in it's theatrical release as a kid and it's lush visuals have stayed with me for over 50 years.  I have had this Laserdisc version in the past and have just re-ordered it because, as of this date, Paramount (which somehow allowed it to slip into public domain) has not reissued the film either on DVD or Blu-Ray.  The Laserdisc is the best version currently extant and is highly recommended.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Great game. It's very addicting and a nice change from sudoku. I just wish there was a way to keep track of your scores without a third party app.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I really like this mouse. The option to change the weight is really useful and the mouse is a nice shape that fits nicely in my hand. My only complain are the three buttons on the left side. They feel like really cheep plastic and there is wiggle room on the buttons. In addition, they are right in the way of my thumb so I sometime click them on accident when I grip the mouse tightly. 4 stars.

B00B5HQL50|4.0|Like Daniel Craig's brooding character style. Terrific action sequences. Nice salute to &#34;Goldfinger&#34;. Appears that Dame Judith Densch(&#34;M&#34;) wanted an honorable exit from the franchise. I've been a Bond fan since &#34;Dr. No.&#34;
B002N5N4M6|5.0|My favorite sitcom...EVER!  The writing is intelligent, the cast plays off each other well, and it's just plain hilarious!  Seems to get better with every season.  I'd put this show right up there with Cheers & Frasier!
B003VANOFY|5.0|These headphones far exceeded my expectations and even Logitech's specifications. First off, the range easily exceeds 40 ft going through a couple interior walls. I haven't been able to test it in a big room, but I feel that the range could exceed 100 ft in the open.<br /><br />The battery life also exceeds 10 hours if you aren't blasting the speakers. I typically get 6 hours of life out of them listening to music.<br /><br />Comfort wise, these things feel great and I wear them on a daily basis for 4-5 hours.<br /><br />Sound quality wise these sound great. They have the right mix for playing games. I'd rank them as almost as good as some &#62;$200 noise canceling or music listening headphones which is impressive considering they are wireless and half that price.<br /><br />When playing Battlefield 4 I can almost always tell the general vicinity of a sound. They aren't as good as a dedicated surround speaker system (duh) but are way better than stereo phones.<br /><br />Lastly, one nifty feature that I never thought I'd use but has turned into my favorite feature is the boom mute. When you fold the mic up, there is a hardware mute. This is great when someone needs to talk to you while you are on a conference call.<br /><br />Finally, I use these on my Mac most of the time and everything works great, the volume wheel works, even the play buttons work.
B00EOARZ4G|4.0|A fitting farewell and sadly his last novel, as it seemed to reminds heavily of his earlier (and best) work. Fast paced, well-researched and thoroughly engaging!

B00FQ53NIA|5.0|All right, so I forgot this was coming out but when I saw it, I had to buy it because I have been her fan since day 1!<br /><br />I wasn't sure what I was going to think because her single wasn't what I am used to, but it's clear that as her first release on RCA records is an amazing one. Its more a dance and somewhat techno type of album but track 9, was a total surprise.<br /><br />Track 9 features Jamie Lynn, Brits little sis and she has a great voice, that song just might be my fav on the CD with the two sisters singing together.<br /><br />Though the album isn't the usual Britney type, its still great and for the first time, she wrote on every single song. I am glad that she is writing music more and I hope I get a chance to see her tour for this one.<br /><br />Album is good for loyal fans to buy, but only if your open to hearing her sing with a different type of song. Can't wait till I see if she sticks with this sound or not.<br /><br />I recommend the album, but be warned, its a lot of interesting and weird beats.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Highly addictive game!!! I find myself playing it during every free moment I have. The more friends you have the more rewards you get. Also, the more rooms you complete the more rewards you get, too! I like that even if I run out of tokens for the day I know they will replenish in 23 hours or I can play the slots with my coins in the meantime. People are so friendly and will always trade extras to help you complete rooms. I have also made some great friends playing this game. I suggest joining a Bingo group, as well for more friends and more trading. I highly recommend this game as it's the best Bingo game out there! Happy Bingo-ing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Get ready for the most epic game,<br /> I recommend that you get this fascinating game, now I'm not going to ruin it but I will tell u this. This is the replacement for temple run, if u like games like that I say get Subway Surfers.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|For years I've read King's new stuff, as in the past fifteen or twenty years, and hated it.<br />Well, maybe not hated it, but none of it could measure up to his OLD stuff. I finally stopped reading the guy. Every payday I still took my kids to the local bookstore and turned them loose: one paperback, and I didn't mean a comic book.<br />My son always went straight to King's section, but one time even he asked me about the change in stories. I taught him how to check for the publication year, and to stay away from Dean Koontz.<br />But this book is the old King, a fresh take, a new kind of monster, one we haven't seen but still seems plausible. This is a monster that will have people with the tiniest speck of intuition screaming in their sleep.<br />I reread The Shining before opening this, not a necessary step, but I wanted to be thorough. The books fit seamlessly together, no matter how many years had passed. The new copies of The Shining have some teaser chapters from this book-don't read them; they skip around.<br />Little Danny Torrence has grown up to be his father's son, an alcoholic excuse for a man who can't keep a job. He even empties the wallet of a welfare mother, but he didn't take her food stamps. Big hero, huh?<br />Dan the man can get a job, usually as a custodian or an unskilled helper in a nursing home, and he'll be a good worker. Then he'll get drunk and miss a day or two or three and boom! No job!<br />That is until he's caught buying liquor instead of coming to work in a small New Hampshire town. This time Dan is marched in front of the man who hired him and given one choice-AA.<br />And it works.<br />Dan's cat gains a reputation for knowing who in the nursing home will die. Dan himself helps people pass over. I'll let you read how.<br />But that's the tiniest part of the book. If you remember little Danny from The Shining you know he had a special gift. This book tells the story of a group of people who have lived hundreds of years past what God intended by ingesting the psychic powers of others, usually children. When this group decides to attack a psychically strong teen in the area Dan now calls home, he refuses to sit still.<br />Go, Dan, go.<br />What follows is an unusual, engrossing fight to the finish. And since it's psychic, players don't have to be in the same State to participate.<br />You'll never look at a top hat the same way again.
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|The storyline seems like that of Cinderella.  A young girl from a poor and simple background addresses the UN on her 16th birthday and receives a standing ovation for the message she so eloquently expresses.  How many others of her talent are hidden away in corners of the world being denied the opportunity of going to school?  The entire account reads like it has been written from the heart.  Inspiring to say the least.
0399157573|5.0|The story is about Scarpetta, Benton, Lucy and Marino working to solve the crime as someone within the FBI is corrupt and trying to keep them from learning the truth . This brings Benton into the foreground and we get a glimpse into his world as he struggles to work against the FBI and solve the case .<br />Marino has become a police officer again - And Kay is dealing with his new role - and the fact that they are no longer working companions<br />I don't know why the bad reviews - I really enjoyed it  :)
B000XUBFE2|5.0|With all that has been written about World War II, I have never read anything focussing on life for the German people much less focusing on a German child.  It is not preachy, but possibly because of the character of Death as narrator, it moves along with no judgments.  Yet, the humanity in the characters is evident.  There is no storybook ending, yet as in life, all of the pieces fit together. I wanted to know these characters and cared about them.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Fast downloads - the books I buy are already loaded as soon as I open my Kindle account. Love the carousel of recent reads! Bigger icons, all around a better reading experience.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone tells the story of author Ishmael Beah's horrifying journey as a child living in Sierra Leone during the time of the civil war between the ruling government and the RUF. From the beginning, the story both nauseates you as a reader, trying to imagine seeing and feeling all that he does as a twelve year old boy, while simultaneously leaves you wishing the next page will hold a better day for him. As you read through the chapters of the book and tag along Ishmael's heartbreaking journey, it is hard not to think of all the children that go through this today. I found this book so moving because it made me realize that most of the world is not aware of such terrors happening, and without awareness, how can we ever get it to stop? The next generation should be assigned stories like A Long Way Gone in order to see that not everyone wakes up and enjoy the world the same way. I would recommend this read as both a chilling story and an educational account of the effects of militarization.
B000059TPN|4.0|This is the best version of &#34;The Rock&#34; I've seen by far, in that both the image and sound are sharp and the thick black bars above and below of the standard widescreen presentation are gone. The only thing that this version lacks are subtitle options (which the standard &#34;The Rock&#34; DVD has: English, Spanish and French). If not for that, I'd give it a five.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great way to pass the time! Fun and adorable. Can not get enough of it. Super addicting. Easy to learn and play.
B00447G29S|5.0|This is one of the absolute best 3D movies around. It was definitely meant to be seen and made for 3D.
B005T87QCI|5.0|The only problem I see with the game is that when you pay the .99 credits it should make the game free and then still make there in app purchases
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Nice hidden object game. Had several hour of fun with this one. Not too easy, by t not so complicated that my 7 year old couldn't play with me
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love the game is very addicting, but is right what I read in one of the reviews, you have to be very patient.  I recommend it to those who likes this type of games.  I am just running out of magic pictures to open, I need more of this game.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|I see there are a lot of one-star reviews, but I thought this was almost as good as the other 'Lincoln Lawyer' book.  It certainly kept me turning the pages and I read it quickly. It was a little predictable, but I enjoyed been taken there anyway.  I recommend it for a quick fun read on a chilly winter night with a cup of steaming tea and an cozy afghan.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was written from an interesting perspective. There were moments of humor and tears. Can't wait to share with friends
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Worked pretty well for us. The real issue that Kindle Direct Publishing does not adequately address is the need for authors to have a preview copy before staging the final book. It can be done, but it's not obvious how to do that. Also, some of the peculiar formatting issues are simple ignored by Kindle Direct -- and cross-platform/version compatibility should always a goal in the ePub world.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great sequel to The Shining. Not as all-out terrifying as it's predecessor, but more heart and a lot of benefit from the intervening leveling-up of King's writing style.
B00ESY77LO|1.0|While it was well photographed, the screen play was terrible. Except for the general outline of the story, it did not capture anything of the novel. It seemed as if the film maker was so enthralled with the party and slum sets that they had no time for a screen play. Too bad. I really liked the novel.
0547391005|5.0|Love Curious George! My boys and I have listened to to the books on c.d. in the car over and over and over again. The stories are timeless.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I unfortunately did not have this great experience that everyone else does.  The image is blurry, and jumpy, and the sound does not match up with the people talking.  I will just stick to running a cable to the TV, for perfect picture and sound everytime!  While $35 isn't much, it was a waste of money.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|The dialog in this movie was outstanding. Very entertaining and most of the actors and actresses did an outstanding job. Brad Pitts character/ perfromance was a distraction to the the high quality performance of the others. The scenes in the French farm house at start of the movie were riveting.

B00FQMVCEA|4.0|Was this the best animated film of the year? Not at all, but is it deserving of the scathing reviews by film critics? NO! Critics make a big deal that it's the same as &#34;Cars&#34; but for planes, and I disagree. This one is about an underdog, this one is not tying-up the lead's role so much with a love interest (although that is secondary). This one is far more from the perspective of the individual conquering his own internal challenges. Yes, there are secondary characters that are cut-out from ones in &#34;Cars.&#34; What I am not hearing from critics is that this is closer to a storyline that takes us on the road for an adventure. I think the geography lesson, alone, is worth it for kids (geography is such a weak subject area for young people.) This one is far more about not allowing oneself to be stuck in a stereotype. Its about taking risks, even when that means we need to face what scares us most. This is not Oscar-worthy, but there are characters, lessons and heart really worth it for kids.
B00CE03UOC|3.0|Mindless fun so far. I can watch t.v. and play at the same time. I'm waiting to see if it gets harder
067144901X|5.0|This was one of my favorite books to read to my children when they were little and they were at the stage that they requested multiple readings of the same book. Over and over again.  It was fun to read in a sing-song voice, and now give it as a gift to new parents.

B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I think I keep reading this series out of habit.  Really tired of Scarpetta's introspection/self-absorption that seems to take precedence over the case at hand.  Solution to crime becomes an afterthought in the last few pages.  But will probably keep reading them--habit, you know.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I loved the plot and the characters, but the writing was too simple for me. I found myself skipping ahead of some parts. Too much attention was paid to insignificant parts of the plot, and areas that should have been explored in depth were not. It was frustrating to want to see how the story unfolded, but not to enjoy the writing.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Clay Fray wants her life to go back to normal. But since this is paranormal fiction, of course it doesn't. Her mom's on the hospital. Luke is a werewolf. And she's in love with her brother.<br /><br />  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!<br />Who's not her brother, so all you people out there who say  it's disgusting, it's not. They can't help it, and they aren't related so stop talking.<br />Right then. In this book we are introduced to a few new characters, including maryse , Maia, and the inquisitor. We get a little more of look at Jace and Alecs character, and the book is overall amazing. I especially loved Simon being turned into a vampire. There is a little bit of filler in this book, but the filler is interesting so who cares. One of Clares best works.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have been using Duolingo on PC for close to a year and just started with the mobile app. It is missing a couple of features from the full version, but it is still great.

B006GKHE6G|5.0|I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet with a Tegra3 processor and 2GB RAM.  Very few apps are designed to take advantage of this chipset, this app clearly is.  It looks and runs beautifully on my tablet.  The graphics are some of the best I've seen for a tablet, similar to what you'd see on a Playstation 2 or XBOX game.  The 3D objects are nice and clear, as are the textures, and the water looks fantastic.  Game play wise, it works as good as it looks.  The tilt steering works great on my device, better than a lot of car racing games I've tried.  The physics seem fairly realistic.  Your jet ski bobs around in the water and probably handles like a real one would.  The collision physics also seem realistic, except  you don't suffer any damage, at least not on the &amp;#34;Easy&amp;#34; tracks.  As good as all of that is, what is even better is that the game has no bad permissions or in app purchases, or anything like that.  You get a small selection of jet skis and tracks to start with, but unlocking content seems fairly painless.  I didn't play a lot, but I ran one  race on each of the unlocked &amp;#34;Easy&amp;#34; tracks right off the bat.  I placed  third in both races and that was good enough to unlock the first locked &amp;#34;Easy&amp;#34; track.  Also in this app's favor, there are no huge, annoying Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. buttons hogging space on your screen.  It's not that the game doesn't support social media, they are simply accessed through a menu for  those who want to do so, making them easy for the rest of us to ignore.  An Amazon Game Circle thing pops up when you first start the app, but that's fairly easy to ignore.  Overall, this is a very good app.  Five stars to the developers for creating a beautiful, polished racing app that's reminiscent of old school console racing games.
B00000IZOR|5.0|I like this one but the original is the one I remember. I do hate the cord has to be so short from the handset to the phone. This is a more modern look to an old classic. The memories...
030758836X|1.0|This has to be the sickest, worst book I have ever read. The person who wrote this must be horribly psychotic to conceive such a piece of trash. I read the beginning chapters, and when I realized we would go thru the trumped up prosecution of the husband I went right to the return. It is no wonder America I has such sick, demented  acts going on. Just read this crap for a road map. I think I actually paid an amazing $3.99 for this.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great and really fun too. I love it, and I suggest that you get the game immediately.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|Picking up shortly after Mickey Haller's disastrous run for District Attorney and it's aftermath, we get a look at his moral evolution through hard-learned lessons. He is a complex character often tripped up by his own bravado but reading about his life and career is always fascinating. Another great job by MC.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Great graphics for a mobile game, good music, and the gameplay is good. But earning credits is so tedious. Of course we could buy more credits but who even does that?<br /><br />Also a side note on the buying credits part, this one made me laugh. One of the choices for credit purchase is one hundred dollars. Who's going to pay one hundred dollars on a free game? Have people actually done this? Who and where are they?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|To know that children, innocent children, once lived in such a time, surrounded by the cruelty and hatred that was Nazi Germany during WWII, is unimaginable to me. Zusak portrays a young girl who uses words as her escape and refuge, and ultimately her salvation, during this shameful part of humanity's history. An ugly time written beautifully.
B005721W9O|1.0|This parody is a classic.  Cult following is justified. Best line?  &#34;Those poor people&#34;  Favorite line &#34;historical documents&#34;<br /><br />I watch this every year or so and still laugh!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very good book also a very surprising twist. I can't wait to read her other books. I couldn't put it down.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It's easy to use, updates quickly and the podcasts sound great. I would definately recommend getting this.
080214473X|5.0|The first moment I started reading Black Hawk Down I was hooked.  It was non-stop action from the first page.  I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of ten.  It contains some cursing and violence in a war setting.  I would give the book 10 out of 10 stars.  In addition to the book, there is also an outstanding movie called Black Hawk Down.  I would also recommend watching it as well. This was a great book that told an amazing story.  While reading this book and watching the movie Black Hawk Down I am reminded of how thankful I am to live in the USA!
B000XUBFE2|3.0|This book was good but not as eventful and exciting as I hoped. The ending was good but the rest of the book didn't keep my attention very well. I am usually fascinated by any book about ww2 and it was interesting to see it from a different perspective. Just not my favorite book
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I got this game for galaxy s3 as well as kindle fire and its awesome. Haven't got real far yet though.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love the game! Beautiful colors, nice different pics and puzzles, pretty easy to earn coins and crystals without purchasing with your own money. However, a little more guidance  would be nice. Different symbols, hints, and game modes not well explained. You kind of having  to figure some things out for yourself.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|This is a classic that anyone, any age will be sure to enjoy.  If you're a fan of Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, you must see this strange and surreal children's classic.
B00FXRTWQ8|3.0|Good graphics and smooth gameplay, but all the tanks and decorations are the same! Bummer cause each one basically winds up looking the same when finished.
1118109791|5.0|This book is so heavy! It is really great to do the practice exams and problems. However, the explanations of the answers suck.<br />The explanations in the book will confusion you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So far this game is sufficiently challenging to keep me interested but simple enough to be able to advance.  I heartily recommend it if you like problem solving. I thought it would help me keep my powers of observation sharp and it definitely has!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I was able to set up my acct quickly and was able to read, edit, and send mail through this...just like I did as if I was online.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I saw the movie Ender's Game before reading the book. I generally like to do the reverse. The book was much more involved than the movie but having seen the movie some of the big surprises in the book were given away.  The book is a quick read and definitely worth the time.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I like to be able to modify my Excel, Word pad and also be able to create more documents on my tablet or in my Dorpbox...this is something you really shouldn't live without if you do a lot of business documents
B005D63ICI|5.0|Love the show. I never thought I would like a killer but Dexter is special!! He has something that makes you fall in love with him even though he does bad things!! It's a serious show but funny too!!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I really like this date book.  I can put icons on my special days and it will repeat forever if I really want it to.  There's a preview window that shows what's going on today to help remind you of any upcoming events
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Love love love this show! If you want a creepy late night show to watch, pick this one! I'm hooked.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Not bad but you Need to be able to get more acorns . It's a great game very addictive. Didn't like some updates as it took all my acorns
0385537131|5.0|Have bought this book for my granddaughter will let you know later if she liked it ,she does like all his books tho & told me this is his latest book out & she wanted to buy it but grandma went ahead  and bought as a Christmas gift to her this year. I know she'll like it tho ,she loves all his books. I just bought myself a Kindle Fire Tablet  & plan on reading it soon  as soon as my Kindle get's here .Joyce lehman
B00E9A656K|5.0|I really like this game because I love racing I would reccommend this for 7-11year olds that's why I like this game
B000YMM3CC|5.0|A beautiful love story ,so  touching , you might even get tears in your eyes ,A must to buy and keep forever ,great movie Joyce Lehman
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Sorry to say I haven't listened to the entire CD yet. But from what I 've heard I can say this is a great addition to my Christmas collection.
0345536886|5.0|I gave this book as a gift to my granddaughter  she reads a lot of his books & she tells me it was a good book to read. so if she tells me it was ,I believe her ,I haven't read it yet tho ,she was happy to receive it tho. Joyce Lehman
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great game! The graphics are amazing and the amount of weapons makes it a great game. If you like frontline commando 1 you'll love this game
006202406X|1.0|Sadly dissappointed. The plot was poorly planned, and the ending was awful. I hate to read a series that is so good, that I read the first 2 books in just 3 nights after work everyday. The last book left we wanting more and wondering what the author was thinking!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|All ages will enjoy this one. It teaches you while you have fun. The graphics are also great.<br />So have fun friends.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|the latest update results in process errors with the kindle fire so often that the app is simply unusable. the earlier version was ok.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love how the English does a series.  Great stories w/ great actors.  Familiar faces through out the many I have watched. Their many different era stories intrigue me with how the &#34;classes&#34;  mingled or mixed.  Please offer the rest of this series and the many others that you only have the first series of.  Keep me a customer!
B0038LB3YK|5.0|DW at his best. Dark, dangerous and always unexpected. The type of book you cant put down just to be sure you not going to miss the next twist & turn
B00BC254I8|5.0|Great book, you'll understand his life and why he is what he is. This will make you more of a fan of Mike.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was so exciting to read and as a 9th grader, it had the perfect blend of dynamic characters, an exciting plot, and readability.  This was one of the best books I have ever read in my life, as I felt the same way as the characters in the story.  The only negative in this story was that the end of the story wasn't great, as it left the reader on edge (this just annoyed me as I felt so connected to the characters).  Overall this was a great read.
B006S08RLU|5.0|One of my favorite movies of the early 00s, and seeing it again on Blu-ray was a treat. The transfer was solid (I didn't do bench mark tests or anything of that technicality, just watched it on my Samsung HDTV and remembered how it looked in the theatre and the DVD I had, but hadn't watched in like 5 or 6 years). There are some flaws that are revealed, but I think that's a function of how CGI and other VFX compositing and coloring was done when the film was produced.<br /><br />The story, acting and directing is all top notch, as this film put Jean-Pierre Jeunet at the height of the internationally-acclaimed filmed directors after doing director-for-hire work on ALIEN 4.<br /><br />Always meant to be a love letter to the City of Lights, Amelie still carries its fairy tale charm (that you'll either love or hate, I happen to love it) and Audrey Tautou shines as the titular character. The director's signature is writ at large on this film, and its style is superbly executed.<br /><br />The extras on this Blu-ray mimic those from the DVD (at least I think, I don't remember what was on the DVD and I don't want to look that up, because anyone can do that at DVDBeaver or some site like that with better accuracy than I can give).
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|The extra clips only add to the splendor of this movie.  It's cinematic genius.  I'm glad they added in even more singing, to hold even truer to the book.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|If you don't mind  having a heart attack all the way to the end, don't see the movie.  Wow, it kept me biting my fingernails<br />all the time.  See it See it.
0804161380|5.0|Collectors edition box set with 6 guides for some of the greatest Zelda games ever! just makes wanting to play all of the zelda games over again just to use the guides, the gold laser etched bookmark is a nice touch as well.
0545626382|5.0|Although the third book is all about war, I truly enjoyed the books. Never crossed my mind to read the books but my<br />granddaughter loan me her set and force me to read them,  Surprise, I bought the set for me.
B00A81NFAS|2.0|I decided to watch the movie due to all the great reviews.  It started off promising.  However, about half way through (maybe a little more) when I got tired of waiting for something to happen, whether entertaining or not, I turned it off.  Maybe if had watched all the way to end, I would have been rewarded with the best ending ever.  But, I reasoned that I shouldn't have to sit through the most boring, pointless, attempt at depressing/funny(?) movie to see what is going to happen in the end.  Despite all the five star ratings and ravings on here, I still have no desire to reattempt to watch this entire movie.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Fantastic!! No wonder Jennifer Lawrence got an Oscar, it was well deserved.  The dance sequences were hilarious in<br />particular the very last one.
B005CRQ3NY|3.0|It was a good book.  But it wasn't the best book of the series. I recommend the third wheel that's a good book
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved this book. Scary description of a future world which seems very possible considering how addicted we all are to the internet and games or social media. Should be interesting to anyone who likes video games, virtual reality, computer geeks, sci fi, 1980's movies & games, and dystopian/ post apocalyptic genres. This book would make a great movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|beautiful fabrics, architecture<br />music/sound is awesome<br />cannot wait to watch the next episode<br />so glad this is available as I already purchased season1 and 2
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|The twists and turns were fun and exciting.  As a regular reader of fantasy, I thought this story was really unique. Locke is a great central character, I can't wait to read the rest.
0688152023|5.0|Stretches and warm-ups beautifully expressed and written and well worth doing accompanied by beautiful photos as well. Easy to follow and anyone should be able to do them.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|This game is very challenging and a lot of fun to play. The first couple of levels are fairly reasonable to beat, but then it gets tougher to advance to the next level. I am really glad I got this!
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|this is a fun game. But I have an ipad also and it has Leps world 3. so his cone its not on kindle yet???
B00703J38K|5.0|I see that Amazon has corrected the misinformation on this page. So I'm changing my rating to 5 stars. I love the CD and The Alabama Shakes, but I was REALLY PO'd when Amazon misrepresented this Movie Marrs CD offering as \\"We All Raise Our Voices to the Air\\".<br /><br />Alabama Shakes is a folk - rock - blues synthesis band which uses a lot of licks from such hill country blues greats as R.L. Burnside as well as all the down home 60's rock and folk instrumentals we all love. Their voices are perfect together and everything about this CD shines.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Awesome game with a lot of DC Comics characters. Fun to play and looks great! If you like fighting games and are a fan of comics definitely check this game out.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is the first book that kept me up 2 hours past my normal bedtime in a LONG time (I have a one-year-old) just so that I wouldn't have to stop the story...even though I wasn't close to finishing it! After I finished it, I went straight to the Kindle store and downloaded two more books by this author because I knew with certainty that I will enjoy (and thus devour) everything she's written.<br /><br />This book had just the right amount of suspense to keep me honestly racing through the chapters, trying to see what was happening and how on earth the characters would be able to resolve the tough issues they were facing. My favorite part, however, were the deep and meaningful layers to every thought and revelation the characters had. There were many instances in the book when I found myself pausing and reflecting on what I'd just read, and the honest underlying truth in it.<br /><br />I believe in regards to love, relationships, family, and values, some things are just easier to never have to fully realize or think about - and I think this book truly brings that reality to life.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|This app is AWESOME... I have in installed in my phone &&& my tablets :) NO COMPLAINTS:) did I mention it's AWESOME&#34;/
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Nice and easy read. Amusing style of writing that kept me interested. Everything in this book made sense! There are a lot of these books on the market but this is the first time it actually made sense to me. Pam put all of the information in simple terms. Very impressed!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|red green blue plus purple and pink one two three four five six seven eight ten<br /> Van truck car sick Rick Jim Tom peanut butter jelly
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|It is a great movie and the copy was in perfect condition.  I didn't like the mandatory viewing of the trailers for other movies, however.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I was trying to watch a video but my stupid youtube kept on pausing and when it didn't pause, it only stayed on for 3 secs and then it pause.
B00DQVST76|1.0|The DVD was released and pulled out because of A major production flaw. I was so excited about it. I saw the MDNA show in L.A. So when it finally arrived in the mail and I put it on. When the picture froze up within the first 5 minutes I was not happy. So I returned it and when I got the new copy. THE SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED! It froze up before Madonna made her entrance!!! So by now I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!! So I eturned it again and then I find out that I am getting a refund. It was no longer in stock, So needless to say. This was really demented.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush:  Definitely five stars.  My favorite game evah!  I honestly  couldn't be happier. Way better than Temple Run or Subway surf.  If you don't have this game, you need to get it now. Its free, their is no reason not to.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|One of my favorites of Album's books. An adult fairy tale with a deep message. This is one of those books I will always remember
1451666179|5.0|Hilarious, made me laugh out loud. Currently trying to convince the rest of my friends to read it. Very fun.
B004I744AS|5.0|A dictionary always in your hands is so wonderfully convenient love!!! (: I will use it frequently, thank you very much! Have a blessed day!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I had a mlp and it got deleted and I was on level 45..... is there any chance u can get me back.... thank you
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is really fun. It can get hard at times, but if you win enough of the levels, you will have enough coins to get help in a level,  and never run out because you get coins each time you win a level. I would say this game is really fun, and a lot of people would agree.
0547338007|3.0|Seller: Great. Fast shipping. Packaged well. In excellent condition. Truly.<br /><br />Book: &#34;Eh.&#34; The book seems like its going out of it's way to be abstract. It just makes the story seem rushed. The curt dialogue loses the charm of the original book. Doesn't capture real innocence which is the true intent of the original book. Sexualizes the flower. so wrong! lol
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think this is a fantastic book with a great message. It tells you no matter what you look like or who you are, you can be loved and there is always a place for you no matter what. It is a beautiful book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I LOVE playing with my kids and myself l o 've this game n when WHEN WE open new pony
B00BT70J6S|5.0|With surprisingly good sound, clean backgrounds that preserve a measure of hall ambience, this set is an important addition to all pianophile's collections, even those — like myself — who own dozens of VH's recordings. It includes a great deal of his standard repertoire, sometimes as in the case of Kreisleriana, Moussorgsky's Pictures, or the Tchaikovsky concerto, in more than one iteration. This is by no means a complete traversal of is live playing of course. There's no Schumann Humoreske, no later Liszt Sonata, and the live Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff concertos he did with Barbirolli and the NYP are not included. I am not absolutely sure they were offered at Carnegie Hall, of course. But where else would they have occurred? Anyway, a marvelous job. And Kabalevsky, well represented here, comes across as a neglected composer of stature, when played at this level. This set is self-recommending. Although he had his blind spots and interpretive flaws, there was — and only will be for all time — only one Horowitz.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I LOVE it<br />I ALL WAYS PLAY IT WITH MY daughter ALL the time<br />I like when u get New pets
B00631HASU|5.0|A beautifully designed game with an incredible soundtrack. Worth buying this one. I was lucky to get it on app of the day. I will be checking out this developers other offerings!! .
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I am excited they finally put this on the Appstore  it is very fun and easy to play surely enjoyable for all ages
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is fun, hilarious , and very cool! Me and my sister love it!<br />You can chose minions for the run and locations too! If you get the app then we suggest getting the upgrade it is awesome!  There are more things to do on the app too! Please get it!<br /><br />Thanks ,Katherine and Gianna LaPonte
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|With all apps I am disappointed when it requires a small fortune to play, however it is better than some that do. Bugs are a minimum, having fun playing. Great graphics.
1449433251|4.0|Got this set for my husband for Christmas. He didn't want the hardback set and was happy to see that it was available in paperback form. He knew he was getting it and couldn't wait until Christmas. He got it early! Loves it!
0061353248|3.0|Interesting examples but somewhat redundant. Not a fault of the book but as a statistic s teacher was actually hoping for a bit more math/stats.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is a descent game, it can be a challenge at times,fun at most times,but it can be frustrating too. The game should update more often my wife has a spin wheel on hers but I don't . I think all the games should have the same options. The other problem is if you try to use the extra moves option from your gift list it doesn't work but it still takes the gift away. That's not right!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is a lot of fun and I highly rated it.  This past week (early December, 2013) there has been a popup that said &#34;Free Gold&#34; and said there was a bank... but I can't find any bank anywhere and have the same amount of gold that I have had for several weeks.  So I wish there was a place on the site/in the game to be able to ask questions or get answers to commonly asked questions (an FAQ with a limited number of 'big' issues and someplace to go to ask the less commonly asked questions). I know and understand that there are to be 'hard levels' so that there is a challenge, but after &#34;getting stuck&#34; on one level it frankly gets boring to see the same old same old patterns.  I also know and understand that King.com has these kinds of levels so people will purchase more lives or more moves or whatever (and they are apparently making a big bundle of money off people who buy extra moves and lives).  But I am playing it just for some brain activity and will not spend a penny of my fixed income on any extra moves or lives or anything, unless I could have it donated to a charity, then I would purchase some things sometimes.  I like that some friends can give additional lives and moves and tickets and whatever -- and every time I see that someone needs lives or tickets or other moves orr whatever that I can give them for free, I do so.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and interesting game...it gets harder as you go....I had to get a pencil and paper to help on some levels
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This has been a great game that I play with my daughter. really very enjoyable. it is very colorful and simple but still challenging. I am very glad it is now available on the Kindle.
B000AARKOO|5.0|This is one powerful drama of a movie. NON STOP good old knight vs knight movie. If you like to see good battles watch this movie NOW. It will really surprise  you.... FIGHT ON ~~~!!! Forget the story line just FIGHT for Victory and peace~~~!!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Saw this when it first came out. Just as good the second time. Some of the episodes in season 1 were in black and white - the rest in color. Good either way. There is also a 2012 version of Upstairs Downstairs - even better. Downton is the best but we like them all.
B00FN811SY|2.0|I rated only two stars not for the content in the app but because I am unable to use on my first generation Kindle Fire :(<br />I have the app on my other devices and is terrific, so the content in the app is given five stars!!
1451638450|5.0|A book to make you smile. If you've read anything else by Lois McMaster Bujold, you don't need my review to tell you to go out and buy it now! If you've never read anything by Bujold, this delightful book may not be the place to start, as it features many characters from previous novels.
B00DNB9RXO|1.0|Five times I removed this game to the cloud, and five times it pushed itself back onto my home screen.<br /><br />No way, you're gone!
B008JFUPPI|4.0|Not sure why people are so critical of this movie, I thought it was pretty good. I'm not buying the MIB comparison either, it was different enough to be its own movie.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Not his best work, but it was an enjoyable quick read and worth your time if you're a Brandon Sanderson fan.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|When I first got this game I was totally in love with it. Then it started freezing up and wouldn't let me play at all. If the glitches weren't there, then it would be a five star game, but since it would not let me play for two days straight I give it three stars.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Who ever would have thought about the subculture of the below decks when they notice the alarming trend of red shirts getting killed off when in proximity to the senior officers - as well as the miraculous recuperative powers of the ship's navigator!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has been on a resurgence which Dr Sleep continues. Great character development, interesting plot, a realistic look at alcoholism, and a fast read. It ties up loose ends from the Shining in an interesting way. Highly recommended.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I read both books and I've watched this movie countless times. Love it. Hope they are coming out with the 2nd movie!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun games lots. of. fun entrainment<br />would. recommend. to friends and family. there. is a game for all abilities and ages to play
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This was a great ending to a wonderful series. Even though some parts were predictable in the beginning there were a lot of twists that really surprise. I will definitely recommend this to my friends.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|My wife loves this super group of true 80's rock! Def Leppard is dynamite in this return to the stage! 80's Rock Rules!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Another great cd at a great price and quick delivery  I will go back for more music. Packaging is very good.
0792162803|5.0|My wife loves this movie, well we both do it's stupid-funny! Dumb humor and quirk moments had the family laughing constantly!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'll admit I struggled through the first third of the book.  Guess it took me awhile to warm up to the characters.  I'm now looking forward to the sequel.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My wife and daughter love the Hunger Games! Hungry for more! Great Entertainment for All the family to watch! Can't wait for the sequel!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Very easy setup and lots of customizability, love custom snooze times and shake to disable. Kinda wish I bought it in the play store but I had amazon credits to use so...
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband.  Many of her movies are exciting to watch, and always keeps you guessing.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a very well written movie. It seems to keep you interested through the whole show. I hope the 2nd one is done as well.
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|It started out a little slow but toward the end they really brought it home.  Good movie and would watch again.  There needs to be a sequel.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|An underappreciated sci-fi, action film. Want DREDD? THIS is the movie. As in the comics, he doesn't remove his helmet and dispenses judgment, and execution, with a grim chin.
B00FGFVMGA|2.0|I didn't find much of a plot.The progression of the game was tedious and honestly ,the way the clues were put together made little to no sense.I found it to be rather boring. As with most of these type adventures ,you click on an obvious item and place it somewhere else with no rhyme or reason. Why we're these items put where they were to begin with? I guess for those who like it,have fun with that ,but for me, I'd rather the game made sense. And by the way, it was short too..really short so don't expect it to go for very long. And it ends abruptly too...
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Be careful with the accessories if you remove them from the box. Merle's gun has a breaking/weak spot at the butt of the weapon. Daryl is perfect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! A definite recommendation for those who love the Despicable Me movies. It's sort of like Temple Run and Subway Surfers, but it's much more fun. I recommend this app to most ages, because it's easy and fun! I love this game!
B0049IHX2C|4.0|What is not to like with the 2nd  movie, that is as good as the first.  Hilarious.  Tommy Lee Jones and will Smith have a very good screen prescence together.
