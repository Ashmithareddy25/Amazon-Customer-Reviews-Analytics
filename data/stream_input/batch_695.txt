0061139378|5.0|Neil Gaiman does a few things many authors neglect to do when writing for kids:    1) He includes humor. This book had some great funny parts to balance out the scary bits.    2) He doesn't underestimate his heroine. Coraline is a kid, but that doesn't mean she's not resourceful and bright. She manages to match wits with an evil entity living in a parallel universe without some deus ex machina coming out of the blue to save her. Kids can empathize with her, but adults aren't alienated by her age.    3) It's creepy, but not *too* creepy. Gaiman strikes a perfect balance. He never goes overboard, but he doesn't assume his intended readership is too wimpy to handle some scary parts.    Besides all that, the novel is, simply put, engaging. The atmosphere in the book is wonderful and does a great job of setting the scene. All the characters are unique and portrayed well. The book moves at a very brisk pace.    I'd recommend Coraline to anyone, child or adult, looking for a good adventure story.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|RHCP have been my favorite band for years.  As you can imagine I was hungry for their new material.  I bought this immediately after it came out and all I can say is WOW! This is, by far, their best work.  THey show such a range of musical talent from balladry to hard rock to funk (often in just one song).  Even thought it is a double CD set, they have left me craving for more.  Let's just say, I have had a year to totally wear it out.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|This movie is only moderately entertaining, but what it lacks in its odd pacing and mediocre character development it makes up in intellectual appeal. Upon reflection, it's kind of an odd mix of mass Hollywood appeal and thought-provoking ideas. In this movie, the two elements don't really mesh.    On the one hand, it has the feel of an action movie. Though I'm not much into action movies these days, the action sequences here do exceed most action movies. These sequences are visually and technically stunning, and most of them are filled with new ideas. But aside from their impressiveness, the main pitfall of this movie, and of the whole trilogy, is how it uses action - the action gives the story its texture, but it's simply too conventional. When car-chases or gunfights or karate fights begin, the viewer's mind is intentionally put on pause, and s/he's encouraged to dig into the fight and give into the adrenaline rush. It reminds me of my intense dislike for musicals; even if a musical has a good plot and sound characters, when the music is cued, everything is put on hold for song and dance, when I'm just waiting for things to continue. Likewise, the action sequences here arrest the plot development. They're still entertaining, but in a very short-lived manner. The fighting compares well with every other movie with similar fighting, but it's poorly integrated into the story of The Matrix; and even if it proves groundbreaking, its influence will dissipate as directors one-up these movies by coming up with more exciting ways to have one character chase or demolish another.     The last hour of Revolutions is told in two consecutive unrelenting battles; it results in a long-lived and exciting climax, but it turns the viewer's attention away from the film's plot, and merely towards sigh and relief when the tension stops. And for all it was worth, by the time we reach the end, the plot developments feel minor in comparison.     The ending doesn't quite feel worth it, butit does convey the thought that went into the story's structure. In retrospect, it works very well in theory; it's almost like one of those complicated gun standoffs where more three or so characters are pointing guns at each other in various directions (and in touching every single past convention, the film does contain a brief literal version of this). Only here the characters exist and influence each other on different levels and in different worlds, and they're eventually brought together by similar yet conflicting interests. Moreover, each side pointing guns is made to represent different intertwining ideas. On one level, in order to accomplish this, the movie does occasionally spell things out too clearly to the viewer with pseudo-philosophical rants; but more importantly the characters end up playing out these roles and \\"ideas\\" - the structure of the story walks the walk so to speak.    To avoid spoiling it I won't give too much away. In and of itself, the end is fairly simple, but what has continued to impress me is how the movie's sequences of events arrived there from a \\"perfectly balanced equation\\" (which we hear about in The Matrix Reloaded), that pitted two seemingly contrasting ideas on different sides in order to fulfill its purpose. There is an inevitable logic to the \\"solution\\", which speaks to the trilogy as a whole.    But as I said before, most of this is painted in cheeky Hollywood clothing, complete with Bond-like sarcasm, overuse of stunt-men and CGI-effects, and dispensable characters and side-plots. With a lesser budget and geared towards a smaller adudience, the story could have been told in a tighter and more efficient manner in three or four hours if it had less focus on fighting, and more focus on the characters and the different levels of the story. But not to ruminate on what it could have been, I was glad that the movie challenged me more than most large-scale movies and gave me something pretty to watch at the same time. Hopefully it'll raise the bar for other mainstream flicks, beyond just by giving us new ways to film people shooting each other.
0767818040|4.0|I am a Brian DePalma's fan. I love his style, his visual uniqueness, his ability to grab me from the very opening of his films and not let me take my eyes off the screen until the very last moment and even after that keep me a captive of his dangerous yet seductive worlds. I liked a lot every De Palma's film I've seen: The Black Dahlia (2006), Femme Fatale (2002), Snake Eyes (1998), Mission: Impossible (1996), Carlito's Way (1993), The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990), Casualties of War (1989), The Untouchables (1987), Scarface (1983), Dressed to Kill (1980), and Carrie (1976).<br /><br />As with all his films, you either love \\"Body Double\\" and let its typical De Palma's over-the-top charm, his mesmerizing beautiful camera movements, his 20 minutes long, dialogue-free pursuit sequence, his intense interest in exploration of sexual \\"dysfunction,\\"  his constantly present obsession with voyeurism, his satire on making cheap horror and adult movies, and his loving yet humorous homage to several Alfred Hitchcock's films  overwhelm you or you just dismiss it scornfully for its most impossible and unbelievable story, for the plentiful coincidences and the holes in the plot, for the  excessive  violence, and for its sensationalism and exploitation. I found \\"Body Double\\" shocking, poignant, satirical, often hilarious, and always highly entertaining. Once again, De Palma did not disappoint me. I figured from the beginning where the story of a struggling B-movie actor (Craig Wasson) with many problems (claustrophobia that cost him a part in a horror movie, break-up with a cheating girlfriend, witnessing a gruesome murder and becoming a possible suspect) would lead. It did not stop me from enjoying the film and admiring De Palma's ability to trick me not just once but many times by making me see what he only wanted me to see, yet never hiding the whole picture and using to perfection his magic camera that \\"lies all the time; lies 24 times/second\\". I believe that De Palma himself has provided the keys to better understanding and enjoying his films when he said, \\"My films deal with a stylized, expressionistic world that has a kind of grotesque beauty about it.\\" All we have to do - to recognize the beauty behind the grotesque.<br /><br />P.S.

B000M5B6Q0|5.0|This is another instance where I thought the movie was, \\".....eh\\", but I love the soundtrack.    I was a little irked at what I felt was another attempt to show that the 80s was nothing more than a vapid, superficial decade which only produced goofy, forgettable, lightweight fluff.  Yes, there was a lot of that, but there were also many serious, moving, culture-defining moments as well.  If we want to assume that \\"My Humps\\" summarizes all of the music produced during the current decade, then I'll buy in that \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\\" was what the 80s was all about.    Anyway, half of songs here are designed to sound like they came out in the mid-80s; obviously the ones Hugh Grant sings on are supposed to be like the equivalent of Wham! (not that Wham! was a synth-pop band, but whatever).  And I have to say - they're great songs, and it's a pleasant surprise that Hugh sings; his voice works well with these songs!      When I went to see this movie, people in the audience were laughing at the \\"music video\\" for \\"Pop Goes My Heart\\", and I was like, \\"Why are you laughing??  Videos were in their infancy back then, so many of them by today's standards do appear kind of goofy!\\"  Awesome song; love the \\"crash\\" after \\"Pop\\" during the chorus.  \\"Meaningless Kiss\\" is a great knock-off of \\"Careless Whisper\\" (whatever happened to the infamous saxophone solos anyway?).  \\"Tony The Beat\\" is reminiscent of \\"Push It\\" by Salt N' Peppa, and for the longest time I couldn't decide if the singing during the chorus was annoying or not; eventually I decided it wasn't (although just barely).    Now, on the \\"current day\\" songs, I love the Haley Bennett songs; the best being \\"Buddha's Delight\\" and especially \\"Entering Bootytown.\\"  I know these songs were written to sound like the typical Britney Spears/teen pop music from a few years back, but they're great songs regardless.  There's no reason why these songs wouldn't (or shouldn't) be as popular as songs by the artists in which they were inspired by.      I was initially angered that Haley's songs were so wonderful, but that she was just playing a character for this movie so I'd never hear anything else from her.  However, I see that she will be coming out with her own album soon.    I have to commend the writers of the songs on this soundtrack.  Though they wrote songs as if to sound like they came from a specific time period, they still created some great songs.  However the problem with loving songs by these fictional characters is that - you want more, and unfortunately the majority of music is just relegated to this one album.  But if Haley's material sounds anything like what appears on this soundtrack, at least that will pacify my desire to hear more.

B00005JPAO|4.0|The cleverness of the premise of THE QUEEN--together with its career-defining performance by Helen Mirren--helped put it over the top with most critics in 2006 when it was released. Even now, when it's possible to look at it with a bit more soberness, it seems pretty nifty. The whole idea of doing a serious and intelligent look at the function of the constitutional monarch in contemporary Britain during its period of greatest trial (the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the outpouring of grief it produced and its new demands for a response from the queen) is just about irresistible, and the performance of Helen Mirren in the title role is nothing short of astounding.  One of the key plot devices (the hunting of the giant stag, \\"The Monarch of the Glen,\\" concurrent with the press and the Labor government's stalking of the queen) does come out as heavy-handed even more than when the film was released, and at times the film does seem a bit too much of a valentine to Elizabeth II. Despite her claims to her prime Minister Tony Blair of not going in for \\"glamour and tears\\" in moments of grief, we do get to see her suffering and mourning (both for Diana and for tradition) in private, and she's surrounded by such a pack of stiffs away at Balmoral that it's impossible not to feel sympathetic for her. The film conceives the other members of her family as strictly two-dimensional: Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is a sour bully, the Prince of Wales (Alex Jennings) is an opportunistic whiner, and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) is an addled tippler. Compared with this lot, how could she help but come out smelling like a rose? Fortunately, Mirren is unafraid of bringing out the character's sourness when it suits her, and occasionally makes some wonderfully unexpected withering comments to her secretary (Roger Allam) and to Tony Blair (Michael Sheen, also terrific). Even though this is a plum role, Mirren is such a brave and strong actress that she makes even more of it than you'd think: she's absolutely marvelous in the final scene, where the hurt queen comes to meet with Tony Blair months after he thinks they have scored a victory with the public relations over Diana's funeral while she's still smarting from the wounds inflicted upon her by her people.    The big disappointments with this DVD release are its extras. There are some lovely moments on the \\"Making of..\\" brief documentary where Mirren explains her approach to the character, but there should have been much more from her and Michael Sheen. There are two sets of commentaries, one from royal expert Robert Lacey that's pretty standard (explaining away all the minor bits of court etiquette) and one from the director Stephen Frears speaking with the screenwriter Peter Morgan that's nothing short of disastrous. Obviously Frears and Morgan did not prepare for the commentary properly and felt that they had said everything about the film that needed to be said, because they offer very few illuminations about their ideas behind the work or the acting and directing; instead, they natter on about such dull trivia as why James Cromwell wears two dressing gowns and how the rooms they used to stand in for the drawing rooms at Buckingham Palace look nothing like the real thing. They come across as every bit as self-satisfied and as unrevealing as the very people the story is about. So skip the commentaries, and stay instead with the fine film as it is.

B00005JKG9|5.0|Amazing work by Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Jack Lemmon! Arkin and Spacey aren't bad either in this exceptionally well-written drama.  Couple of minor complaints: Jonathan Pryce's mouse of a man who couldn't seem to get two words out without stammering. His part was agony to sit through. Yes, I know, it was intended this way by Mamet, still...painful to witness. Pacino character is a slimey sleazebag in this flick and rather unpleasant to experience. This, too, was intentional.  Okay. I get it.    My only real beef is that the film was too short. Something like this should be longer--because the characters are so damn believable and their dilemmas so real.    To me, this is basically the human condition (from day one): struggle and more struggle (and the real estate office nothing more than a metaphor--although quite powerful and appropriate.)     Hey, what would life be without a few obstacles?    Mamet has written a winner of a flick here (based on his award-winning play.) Gotta be proud.    Oh yeah, the only thing I (mildly) resent is Mamet borrowing \\"The Machine\\" monicker (for Shelley Levine) from the late, great Nelson Algren and his Man With the Golden Arm  tome.

0061120073|5.0|I love this book. I don't know if I have ever read a book so fast. It took me a total of 3 days to complete it. I love the detail in which it is written and the relationships between the characters. I think it's a fine example of what it means to come of age, and shows how, as we get older we understand and look at things differently then we once had. I read some of the lower star reviews and I don't think it was slow moving or plotless. The plot is life, and sometimes life isn't gun slinging and damsels in distress. If you don't want to commit to the buy, check it out of the library and see for yourself.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|I LOVE this album, and I've listened to it seven times in the past two days, but for some reason it doesn't always feel like the Pumpkins.  It doesn't feel like Zwan or BC's solo album, but it doesn't feel like the Pumpkins all the time, either.  I think a lot of that has to do with me knowing it was only Billy and Jimmy in the studio.  Even if Jeff and Ginger had been involved in recording the album would feel more SP-like to me.  I hope the next album has help from Jeff and Ginger.  The music, though, is wonderful.  The Pumpkins have done something different but have returned a bit to their roots.  The harder rocking songs are definite highlights, but tracks such as \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\" and \\"Neverlost\\" are lyrically the strongest.  I'm pleased with this album, and it's very listenable.  I'm not going to take Zeitgeist too seriously, though, because this album is really for SP to get established again.  I think that there are better things to come.

Incredible character development, great story lines... the only downside is that it is so short.  You can only imagine what would have happened in season 2.

0465092756|5.0|As most people know Not Even Wrong is critical of String Theory. What I did not realize going into the book was the detail it delves into in describing events leading up to String Theory, especially events having to do with the Standard Model. I think the book is worth reading just for this information which spans half of the book. I don't know whether String Theory is right or not as I am not a physicist but I do believe that criticism is a healthy thing and that the author is clear in his criticism of String Theory. I would have wished for more information on other Unified Theories but he devotes only one chapter to this. I guess, as the author points out, there is only one game in town and it is String Theory.
B000OY8NII|5.0|As a fan of The X-Files, I immediately was drawn to EUReKA's \\"there's something going on around here that isn't quite right\\" atmosphere. The show isn't totally like The X-Files, as there's been no real alien activity...yet. But more than any other show, EUReKA is The X-Files spiritual offspring. The cast of characters is already quite large, and each of them are interesting in their own way.    The storylines are that of the fantastic, and since the show is built upon the fact that the town of EUReKA is made up entirely of brilliant minded scientists and inventors, the writers have set up an instance where the show could just keep on going for years, and as long as the writing stays sharp, I hope it does.  I saw the first episode of season 2 last night, and even as good as last season was, this new episode was even better!    What i found cool about the DVD set was the disc trays are made out of a biodegradable material which is essentially paste made out of potatos. It's a lot harder of a substance than you'd think, and actually seems almost as durable as soft plastic, or maybe twice as strong a heavy cardboard. The downside is the little prongs that hold the DVD's in aren't quite strong enough and the DVD's pop out quite often. Hopefully they'll toughen them up a bit for the season 2 set of DVD's.    There's about 10 hours of bonus features on the DVD set, including commentaries on certain episodes, podcasts, webisodes and other things.
1932907009|3.0|Don't buy this book for its title. It's definitely NOT the last book you'll ever need. Mr. Snyder does have very good ideas and good points to share with us, but if you really want to write a screenplay you'll need more than just this book.     If Blake Snyder had titled this book something other than \\"The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need\\" I would have rated this book higher. Unfortunately however, this book doesn't deliver what it promises. It delivers a few priceless concepts on screenwriting, but leaves out a wealth of other simple and practical advice contained in so many other books - advice it seems Mr. Snyder assumes we've heard before.    Having said that, I'm thrilled that I DID buy the book and if need be I'd buy it again just for Mr. Snyder's valuable insight.

B0000028M7|3.0|I admit- I checked this album out because people have been comparing Alice In Chains to Black Sabbath, and people have been telling me Dirt is the closest thing to a Sabbath record you will find.  Well, not really.<br /><br />Black Sabbath is much heavier, not to mention mainly focus on writing guitar riffs and adding tempo changes at unusual moments (at least, the original version of the band).  The music on Dirt is instead almost identical to the several other derivative grunge rock artists.  The Kurt Cobain comparisons are completely logical since Layne Staley and Kurt have identical-sounding voices and often utilize similar singing tendencies (Kurt tends to whine less, however, and Nirvana focuses more on tighter songwriting and snappier vocal melodies whereas Layne often doesn't know when to stop singing).  Some people will claim the music on this album is progressive rock, while others just call it heavy metal.  To me, it sounds exactly like the music Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden and others were doing at the time- shallow music that's not quite as heavy or memorable as people seem to believe.<br /><br />Admittedly, lyrically Dirt is probably not a shallow album however.  It accurately represents the realistic portrayal and repercussions of heavy drug usage, and I imagine many drug addicts and teenagers can relate.  Musically however, in germs of guitar playing and mainly the riffs and solos, this stuff is mediocre at best.  I'd imagine any one of us could write guitar riffs like the ones featured on Dirt with just two weeks of guitar lessons since they're not the least bit creative or memorable despite the 3 or 4 listens I've given the album so far.  The drumming is probably a better aspect at least.  In fact easily the instrument that excites me the most.<br /><br />When it comes down to it however, Layne Staley is a distraction more often than not.  He does *not* have a suitable or listenable enough vocal range to make his vocal melodies soar, and unfortunately for us, his voice soars quite often.  In fact it seems to be his forte.  I have a difficult time playing \\"Rain When I Die\\" without cringing due to his inability to stop whining.  For anybody to compare Alice In Chain's Dirt to a band from the 70's or 80's means they are severely misguided, and I can't take them seriously.  Alice In Chains is original in that they're part of the early 90's grunge movement even though that's hardly something to care about, and whether Alice In Chains is a positive influence or not is up for debate.  I personally think they're a negative influence.  If all these generic alternative grunge bands nowadays are citing Alice In Chains as an influence... yeah, a negative influence.  Simply put, when your lead singer spends all his time whining, it drastically takes away the impact that the lyrics are going for.  To be fair, Layne isn't awful *all* the time.  On Dirt, he's awful 75% of the time.<br /><br />Dirt feels like a one-dimensional album due to every song having an identical style (soft-to-heavy guitar riffs, negative effects of taking drugs, lead singer refusing to stop whining) though admittedly sometimes it works to the bands advantage.  \\"Them Bones\\" is a pretty good way to introduce someone who's never heard Alice In Chains before, with a smack of an updated rock sound to kick things off.  It's energetic, and a pretty good tune.  I think the best melodic moment on the album comes on \\"Down In a Hole\\".  It has an upbeat vocal melody (despite the lyrical message) but it's not *that* great.  Perhaps I like the drumming most of all.  The song kind of gets boring after a couple minutes.  The verse melody is pretty good, but the chorus seems average to me which overall hurts the song a little.  The chorus is, once again, too whiny.  The overlapping vocal section near the end hurts it too.  Actually, repeated listens reveal a rather sappy-sounding track, overall.  The frightening lyrics may have been dangerousand unlike anything else back in the day, but now I can imagine grandmothers humming the melody.<br /><br />\\"Sickman\\" is the whiniest moment of the entire album and it's hard to listen to.  \\"Rooster\\" is only worthwhile for the way Layne blurts out \\"Yeah they've come to snuff the rooster\\" even though this line is out of place it sounds in comparison to the rest of the sloppily-made tune, and I suppose the \\"He ain't gonna die\\" line is slightly memorable too.  Actually I can't help but think the guitar riffs resemble Black Sabbath's \\"Electric Funeral\\" quite a bit.  Speaking of \\"Electric Funeral\\" comparisons, the worst song on the album is definitely \\"Hate to Feel\\".  It's based around an unlistenable and incomplete verse melody that takes up a good chunk of the song, and the song overall is quite annoying except for the \\"All this time I swore I'd never be like my old man\\" line.<br /><br />\\"Junkhead\\" is pretty close to a Black Sabbath track with its dreary tone and atmosphere.  Good track, despite being derivative in the guitar playing.  I can't get into the rest of the song, even after all these years.  Too whiny, but I like the drumming.  The \\"What's my drug of choice\\" part screams generic Motley Crue-inspired hair metal too.  I actually love the dreamy guitar line in the middle of the song.  Amazing, in fact!  As for \\"Angry Chair\\", I'm not a fan of the intentionally careless style on the part of the lead singer.  Sounds like he's deliberately dragging his vocal style through the verse melody for the sole purpose of being intentionally annoying.  I'm not a fan of that.  Actually the entire song seems to go back and forth between clumsy and obnoxious vocal melodies.  I can't have it both ways, but the \\"Can't find it anywhere/I don't mind\\" part is actually awesome.  I wish the entire song was based around *that* part!  \\"Would\\" is more or less the same thing, though shorter and perhaps sadder (at least in the intro).  Layne's vocals then come in and the sadness isn't as noticeable anymore.  I actually like this song though.<br /><br />Overall, I don't consider Dirt a classic album, and don't understand people who do.  Its influence is negative, and the quality of the songwriting is normally average at best.  People rate this album like it's the most important rock album ever made but it's not even close.  It would have to generate some kind of personal reaction out of me in order to award it such a high accolade, and then maybe I'd consider it worthy of legendary statis.  As it is, no, no way.  We need a more tolerable singer to accomplish a \\"best album of all time\\" feat.
B000E6EJAC|4.0|A great album by a great band.  But when oh when will we get the FULL UK single version of 'One Of The Boys', which clocks in at over 5 minutes (basically the same as the album version but withourt the infernal telephone dialling 'effects').  Surely there must be a master out there somewhere - until then I'll stick to my scratchy old 45...
B000005RTG|5.0|It's a shame Come Taste the Band has been ignored compared to other Deep Purple albums.  What we have here is a pretty darn good album that should appeal to anyone who's a fan of 70's classic rock.  Just because the lineup is different from the classic one does NOT mean the music on this album should automatically be criticized.  Please don't let peoples negativity encourage you to avoid it (though thankfully, most of the people here on amazon are rather kind to the album).      I really can't find one complaint with the music here.  Well okay, sometimes some of the guitar riffs sound like something Bad Company would do (think \\"Rock Steady\\") but Deep Purple were always more talented than that band (no disrespect to Bad Co.) and there's certainly more activity between the band members on this album compared to anything early Bad Company would have done.  That makes Come Taste the Band, though stripped down hard rock, sound full and exciting like the rest of Deep Purple's catalog.      The only thing that bothers me is the absense of keyboards.  I think I can hear SOME keyboards playing in a couple of the songs, but it's nothing like Deep Purple had done in the past, featuring lengthy jams.  That's the only thing I miss.      \\"Comin' Home\\" starts off the album the right way, featuring a really good middle section that's nothing but a big, memorable guitar jam.  Tommy Bolin really is just as good as Mr. Blackmore in most areas.  At least, his solos are just as good.    If there was ever an album that sounds perfect for truck drivers, it's this album.  Every truck driver in the world should be required to own Come Taste the Band.  \\"Lady Luck\\" reminds me of Bad Company (sorry for bringing up the comparison again) with a great chorus.  \\"Gettin' Tighter\\" is a perfect \\"Driving late at night on a quiet empty Nevada highway\\" song (though I've never done that, seeing as how I live on the east coast in Pennsylvania).    \\"I Need Love\\" is very catchy.  I love that riff.  \\"Love Child\\" is another rocker that features a memorable riff (and no, it's not related to the Diana Ross and the Supremes song- though I bet some of you were thinking it was a cover version!)     Doesn't \\"This Time Around\\" remind you of walking through a ghost town in a desert?  It sure does!  I love the instrumental second half.  \\"You Keep on Movin\\" again reminds me of travelling down a highway, but this time through Maryland (let's keep it close to home, mister).      Overall, yeah, it's not a masterpiece but it's a quality hard rock album.  Probably in my top 5 favorite Deep Purple albums, if I were to make a list of them.
B00006AW2M|5.0|This review is for people who know the album well, but are not sure if the 2002 Abkco remaster is worth buying the album  again.   Buy it! The 80's Abcko CD's are muddy and flat.  The remasters are clean and dynamic, with nice seperation between instruments.         Hearing the remaster is a revalatory experience which made me appreciate the  album all the more.  I now understand that the rumbling drum in beginning of \\"2000 Lightyears\\" is the engines igniting, taking you for a journey.  Turn that one up loud, it is a thrill ride.  \\"See What Happens\\" and \\"Gomper\\" are no longer tedious excess, but actually jams that go somewhere.   The joy of \\"On With the Show\\" comes through now.   Now I understand that the acoustic beginning  of \\"2000 man\\" is to be a breath of fresh air half way through side one. It is so pretty, now.  Wyman's bass in the middle of tune is great.  He plays  wonderful full warm notes that just carry the part.  Yes, Wyman's bass can finally be heard on the remasters!   \\"She's a Rainbow\\" now has punch to it...now it sounds like a true Stones song, rather than a Beatles parroting.   This is definitely   a  Stones album.     I think a lot of the people who are down on this album only heard the crumby early CD. With the old CD you get an impression of a cluttered mess of an album.  With the remaster you hear the nuances of a band achieving mastery of their craft in an expanding art form. Pick up a copy.
0316067598|5.0|This book tells of extraordinary courage, sacrifice, heroism and of what our soldiers, special ops teams in particular, are experiencing on war fronts in the mid east. It will stun and amaze, it will make you cry, and occasionally it will make you laugh at the irony in tragedy and the sarcastic banter of a close band of brothers. It is very well written by a man whose very survival earned him the right to tell the story along with a professional writer who knows the subject and keeps the story moving and easy to read and hard to put down. I don't particularly like to read, I'm impatient, a slow reader and I'd rather hold out for the movie. But at the persistant urging of family members, I found myself spending last weekend at Coronado, CA training with the SEALS and falling down the mountains of Afghanistan's Hindu Kush. I felt very thankful for men like Marcus Luttrell and his comrades who worked and trained, who fought, who died in those mountains for my freedom and spending 3 days reading about them was well worth it. I will never forget to keep our military in my prayers at night. The sacrifices they have made and continue to make in our name should be known to every American.
B0000AZAUM|3.0|I assume you know this album, so I am reviewing the SACD remaster for you.  The sound is lovely, but the mix leaves me wanting more.       The SACD has a clean fresh sound.  There is nice seperation between instruments.  I previously hadn't heard the viola sound rising up in \\"Hang on to Yourself\\"  The Sacd highlites the acoustic guitar(s).  Particularly the surround mix. It is pretty, but makes it sound like a Bowie album, not a Spider's album.  I was hoping for some raw Mick Ronson electric beauty, but he seems so tame in the SACD.  The theatric strings on pieces like \\"Starman\\" too seem so minimal.  They don't pick you up and carry you away as they were intended.        The glam is just not present.  It sounds more like the \\"wandering poet with a guitar approach\\"  The stereo layer is better, but the SACD just doesn't capture the creativity of the album, or the  dolled up excitement of the scene.      If you like the early acoustic Bowie, you will love this.  If you like those naughty Spiders, forget it.
B000G1ALRK|2.0|Eric Church shows alot of potential on his first major label debut Sinners Like Me. Unfortunatly though, this record seems to be all over the place. It's almost as if Church has no idea what he wants to be. Some of these songs are molded in the vein of contemporary country (think keith urban or rascal flatts), while others are more \\"traditional\\" (think stuff that doesn't get played on your local hot country station). Even still, most of these songs add a southern rock vibe, which throws everything off all together. Now, none of this would be bad if Church could actually pull it off, but more often than not, he can't. Lyrically, the material here is pretty strong, but lyrics alone can't make an entire song. Hopefully Church will come out with something a bit more focused next time around.
B000RGSOR8|5.0|st. vincent is a breath of fresh air.   i saw her open for john vanderslice in chicago and she almost stole the show (almost, i love you john).  anyway, buy her album and help support a great musician.
B000OLGCHA|2.0|Unfortunately for the Harry Potter franchise, the majority of the soundtracks released seem to fall even flatter of expectations than the movies do. While many fans praise John Williams's scores for the first three movies, I found that Prisoner of Azkaban was the only one worth listening to. The others were, well... boring. They failed to capture the whimsy of the first two films, and the so-called \\"action\\" pieces? Quite frankly, they put me to sleep.    Then Prisoner of Azkaban came along, and to date remains the best Harry Potter score. Its music was distinctively its own, yet it maintained a close relationship with \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" so that it was not foreign-sounding. The Goblet of Fire was next, and while uninteresting at times, a number of songs (notably \\"The Story Continues\\" and \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\") were very well done.    And now we have this, the garbled, hideous mess that is the soundtrack to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. From the opening notes of \\"Fireworks,\\" I had garnered the impression that this might possibly be another album like The Prisoner of Azkaban - different from the others, yet holding true to Williams's established themes. A little over a minute into the song, however, I was brought unpleasantly back to Earth by the jarring guitar riff, which has absolutely no place on a Harry Potter soundtrack and should have warranted the firing of Hooper.    Unfortunately, no such happy event occurred, and the rest of the score is just as bad. Sadly, \\"Fireworks\\" was the most eventful piece - everything else might as well just be background music. It's not remotely capturing, and other than the brief times the music picks up (using a light, jaunty, and wholly inappropriate theme for Umbridge), it's utterly boring. To make matters worse, Hooper deviated from Williams's themes, to the point where you would never recognize the score as a Harry Potter soundtrack. Yes, alright, you want to make your score special, but at the expense of makingit incompatible with the rest of the franchise?    In addition to the tepidness of the music, there's also the strange fact that all of the tracks are totally out of order. \\"Fireworks,\\" a scene which takes place during the Hogwarts school year, comes before \\"Dementors In the Underpass,\\" which occurred at the beginning of the movie. The arrangement makes absolutely no sense and should never have happened. Clearly, someone wasn't paying attention at the Warner Bros studios.    To make matters even worse, it looks as though Hooper has signed on to do the next Harry Potter film. One can only hope that he realizes the severity of his mistakes and corrects them with an interesting (yet ultimately faithful) score the next time around, but if not - for Peeves's sake, at least get the ordering of the tracks right.
B0000039QA|5.0|The Notorious B.I.G. was a lyrical genius and he showed it on Life After Death. This is the greatest rap double album ever. Biggy mastered his flow and showed his versitility on this album. He told stories, gave us party records, got serious, clowned around, rapped over west coast beats, rhymed fast, and gave us hard core street records. This is the definition of a complete album. Ready to Die was a classic and Biggy took it to another level on this album.     He left the world with his best work before he passed. Biggy had a great ability to make his lyrics very visual. Stories like \\"Somebody Gots to Die\\", \\"Niggas Bleed\\" and \\"I Got A Story to Tell\\" are so good that you can visualize his every word. Biggy had the East Coast on lock and no one in the game could touch him in wordplay. I can not even sit here and start to name the best songs because there were too many.     Biggy dropped two classic albums and was killed while he was still on top. He never lost his spot. Life After Death raised the bar for the game. I would have loved to see B.I.G. grow as an artist and make new music after this record. Unfortunately, his time was cut short, but he left us with a gem that shows his amazing talent....
0618680004|4.0|Certainly thought provoking, but this is 'heavy' reading - rather labored.  But - then - so is Mills' \\"Atheist Universe\\".  Between them they lay out most of the arguments. Well worth reading, whether you choose to agree or not.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|I have listened to this album now about 5 times and I have to say that I like it. Its no Siamese Dream but its a good album. There are more good songs on this than bad. I have been a Pumpkins fan for a long time and the seven year wait was well worth it. The Pumpkins are back. My favorite song on the album right now has to be 7 shades of black. Love it!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This is a fantastic movie based on an even more fantastic (cancelled) tv show.  If you're not a fan then watch and you will be, and if you're already a fan then please buy this DVD in hopes that with its success we may see a sequel in the works soon.  So much has yet to be revealed... such as why Inara had to leave Sihnon, and who Book really is.    I'm sure we all want the answers and the only way to get them is to support Firefly/Serenity in every way possible.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|The most important thing to know about this album is that you won't like most of it after a couple listens.  It takes time to appreciate the unique sound.      This album is different than anything I've ever heard. There does seem to be a Nine Inch Nails influence (especially on \\"Misfit Love\\"). Not surprising since QOTSA tour with NIN following Lullabies to Paralyze and Trent Reznor appears on a track that is not on the US version.  The best song in my opinion is \\"3's and 7's\\" and it's probably the easiest to get in to.  Very classic QOTSA rock.  \\"I'm Desiginer\\" is an entertaining track with entertaining lyrics:\\"It's just like diamonds (pause) in s**t\\". Josh really seems to have fun singing this one. \\"Battery Acid\\" starts out with one of the most unpleasant chord progressions I've ever heard then suddenly morphs in to a fast paced, rockin' song.      The low-lights of the album would be the boring \\"Suture Up Your Future\\" which has a catchy bass riff, but thats about it.  Then there's \\"Run, Pig, Run\\" which takes chaos to a whole new level. The whole album is chaotic but this song goes overboard. And what seems to be the case all to often in music, the album ends on a poor note with \\"Running Joke\\".    In my opinion, I think this album is better than Rated R, but it's in a dog fight with their Self Titled album and Lullabies for second among QOTSA albums. Those three are too close to call. Songs for the Deaf is in first and not even in sight. Congrats to QOTSA for keeping it fresh and not putting out the same record twice.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Wow! What a line up! As soon as you hear the opening guitar of Gimme Shelter you know your in for something special! I love \\"Country Honk\\" How many groups have that kind of balls to not include a classic hit like \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" and do a country version of that song for the album? Most groups could only dream of having enough great material to do something like that! The Stones were at the top of the game between \\"Beggar's\\" & \\"Exile\\". They managed to put out four of the greatest albums of all time, a fantastic live album(Ya Ya's) and an incredible hits set with Hot Rocks! This is an album that should be in every music lovers collection!
0385733577|5.0|I was actually a little turned off by the cover, it made me think that the book would be all about stodgy boring spells and incantations but it really is a very action filled book. The base of the story is that 15 year old twins are present when nicholas flamel's book is stolen in front of them and they are able to retain 2 pages. The rest of the book is an extreme adrenaline rush as they and nicholas flamel try to evade the \\"dark elders\\" who are trying to complete the book to destroy the modern world of mankind. The chasing and running and magical battles are very spellbinding and more than make up for some of the threadbare explanations and details in the book. The excitement kept me glued. I really enjoyed the book and look forward to the next chase and magical confrontation in the next book.
B00006AW2J|5.0|The Stones started to really shine with this album. It was the peak of their creative genius! \\"Beggar's Banquet\\",\\"Let It Bleed\\",\\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile On Main Street\\" should be in everyone's top 100 albums of all time! Though this album is more acoustic than most efforts by the Stones,there are some classic jammers including Sympathy for the Devil, Street Fighting Man and the forgotten Stray Cat Blues!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly's songwriting is amazing. Very catchy and meaningful songs on here. A MUST buy !!
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I was amazed by the emotional power of this film.  I cried several times and not just when someone died.  Several reviews expressed a desire to know why the women in the film were infertile.  The film would have been far less effective if the mystery had been fully explained.  How many women today are able to pinpoint a concrete reason for their infertility?  Without a specific medical problem, individuals experience the level of despair mixed with hope that the entire society in this film was experiencing.  If this film was nothing more than a comment on the emotional impact of infertility, it would be enough.  Thankfully, this film is much more, and I can't recommend it highly enough.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Any fan who spent HOURS on FF VII will definitely find this enjoyable.  Even if you have stopped playing a long time ago and forgot some of the story (shame on you) the disc has you covered with the reminiscence of Final Fantasy VII.  I'm not going to go into the plot, but let's just say the characters are beautiful and just as you remember (because cussing out Cloud for being the wishy-washy Charlie Brown of Final Fantasy is part of our love)  Don't look for too much depth, but great graphics, great action, wonderful voice acting (Sakurai-san is awesome) and enough story for you to rekindle your love for the series and characters.  I watch it obsessively, and once you see it, you'll know why.  A true best buy for any SQUARE junkie.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|First of all, the movie starts off with a murder and you know who the murderer is. So it isn't a suspense story as much as a psychological thriller, the type that pits two very strong personalities against one another (played by Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling).<br />  Each is a control freak  and each is ambitious. The whole thrill of this movie is watching the characters, seeing how they develop and change and wondering how this will all play out.<br />  Looking at the reviews that others have written for this movie, it is clear that people tended to love or hate this movie -and I think I understand why. For one thing, you KNOW what happened -and why -almost from the start. But I happen to like character-driven movies and this one is definitely in that vein. Yes, Hopkins does seem to recreate his Hannibel Lechter personalty (or hints of it) but that worked out fine in this instance.
0143038419|1.0|I found this book to be whiny and self-absorbed. I honestly couldn't get past the first 20 pages, skimmed thru a lot of the rest and felt like it's a 300 page version of a lame women's magazine article. Oh boo hoo, you have 2 homes, money,travel around the world. Poor you, to have so many hot men interested in you that you have to declare celibacy- what about those of us who are celibate because we don't have hot men chasing us? Who have to work for a living and can't afford to go on soul-searching vacations? I just couldn't relate to the author. Lots of people get divorced and have a hard time of it, what makes her so special?...this book  isn't worth your time or money!
B000GFLKF8|5.0|This really was a great film with an excellent twist at the end.  I guess it is to be expected of a Denzel movie since he always delivers a great performance.<br /><br />The movie centers around a bank robbery in which Denzel plays a detective trying to negotiate with the mastermind behind the hiest.  As Denzel and the criminal go head to head you will stay on the edge of your seat and be suprised by the twists that occur.<br /><br />This one definately gets my seal of approval for a solid enjoyable viewing.
B00004W4UB|1.0|I don't know why this movie got so many great reviews on here.  The movie is not bad, but is certainly not good.  However, what makes this movie really horrible is Julia Roberts.  I am a HUGE Julia fan, but her performance in this movie is laughable.  She can't hold a stead Irish accent-- at times she sounds like good old American Julia, and at other times, a VERY strong Irish accent comes out of her mouth, with no explanation for the sudden change.  I believe this must have been a critical point in her career, at which point someone must have told her, \\"stick with what you do well... romantic comedies!\\"
6305546789|5.0|From the opening scene with the chilling piano music playing to the image of a jack-o-latern burning in the dark, you know you are in for a scare.  No matter how many times you have seen this movie it still remains to freak you out.  I would have to say this is the best horror movie of all time as far as any type of slasher flick goes.<br /><br />Along with a creepy viewing experience you can also have a few laughs, or maybe thats just me.  I find certain lines delivered by Dr. Loomis absolutely hilarious.  Take for instance when they discover that Myers has eaten a dog and Loomis responds \\"He got hungry\\" to be one of the funniest things I have ever heard.<br /><br />So this one gets a full seal of approval from myself.  If you haven't already seen this one, which I would find odd, then check it out.
B000O77SOK|5.0|Ever since \\"The Practice\\" went off the air, I've been searching for the DVD set for the entire series.  I have finally been able to purchase the first season on DVD, and it's fantastic!  In addition to the original episodes, it has some great commentary on how the show evolved from its original concept.  This was one of the best acted and written series ever, and I can't imagine anyone but Dylan McDermott playing the hunk, Bobby.  I am so anxious to get the rest of the set.  Please don't wait so long!
B00004YX39|5.0|Loved it before was glad to find it finally on cd after years of searching
B000GYI32M|5.0|Una serie cuativadora, ambiciosa, fascinante, son pocas las palabras para esta serie que en su tercera temporada parte lenta un poco aburridos los primeros episodios pero despues despegas y no quieres dejar de verla, un dia tuve que ver los 5 discos y me quede totalmente anodado Remoendado 100% la proxima semana compro la 4ta.
B000002KIK|2.0|I love the Title Track but I think that the rest of the CD is plain and has no punch.  I might have overlooked one or two other songs that are decent on this CD but really, the only reason to buy this CD would be for \\"Never Say Die\\"
B000021XS0|5.0|if you liked their Awake CD, then you'll very, very likely like this one too.<br /><br />check other reviews that go into more depth about the way this one tells a story. Not only do the tracks run together, into a single opus, but the lyricist was careful to build one complete story when you hear all the tracks in sequence. There's even flashbacks and such. You might even end up just listening to this with headphones, sipping on your favorite beverage.
0618680004|4.0|Dawkins has done it again.  The voice of reason, calm and common sense in the midst of \\"yapping terriers of ignorance.\\"
1594489505|5.0|I read the Kite Runner and anticipated the release of Hosseini's next novel.  His latest novel was worth the wait.  I could not put this book down! The story was both educational and emotional.  The triumph, strength and courage of the women in this story was overwhelmingly magnificent and at the same time sad. You will not regret this purchase...enjoy this literary triumph, and savor every word!
B000OCXMAE|2.0|This album is a definite divergence from previous Linkin Park releases, and though it is similar in composition and general approach it nevertheless falls short in almost all respects. What really ruins this album is that nothing seems to fit - slow repetitive music is combined with uninteresting lyrics; fast and uniquely Linkin Park beats are combined with overly repetitive lyrics which are unimaginative and not engaging.  The overall CD comes across as a poorly planned and eclectic collection - it's important to branch out and try new things, and Linkin Park should be commended for not trying to hole up in a mode established in Meteora and Hybrid Theory. At the same time, it is important not to disregard the things which worked well for this group of musicians and the fans which enjoyed such releases. Minutes to Midnight will probably disappoint any but the staunchest adherents of Linkin Park's new album of teenage-angst, punk, hip-hop, synth mix.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Total entertainment with a superb cast.  Wahlberg and Pena make a great team.  Stephen Hunter is an amazing writer and I am really glad to see one of his books made into a movie.  At last!
1594489505|5.0|Once again, Hossenini (author of The Kite Runner) has produced a beautifully written,  poignant book about the lives of two women who start from very different   beginnings yet are intertwined in the story.  The backdrop is the unfolding   chaos of  Afghanistan during the political upheaval pre and post 9/11 times,  the Muslim male dominated domestic scene.  But it also is a Ruth and Naomi  story of women bonding and sharing in the midst of it all.  Great and moving  reading, with human insights into culture that often feels alien to us.
1592401791|2.0|This book spends too much time criticizing  three of the Beatles,   John, Ringo and especially George Harrison.  Geoff's obvious dislike for Harrison really detracts from  what at times might be an interesting read.   I actually put the book down several times during the   first few chapters, driven away by his constant criticisms.  To hear Geoff tell it, he's the one that should be called  the fifth Beatle, not George Martin.  reads like a novel that Paul would write....Let It Be.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I have to admit that I enjoyed Shooter a lot.  I was hooked from the opening and enjoyed the ride right through to the credits.  There is a lot that could have been done better, the movie could have had the more serious tilt of movies such as The Bourne Identity instead of the fun, but ultimately unbelievable testosterone-driven action movie it devolves into, but its not a bad thing.  Just different than I expected.  It is loaded with cliches and plot holes and glaring impossibilities and even more improbabilities, but in the end I couldn't help rooting for Swagger as he racked up the body count.  Click-click-boom!
B000O178BY|3.0|or special, but not bad either.  Good to have, but its not going to stick in your player.  Not as good as With Teeth.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|Like most long time DT fans I didn't even hesitate for a second, when I saw that they released a new album. And I was really excited to get it. As always, I felt sorry for my neighbors when I first listened to it, since it is almost impossible to listen to at low volume. But after I got half way through and started to look at the booklet and reading some of the lyrics, I started to get a really bad feeling. I know most will not agree with me on this, and say \\"dark is cool\\". Just like John Petrucci which wrote some of the lyrics and said in the documentary (on the bonus DVD) that this was his intention to make a \\"dark album\\". Well, I guess they succeeded, and unfortunately for me to the point that I don't even want to listen to that album anymore. That is of course very frustrating since this is in my opinion on of their best albums, from a pure musical prospective.     What really pushed me over the edge was their last song, where they [...] (sorry there is really no other word for it) Psalm 23 out of the Bible. First I though, wow, they quote the Bible, but then I realized that they had [...] it. I know that most of you probably don't care about this, but since I am a Christian I don't think it is ok. And it is definitely not 'cool'. Just some excerpts of it, to show you what I mean.    \\"Lord you are my god and my shepherd  ...  For I know you are with me  ... (so far so good)  Decay in the house of the lord  Forever amen  Death will follow me all the days  of my life  ...  My soul grows weaker  He Knows and he waits   He watches over me  Standing at the infernal gates  In the hour of darkness  ...  Dark Master    Well, you get the picture. I know most will probably not care, but I had to write this review for the few who will.
0061015725|4.0|I liked it better than Airframe, Timeline. But Prey is one of my all time favourite novels. I liked it on par with Jurassic Park, COngo. I read it when it was released, and now it's been years. I plan to read it again and I am sure I will enjoy it again. It's educational too. While Timeline teaches you teleportation, Prey tells you about nanotechnology. Prey is a must read, BUY IT!     His next two novels State Of Fear and Next, though educational are not real thrillers. read them too but Prey is better than these two.     Please Mr. Crichton, we like to be educated but we like it to be packed with thrills too, so continue with novels like Prey.  I cant wait to find out what Crichton's next novel is going to be on.
055358894X|3.0|There is a lot to like in this debut novel. The pseudo Venice of Camorra is richly realized. The characters are vividly drawn and their dialogue is salty and entertaining. However, the main story arc, the development of the Gentlemen Bastards from street orphans to the premier confidence ring of the City, is severely hindered by the book's timeline. Lynch dribbles out the back-story bit by bit with flashbacks which rarely correspond to the \\"present time\\" story. These digressions are ultimately maddening. If I read this book again, I will bookmark the flashbacks and read them through in chronological order.<br /><br />Another really annoying problem with this book is what I call \\"the case of the missing character\\". Throughout the book there are references to a sixth member of the gang, and Locke's sometime girlfriend...BUT SHE NEVER SHOWS UP! Ok, so we all know there's going to be a sequel, but really. I kept wondering when she was going to appear (She's the one shadowing them from the rooftops. No, wait! Maybe she's the Gray King in disguise!).
6301955609|5.0|Plot: Spanish/Mexican circus performers. A young boy named Felix, his mother 'a trapeze artist' and the womanizing man shes married to. We go between scenes of Felix as a catatonic inmate in an asylum all grown up and scenes from his childhood. In the middle theres killings, psychological horror, then the great ending.<br /><br /> Theres everything in this movie, love, surrealism, sexuality, mimes, metaphoric stuff. Its very odd, yet beautiful. Picture the movie Psycho involving circus performers, Its hard to explain but shares a similar theme. This movie is beyond description, beyond horror.. The metaphors, the visuals, the whole presentation, the characters, the story, everything was something out of the ordinary and one of a kind. Never saw a movie like this before. I found out about this one in a book i have that names rare horror films. This is probably the best one so far... if not the most unique film ive ever seen. Dont miss this one.
B00005RDRO|5.0|We have been enjoying this movie annually since 1976!  It is a fun family tradition & we're grateful to have this movie on DVD.
B0000027I6|5.0|What a great album. Just goes to show the brains behind some of the majestic Pink Floyds's finest songs were Roger Waters. Genius
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|I'm just starting to use the HP 12C, not a big fan of RPN, but then again that's what I bought it for.    Nice thing is that for those calculations that don't require RPN you can change back to \\"normal\\" calculator function.  The case was nice as was the instruction booklet that I carry around in my briefcase and have marked up quite a bit.    Nice spot on the back to engrave your name.    The only drawbacks are that the case does not much more than cover the calculator and gives a place to put in your business card to stake your claim to it.  Would have liked to have had a possible \\"extra battery\\" compartment in the least, even though I have not had to change the battery yet.

B000255LIY|5.0|As much as I struggled to see this 2004 production without comparing it to the 1960's classic which starred Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn, Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Terry, and Timothy Dalton, the shade of the earlier, better film kept intruding into my thoughts, so let me get the comparisons out of the way here in the beginning. Yes, the `60's version of The Lion In Winter is the better of the two movies, though I also rate this `00's version five stars and don't hesitate to recommend it as an addition to anyone's DVD library. It's a fine, artsy, stunning piece of witty drama that depicts the murderous side of the an irreparably dysfunctional nuclear family, circa 1183 AD.<br /><br />That out of the way, let me say that the 2004 film was far more visually colorful than its ancestor, its sets grander, the twelfth-century more detailed, the recreation of the high era of the Age of Faith was notably loving in the hands of its superb crew. This motion picture was as gorgeous to look at as it was to watch. (Meaning the human cast often took bottom billing to the sheer might and intricacy of the setting.)  If only the actors had held up their end as well, this might have done the near-impossible and surpassed all recent on-screen presentations of the Medieval world.<br /><br />Sadly, the weakness lies in The Lion in Winter's casting and acting. Patrick Stewart, a masterful thespian with a commanding voice, a great actor under most circumstances, was, I'm astonished to see myself write, among the most glaring trouble spots in the presentation. Stewart was simply wrong as Henry II. He chose to portray England's most volatile king with a light, comedic merriness that delivered a great man as an unbelievable braggart. And though no Hepburn, Glenn Close was also sub-par as Eleanor, yet I found her a better match for her part than Patrick Stewart was as Henry II. And was it just me or did it often seem Close was trying to give her best Hepburn impression in this role? Better a good Close than a bad Hepburn, as an acting coach might say.<br /><br />A cast member I did enjoy watching was Julia Vysotsky, as Alyse, sister of the king of France, mistress of Henry, the father of her one-time betrothed. Vysotsky is a lovely Russian actress who did a French accent well and played her part with the right mix of delicate vulnerability and covert viciousness, one moment decrying her circumstances as a pawn in the game of politics, the next urging Henry to exterminate his sons then and there on Christmas Day. Male viewers, lesbians, and assorted connoisseurs of the female form will be pleasantly surprised at her topless scene and find it a plus that it came so close to the start of the movie.<br /><br />The one person I truly wish had not been in this movie at all is Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, as King Philippe Auguste. I have liked this actor well enough in other roles, notably the one in Woody Allen's Match Point, but here Rhys-Meyers plays one of France's great monarchs while looking like some sort of post-modern Jesus and acting like a present-day Hollywood enfant terrible. The way he repeatedly releases his seething \\"take-me-seriously-damn-you\\" anger makes him seem bratty and silly, unlike Timothy Dalton's handling of the part in the 1960's production with his frigidly contained hatred of the Plantagenet's being a distantly frightening thing to behold. Rhys-Meyers did have a brilliant moment, however, when he is seen smugly chuckling to himself from his chair across the great hall of Chinon as he watches Richard and John, two future kings, bickering over who will succeed their still-living father, and one can all but read Phillipe's mind as his notions of Gallic superiority are once more reinforced. In witnessing the pettiness of the two rivals, Philippe becomes all the more certain that to attain his eventual victory over England, all he need do is outlive Henry, and wait...<br /><br />Another brief but impressive moment unique to this version ofThe Lion In Winter came early on when the camera panned back from a by then emptying great hall to show Henry's crown lying alone on a table, and it was striking how up close the object of so much ambition looked like such a small battered thing unworthy of all the fuss over it, as if someone somewhere was commenting on what a paltry thing a kingship is.<br /><br />A final, smarmy note is that the cast of the 2004 Lion In Winter was nearly all English, and I expect this was made so in order to lend a certain authenticity to a story set among feuding claimants to the English throne, and yet the irony is if authenticity was sought, French accents might have been more apt, since Henry, Eleanor, and their sons, including the fabled Richard the Lionhearted of Robin Hood fame, were all French, not English, and even the setting for the play, Chinon Castle, is in France, near the Loire River. (And still standing to this day.)<br /><br />The 2004 version of The Lion In Winter stands well on its own but suffers in comparison to its predecessor. It's worth the long run time and contains some nice moments. It's visually appealing and in a few moments does get a little boring, but I think anyone who loves this ingenious story and the period in which it's set will quickly forgive these flaws. I'm glad it was made, and I'm glad I got to see it after having it on my list for several years.the camera panned back from a by then emptying great hall to show Henry's crown lying alone on a table, and it was striking how up close the object of so much ambition looked like such a small battered thing unworthy of all the fuss over it, as if someone somewhere was commenting on what a paltry thing a kingship is.

I could even stand Labrie's vocals.<br /><br />This is the best album by Dream Theater, in my opinion.

And with an alluring title to boot...    It's not that any of the information is wrong, per se, but also nothing surprising, insightful or new. Manifest your destiny. This is the entire message but it fills 200 pages. Continually interspersed with quotations, which makes it a bit cumbersome to read. All that said, not bad if you need a moment of inspiration.

0316018953|3.0|I have always enjoyed Michael Connelly's books. I suppose that The Poet would be one of my favorites. I remember that this book was actually written for the NY Times in chapter segments, so it was good to see that the publisher finally got around to releasing a full novel. I didn't think the story in The Overlook was complicated, thus making it easy to follow. It flowed evenly, with just enough new clues emerging in every chapter to make me want to read more. Even with a purely plot-oriented novel, Mr. Connelly made sure that Bosch didn't lose his depth of character that was developed so skillfully in all the 10 or 12 previous novels. All in all, this was not Mr. Connelly's best effort but I still enjoyed it.

B000OQF6N6|5.0|A great musical talent can make its mark in many different ways, musical, scandelous what have you. But the way for any band to stand the test of time is to always find new sounds that will be able the grab the approval of its loyal fan base many times over. Billy Corgan, one of the well known voices from the 90's alternative grunge scene made his mark throughout the 90's with the ever popular Smashing Pumpkins. Until 2000 they filled the radio waves with unique gloomy musicianship, haunting harmonies and of course Billy's original singing voice. The band broke up feeling there was no place for them where music was going and Billy still tried to keep his music alive through many different side projects, but it still didn't seem to reach out to his fans without the now legendary Smashing Pumpkins name.<br /><br />Now in 2007 The Smashing Pumpkins are back, but not whole (minus James Iha and D'Arcy. Yet, this new rencarnation it bringing a major message to the legions of fans that have waited for this moment. It is not right to dwell on the past we must venture forward. And Venture Billy and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin have. 'Zeitgiest' is a breath of fresh air in the music scene but it is also a great listen. It is not the signature gloomy heavy but now it a loud fast sometime possitive heavy. The first track 'Doomsday Clock' is already making headway by appearing on the soundtrack of the biggest movie this summer so far, Transformers. The guitars are fast the harmonies have vastly improved and Jimmy Chamberlin really brings out his old school drumming in all the tracks. Some of the best songs on this album are Tarantula, Starz and Come On Let's Go. These songs pretty much take Smashing Pumpkins and Zwan and create some sort of a hybrid that really gets you into it. Also there is tribute to the loyal fans with a few slower and softer songs like Neverlost and For God and Country. These songs use the unique gloom and strange use of Synthesizer and even a Xylephone. This album was well worth the wait and it is great to hear this band again. Hopefully this album will mark a new chapter in Billy Corgans career that will allow this band to stick around for the years to come and continue to bring us great music. More importantly this will hopefully reunite the band as a whole so we can all proudly say The Smashing Pumpkins are back!s well worth the wait and it is great to hear this band again. Hopefully this album will mark a new chapter in Billy Corgans career that will allow this band to stick around for the years to come and continue to bring us great music.

B000OLGCHA|2.0|Sadly, this soundtrack turned many of John Williams' beautiful themes into death marches and left nothing new to be desired.  It was much like a bunch of sound effects rather than a score meant to tie the movie together into an artistic whole.  Obviuosly, Warner Brothers is trying to make the Harry Potter movies as cheap as possible since they know the fans will come no matter how poorly they make the films.  John Williams has said that he would love to do Harry Potter again, and they need him to strengthen his wonderful themes to tie all the movies together before it's too late.

B00008BRB5|4.0|People are too hard on this record. It's not the best LP ever, but it's not the trash basket some people claim. I love \\"Roxanne,\\" but classic rock radio has harmed that song now in my book. The same for \\"Message in a Bottle.\\" Great tunes by a great band, but radio continues to push these tracks so much that it's overkill. The \\"Synchronicity\\" cuts, despite being played on radio more than their earlier hits, in 1983 and 1984, aren't played to death on radio these days. In fact, when The Police played \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" in Dallas last month, it was magical. And say what you want about \\"Every Breath You Take,\\" but that guitar part and tone are amazing. Yes, the song was played to death back in the day on radio and on MTV, but stay away from the song for 20 years, then go back to it. It's unique, it's inspired and it, like the LP, isn't as bad as the nay-sayers say. Not a perfect score, but no grade F, either.

This is one of those movies where you have to force yourself to finish it. Its extremely depressing and will put you in a really bad/sad mood. I cannot watch this movie ever again. I give it 4 stars because the movie has the power to make me feel like that.
B000F6YPW8|5.0|Amazon Reviews<br /><br />As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various music supplies and recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />The Allman Brother's self-titled debut has received universal praise for its incredible display of the blues; the musical interplay between Duane, Dickie, and Greg and such confidence in the material five of the seven tracks were penned by a band member.<br /><br />If you analyze the restrictive circumstances the group dealt with they should receive even larger accolades.  The beauty of blues-rock is the ability to expand the song and take it in a different direction each night.  Your only awareness of time is that you keep and not the length of a composition.  The suits were more interested in making the record a calling card for the live dates.  The entire LP didn't even reach thirty-four minutes!  Shocking as may seem \\"Whipping Post\\" would not even be the longest tune on the album.  How short is thirty some odd minutes to a blues band or a progressive rock group, \\"Mountain Jam\\" would appear years later on \\"Eat A Peach\\" tallied more ticks on the clock than the entire seven tracks on the debut.<br /><br />The legendary debut by the Allman's opens with a cover of the Spencer Davis/Eddie Hardin tune \\"Don't Want You No More.\\"  Greg would show us what would became his signature organ sound.  The Brothers didn't take the song past two and one half minutes but everything including the kitchen sink is there for us to soak up.  \\"It's Not My Cross To Bear\\" wouldn't seem right if it didn't come from Greg's voice.  The pure emotion of the vocals with the guitars left the masses speechless the first time this went on their turntable in 1969.  \\"Black Hearted Woman\\" grabs you by the throat without mercy.  The energy is indescribable and after three tracks your ears have encompassed three different sides of the Brothers.  \\"Trouble No More\\" may say Muddy Waters on the writing credits but as the Beatles always did, the Allman's cover would be the definitive version.  The classic riff and blues power at its best makes this one a must for a time capsule.  \\"Every Hungry Woman\\" needs two listenings.  The initial time you are so engrossed on the music, Greg's words may have escaped you.  \\"Dreams\\" turns out to be the longest track on the record.  At over seven minutes, the only blemish showing is it didn't go on forever.  If you are still able to withstand the onslaught, the LP ends with \\"Whipping Post.\\"  To this day it is served frequently on Classic Rock stations.  The finishing combination of \\"Dreams\\" and \\"Whipping Post\\" is extraordinary.<br /><br />It took one listen and the legions of Allman fans it created were in unison with the hope the road would go on forever.<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"may say Muddy Waters on the writing credits but as the Beatles always did, the Allman's cover would be the definitive version.

B000PHX4VA|5.0|I'm not giving this cd 5 out of 5 because of some issues about the sound...the first cd seems to lack presence in the sound and there is some distortion in the first track of disc 2 [I listen to cds on good quality headphones and I feel that these sound issues could be eliminated if people did the same prior to releasing cds].    Anyway, The Police are perhaps THE major British band of the 1980s. Looking at the credits in the double cd, it seems that lead singer \\"Sting\\" pretty much did everything himself...from writing the songs to arranging the music.    Many of the songs on this compilation show Sting to be the former English teacher that he was...from his superior way with words, to his literary allusions.    The highlights of the first cd for me are:    Can't stand losing you-a song about breaking up. The 'voice' of the song sounds like a pouty teenager and is amusing for its melodrama. Suicide is mentioned in this song. This topic seems fertile for rock. E.g. Metallica have the beautiful and absolute classic song \\"Fade to black\\", with its adult sensibility; and Megadeth have \\"A tout le monde\\", which, like this Police song, seems to have a teenage 'voice' singing. Both latter songs have melodrama, but The Police give their song a nice dose of humour.    Roxanne-perhaps the song which broke the band, especially in the UK. It's about the boyfriend of a prostitute, I think. Along with the song above, it is one of the strongest songs on the first cd. It has a nice mixture of a vulnerable 'voice' doing the singing, and the pounding, repetitive lyrics of the chorus.     Two other songs from the first cd which take my fancy are \\"Message in a bottle\\" and \\"Walking on the moon\\". Both songs are more towards the \\"ballad\\" end of the pop/rock spectrum. The latter song, particulary, illustrates Sting's great lyrical imagery...i.e. he likens walking, when one is in love, to walking on the moon...brilliant use of lyrics and imagery.    The second cd contains most of the songs that I particularly like from this band. \\"De do do do, de da da da\\" is a terrific song about how the powerful use language for their own benefit. Many years ago I wasn't very keen on this song, as it SOUNDED like non-sense [and going on the title too]. Listening to this song years later, you appreciate the depth of meaning it has behind it. Nice turn of phrase \\"Poets, priests and politicians, have words to thank for their positions\\". Sting doesn't seem to include pop/rock stars!    \\"Invisible sun\\" has a terrificly eerie opening [not unlike Synchronicity II...in fact, the intros could just as easily be used to introduce darker themes and music, but settles for terrific pop/rock]. I'm not so keen on the chorus of Invisible Sun, but I really like the verses and the ambiance of the introduction.    \\"Spirits in the material world\\" is another highlight from the second disc.  It exemplifies an attractive trait of this band...mixing up the hooks in one song. The song is catchy from the start, with nice melodies [vocal], but it really picks up when a NEW melody [keyboard] is introduced in the latter part of the song. This song may be the one where Sting's glib political views are at the fore [\\"Our so called leaders speak. With words they try to gaol you. They subjugate the meek, but it's the rhetoric of failure\\"]. That's a VERY nice turn of phrase, but, like I say, rather glib and lacking in hope for the political process.    Perhaps the band's biggest hit is \\"Every breath you take\\". This song isn't one that has ever really grabbed me. To me it's like the curate's egg...good in parts. An Australian equivalent would be Mondo Rock's \\"Come said the boy\\"-both bands had monumentally great pop/rock songs, but their most successful songs were not the ones I rated as great. Anyway, The Police's ballad is perhaps growing more on me now...it's 'good' bits are making the song gel better now, for me, perhaps.    \\"Wrapped around your finger\\" is another very good Police song, and whichhas those literary allusions I spoke of earlier \\"Caught between the Scylla and Charibdes\\". Perhaps my favourite Police song of all is \\"King of pain\\", which also has some literary allusions that I know of \\"There's a king with his eyes torn out\\" and some that elude me \\"There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread\\". Both these songs illustrate the great thing about Police songs...how they change gears, so to speak, by changing tempo or pitch or melody. The bit in King Of Pain where this happens is where Sting raises his voice higher and starts the line about the King. Reading the lyrics, I saw that it was more gruesome than I remember, but nonetheless beautiful to listen to.    \\"Synchronicity II\\" is  one of the band's more adventurous sounding rock songs but they carry it off with aplomb.     I do remember hearing somewhere about the song \\"Murder by numbers\\" causing controversy in the US and the band's response to this. Having read the lyrics that come with this cd, I see that the band is right to defend the song, but perhaps they only have themselves to blame by making the point of their song towards the end, making it difficult to come by, perhaps. It is also another politically glib song by Sting, though perhaps containing a germ of truth.    Lastly, I did find \\"Walking in your footsteps\\" to be a lyrically interesting song. Perhaps it is Sting likening humans to dinosaurs...with us heading for extinction too, like the dinosaurs, if we keep toying with nuclear power.    In conclusion, this is a terrific buy for people into lyrically sophisticated music with catchy pop/rock that is also sophisticated. I do find the drumming sound by this band to be satisfying and their melodies gorgeous when they're at their best. It's just a pity though that on occasion it sounds like the master tapes are in fact LP records...with dust or scratches on them.    P.S. if you like poetic music, I recommend and have reviewed:    Patti Smith's album Horses.    If you like political music, I recommend and have reviewed numerous albums by Midnight Oil here [highly recommended are their albums \\"10-1\\" and \\"Diesel and dust\\".    I've reviewed Metallica and Megadeth albums here too.

0688014291|5.0|For an adult to have not read this book, to me, is like a person who never read \\"Green Eggs & Ham\\" or \\"Jack and Jill\\".  This is a MUST read for anyone who is involved in the corporate community at any level.  The three concepts introduced in \\"The One Minute Manager\\" are so simple to understand, yet so profound at what they accomplish. Actually, \\"The One Minute Manager\\" IS as easy to read as \\"Green Eggs & Ham\\".  I love the \\"story book\\" format that is used to tell the tale of this enigmatic character who calls himself a one-minute-manager.  The other character, a young man on a quest to learn what makes a good manager, who subsequently encounters the one-minute-manager, reminds me of Columbo who asks questions and investigates tirelessly until he finds answers.  This book is an easy read and a fun read. Yet the concepts that it reveals are priceless.

Being close to 50, most of my friends are surprised that I took to this group, but I found that age doesn't count when it comes to rock music.  I introduced all of my friends to their music.      I bought their first album,\\"30 Seconds to Mars\\" and couldn't believe that as outstanding as the album of the same is, that \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" surpassed it.  It is without a doubt an album to own not only for your listening pleasure but to keep in your collectors section.  PROVEHITO IN ALTUM. Realizing that they also had an album (of the same name (A Beautiful Lie), with a video included, I had my daughter quickly purchase it for me.  I love seeing the videos.  \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" pass it on.........
B000P0IW6E|5.0|The Scorpions have joined Iron Maiden as 2 of the old groups to put forth a great effort on their latest release.  I haven't been this impressed with a Scorpions cd since the mid to late 80's.  Klaus' voice sounds incredible, and the lyrics and music are top notch.  There is a reason why people are still buying this music, because todays rock bands have forgotten about the guitar as a fundamental instrument.  If you're a fan of the Scorpions, you won't be disappointed.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is my all time favorite Disney movie, I loved this movie so much I used to watch it all the time when I was little.    What I like about this movie is that it has a good pace, it tells a long story in a short amount of time, by skipping out on things that probably would have made more sense, but would have slowed the movie down.  One might think \\"What does Eric and Ariel see in each other? They just fall in love and live happily ever after?\\"  I can imagine of utterly boring this movie would have been, having you forced to see those characters explain and show how much they love each other.  Instead, it's love at first sight, you kind of guess Eric's personality (though it's obvious he's kind and brave), and it dosen't slow the movie down, and they do add the romantic scene \\"Kiss the girl\\" to really show Eric and Ariels love for each other. \\"Kiss the girl\\" is so beautifully animated, it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.     The music and the songs really stands out in this movie, I used to sing-a-long with \\"Under the sea\\" when I watched it, nowadays I always choose \\"Part of your world\\" when I sing. That song is so dreamy, so perfect and tells the story that just because you got a lot of fancy stuff dosen't mean you are happy. \\"Kiss the girl\\" is also a very good song, it suits perfectly with the beautiful scene.    And to not make this a sappy love-story (like Pocahontas), there is some scary stuff in this movie. The ending battle is without a doubt the best painted parts of the movie, I can't even imagine how many hours was spent drawing that scene!    It's a good story, great songs, loveable (and not lovable Ursula) characters and beautiful animation.
B00005ATQF|5.0|One hell of a war movie. Examines the weakness of men being put in an unwarranted situation and the pride of some. Would watch it again.
B000001E29|5.0|Yes Rain Dogs, Bone Machine, and maybe even Mule Variations, Closing Time or Alice, are indeed the great works by Tom Waits - But The Black Rider is the most sublime and un-selfconcious and inspired in my opinion.<br />Pick it up If you havent already.
6305263248|3.0|If not for De Niro and Jean Reno, I wouldn't have imagined what the movie would have been. The plot was almost predictable. Sean Bean added some colour to the movie. The action sequences weren't exactly fantastic although I will have to give the writers some credit for executing some rather clever parts in the movie. Still worth watching though.
B000002AH9|5.0|I can only quote the eloquent review from Amazon:<br />A harrowing classic, Billie Holiday's personal favorite among her '50s albums captures the singer 17 months before her death, her once honeyed voice, scarred and weakened from punishing life, its ravages highlighted by the 1958 session's crisp sonics and the contrasting \\"satin\\" of Ray Ellis' sleek string arrangements. Yet it is that very contrast that explains the power of these performances: In revisiting its torchy standards, Holiday reduces them to their core of pain and longing, transforming \\"I'm a Fool to Want You,\\" \\"You Don't Know What Love Is,\\" and \\"You've Changed\\" into naked declarations as mesmerizing and unsettling as a horrific accident. Any postrocker that presumes pop standards and string sections automatically translate to \\"easy listening\\" hasn't listened to this. This 1997 version adds unreleased takes and a beautiful 20-bit digital transfer to extract every shivering pang of Holiday's music. --Sam Sutherland<br /><br />Nothing to add more. Only that I own all her albums, as well as around 25000 mp3s of all kinds of artists like Sinatra, Hendrix, all that one could call good music. This album was her favorite, and it is possibly the most beautiful album I have come across in music.<br />As they say, only a sad life makes it possible to sing from the heart, as one can find out listening to Piaf and Callas among others. This beautifully melancholical album is a treasure of Billie Holiday's voice and embodies her work, which is, unfortunately, receded to recorded history.'<br />When NASA decides to shoot a CD into space again as they did in 1977, this should be the one!
B000000OUJ|5.0|The acknowledged head of the Wu-Tang Clan, Genius (a.k.a. GZA) delivers the fifth Wu-banger with his sophomore solo album. Musically, LIQUID SWORDS is the Clan's strongest solo release to date, and lyrically, Genius comes correct with a style he describes as \\"too swift to bite.\\"<br />LIQUID SWORDS is comprised of two types of songs, all backed by the rza's skillful production.<br /><br />On the one hand, Genius schools the Clan's followers through songs that address serious problems experienced in every day inner-city life. \\"Cold World,\\" which is backed by whirling wind sound, contains mini-stories that illustrate the misfortunes of gun-slinging in the hip-hop community. \\"Investigative Reports\\" goes even deeper in administering the blame, suggesting that drug-related crimes stem from a higher authority.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are the Clan's kung-fu metaphors, which show up on Genius' more Wu-styled songs. On \\"Duel Of The Iron Mic,\\" he's joined by a number of fellow Clansmen to reinstate the idea that no one can match them, despite numerous attempts to copy their image and concepts. Similarly, the production on songs like \\"4th Chamber\\" and \\"Shadowboxin'\\" closely relates them to 36 chambers, and helps make liquid sword a complete classic.<br />Personnel includes:  Lou Diamonds a.k.a. Raekwon The Chef, Tony Starks a.k.a. Ghost Face Killer, Lucky Hands a.k.a. U-God, Ol' Dirty Bastard a.k.a. Dirt Megirt, Rolly Fingers a.k.a. Inspectah Deck, Johnny Blaze a.k.a. Method Man, Master Killa a.k.a. Noodles, Killah Priest, Dreddy Kruger, Life (vocals).The best hip-hop album in years.
B00006RCNW|5.0|Ok, this show is good. None of us want to believe that law enforcment is this morally bankrupt, but something in me says these guys are out there somewhere. This show is gritty and the characters are those guys you love to hate. You never want to be them, but by the end of the season you are rooting for them. They are just good enough to keep you on their side. You will either love this show or hate it. I doubt there is any middle ground. I loved it!
0553588486|4.0|I finally gave in to peer pressure and decided to read this series, although I'm generally not a fan of the fantasy genre at all.  This is the first in what is currently a four-book series, with the fifth currently in the works.  The focus is on two families, the Starks and the Lannisters, which remind one strongly of the Yorks and Lancasters from England's War of the Roses as they scheme against and battle with each other for control of the Iron Throne.  At this point the reader's favor is going to be largely with the Starks, as they're the family being spotlighted, at least in this first installment.  Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell is a good and honest man, but when he's asked to travel south to act as the King's councilor, it's a catalyst for the tensions that have long brewed between the families to openly erupt.  Meanwhile, unbeknownst to either family is a long-forgotten bloodline trying to make an unexpected comeback to power.<br /><br />It's a dark story, with lots of violent death, fighting, and betrayals that might surprise even a hardcore fantasy reader.  The reader spends a lot of time getting to know the sons and daughters of Lord Stark, and I imagine the rest of the series is focused on their growth and development, and then maybe beyond them to the next generation.  There are some nice fantasy touches with creatures like ice vampires and direwolves, and snaking through the tale is the menacing threat of the long, deadly season to come, and which they're all dreading:  \\"Winter is coming.\\"<br /><br />I'll probably wait a bit before reading the second one since I can't take too much fantasy at once, but I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next.  The ending definitely left me hanging.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|I had heard about Le Diner de Cons and how massively successful it had been in France when I lived in London in 1999. I returned to London in 2002 for six months and while browsing through the local library DVD rentals I saw the movie available for rent and remembering the rave reviews it had gotten three years prior I decided to pick it up as a fan of European cinema. I am deprived of European cinema here in Trinidad, West Indies except for the annual European film festival as our cinemas are dominated by American fare. This movie turned out to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I laughed until I cried. Five years later I have decided to buy the DVD to add to my collection. I had forgotten about it until I was watching 'Volver' and they had trailers for other movies including 'The Valet' which is also by the same director as Le Diner de Cons. Remembering how much joy it brought to me I ordered it and I have no regrets. After reading other reviews for this movie here I have to now get 'The Closet' as well. Le Diner de Cons is French farce at its very best and although my French has gone the way of the dodo with lack of practice it is still enjoyable for non-French speakers. I recommend like a beastly cold beer on a hot and sunny day!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Loreena McKennitt is one of my all time favorite recording artists...and she truly deserves the title of artist...she writes, arranges and performs her own music in her own studio, and her voice is gorgeous, her music lush, exotic, rich in complexity and arrangement, and just a delight for the soul.  It is wonderful to have her in good tune, sharing her melodic and stirring \\"musings\\" not in an ancient way at all, but in a modern, satisfying and imaginitive manner that communicates the deepest aspects of her talents directly to our own hearts!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|An action film filled with physical action (not just mechanical as in cars etc.) that sets your heart pumping.  So does the new Bond.  Have fun.
B000001GPX|5.0|A terrific 5th!<br /><br />This is the best rendition of Beethoven's 5th Symphony I've ever heard. It has a continuous pace and energy that I've seldom heard when listening to this piece before.<br /><br />Beethoven's 5th has often described as \\"fate knocking at the door\\". Well Kleiber's interpretation still has fate knocking at the door, but urgently... very urgently, and with the utmost positive effect. (I somehow envision the musicians lathered in sweat and collapsing from fatigue at the end of this piece).<br /><br />This disc also has Beethoven's 7th Symphony; it too is very well done and, on any other CD, would be the focal point of attention.<br /><br />A great CD; one to be considered in anyone's collection of classical music.<br />5 Stars.<br /><br />R. Nicholson

1594200823|5.0|Michael Pollan's delightful treatise on food and dining reads like a novel yet addresses serious issues regarding the deterioration in quality of our American food supply.    Describing the natural history of four meals, (commercial fast food, industrial organic, local pasture based farmed, and hunted / gathered,) Pollan provides a sobering account of the of the nature of the industrial U.S. food supply. He then follows it up with an optimistic suggestion of a new direction we can take to improve human health and the health of the environment: Eating locally raised, pastured animal products.    A powerful exposé of the U.S. \\"corn machine\\", The Omnivore's Dilemma goes into great depth about one of the primary causes of America's health crisis; high fructose corn syrup. I thought I knew how prevalent it was, but was amazed to find out to what extent it pervades and permeates every aspect of our culture.    This is a must-read for anyone who cares about their own health, the health of the environment and agriculture, as well as anyone who loves food and dining.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|I got the dvd without damage or anything. I'm not going to write about the movie because my opinion is not to buy something you know nothing about. It's a great movie though. I must say that shipping was a tad slow but that's expected.
B00008AWOG|5.0|Still Life, like basically any other Opeth  album, is a testament to this band's brilliance. This was their fourth album, and marked a few noticeable changes in Opeth's sound. First, Mikael's growl deepened considerably on this release, and it sounds more proggy than the releases prior to this one. It's also their first album with bassist Martin Mendez. This is also the first Opeth album to feature songs that cross the 10-minute mark and beyond since Morningrise.<br /><br />Still Life, as most people know by now, is about a man sent away from his village. 15 years later, he returns to find his lover, Melinda. He watches her from afar, afraid of being seen by the other villagers, fearing for Melinda's saftey and his own. Eventually, he meets her, and tries to convince her to come with him. But the Council of the Cross, the people who banned him from his village, as well as the people who are in  charge of it, slit Melinda's throat. In his rage, he slaughters the people who took part in murdering her, until he is burned at the cross, and sees Melinda waiting for him in the next life, with open arms. Even though this story is ficticious, I could really see it as something that probably happened a lot in the midevil days. There is more to the store than that, but that's the just of it.<br /><br />In constrast to My Arms Your Hearse, Still Life is softer, and contains more acoustic passages. Like I said before, it also marks the point where they veered from being a spacey, atmospheric band to a more stable, progressive oriented band (not that there's anything wrong with either style). The style of the album still follows the Opeth formula: long, atmospheric inquisitions that makes transitions between brutal (yet still proggy) death metal and quiet, acoustic folk/prog music. But this is the style that we've all come to love and expect from Opeth, so no criticism is called for here! Mikael has awesome guitar solos here with extreme complexity (without sounding too indulgent). Peter provides great rythm guitar riffs that give Opeth their amazing atmospheres. Martin Lopez makes great transitions between maniacal double-bass pounding and soft tapping of the drums. Martin Mendez, as always, is buried behind the rest of the band for the majority of the time, unfortunately. So I can't say much about him, other than the fact that he sounds great whenever he's audible.<br /><br />My favorites off Still Life are: The opening track, The Moor. This song is about when he returns to his village, expressing his hatred for everyone in his former village except Melinda. Mike's clean voice sounds very haunting on this song, and I get chills everytime I hear it. Godhead's Lament. It's one of the heaviest off the album. GL is when the man is marveling at Melinda from a hiding place, seeing that she's been taken in and brainwashed by the Council of the Cross. He also decides to stay in an attempt to get her back (\\"What woould they care if I did stay. No one would know, oh-ho\\"... I love that part!). Great melodies are present on this song, and Mike has a great solo. And finally, Moonlapse Vertigo, which is possibly my favorite track here. Mike sounds like a stray puppy on this song, especially during the part where he sings \\"I would persih at the given signal at the slightest touch from my soul tainted prophet in flesh for all the plagued and lost.\\" In this song, the outcast reminds himself that he'd be killed if the Council saw him. This is also the point where he decides to meet Melinda and take her with him.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this album was neglected in the States, because awful trends like Britney Spears and The Backstreet Boys were polluting the airwaves. No one wanted to dig beneath the surface and find the artworks that Opeth have made and are still making. And while they have gained more recognition in  the U.S. (and everywhere, really), they still haven't gotten the success that so rightfully deserve. Metal is a highly discriminated genre. A shame too, since there are many talented metal bands out there with immense sophsitication, such as Opeth.<br /><br />I don't think Morningrise will ever be kicked out of my spot for \\"favorite Opeth album,\\" but I've come to love this album so much that it has dethroned Orchid as my 2nd favorite Opeth CD. Although, in all truth, I listen to the entire Opeth catalogue and find each album to be a classic, at the risk of sounding like a fanboy. But Still Life, like all of this amazing band's albums, is a spellbinding masterpiece that deserves multiple listens by everyone on the planet, if only people would give it a chance. But hey, maybe all that popularity would corrupt Opeth ;).e many talented metal bands out there with immense sophsitication, such as Opeth.

B000050X31|5.0|The opera is wonderful. Everybody is to listen to and look.  Though I still don't understand why the video is in NTSC and the only language besides English is Chinese.  Is is well known that in Russia we use SECAM and PAL and speak Russian not Chinese. At least if Russian menu and subtitles are not available European languages fit better than Chinese.
B000002UB6|2.0|TO MY SURPRISE, NOTHING REALLY STOOD OUT AS I EXPECTED IT TO. THIS ALBUM DIDN'T DO IT FOR ME 35 YEARS AGO EITHER. I WAS HOPING I WAS WRONG; PERHAPS I'M JUST TIRED LIKE 'THEY' WERE THEN...
B000000XB9|5.0|As Im in my sixties you might think Im to old, but this is my sort of music.I reckon \\" john fogerty \\" is a great singer. Just listen to find out. Hope you like it the same as I do.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Excellent quality.  I also own a video tape of this movie and the clarity of the DVD is remarkable in comparison.  Special features are fun too.  I ordered it because my granddaughter loves this movie so much she has practically worn out the tape.  It is a fun movie and I am enjoying it again as much as I did when my daughter was young.
1582701709|1.0|If you think it it will come... just a bit simplistic- Norman Vincent Peale did a much more inspiring job many many years ago. This book sucks
0374105235|5.0|This is a book that you cannot put down.  It is so unbelievable to think that little children who have suffered so much then do these unimaginable things.    The best part of human nature was the ending to this young man's saga.  Fantastic read!

B000056CUF|5.0|Watch this if you need a really good hard hour-long cry. Sometimes you just do. This film delivers at the end and it's a lovely film that leads up to it.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I have read many reviews on Amazon about this cd...Most say it is not like the other stuff LP released..This is true to a degree..However, it is still a nice record ...It has a different sound but different is better..Why would they still sound the same..That would mean they have not grown as a group.  Well i like the change..I am loving this cd ..
B000OQF6N6|5.0|I loved Smashing Pumpkins in the '90s. But like a lot of people, I was destroyed by Adore. And even though Machina was decent, I never really recovered my previous affection. (Zwan and TheFutureEmbrace almost put me off all music for good!)<br /><br />So I was sure Zeitgiest would be terrible. I was sure the \\"new\\" Pumpkins was just a get-richer quick scheme. I was sure I'd buy the CD, listen to it once and spend the next two weeks complaining about how miserable it is.<br /><br />You know what? It's really, really good. I mean, it's fantastic. When I heard Tarantula for the first time a month or so ago, I liked it, I thought it rocked, but I was sure it would be a fluke. When the CD came out, I read some of the other positive reviews on amazon and from other sources and there started to be a glimmer of hope that it wouldn't be the steaming pile I was still expecting.<br /><br />Then I went and bought it. This CD takes you through all facets of Billy's brilliantly creative mind. The CD is complex and nuanced lyrically, with a variety of sounds that seems to span the \\"real\\" Pumpkins' career. Even if you hate Adore and Zwan, there's something about these songs that move beyond simply reminding you of those failed experiments. These songs forge their own identities. And that's not to mention the songs like Tarantula that rock your face off. United States is my favorite song on the album. I can't wait to hear it live.<br /><br />Seriously, please take the advice of this converted skeptic: Do yourself a favor and buy this CD.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Excellent CD!  I couldn't wait to get it and listen to it all the time.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Band of Brothers is a well-done, deeply moving series and should be watched by all.  As for the video, I wish it had the capability for English subtitles, because I had a hard time understanding all that was said.
0439813786|2.0|About the only nice thing I can say about this books is what I've said in the review title. I find it hard to believe any discerning adult enjoyed this - I certainly did not. The illustration really aren't very good - kind of blotchy without much expression - something an amatuer would come up with. The story itself leaves a lot to be desired and could give adults heartburn for all its inconsistencies and inaccuracies.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|Rambo Series HAs been All time favourite of Mine... This Ultimate Edition is must to have for every Die Hard Fan of RAMBO. The Extras in First Blood & Rambo 3 are Decent but i think the Survival Mode is Little bit Childish, it would have been more Good if they had put some Behind the scenes instead of Survival Mode. Overall This Trilogy Pack is the best money can buy.
0786838655|3.0|I can see the alure of this book to those who haven't read much, but there's really nothing special here. Percy Jackson is a remade Hercules, and well, the Greek gods are the Greek gods as they've been told about countless times before. I thought it was ok over all, good enough to continue to the next one, but not good enough to get excited about. My 11 year old still is working his way through it (since June because in his words its dull, dull, dull). Normally he finishes a book in a few days - that says a lot more about the book than anything I can say.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This is a long boring movie. Stan Lee revolutionized comics by adding an emotional and psychological background to the standard superhero story line. But this technique was just a frame to add depth to the main story of adventure, threat and action. This film focuses on the emo/psych part, leaving a piddling amount of screen time to the action part. This genre screams for action, not endless background plot. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly both appear to be sleepwalking thru their parts. Nick Nolte scares everyone within acting distance by an emotionally drenched method acting demonstration. There is not one scene containing humor, fun, wonderment, adventure, or any kind of thrill whatsoever. This film is a major misfire.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|If you like nature, and science, you will love planet earth. It is amaizing how they captured some of these shots. You will not be disappointed.
B00005ATQF|5.0|FMJ came out during the 80s and of course there were many Nam era movies coming out then.  The Country had started to heal and almost forget about this war, but we cannot forget it ever.  What Kubrick did in order for us to never forget is he took the boot camp that Marines go through and put it right in our faces.  Tough, raw and relentless training that is followed by a tour in a war torn Asian country.  The comeraderie, irony and just plain crazy things that happen to a young person in war are all shown here.   Matthew Modine is awesome in his role as a Marine who is a peace correspondent that is still toting a rifle around.  Overall a must see film that is part truth, part terror and part Kubrick.

B000056VJ7|5.0|Fantastic!  Catchy songs that are both rockin' and yet beautiful.  This is one to have in your music collection.  Good music!  GREAT MUSIC!!!  From start to finish it's fantastic.
B000OLGCHA|3.0|Received the soundtrack prior to having a chance to see the movie since the movie just came out for us yesterday. I was disappointed in the sound track since from Williams' first the HP music has been fun to listen to even as background music while working or whatever. But HP 5 just seemed tune-less. The Umbridge theme is there and annoying as it was designed to be -- increasingly so -- as designed to be -- but this is well, annoying music. Good job. Well, I waited to see the movie before making a judgment on the soundtrack since after all it is music for the movie and the main thing it should do is work well with the movie. And while watching the movie I noticed that it is appropriate noise for the movie -- but, and I realize one of the rules of music is to be not only invisible but inaudible -- not distract from the action -- it is never distracting. It seems never good enough to distract attention from the action. Is this how the science of directing our emotional sense during the movie is going? There will be little point in buying soundtrack noise then. So this is a disappointment. I miss Williams' themes even if they remind us of Star Wars or Indiana Jones or Close Encounters. You can sing some of those. With HP 5 the only thing I can sing is annoying.

B000OT6V00|5.0|First off the movie is great especially this directors cut.  Secondly, the picture quality and sound quality rivals that of the pirates movies on blu-ray so I would say this is a must purchase for those who like the movie and want to show it off
0385338694|5.0|Definitely a unique story... I thorougly enjoyed it.  Took place in England, a highly stressed out lawyer freaks out after making a costly mistake and ends up in the country working as a maid for rich people.  It was highly entertaining.  Worth buying and passing along to your girlfriends.

B0009A40ES|5.0|American Psycho tells the story of the yuppy life to a tee and tells the story of Patrick Bateman falling right off that tee. Christian Bale is excellent in American Psycho. His rendition of a psycho killer is amazing; he switches between yuppy to psycho in an instant and seems to add a bit of humor while doing it.    This is a must see movie for everyone.
0739350323|5.0|I read the book and devoured it and I needed more.  I decided to pick up the audio tape so I could listen to it in my car.  Even with knowing how it ends, it is so exciting and suspenseful!  And being taken away to San Francisco and enjoy the fantasy that the characters are experiencing is magical!    The story is fascinating.  The events that led up to up it are amazing.  I want to go to Paris to visit the Flamel's home.  It's incredible that it still exists and that it was the seed out of which this story grew.
B000E5KJD4|5.0|Great movie to show off what HD DVD can do - and one the wife will enjoy.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is one of the best looking educational/nature series of all times, right up there with Blue Planet. If you really want to see what your PS3 or Blu-Ray player is capable of this is for you. Also way cheaper on Amazon than any other place. This is the BBC version narrated by Sir Richard Attenburrough (sp?) which is far better in my opinion than the Americanized Sigourney Weaver one.
B00009MGGI|5.0|My wife and I had seen the original House of Cards trilogy when first broadcast on PBS in the 90's, and loved Ian Richardson as the evil but charming Francis Urquhart (I think that's spelled right). We'd been meaning to get our own copy of the series, and the issuing of the DVDs, along with his recent death, triggered our order. We just finished watching the entire series, in the space of less than two weeks. We were as anxious to see the next episode as we'd been the first time around. The dialogue is wondrous to listen to - and Urquhart's internal ponderings on the nature of life, politics and passion, and constant asides to the viewer, are often poetic. Richardson's training as a Shakespearean actor is evident in the delivery of every line, but his facial expressions are a revelation. Michael Dobbs, the author of the original novels, was an Parliament insider during the Thatcher years, I believe, and brings realism and unparalleled cynicism to the story (though he didn't do the screenplays). There are shocks and surprises throughout - just when you think things can't get nastier... A final pleasure was that the quality of the DVD recording is excellent; we'd been disappointed with the DVD of the Wilderness Years (the Churchill series of the late 80's), where the audio was almost unlistenable, and the video quality poor. Here, both sound and picture are crisp. Overall, highly recommended - you'll love it, especially at its current price.
0743289684|5.0|I bought this book and then left it on the shelf for some time, thinking it would be a heavy read.  It wasn't.  The book flowed from the pages.  It was engaging, new, and enlightening.  The author is wise beyond her years and her perspective is astounding.  I plan on buying several copies for friends and family... I think this is a book that demands to be shared.  I wish I could sit and talk with the author for a while; she has learned so much and has the mind of a teacher, philosopher, and friend.  Thank you, Ayaan, for opening up the world more for me!  I feel that if everyone in the world could read this book, it might be a better place...

B000OCXMAE|4.0|I've liked Linkin Park since their first album, and this one is no acceptation. But the use of cursing is in poor taste. It does not flow very well with the lyrics and it seems to stagnate the songs.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|I must admit that i bought this CD for one song, and this song is \\"One Way Out\\". I loved the tune because it had a remembrance with the \\"Rat Bat Blue\\" song made by Purple. Now, this CD has a very important thing that it must be mentioned: It is a compilation that includes Duane last concert, before beeing killed in an accident. And also, it includes never before released material, like Statesboro Blues, Hot 'Lanta, among others...<br />It's a good stuff to be heard when you are travelling by car, or, after work sitting in your couch on the living room (i prefer the latter one), so go ahead and buy this, if you want to know Allman Brothers.
1577314808|3.0|I read a little bit of this book.  It goes to a very deep level and it was to deep for my liking.  Some readers might like it, but I think it takes a certain amount of understanding to know the message he is expressing. He tries to break it down but I still had to ask others what he meant. He talks more about the subsconsious mind.   A bit confusing for me, but others may like it.    Thanks,  Sara Omaha, NE.

0316010669|5.0|Gladwells book in an insight to the measurement of ROI. Hardly a week goes by that there isn't a new article about how to measure ROI, as requested by corporate headmasters to justify expenditures. The rational formulas that have been outlined have to be tempered with the unconscious atmosphere. Understanding event functions and the value they bring is a starting point on the measure of return.  Trade shows, sponsorships, product launches and seminars can be measured only in a superficial sense, leads, positioning, placement, all are the means to the end of a sale. Language is so limited in the expression of motivations and reasoning that it has to be tempered with emotions, do we abandon measurement, of course not. Madison Avenue realizes you can't force branding, people have to come to you. Their strategy now is shifting from rational logical reasoning to emotional reasoning. You can ask what they think but until you move them emotionally they won't change their patterns of buying.
B000QGDIKM|4.0|Their third start as a band (second without their bassist and this time with Chamberlin and Corgan only), the Smashing Pumpkings are half of what Siamese Dream used to be: innovative.  This time like Siamese, Billy plays all the instruments with the exception of Jimmy on Drums.  The most radio friendly songs include Tarantula, (Come On) Let's Go!, and Bring the Light.  Here you will find songs in contrast to The Future Embrace and a mixture of Zwan's Mary Star of the Sea and Machina.  The lyrics are political like \\"the're bound to kill us\\" from Doomsday Clock and \\"revolution!\\" from the song United States.  The multiple-page book shows images of Paris Hilton (Starz), the U.S. podium, death, and children.  The booklet also includes the lyrics to all songs and images of the two remaining Pumpkins.  All photos were taken by Billy Corgan using multiple images to show what politicians are doing to America or in some cases facism.  The music is lyrical and fueled by guitars and drums.  One of the songs, Bleeding the Orchid, shows a sensitive side to what Corgan is trying to achieve with this reunion.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Product purchased is as good as can be purchased in a local store but is less expensive. It also came sooner that I expected. The Series is my favorite WW2 docu-drama.
032147404X|5.0|Easy to read and very concise. Not bogged down with a lot of technical info that most people could care less about. Rather, the book offers recipes on how to achieve a certain shot. Also some basic concepts and equipment you need and why. Some of the humor in the book was very funny and much of it fell flat, but over all made the book that much better to read.  This book is perfect for the new photographer looking to improve the quality of the photos. I can not recommend this book enough to casual photographers looking to greatly improve how they take photos.

B0000797IO|2.0|All I heard when this film hit the theatre was how good Aniston's performance was.  After viewing this movie, I feel like the odd woman out.  Really how hard is it to act depressed?  And that accent-Lord help.  Gyllenhaal, as always, is astounding.  He and his sister are definitely talented and are rising stars.  John C. Reilly the underappreciated talent is also good.  Aniston-needs to go back to tv with her other friends and stop masquerading as a movie star.  I suspect now that Mr. Pitt is gone that will be where she'll get future work.  The film isn't a total bust, there are some thought-provoking questions posed but the plot was entirely too transparent.  I knew what was going to happen to Holden back when he first started giving her books to read.  Overall: It's just not my cup of tea.

B000BB1MI2|3.0|2.5 stars.  I had long thought that Depp was a remarkable actor.  I remember over a decade ago when I shared that thought with some movie friends and was literally laughed at, now it's an accepted fact. Woo hoo for me.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is just another shiny example of the risks Johnny is willing to take to bring us unique characters and one of the things about this film I like is his total committment to his performance.  Course there was something inconsistent about an arrested developed man seeming to not like children.  Given his history with his father, I could understand him not liking parents, but in the movie, he really seemed to get along with them better.  Still a good Michael Jackson impersonation.  And for that I say Bravo.  The other great things about this the movie are the wonderful sets for Willy Wonka's extraordianry chocolate factory.  They are literally eye candy for the movie audience.  But as a whole, I can't say that I was blown away by this movie.  In fact, there are portions of the movie where I was bored and was entertaining doing a few house chores instead--and I HATE chores.  Anyway, this goes to show that sometimes even great performances can't save a movie.  Overall: watch at your own risk.

B00003CWPL|5.0|Me pareció un film sorprendente, muy atrevido para los comienzos de david lynch, estoy fascinado con el film, en este, Lynch nos muestra un mundo industrializado, oscuro, lúgubre, irreal, donde la vida humana agoniza, donde el personaje principal sufre, al perder lo mas valioso de si, su esencia o por decirlo de otro modo, su esperanza de amar, de vivir plenamente, éste como otros films de lynch como Blue Velvet e Inlandempire, se muestra esperanzador y al final de la pelicula existe esa reconciliación del personaje consigo mismo y con su lado espiritual, una pelicula con un estilo distinto, pero no deja de ser extraordinaria...
B000007MVD|4.0|I grew up in the 80s and my family used to always play The Beatles, especially during the Holidays.<br />They were the first Rock band I have ever appreciated.<br />And I have many memories, spending Christmas w/ family, eating turkey, etc.<br />  Throughout my teens I collected all The Beatles' studio albums on vinyl and Cd.<br /> I knew much of the pop Music that was out during the 90s has borrowed from the Best.<br />  Until recently I have never owned anything Live by The Beatles. I just recently bought 'Live at the BBC' and enjoyed it from start to finish. 69 tracks in all. Includes some 'talk' tracks and silliness.<br />  Normally I don't care for cover songs, but The Beatles do make these 50s classics sound as if they were their own.<br /> They cover influences like Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, Elvis, Little Richard and Chuck Berry. I do enjoy hearing these covers and the Fab Fours originals(many unreleased) together on this set.<br />  At this point in 1962, I don't think many in the Audiense knew that the Beatles would become one of the Greatest Rock n Roll bands of All time.<br />- This 2 disc set really captures The Beatles at their youngest and up-beat, just creating their sound that was to come- on 'Rubber Soul' and so on.. ~4 1/2 stars~

B0001AP14E|5.0|After years as a celebrated producer behind the boards at Roc-A-Fella Records, Chicago native Kanye West finally delivered his own solo debut, \\"The College Dropout,\\" in 2004. \\"The College Dropout\\" really is a wonder of a project to behold, an overblown and at times ridiculous showcase of a man and his life. While the production is the kind of excellent music you'd expect, I think Kanye really made this album special because of his work on the microphone. He's not the kind of street rapper and vocabularist like most of his labelmates, rather, I think he found so much mainstream appeal because he comes across as very human. His verses sound very conversational, a lot of people can relate to his everyday subject matter, and he makes himself look like an underdog in a world full of gangsta rappers. What also makes him endearing is that although he really is a great rapper, he does his best not to flaunt it. Sometimes, he'll rhyme a word with the same word in the next line, or end a verse by flowing off the beat just to show he's human. The journey he speaks of from college dropout to depressed wage worker to lucky hip hop producer is fairly inspiring and part of what makes him so likable. Before the media started portraying him as someone with an oversized character, \\"The College Dropout\\" made many believe otherwise. The songs throughout the album are emotional, thought-provoking, and fun. The production ended up having a wide influence throughout hip hop. Kanye's sample-heavy beats are nostalgic for an earlier era, using squeaky, sped-up vocal samples. His sound is very unique and is almost as friendly as his microphone presence. There are a few very minor missteps over the course of the debut, but \\"The College Dropout\\" is a winner, an unlikely champion and a widely influential album.<br /><br />After the intro, the album begins with the anthemic \\"We Don't Care,\\" an anthem for kids from the wrong side of the tracks about overcoming struggles. The song is funny and very catchy. On the single \\"All Falls Down,\\" Kanye recounts the ways of an image-troubled woman, and his lyrics here might be the best on the album, full of irony and funny one-liners. The beat is also quite clever. Another one of my favorites is \\"Spaceship,\\" a song where a depressed Kanye provides insight into the life of a poor man with few options, another excellent production with an anthemic quality. The hit \\"Jesus Walks\\" was a landmark for hip hop. Despite being a lyrically and musically piece of creative genius, this song really brought Christian influence to urban radio, and Kanye should be respected for that. Jay-Z and J. Ivy guest on the inspired \\"Never Let You Down,\\" a highlight, and Talib Kweli and Common are featured on the light, loopy club track \\"Get 'Em High.\\" \\"The New Workout Plan\\" is meant to be a humorous song, it's a low point on the disc though, it doesn't fit in too well and doesn't come off very well. The classic \\"Slow Jamz\\" follows, the hit collaboration with Jamie Foxx and Twista. The version on \\"The College Dropout\\" is a slightly remixed version from the one you might be familiar with, but it maintains its creative genius and hilarious hook and gorgeous music. \\"Breathe In Breathe Out\\" is another club song along the lines of \\"Get 'Em High,\\" this one featuring Ludacris. It's not my favorite, but a perfectly fine addition to the tracklist. \\"School Spirit\\" is a very ironic look at American culture. Kanye maintains that the structure of high schools and poor people's feelings that they must pay for college is unnecessary, it's a very interesting take to hear. Mos Def and Freeway guest on the rough \\"Two Words,\\" followed by Kanye's classic first single, \\"Through the Wire.\\" I absolutely love this song, a dramatic and epic count of his near-fatal car accident, over a perfect beat anchored with a Chaka Khan sample. This song was infamously recorded with his jaw wired shut, and it was a perfect single. The album closes with the sad \\"Family Business\\" and the 13-minute \\"Last Call,\\" an interesting track where he recalls his entire musical career.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The College Dropout\\" is an inspired, entertaining, and fulfilling debut from a truly multitalented artist. It's received a fair amount of hate for all the success it had, but I think this was undeserved. From a lyrical and musical perspective, this album is excellent from all sides, and I highly recommend it to all hip hop fans.inute \\"Last Call,\\" an interesting track where he recalls his entire musical career.

B000OONTFU|5.0|This trilogy has groundbreaking writing, directing, editing, and special effects, which all add up to a instant classic sci-fi action movie. As far as all the compatibility issues, it is quite common for early HD DVD drives (which all are as of this writing) to require firmware updates to provide compatibility with new HD DVDs. If the HD DVD is manufactured to spec (which all are if they carry the HD DVD logo), it is your drive manufacturers job to provide a firmware upgrade to make their non-compliant drive up to spec, not the movies job to work with every version of firmware ever made for every drive. Luckily all HD DVD drives include ethernet access to easily download firmware from the internet.  Anyways, rate your drive 1 star, not the movie! For my experience, all discs played fine on the Xbox 360, so don't take the experience for one reviewer to mean it won't work for you, and if it doesn't don't freak out, just contact the player manufacturer to see if it is a known issue and wait for the firmware update.
B000Q6GXW2|2.0|The lighting is so dark that it's very difficult to see in many scenes. The scenery look like video games which I don't like. Many times, the scenery look so obviously created by computer graphics that it clearly shows the low budget of this film. The fighting scenes are not as thrilling and real as Kingdom of Heaven or Gladiator.    It's worth watching once.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|Speed starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock is still the best action movie of all-time. This film was released in 1994 and still to this day, Speed never grows tepid or outdated. How can you not love Sandra Bullock? This film put her on the map, she's spunky, fearless, and funny as Annie. So glad Reeves got to play a serious guy who turns into a hero, anyone remember Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure? (so not the movie for him). If you enjoy a good action film then Speed will be your new best friend. A must-have!
0743556003|4.0|I have only listened to this story on CD. I have read the complaints about all the cutesy words and phrases and the reader - Mare Winningham makes them feel absolutetly appropriate. SOWISA becomes the adreniline charged call to lock and load it should be and it sticks in your smucking head long after the story is over. We all know that no matter what the \\"other\\" place is called its really part of the \\"Territories\\" and it good to hear that word again no matter how briefly. If you have the chance to listen to Lisey's Story on CD please try it. You might enjoy a very different experience with this work.

B000LC3ID8|4.0|Saw III is probably considered a bloody mess and this sequel does tend to drip on the sloppy side, but Saw III still pulls off another fascintating, twist ending. No big names in this one, just the return of Jigsaw and his apprentice, Amanda. Some of the graphic and brutal tortue scenes are kind of silly but I always liked to story behind as to why these individulas don't appreciate their lives (Jigsaw has an obsession of people who don't feel grateful). This sequel doesn't compare to the original or even Saw II, but if you want to know how this baby ends then indulge yourself in a little game of cat and mouse. Enjoy!
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|I read Point Of Impact by Stephen Hunter a few years back and thinking this would make a decent movie.I was right on target.This is a good movie with Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee Swagger a marine scout leader pulled away from his home up in the country to stop an assassination attempt on the president.It backfires and now he's being framed for it.He spends most of the time running and hiding on occasion fires his weapon on the folks setting him up.Danny Glover{who i liked in the Lethal Weapon series} plays a nasty man who keeps spewing I win you loose in Marks face.There's only one man who believes his story and they set out to fix it.Ned Beatty plays a Senator running the whole show.Its a well paced movie sometimes Mark speaks so low you wished it had subtitles,but never the less it unravels to a satisfying conclusion.
B000J103PC|3.0|This movie does not accurately reflect the tone of the book, as a result of a very conscious decision not to do so.<br /><br />The concept of the book is that Andy's boss is \\"the devil\\".  She's awful.  She's a nightmare of a boss.  She intimidates all of her employees.  She is not just demanding with them, she is sadistic with them.  She lies to them, puts them through hell for her own amusement, constantly berates them, breaks them down, wrecks them.<br /><br />Meryl Streep in the movie is nothing like that.  She is the Disney version.  She is Carol Burnett at that time of the month, a bit cranky.<br /><br />The book's title villain could best be played by that snippy British lady who hosted The Weakest Link.  She would be perfect for the role of Miranda Priestly.<br /><br />If she were not available for the movie, I'd cast Cruella DeVille in the role.  She hasn't had a decent starring role since knocking us dead with 101 Dalmatians.<br /><br />The book made a statement about the fashion industry being a bad influence on young girls, turning them into self hating anorexics.  The movie did no such thing, and in fact took it in the opposite direction, showing a very positive image of the fashion industry.<br /><br />The most entertaining part of the book was simply left out.  I loved when Andy tried to get into her office building, in a mad hurry, loaded down with four Starbucks coffees and a few dozen scarves, and the security guard at the entrance locked the turnstile, refusing to let her in the building until she sang to him.  I can't believe they left that out.  It was the most fun thing in the book.  And it also set up the big finish in the book, when this same security guard showed respect for Andy as he played with the new girl in the same way he used to tease Andy.<br /><br />All in all, I wish they were truer to the book, because I think it was a very good book.  The movie was good in its way, and had a good ending, but I really wish that these film people would show more respect for the original author and I wish they didn't Disnify things.h they didn't Disnify things.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My son and nieces saw Wicked on Broadway three years ago and it took me this long to order the CD.  I played it endlessly the last several weeks and as a long time musical afficionado can say unequivocally, it is a superlative example of score and libretto.  The lyrics are exemplary in their poignancy and clever massage of the concepts of good and evil.  The music tugged at every heartstring I have.  Wicked is sublime!

The sound of the horn from Miles makes you want to cling to every note and have them just lay next to your soul. It will take you into the minds eye where you will see and feel the greatness within you and yours.  This is a must share CD. I mean you must share the mood with that person of rare bread of taste.  This is ome CD that the five pleasure zones will be thankful.
1594489505|3.0|I thought the first half of the book was fair, while the main characters were being developed, but the second half was very good.

0316067598|5.0|I am a former U.S. Marine Corps Captain and I recommend this book very highly. It is the action filled true account of some of our very best modern day Spartan warriors. Modern American heroes whose stories deserve to be widely known by everyone in this country. Without question, this book should be required reading for every high school student in America. If you are a veteran, go out and get this book right now. Your eyes will water up with tears and you will want to go out and immediately kill terrorists with reckless abandonment! I am sure this book will soon be a movie - if not, something is very, very wrong. The author Marcus Lattrell is both a Navy SEAL and a Navy Corpsman. He is also a proud Texan and in my opinion he is right up there with the heroes of the Alamo. He was awarded the Navy Cross for his role in Operation Redwing. Apparently he has just left active duty with the goal of going to Medical School. Hopefully, someone will come forward and help make this happen.

I won't even go over the songs they are all great, this is a great package since it includes the DVD of the album being recorded. I watched and actually laughed along with the band, it was great to see this group of guys together and havin fun with no pressure to produce this, but it was a labor of love of music. Fantastic, just go buy it.
1594489505|4.0|Terrific book--historical, sad, poignant and a terrific read. I think this book may be better than \\"The Kite Runner\\". It also gives you an additional insight as to what has gone on inside Afganistan which many readers are less than familiar with.t

Stallone gives a solid performance, Pauly is pretty good too.  I was very resistant to dropping $9 to see it in the theatre, but welcomed the opportunity to use Unbox to watch it from the comfort of my living room.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I have always loved the Pride & Prejudice story, and both previous major versions of film adaptation. I fell in love with this particular version right from minute one, and was immediately captivated by the wondrous music, primarily centered on the piano. It is brilliantly performed by Jean-Yves Thibaudet.    If more modern music was of this caliber, the world would be a more noble place. No film score collection is complete without this item.

With fast paced fun hard-hitting licks on such songs Hotrod Honeymoon, Jeff makes it fun to listen to him again . I've enjoyed the cd so much I keep playing it over and over

Just started out reading and though I feel a little overwhelmed I can so much relate to all the patterns being discussed. Its being tough to digest and register the terminologies but I am sure I will get there as I progress. Definitely the best technical books I have ever purchased and is must have for any one who is involved with application integration !
B00005JPCF|2.0|I didn't hate this as much as some people did, but it was not that entertaining to me either.  It was cute idea, but they really messed it up.  The kids probably won't like it.  I don't know what audience they were aiming for, but this movie fails for any audience.  I didn't think the animation was all that wonderful when compared to many other current animated films.  Skip this one and get: \\"Ice Age, The Meltdown\\" instead.  It's a much better movie, a lot funnier, much more upbeat and everyone will love it.
074356619X|4.0|Love being able to listen to Secret contributors as I drive.  Plus there are some additional comments in the CD set that were not (I believe) included in the movie and definitely were not in the book.  You can also focus on those portions of The Secret that you choose to reinforce the concept.<br /><br />However, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired; it is a fold-over cardboard-type wrapper and 2 CDs of mine slipped out of the jacket and were damaged.  The mfr should have distributed the 4-CD set with a 4-CD jewel case, supplied a single-CD case with the set or added \\"sides\\" to the cardboard wrapper.<br /><br />The only thing lacking - and this applies to all versions of The Secret --nobody tells you HOW to do this ... or that you need to be spirtually planted, so to speak.  Just general steps 1 (ask), 2 (believe), 3 (act like you have it) are given along with lots of comments by contributors.
0812975219|1.0|The title of this book is a bit misleading.  A better title might have been:  \\"Fooled by Randomness:  How Foolish Other People are and How Much More Worldly and Clever I am Than They (With Emphasis on My Fondness for Parenthetical Exposition)\\"    Reading various recommendations of the book elsewhere, I had the sense that this was a popular book about randomness.  Having read half of this book thus far, it appears to be nothing more than a narcissistic, meandering stroll through anecdotes relating to randomness, with heavy emphasis on how *totally kewl* the author is compared to various bond traders, mathematicians and dentists.      There is certainly insightful information to be gleaned from this text, but...WOW, is it painful to do so.    If you are a fan of Mr. Taleb, this might be the book for you.  If you are looking for an accessible book about randomness and statistics, it might be better to utilize the \\"other people bought...\\" links.
0143038419|1.0|Not one interesting character. Not even the author. A horrible divorce... big deal. A love of food ... not really worth 116 pages. I had to get to page 156 to finally understand. She is in an Ashram in India having trouble silencing her mind and meditating.     \\"What I am alarmed to find in meditation is that my mind is actually not that interesting a place after all.\\"      That sentence sums up the book
0823013626|5.0|Donna Kato is a perfectionist and a wonderful teacher.  She is generous with her expertise and \\"secrets\\" of this craft form.  This book is so well put together that experienced clay artists will find much to inspire them and refine their art, while beginners will learn quickly and develop their craft.  Donna's style is elegant and adventurous, rarely \\"cute\\", and the final products, as she makes them, are worthy of high end jewelry stores and craft galleries. But she makes the techniques so accessible that I think even novices will produce something to be proud of.  In addition to a beginning section on all the basics of working with clay, the actual projects include details for finishing and refining them so that they don't have that \\"homemade\\" look.  Even if you're just a dabbler in this field (like me), you will appreciate the beauty of the book and the level of instruction.  It inspires you to think that, if you really took the time, you could make something this wonderful, too!
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|Revised review date: June 6th, 2012<br /><br />Call it magic, call it lightning in a bottle, call it any commendable descriptive you want, KING KONG (RKO,1933), is one of those rare films that just gets better with age. This is because we watch it now as a 1930's fable that has transcended its own time and has become an American myth. The undiminished, primordial energy it continues to generate derives from all aspects of production; from Willis O'Brien's tour de force special effects and Murray Spivack's innovative early sound mix, to Max Steiner's brilliantly evocative music score.<br /><br />The performances as well are in perfect sync with the larger than life premise of this adventure/fairy tale classic. Fay Wray's iconic portrayal of the beauty who kills the beast set the standard for every damsel in distress that followed, and her lusty screams are the female equivalent of Johnny Weismuller's celebrated Tarzan yell. Most impressive of all is Kong himself, who projects such a distinctive personality that we willingly dismiss the fact that he is only a visual effect. Who can forget those expressive, blinking eyes of his at the hotel window when he recognizes Fay Wray?<br /><br />But even beyond all the indelible imagery, the film also rates high marks for Ruth Rose's wholly original screenplay, which has a subtext that's based on the real life exploits shared by co-directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack in making expeditionary films. This essential, autobiographical approach drives the first third of KING KONG and serves effectively as build-up to the wild fantasy that ultimately takes over. The film is as much a personal work as is anything by Erich von Stroheim or Charlie Chaplin, and this explains in part why the remakes fall far short of the original. Consider: The \\"Old Arabian Proverb\\" that follows the opening credits and has since become a part of popular folklore was written by Cooper, the intrepid filmmaker Carl Denham (played with 30's style, two fisted gusto by Robert Armstrong) was fashioned after Cooper, the girl shy first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot in a rare heroic turn) was based on Schoedsack, and the pilots machine gunning Kong in that famous, fantastic finale atop the newly built Empire State Building are actually Cooper and Schoedsack. KING KONG interweaves fact and fiction with such clever subtlety that audiences are, perhaps, still largely unappreciative of this unique aspect of a film that's quite unlike any other ever made. All the various filmmaking elements are perfectly balanced so that they accomplish exactly what they're supposed to, namely, to drive the story forward with clockwork precision. Dialog is tight, the characters aren't complicated, and shots and scenes don't run any longer than they should. While the narrative is ostensibly simple, there's a lot more under the surface that penetrates our subconscious, and a closer examination reveals some intriguing parallels and timeless themes.* It's a great, shrewdly conceived piece of escapist entertainment that endures, inviting us back for repeated viewings so that in the end we realize there will always be only one Kong.<br /><br />Warner's Blu-ray Book Edition is unquestionably the most definitive presentation of KING KONG possible. The video/audio quality edges out the previous DVD, and for serious Kongphiles upgrading is a given. The 1080p resolution looks like film; deep blacks, rich grays and sparkling whites, so that whatever should be seen is seen in crisp detail. This is especially noticeable in the Skull Island scenes with their intricate, Gustave Dore inspired backgrounds, giving the film an engraved quality that leaps from the screen. The bold, mono soundtrack has an immediate presence that really comes across in this restoration, doing full justice to Max Steiner's awesome score. We can now savor better than ever before the magnificent craftsmanship that went into every frame of this truly amazing and influential cinematic landmark.<br /><br />The extraordinary special features include an engaging commentary by stop-motion legend Ray Harryhausen and effects artist Ken Ralston, a fascinating profile on Merian C. Cooper, a 7 part documentary that is one of the most thorough ever done on the making of a movie, the original test footage for Willis O'Brien's abandoned CREATION project, a re-construction of the famed Lost Spider Pit Sequence (the Holy Grail of all lost movie scenes), and a re-issue theatrical trailer. The profusely illustrated book with liner notes by historian Rudy Behlmer is the best one Warner has done to date, and should be stored in the cool collector's tin from the previous DVD release that has the souvenir program and poster reproductions. It all makes for a killer Kong collection indeed.<br /><br />My all-time favorite movie, KING KONG had a profound impact on me when I first saw it as an 11 year old, and this glorious edition of \\"The Eighth Wonder of the World\\" gets my unreserved, highest recommendation.<br /><br />Long live the King!<br /><br />*Footnote: Here are some examples of KING KONG's intriguing concepts:<br /><br />(1) The film presents an allegory on the destructive powers of both unrequited love and modern civilization.<br /><br />(2) The motto of a Cooper/Schoedsack film was the three D's: \\"keep it distant, difficult and dangerous.\\" This motto was stamped into the film by having the last names of the main characters begin with D: Ann Darrow, Carl Denham and Jack Driscoll.<br /><br />(3) Like Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 (1963), KING KONG is a movie about movies and their ability to mirror life. Denham starts out to make an extraordinary film despite the misgivings of his backers. This echoes exactly what Cooper and Schoedsack did when embarking on KONG, which was both daring and innovative at the time. The plot of Denham's proposed film - a fearsome beast falls in love with an innocent beauty, causing him to let down his guard allowing his enemies to destroy him - becomes the actual premise of KING KONG itself. Denham never finished his movie, but through the course of Cooper and Schoedsack's film, Denham's spectacle gets played out in ways he never imagined. The curious New Yorkers flocking to see \\"Carl Denham's Giant Monster\\" could easily be stand-ins for Depression era audiences that packed theaters to witness KING KONG when it opened in 1933.<br /><br />(4) The film revolves around the theme of sacrifice. Ann Darrow is sacrificed to Kong - Kong in turn is sacrificed to greedy profiteers - Kong ultimately sacrifices his own life for Ann through his single minded, misunderstood desire to protect her, thus bringing the theme full circle.<br /><br />(5) There are a number of striking parallels and juxtaposed images:<br />(a) The aforementioned movie plot of Denham's that metamorphoses into actual occurence.<br />(b) Driscoll is Kong's rival; like Kong, Driscoll at first is tough, but he gradually softens by his attraction to Ann.<br />(c) Iggy, the monkey aboard ship who takes a liking to Ann, also foreshadows Kong.<br />(d) Skull Island, with its primordial jungles and high cliffs, corresponds with the civilized island of Manhattan and its modern \\"jungle\\" teeming with skyscrapers.<br />(e) Ann Darrow on the stone altar, tied to two pillars as a sacrifice for Kong, mirrors when Kong is shackled on a steel \\"altar\\" in New York, as a sacrifice for exploitation and greed. The physicality of the imagery is identical - in both cases their arms are raised and spread apart.<br />(f) The prehistoric creatures Kong fights in his native habitat are counterparts to the man-made trains and airplanes he later defies in New York. In both locales he's fighting for possession of his precious captive.<br />(g) Kong atop the Empire State Building is the ultimate, iconic image of primitive nature challenging modern civilization.<br /><br />(6) There's also the theme of wanting something you can't or weren't meant to have. Itstarts with the apple - \\"the forbidden fruit\\"- that Ann Darrow tries to steal in the beginning. It's what triggers the chain of events: Ann herself is stolen by the natives and offered to Kong, who in turn isn't allowed to keep her. Even the leitmotif Max Steiner composed for Kong and Ann is appropriately called, \\"Stolen Love\\". Kong himself is stolen from his island and greedily exploited by a modern civilization that ultimately steals away his life.<br /><br />All of these concepts work on a subconscious level, making KING KONG far more than simply some shallow excursion in special effects. It's a sophisticated, modern Greek tragedy that transcends social/cultural boundaries. A film that's the very embodiment of the term, classic.ies to destroy him - becomes the actual premise of KING KONG itself.

B000E5N62U|1.0|I don't understand it. I LOVE Steely Dan. Own the box set. Play it a lot. Had all the albums and GOLD and PRETZEL LOGIC on CD before I bought the box. Like just about everything on the box set (which of course has the FULL Dan catalogue up through GAUCHO on it)<br /><br />So how come the only Fagen solo project I even like is THE NIGHTFLY?<br /><br />I think the answer is simple: hooks. Steely Dan's got `em but Fagen usually skips them.<br /><br />The one decent tune here, \\"Security Joan\\", is a come-on to a woman who makes her living vetting possible airport troublemakers.<br /><br />I can't live by music alone, Don...you gotta find a way to pair it with catchier words next time out.
006085880X|5.0|i have seen this movie and am really looking forward to getting my hands on this book; i also own plain truth, which i have also seen the movie on lifetime.  one thing that i have found is that the books are usually like 10x better than the movies-all i really have to do is find time to read them!  this is one author that i have heard nothing but great reviews about, so i suggest that anyone who has not yet read a book by her too pick one up asap!
B0000029DD|5.0|A friend turned me on to Jeff Buckley music and am now a fan.  His sound is so good and haunting.  Even though his life was cut so short, his music lives on forever.
B00003CXIP|5.0|We've all been there. It's summertime, when you're with a few, great friends and wanna go on a big adventure. Well, that's what \\"Stand By Me\\" is about; a brilliant mix of laugh-out-loud humor and introspective moments of awe, it's a movie that never wears thin.       The overall plot is that four boys, from ages twelve to thirteen, hear of a dead body and go searching overnight for it. There's plenty of summer adventure in it, big laughs among friends, and that feeling of living in the wild, if only for about forty-eight hours. And then, there's that feeling of change that, for at least one point in our life, we get nervous about. That necessity of holding onto friends even as you get separated from there. It puts you in such a state, as it's displayed in such an honest, realistic way that it captivates you all the way through.       What impresses me a lot about \\"Stand By Me\\" is how it just seems to carry on at full speed. There never seems to be a dull moment and by the time it's over, you may feel astonished that it's already done with. Like with a lot of other, great movies, this one has many, sub-situations the four guys get themselves into, and if it's not enough that they're racing a gang of older guys and outrun a junkyard dog, need I say more than such things as \\"campfire stories\\" or \\"a lake of leeches\\"? *shudders*       Without revealing the resolution, the ending shows the adult Gordie, who has been narrating the whole thing. The ending is very powerful and moving, and as the credits roll, the '61 song \\"Stand By Me\\" plays.       This is an excellent summer movie that goes by quickly, but leaves such an impression on you that you'll remember and love it forever. But through all the drama and action, it's a definite work of art that's sure to please anyone who sees it.
1582701709|5.0|Ms Byrne presented one of the best docu' films ever is this catagory. I also read the book which was exceptionally written. First I read the book I rec'd as a gift and then I watched the film. I have watched it 5 times so far. I will keep it on the top of my DVD collection and continue watching it as I learn and apply The Secret. BRAVO to all the contributors Ms. Byrne has assembled for the film's presentation.  May I give it 10 STARS?
B0000042MY|5.0|I play this CD over and over again.  It is a fantastic soundtrack to a fantastic movie!  As you listen to each track, it places you at that scene in the movie.  The music is very emotional and moving!  If you liked the movie--buy the CD!    Sharon Ascherl, Maryland, USA
B000LC3ID8|1.0|Did you like the first Saw film?<br /><br />Forget about it. This film rips out the heart and guts of that movie.<br /><br />Did you like Saw II?<br /><br />Forget about that, too! This film says it was all a lie.<br /><br />What a pile of tripe this film is. I HATE movies that circumvent everything that came before while calling themselves sequels.<br /><br />What a colossal waste of time. Seriously, if you liked the first two movies, skip this. It falls into the \\"It never happened\\" category of film making. Take the first two as the complete story and skip everything that comes after. Trust me on this. Why the hell make something like this after two very good films?<br /><br />No, I will not be wasting my precious time on any \\"sequels.\\"<br /><br />Idiots. Good thing I only rented it.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money.

B000QEIORG|5.0|To say that I am a big fan of the Foo Fighters is an understatement. I have all their albums, and a few singles. This is definetly worth getting.    Now I will be 100% honest. There Is Nothing Left To Lose is still my personal favorite cd. The Colour And The Shape is a very, very close second. Don't get me wrong. I love Colour, and some people like this album the best.    This cd however is still one of my favorite cd's of all time. My hero and everlong are just so perfect, not to mention see you and new way home.     The extra tracks are awesome. I don't like requiem and drive me wild. Never have. But the rest I love! Very great b side tracks.    If you are a border line fan and don't really have one of their cd's, get this one first. You will be blown away. And even if you have the original, this is definetly worth the buy.
B000OVLBEO|1.0|If Ghost Rider doesn't win a Razzy Award for Worst Picture of 2007, then there is something wrong. It is bad with a capital B!    Ghost Rider completed filming back in 2005, but it was shelved because the studio didn't believe the film was good enough to be released. Apparently a lot of editing was done and a great deal of the film was scuttled, resulting in the disaster that was presented in 2007. Whenever a film sits gathering dust for that long, you can be pretty certain that it is not going to be very good.    Nicolas Cage (who looks like he has a 50 year old's head on a 30 year old's body) absolutely chews up the scenery with such a bad acting job, attempting to channel Elvis Presley. In one scene he goes through some sort of Bad Acting 101 display as he dramatically and very slowly (not in slow motion though) raises his arm and points (but doesn't use the single index finger that most of us would use) and then utters the brilliantly scripted: \\"Yoooooooooooooooooooooou\\" as he speaks to Peter Fonda who laughably plays the devil.    Cage was never secretive about his desire to play this character. Apparently he has been a fan of the comic for a long time. He must have put up some of the money for the film, because that can be the only explanation for the lousy performance. There's no reason for his character to speak like Elvis (and he isn't consistent in delivering it that way either).    The special effects are cool in some scenes, but the battle scenes are really a let down. I've seen better in video games. Even the transformation from man to Ghost Rider is not exciting. It looks fake (which, I'll grant you is really misleading since no such creature exists. However, Marvel has done a great job with XMen and the Fantastic Four in creating films that incorporate the real world into their mythos). That said, the transformation should have been more dramatic and less drawn out.    Cage's rug is its own character. And that brings to surface something really creepyabout this film. Cage playing the title character. Never mind that he's about thirty years older than the character is supposed to be. Never mind that he overacts so badly that you feel compelled to turn away from the screen. It's the fact that he looks so very very old. His face is craggy and his pores look huge. He actually looks like he is ill: his body ripped with sinewy muscle, but his face drawn and sallow.    Eva Mendes doesn't so much act as she moves around a bit and smiles and delivers a line.    Wes Bentley resurfaces from previously committing career suicide (he insulted Harvey Weinstein of Miramax and threw prima donna tantrums on the set of The Four Feathers, garnering Weinstein's wrath to the point of being exiled from A list films)and plays one of the devil's sons: Blackheart. Bentley once said he would never be caught dead in a special effects film, because he was a \\"serious actor\\". Well, he's right about one thing: he is serious....seriously bad. Bentley phones in his performance and seems about as menacing as a Chatty Cathy doll.     Maybe there were supposed to be better special effects added that never happened. Maybe there was a better film that ended up on the cutting room floor. Maybe there really is a man in the moon. Who cares? It doesn't matter about the maybes, because the film that we see in this DVD is so bad that it should have remained on the shelf.

Read it, you will not regret it.
B000O1799U|4.0|Dreamgirls is a spin-off of the legendary Supremes.  I am a baby boomer and remember well as a teen the success story of Motown and its most popular group the Supremes later known as Diana Ross & The Supremes.  I must keep the focus that the movie is an adaptation of the Broadway production of Dreamgirls.  It's hard to believe that it was on Broadway 25 years ago.    It is a challenge to separate the real story from the stage and screen production.  Yet focusing on the movie I found several areas somewhat disconnected. The singing production of \\"we are a family\\" was too much of an acceptance from everyone telling Effie that she should suddenly step aside and perform backup when from the beginning it was emphasized that Effie is a front line singer.      The singing production of \\"And I am Telling You\\" was a bit choppy and though Jennifer's performance was outstanding, it seemed that editing left a vital part on the editing floor.    The story could have dealt more in the lives of each person, the brother, the mother, Curtis, everyone.  It was more of a push and pull situation of songs and storyline.  Much of the story was predictable and somewhat boring.  The ending was too much a fairytale.  Since it's on DVD it should be offered as a complete story without editing.
B00005MP58|2.0|After reading all the good reviews, I bought this version with great expectation but was left disappointed by the hype.  While this version closely chronicles the book, it lacked passion and suspense.  The chemistry between Lizzie, Darcy, Jane, and Bingley was rather dull and unbelievable.    The casting was off:  Jane and Lizzie were too mature...I found Darcy absolutely unapproachable...Mrs. Bennet was odiously played...Mr. Bennet lacked that sarcastic wit and timing.  Sigh.  I still prefer and love the version with Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFayden despite its adaptation.
B00005RHGL|5.0|This is an incredibly entertaining movie and the development of the relationships between the major characters really makes you explore the human condition.  What really snaps me to attention is at the end of the movie where the narrator says that Wyatt Earp died in 1929 in Los Angeles.  Maybe not for some but 1929 wasn't all that long ago.  I always thought the \\"Wild West\\" was some bygone era but, in truth, it was only yesterday.

B000P0J024|5.0|This release of the two Traveling Wilburys albums is a great package of some of the finest music from the 80's.  All that super talent coming together just can't be beat.  The bonus dvd included gives us some lasting footage of Roy Orbison & George Harrison as well as the rest of the Wilbury clan.  I've also ordered the premium package which is so popular that they can't keep up with demand.  This set is a must have for anyone that enjoys the music of these talented musicians on their own and together collectively.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|Other reviews here are spot-on and say everything I would want to say about this film.  I won't make you read the same stuff all over again.<br /><br />Great movie and worth its 5-star rating.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I was already a fan of this movie, but after watching it again, watching the special documentary about the making of the movie, and then watching the movie with the director commenting on the details that went into the movie, I REALLY loved it!!  What wonderful acting, wonderful storytelling and great period detail!!  A real treat!!!!!  Even if you've seen the movie several times before!
B00006I53S|5.0|This is one of Canon's most versatile lenses.  I have used it for portraits and weddings since day 1.  The IS enables lower light settings.  It's a great alternative to the 24-70 L 2.8 lens that is so expensive.  This is a lens to have in your bag.
B000065BPB|4.0|The noise reduction is excellent with this headphone. The quality of the headset is superb. The only downside is the size of the headphones even though it's collapsible. It's still not \\"travel-size\\" just yet.    Otherwise, with no extra battery pack and not 300 dollars, this is an excellent deal.    Only other downside is that it's cushioning starts getting sweaty due to no air circulation... :(
0446691437|5.0|Awesome, life-changing little book!    Absolutely necessary for all creators, whether artists or writers, painters, novelists, and even cartoonists like myself!    Mr Pressfield has my complete gratitude :)
032147404X|5.0|This is the best photography book that I have ever bought. Cuts through the BS and just gives you the facts on how to take great pictures!
B000P0J024|3.0|I am being very generous giving this product 3 stars. 2 would be more like it but it gets 3 for Roy Orbisons' strong presence on the first cd. I had an irresistable urge to hear Handle with Care again a while back only to discover the album was out of print. I looked forward to receiving this sort of thinking I liked this album back in the day. Well now I know why I dumped the album. Handle with Care is still brilliant, but the rest of these 2 cd's is fairly self indulgent and not really representative of any of these artists as individuals in my opinion. It seems to be an album of great musicians who are friends and like each other forcing themselves to try to make songs. It plods on and on in basically the same style. Dylan seems to regard it as a joke, and I can hear George attempting to try to keep the interest and the idea together but it not quite working. I've heard worse but the album doesn't stand the test of time I don't think. The production is brilliant and crystal clear though. Wish the Beatles would do this to their catalog.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The Planet Earth series is amazingly inforative, and the most incredible cinematography I have ever seen.  I wish the series were longer!
B000O77SOK|5.0|It was great seeing The Practice again - can't wait for the other seasons to be released.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I admit. I bought this DVD, because of its intriguing cover. I didn't know if it was worth the big bucks, but the rave reviews were very encouraging. Well, I wasn't disappointed! Along with the other outstanding BBC production, [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]], \\"North & South\\" ranks on top as one of the best miniseries ever! Having not read Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, which this TV serial is based, I cannot comment on the book-to-screen adaptation. However, I do agree with previous reviewers. \\"North & South\\" is truly fabulous! Excellent cast, wonderful directing, and beautiful music. Also includes one of the most exquisite and romantic love scenes ever captured on film! Kudos to Sandy Welch (the miniseries scriptwriter). Her screenplay is indeed \\"a persuasive mix of historical context and character study.\\" Highly, highly recommended for period piece lovers and romance readers alike.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This CD captures the beauty and power of the songs from the movie. I still get goosebumps when I listen to Say It To Me Know and When Your Mind's Made Up. You will not be disappointed by purchasing this soundtrack.
0061150142|5.0|Picoult writes an amazing story of two childhood friends who become romantically involved as teenagers.  A pact links the two even after one of them commits suicide.     Although it is written to perfection, it is painfully hard to read as a mother.  The reality of not knowing your children as well as you think you do is upsetting but eye opening.  This is another one of Jodi Picoult's must reads.
B000OVLBF8|3.0|The movie was not as good as i expected it. It was just... ok. If it wasn't for the special effects the movie would be terrible. I would wait til the price for this movie goes down before buying it.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and have to admit I was not a Brad Paisley fan at the time of purchase. After listening to this CD multiple times I must say that I am now a fan. This is a great CD well worth purchasing I like all the songs on the CD.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I just love Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition). It's hillarious and I would reccomend this movie for teens who just want something funny that they understand. I got this movie NEW at a really cheap price and it came earlier than I expected. When I opened the movie, it worked great and so did the second disc. I hope you enjoy this movie just as much as I did.
B000P0J024|5.0|This is the definative collection of the Traveing Wilburys.  Their harmonies are terific and you can 't keep your feet still!  Why?  Because you gotta do the Willbury Twist!
B000OQF6N6|4.0|For as long as I've been a fan of rock music I've listened to the Smashing Pumpkins. I'm quite sure that no album(s) will ever replace Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie as my all-time favorites. Even Adore, which was not so popular among the groups long time fans, I'd rather listen to then most any other bands albums. So I guess I'm biased, but I was not disapointed with this CD. It is more like Machina than any other of the Pumpkins work, though there seems to be less keyboard. The guitar work and music editing is very solid, and Billy sounds just like Billy. Some songs are very good: Doomsday Clock, That's the Way, Tarantula, Neverlost, in particular stand out. United States is an interesting track, can't decide whether I like it or not yet. The new band members seem to do a pretty decent job in general, although it's not like D'arcy or James ever had much of an impact in the recording process. It really is and has always been Billy's band, and this is a pretty good record for the most part. Other than 30 Seconds to Mars I can't say I'm a big fan of any of the alternative/rock (or Metal if you will) that has come out in the last few years. That being said I'd rather keep this in my cd player than turn on the radio. All in all, I like the disc a lot but don't love it even as a huge Corgan fan
B000JJSRNY|5.0|Lovers of opera, both new fans of this genre of music as well as those already accostumied to tenors and sopranos will enjoy this DVD. Someone mentioned to me that it was probably the last open-air concert of Placido Domingo, who would be dedicating now his music life as maestro. The new voices of both Villazon and Ana Netrebko proves that opera will last forever.
B00005JPQT|5.0|When cyberterrorist Thomas Gabriel (Olyphant) begins to take down America's computer systems, John McClane (Willis) gets the call from his superiors to pick up programmer Matt Farrell (Long).  Farrell has some idea of what Gabriel has done, and all of Farrell's colleagues have been killed.  Farrell is the last hope to stop Gabriel.  Of course, McClane is not the only one out to find him.  Gabriel's goons are looking to finish him off before he can be of any help to the authorities.  McClane foils their plans repeatedly, and as Farrell gets closer to shutting Gabriel down, Gabriel kidnaps McClane's daughter Lucy (Winstead) to use as leverage.  Of course, putting McClane's family members in danger has never really worked well for terrorists before.<br /><br />After twelve years, John McClane is back.  He is a older and a bit more hardened, but it is good to see him again.  I forgot how much I liked the \\"Die Hard\\" movies, and seeing McClane again was like seeing an old friend.  Bruce Willis still seems at home playing him, and I have a feeling that this movie will breathe new life into the franchise.  Olyphant is good as the bad guy, and Long gets the job done as the sidekick, although he may have a hard time living down those Mac commercials.  The story is scary enough to make you worry it could happen, but over the top enough to just be a bit too ridiculous.  All in all it is good fun though.  Those worring about the PG-13 rating watering down this R-rated franchise should not worry.  Nothing is lost.  I highly recommend this film as one of the best action movies of the summer.
1582701709|5.0|Loved this book and it seriously changed my life. A must-read just the idea of being more positive can change your perception of your life unfolding around you... It really helped me, was exactly what I needed to read to snap me out of being so negative...
B000K7UBTI|2.0|I watched this on my portable DVD player while waiting for my car to be repaired at the dealership. It was a pretty boring film, but I continued to watch it as I had nothing better to do. \\"Blues Clues\\" was on the waiting room television, and was mildly more interesting than this bad version of Iron Man.<br /><br />By the way. Why does every film about a superhero have to recap the origin of the superhero? Why can't we just say; \\"He's a millionaire, he wears an iron suit, he blows stuff up.\\" You could probably do that during the opening credits. We don't recap James Bond's origin every time...
B000E1MTZE|5.0|INSANE VIDEO AND SOUND. THIS IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT HD DVD CAN DO!  I LOVE MY HD DVD!!!!
B00005JPQT|5.0|Ok. I'm going to make this short and sweet. (unlike my usual reviews!).    I will NOT give out any spoilers.  If you liked or loved the first 3 Die Hards (although I withhold opinion on the 3rd, it was pretty good. A little reverse racism, but that happens), you will LOVE Die Hard 4.  It was everything a Die Hard movie is expected to be. 2 hours and 20 minutes go by quickly! Humor and drama. The character of John McClain does not disappoint.  I do miss Al and Holly, but other than that, it exceeded my expectations of enjoyment.    I saw an interview with the director, and he says he was 15 when the first Die Hard movie came out (boy do I feel old!), and was a fan. He didn't want to direct action movies, but said even though he said that, he also said \\"unless it was a Die Hard movie\\".  He got his wish. He also said that in some instances Bruce Willis would point something out and say that John wouldn't do that, this director would tell him that not only WOULD he do it, but he'd already done something similar in this movie when that happened. Bruce stood corrected and understood that this young man was a true Die Hard fan!    I highly recommend this movie. Don't buy any concession drinks or drink a lot before going to see it.  You don't want to have to take a break for any reason from it!    Ok, so it wasn't so short!
B00005U11Z|4.0|Well done but it is just not the same without Steve Perry!  Many old songs and a few new. Worth buying!
B000J103YI|5.0|This music, this movie, this Script is so awesome!  An amazing portrayal of a struggle for stardom.  Beyonce' is beyond beautiful and \\"represents\\" the icon \\"supremely\\" (sorry...had to go there!). The music is so well written, I love each and every track!  Enough has been said about Jennifer Hudson, she has won her due, but ALL the actors did an amazing job.
B00006DEF9|5.0|It is probably the best musical ever made. The cleaned up DVD version with all the bonus material on the separate disk is a treasure to have. Some of our young generation do not know what music is, they are listening to noise not music.
B000E1KN8E|4.0|Enough has been written about the importance of this album and how it has stood the test of time.  It says something about this listener's growth, at least; when I first heard Exposure in high school, I called it the biggest waste of talent on record, given the roster of musicians playing on it yet the distinctly non-Crimson results.  But I wasn't ready for punk rock, I suppose, and Fripp was - hence this stellar effort (as I grew to see it within a couple of years!) that fuses New York avant-garde, punk (in spirit if not in yobbish playing), ambient music, and - yes - even a touch of King Crimson (in the devastating Breathless).  And I was too young and uninformed to know anything about the fight between Fripp and RCA record boss Tommy Mottola over Daryl Hall being the main vocalist on the album, with Fripp's loss in this tiny power struggle resulting in Peter Hammill, Terre Roche, and Peter Gabriel sharing the vocal duties.<br /><br />That said, I'll aim my comments at this reissue.  In a nutshell, Fripp does the same thing here that he's done before, producing the same infuriating results: he tampers with the original artifact to reflect his present attitude towards it, instead of just reissuing the recording as first released.  I find it as frustrating now as I did when he remixed Exposure in 1985, just the same as with individual discs within the various generations of Crimson reissues, whether earlier, like Islands and Larks' Tongues (where tiny changes produced annoying results) or more recent, like Discipline and Three Of A Perfect Pair (with bonus tracks that marred the spirit of the record in the first case and radically improved it in the second).<br /><br />The first disc is the original LP mix of Exposure, so that's great; it's now on CD, with all its unique moments restored: the fast fade of Disengage, Terre Roche's dismissive \\"Hah!\\" at the end of the title track (which once more ends on \\"X\\"), the much longer narrative at the end of Haaden Two (including the wonderfully paradoxical \\"Both the things weren't true; that's definitely true\\"), and probably a few more subtle differences I missed the first time around.  Putting the various versions side by side, the original mix is thicker and grubbier, but still my favorite.  Punk rock, right?<br /><br />Disc two is where the problems start.  Take note - spoiler alert!  According to Fripp's typically discursive (but ultimately informative) liner notes, the original idea was to repackage the 1983/85 remix/reissue with the unreleased Daryl Hall vocals as bonus tracks.  Of course, Fripp then decided to redo things to \\"create\\" a version of the album as he originally mooted it.  This mix, therefore, is basically that 1985 version, but with Hall's lead vocals substituting for all the Peter Hammill vocals except I May Not Have Had Enough of Me -- hence Disengage (with almost entirely new lyrics, possibly improvised and basically rubbish) and Chicago -- and for Terre Roche's vocals on Exposure.  Peter Gabriel remains as the voice of  Flood and Roche as Mary.  The Hammill versions as they appeared on the first remix are now shunted to the end as extra tracks, except for his take on Chicago, which is dropped entirely, though you get a separate Daryl Hall vocal version of Mary and a duet of Hammill (fine) and Roche (awful, sorry) on Chicago.  The labelling of the 1985 versions as \\"alternate\\" is disingenous, to say the least.<br /><br />So how about those Hall vocals, resurrected after all these years?  Frankly, they're not that good.  I recognize the punk ethos teeming in the mix and Hall's determined need to shrug off his pop star status and go with the artistic spirit of that remarkable age, and it's well established that Fripp was caught up in it too, which shaped the sessions into this resulting album.  But honestly, the tracks aren't comparable to the official release.  Chicago works well enough - the blues are the blues, after all, though I still prefer Hammill's menace on the familiar version.  And Hammill is simply much better at channeling the fury and edge of 1979; he'd been capable of being a proto-punk screamer (with Bowie and John Lydon on record as endorsing him) well before Hall was even singing Sarah Smile, thus Disengage loses everything in its \\"new \\" version.  This is not to slight Hall, who's talented, just a bit out of his depth: his take on Mary is fine, though little different in spirit to Roche's, and he does sterling work on the title track -- though still not a patch on Roche's utter nutcase delivery on the original.  NY3 (retitled here) is the one real success, but basically it's a different song so can't be compared; it loses its Hells Kitchen found vocal and has proper lyrics sung by Hall over the instrumental track; they're good, and the results are similar in sprit to NY3NY on Hall's Sacred Songs, which put new words to \\"I May Not Have Had Enough Of Me.\\"  It's certainly the high point of fresh Hall material on this record.<br /><br />My position is this; fans would have been better served if the second disc had been the 1985 remix with the unreleased Hall versions as bonus tracks, but I suppose that's too much the industry way of doing things for Fripp to go along with, and he had a chance to assemble something close to how he envisioned it originally.  It's just not as good.  Fripp hints at acknowledging that in the liner notes when he observes that Mottola's stubbornness caused him to take the album in a different direction, with the results as we know them, and that fans can reassemble the familiar album through programming regardless.  This assertion isn't true, by the way -- that we can put back together the 1985 album he decided not to reissue here -- because he leaves off the 1985 Hammill version of Chicago, which was a different vocal take to the 1979 mix.  Instead we get the unreleased duet, which as I've noted is less than successful; Terre Roche tries for her Yoko Ono thing again but this time sounds like she's being strangled on the fade-out.  Of course, the irony here is that Fripp was right as much as he was wrong.  You get the original version in all its scruffy glory and you can create a version of the 1985 mix if you want (which I've done), but only with the help of an earlier reissue to get what's missing.  So there you go!<br /><br />OK, just a few words on the package.  The liner notes are excerpts from his diaries, which explain choices in mixing, etc. but aren't useful for quick reference.  The pictures are great, if not always the best quality: newspaper reprints, unused cover concepts, a work-up of some attempted remake of Alphaville with Debbie Harry.  The best element is the musician credits; finally, you get a clear list of players for each song.  Fans may want to learn that Levin is the bassist throughout (not John Wetton), Phil Collins and Jerry Marrotta drum on a couple of tracks each, and on everything else (Breathless, Disengage, NY3, and I May Not Have Had Enough) is latter-day Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer Narada Michael Walden, which helps explain why Breathless in particular is like some ferocious outtake from Red.  And that's Sid McGinniss playing the massive funk riff of Exposure, because Robert just could never do that sort of stuff, could he?<br /><br />If you buy the Japanese version, you also get two separate sleeves, just like the LPs (a single one for the 1979 version, a gatefold for 1985), plus a postcard, an OBI, and a Japanese booklet.  Very nicely done, in fact.<br /><br />A curio fans may want to find, I also have an Italian/Indian (?) re-release of Exposure from 2006 that just preceded the double reissue (VH Records, RFCD 01010202).  Its mix is the 1983/85 version and the package is a single-sleeve mini LP, with a redundant booklet that provides in larger type everything on the inner sleeve (also included).  Nice for the aging audience who might now wear bifocals.  The real gem, though, is a much longer (by nearly 2 minutes!) take on Water Music 2.  This is not a merging of 1 and 2, I should stress, but a longer track that show how the familiar version actually fades in about half way though.  Nothing radically different, just more loops, but a surprise and a real treat once I figured it out.out.  Of course, the irony here is that Fripp was right as much as he was wrong.

6305882592|5.0|I was told about this film by a friend when it came out. After days of them insisting that I see it, I was in downtown Portland, Oregon and it was playing at one of the theaters w/ a special sneak preview of a film and a second feature. So, you got 3 films for the price of one. Having absolutely nothing better to do, I decided to go see it by myself. When I arrived at the theater, the showing of Harold and Maude was just getting out. The theater was extremely crowded for a Sunday matinee. When the next film started up, the theater was almost empty. I watched both the sneak preview, and the co-feature and while I was waiting for Harold and Maude to start, the theater began to fill up again until it was FULL. Harold and Maude was the draw! I have never enjoyed a film as much as I did Harold and Maude. After that I returned to the theater 26 times with everyone I could find to see the film. They in turn brought their friends and etc... Harold and Maude was held over at the Guild Theater for a record 42 weeks. I cut the article out of the paper with a picture of the marquee, when they said it had broken records for films held over in the city of Portland at that time.    For years I watched for the film on TV. I never saw it again until one day, after VHS films began to get popular, I found it in a bargain bin in a K-Mart in Idaho and the phenomenon started again. I showed it to all my new friends, relatives and anyone I could talk into sitting throught the film. I have never loaned out my VHS. Am purchasing it on DVD as we speak. And when I get my DVD....believe me, the phenomenon will begin once again as I've moved from Oregon, to Idaho, and now to Nevada... I will create another entire Harold and Maude fan base! This is a wonderful film. Imaginative, Original, Funny, Sad and Refreshing! I see something new every time I watch the film. By the time I'm dead, I'm sure I'll have every frame memorized. This is a film you SHARE with as many people as you can.     After viewing the film, I did find a copy of Ruth Gordon's autobiography. It was great reading. I only wish that I'd met her in person. I saw her on Johnny Carson w/ Bud Cort when the film was celebrating one of it's anniversaries. Either for the VHS release, the DVD release or for a re-release of the film, I can't remember which. But, in the interview, Bud Cort said that many of his friends begged him not to take the role because they thought it would pidgeon hole his career to playing quirky roles. But, he said: \\"Once I read the script, I knew that I had to play Harold and when I met Ruth, I knew why he fell in love with her.\\" They were close, tight friends until her untimely death. I have watched every thing on film I could find with either of these talented actors. Ruth found more fame playing Clint Eastwood's mother in the \\"Every Which Way But Loose\\" film and sequels. Bud's career, was in fact pidgeoned holed to quirky roles so far, but, this is the film that EVERYONE MUST SEE BEFORE THEY DIE! The soundtrack is almost ALL Cat Stevens. If you ever wondered what people saw in him, this movie will show you. It's unfortunate that his career has been overshadowed by his conversion to muslem. He was then and still is an incredible writer/performer. This film proves that.    This film is a black comedy that looks at life, love, war, politics, fashion, music, art and most anything else you can think of through the eyes of a 79 yr old woman and a young man who meets her at a funeral for someone neither of them knew. He's fascinated with staging suicides, she's fascinated with everything in the world and that includes Harold. This is NOT your typical film in any sense of the word. I can't explain it to you or give it away...you HAVE to see it for yourself.    Vivian Pickles as Harold's mother deserved an Oscar Nod for this film as did Eric Christmas as the family Priest.    The Soundtrack for this film is only available in a Japanese Pressing (if you can find it) the closest thing to an American Version of the Soundtrack is \\"Footsteps In The Dark - Greatest Hits, Vol.2\\" by Cat Stevens. It \\"IS\\" the soundtrack plus a couple of extras tossed in and worth the price of admission to both the film and the LP.

And Hammill is simply much better at channeling the fury and edge of 1979; he'dbeen capable of being a proto-punk screamer (with Bowie and John Lydon on record as endorsing him) well before Hall was even singing Sarah Smile, thus Disengage (with almost entirely new lyrics, possibly improvised and basically rubbish) loses everything in its \\"new\\" version.  This is not to slight Hall, who's talented, just a bit out of his depth: his take on Mary is fine, though little different in spirit to Roche's, and he does sterling work on the title track -- though still not a patch on Roche's utter nutcase delivery on the original.  NY3 (retitled here) is the one real success, but basically it's a different song so can't be compared; it loses its Hells Kitchen found vocal and has proper lyrics sung by Hall over the instrumental track; they're good, and the results are similar in spirit to NY3NY (on Hall's Sacred Songs album), which put new words to \\"I May Not Have Had Enough Of Me.\\"  It's certainly the high point of the Hall material on this record.<br /><br />My position is this; fans would have been better served if the second disc had been the 1985 remix with the unreleased Hall versions as bonus tracks, but I suppose that's too much the industry way of doing things for Fripp to go along with ultimately, and he had a chance to assemble something close to how he'd envisioned it originally.  It's just not as good.  Fripp hints at acknowledging that in the liner notes when he observes that Mottola's stubbornness caused the album to take a different direction, with the results as we know them, and that fans can reassemble the familiar album through programming regardless.  This assertion isn't true, by the way -- that we can put back together the 1985 album Fripp decided not to reissue here -- because he leaves off the 1985 Hammill version of Chicago, which was a different vocal take to the 1979 mix.  Instead we get the unreleased duet, which as I've noted is less than successful; Terre Roche tries her Yoko Ono thing again but this time sounds like she's being strangled on the fade-out.  Of course, the irony here is that Fripp was right as much as he was wrong.  You get the original version in all its scruffy glory and you can create a version of the 1985 mix if you want (which I've done), but only with the help of the earlier reissue to get what's missing.  So there you go!<br /><br />OK, just a few words on the package.  The liner notes are excerpts from his diaries, which explain choices in mixing, etc. but aren't useful for quick reference.  The pictures are great, if not always the best quality: newspaper reprints, unused cover concepts, a work-up of some attempted remake of Alphaville with Debbie Harry.  The best element is the musician credits; finally, you get a clear list of players for each song.  Fans may want to learn that Levin is the bassist throughout (not John Wetton), Phil Collins and Jerry Marrotta drum on a couple of tracks each, and on everything else (Breathless, Disengage, NY3, and I May Not Have Had Enough) is latter-day Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer Narada Michael Walden, which helps explain why Breathless in particular is like some ferocious outtake from Red.  And that's Sid McGinniss playing the massive funk riff of Exposure, because Robert just could never do that sort of stuff, could he?<br /><br />By the way, if you buy the Japanese version, you also get two separate sleeves, just like the LPs (a single one for the 1979 version, a gatefold for 1985), plus a postcard, an OBI, and a Japanese booklet.  Very nicely done, in fact.<br /><br />Another curio fans may want to find, I also have an Italian/Indian (?) re-release of Exposure from 2006 that just preceded the double reissue (VH Records, RFCD 01010202).  Its mix is the 1983/85 version and the package is a single-sleeve mini LP, with a redundant booklet that provides in larger type everything on the inner sleeve (also included).  Nice for the aging audience who might now wear bifocals.  The real gem, though, is a much longer (by nearly 2 minutes!) take on Water Music 2.  This is not a merging of 1 and 2, I should stress, but a longer track that show how the familiar version actually fades in about half way though.  Nothing radically different, just more loops, but a surprise and a real treat once I figured it out.e, the irony here is that Fripp was right as much as he was wrong.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is first class. The time and detail invested in this production is dramatic, entertaining and of course, informative. I've already bought another set for my little grandson, and he's only a year old!
B000OQF6N6|3.0|But unfortunately that's not saying a lot. Comparing it to other SP works this one hovers near the bottom, just ahead of Machina. Yes, I had high expectations. No, they were not met. The album was over-produced, with pointless dubbed harmonies added throughout. They really become irritating after a while.  Most of the rhythm guitar parts were predictable, repetitive, and unimaginative by SP standards.  Perhaps with less production, the raw guitars and Billy's voice would have added some energy to this average/mediocre album alas this is not the case.  Still my favorite band of all time. It's just unfortunate that they couldn't come back on a better note.
0757302661|3.0|I bought this book in the hope to learn some new guided imagery that I could use to relax me during labor, and during pregnancy. The book is one of those books that is just ok, not life-changing. When you read it you don't really have any \\"aha\\" moments. The CD that comes with it was ok, but not that special. I have found Belleruth Naparstek's CDs to be by far the most transformative. Her CDs make me SO relaxed! Even the heartburn and swelling seem to calm down after I've relaxed to her CD for about 45 minutes. Also, I find that during the weeks that I do her CD I have a more positive outlook and I can cope with things better. The pregnancy hormones seem much more dark and difficult to deal with when I get busy and don't do the CD. I like her \\"Pregnancy and Childbirth\\" CD, as well as her \\"Relaxation and Wellness\\" one. If you had a traumatic birth experience or pregnancy in the past, her PTSD CD is really powerful. Hope this helps someone!
1594489505|4.0|I thought this was a really good book.  I was hesitant about the subject matter because usually in the USA anything related to oversees is always a negative, but this book doesn't really delve into this very much.  This is mostly about how women fare (or not) in this part of the world.  If you ever saw the Sally Field movie, Not Without My Daughter...this is like that.  Great glimpes into the hard life and limited freedom of people on the grounds of religion.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|The product arrived in good shape and on-time; unfortunately, I had no idea I need a different type of DVD player to watch it.  We have not actually watched the videos yet.
0590259385|5.0|Great book! Teaches about animals. Flows very well and fun to read aloud. Illustrations are not that colorful or clear for very young toddlers. But I still like them because they are different and gives the book character. It took my 15 month old toddler a few times to start liking this book. But now she loves it and sometimes brings it to me to read to her.
B000OLGCHA|1.0|With all the incredible talent out there, why this guy was selected for the score reminds us that directors and the guys in the suits usually don't know anything about the power of REAL film music.  Stick to TV shows, Mr. Hopoper.
0694003611|5.0|I did not know of this book until I had a baby so I was objective about it (no childhood memories of this or emotional attachment as many other reviewers). At first, I thought it was okay. But once we started reading it to our 15 month old, we realized how much she loved it! And its fun to read... rhymes very well and has rhythm. Good illustrations.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  Epic story, sweeping score, a little more violent and graphic than Miyazaki's other films, but still a stunning work of art.
B000PY52EU|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie as the trailers are more lurid than the movie itself. I'm glad I took a chance. To start, the acting is well done from all the players, not just the two main characters portrayed by Jackson and Ricci. The director/writer lets you know that this is a fable and he borrows from the mythology of the deep South and the blues music therein. And of course, there is the music, a brilliant score that drives the emotions of this well-crafted movie by paying homage to the music of some of America's greatest musical heroes.<br />If you like the blues and you like a well-done yet gritty and raw fable, I recommend giving Black Snake Moan a spin.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|HITS!....a wonderfully compiled album that contains all the songs that truly matter(well except 1 or 2 such as \\"do you remember\\" and \\"i missed again\\")...So much that it doesn't even need a qualifier such as \\"greatest\\" or something equally descriptive.     I cannot even begin to rank any of these classics in any order of preference...that would an absolute undecisive mess! From the chart topping cover of Cindy Lauper's \\"true colors\\" and mellow ballads such as \\"Separate lives\\" and \\"I wish it would rain down\\", to the funky-ness of \\"Sussudio\\", this album has it all. Collins' musical genuis is well apparent. \\"Hits\\" is a mere reminder of how truly gifted he is as a musician...he sings(amazingly) and drums(wonderfully too)...he rocks! simply put.
B000002H6C|5.0|Dang, too bad I can't give this a million stars!    I don't have as much that I can say about this album compared to other people. What I can say, though, is that this is the greatest album Metallica has ever recorded. But don't get me wrong, I loved Puppets as much as anyone else. Justice was just better, and I'll even say by quite a bit. When I listen to the album, I try to forget about the bad recording quality that it present on it, and I just listen to the MUSIC. When I do this, the true musicians that Hetfield and Ulrich were really jumps out at me. Two best songs on the album are, and I had to really think about this, The Frayed Ends of Sanity, and ...And Justice For All. I'm not a die-hard, Kill-'Em-All-and-that's-all-I-like Metallica fan, but people, I know my music, I know my Metallica, AND IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!
B000E6EGXM|5.0|This recording is a 'must' addition for anyone's collection of great 20th century music. It is conducted by the composer, Benjamin Britten, and is as moving as when the War Requiem was first heard more than 45 years ago. And the quality of the London recording captures the powerful and huge ensemble of soloists, musicians and choirs that came together for this historic recording. Listen and weep for the 'the pity of war.'
B00008HCCF|5.0|Nora Jones delivers another perfect score on her concert. Here voice is tooo smoottth. I used it to have my baby sleep in no time .
B000EJ9VUW|5.0|Everyone who gave this record a bad review will eat their words, eventually. This record is genre shattering.   Rushing to meet the future. Why are people so afraid of change? How dull would you be if you kept repeating yourself?    This record grows and grows...and it expects the listener to as well. \\"Pedestrian\\" listeners want things hand fed to them     because their attention span is so commercially castrated. I found a refreshing expansion of emotion on this record.   Every step of the way LIARS has taken me on their journey of freedom of expression.    I love when music makes me rewire my expectations of modern culture.  BRAVO LIARS.
B00003CX5P|1.0|The immortal main theme begins. The orange words appear: \\"Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo..... this alarming chain of events...\\"    We sit in wonder, our popcorn halfway to our mouths, as a chill runs down our spines. Good lord! A trade dispute. A blockade of a small planet.  A chain of events (albeit quite a small chain, only a couple of links).     This is the stuff of which epics are made?    What is the purpose of the blockade? Shouldn't the Trade Federation want to trade with Naboo? Perhaps the T.F. wants to charge higher prices? If so, why are we never told that? We are never, in fact, told anything about the dispute, other than it is trivial and legal. (Qui-Gon says \\"... something as trivial as this trade dispute...\\" Viscount Gunray says \\"Our blockade is perfectly legal\\") So, having been officially told that the plot opening is a legal, trivial trade dispute, we might think that the first exciting scene would be a  committee hearing by economic experts.      How could Mr. Lucas give us so lackluster a start to so eagerly anticipated a movie?    Ah yes...Queen Amidala. Now, the films do demonstrate, that Mr. Lucas's general knowledge of politics, government, and diplomacy is so minuscule that it could all be engraved on the head of a pin with lots of room left, but in the polity of Naboo he has confected something particularly fascinating: a democratic monarchy--a \\"queen\\" who is elected and subject to term limits. (We never hear of any kings; perhaps a matriarchal democracy? Unique.) This \\"queen\\" is required to wear preposterous costumes that change hourly and coiffures not seen since the court of Louis XVI. Surely she would have little time to do much governing, being too busy with her clothes and hair. (But that might be a good idea,since the office of monarch apparently has no age qualification and in this crisis Naboo is governed by a girl of perhaps eighteen. That's the best they could come up with? And she, we are told in Part II, is 'not the youngest' ever chosen. One would have liked to see the youngest, who perhaps ruled from a cradle rather than a throne.)         The Gungan \\"government\\" is also interesting. The oddly-titled \\"Boss\\" Nass is evidently not a Gungan at all--or from a superior race of Gungans, who look entirely different than those they govern? It doesn't seem quite right.     So we arrive on Tatooine, where a serious difficulty arises: the ship's hyperdrive is kaput.  It is vital that the ship get going ASAP--a matter of galactic importance, in fact. Only one dealer has the needed part. The dealer will not accept Republic currency.   Now, what is a resourceful, masterful, intelligent Jedi to do? Here are some choices; which would you choose?   A: Go to a bank and convert your currency into the local stuff.   B: Inform Wattoo, the overgrown house fly, that the Jedi Order is commandeering his hyperdrive and will wire him the money. If he objects, take it by force.   C: Wait around doing nothing until you accidentally discover that a small child might get you the money by winning a race (although this child has never won a race).   What Qui-Gon does is so absurd, only Lucas could have come up with it.      A side note: Qui-Gon asks Obi-Wan if they have anything to trade with. He replies that they have little but \\"the queen's wardrobe\\". Folks, if that queen brought her whole wardrobe,  it could be traded for most of the starships on the planet with Jabba the Hutt thrown in.    Anakin's poor mother: now here is perhaps the biggest, most glaring plot hole in the whole series. Why in heaven is she left as a slave? The Jedi are willing to take a 9-year-old boy away from his only parent and forget about the woman. No effort to free her, now or later, even after Anakin shows her a pile of cash and says \\"look how much we won\\". I guess he keeps it and leaves mom to the mercy of the giant fly.     \\"Gungans go to sacred place.\\" The Trade Federation has occupied the whole planet. They know about the underwater city. Yet thousands of these not terribly inconspicuous Gungans manage to move to a spot on the surface that the T.F. never even notices. One wonders how they did that. But of course we must reckon with \\"Lucas logic\\" as well as \\"Star Wars physics\\" in these movies. This also applies to the production of dei ex machinae as needed. You must get into the city? Voilà, \\"the secret passage on the waterfall side.\\" Thank heaven for secret passages. And how we rejoice at the pistols concealed in the arm of a chair, a chair in which Newt Gunray has been sitting for weeks without discovering them.    When the big door goes up and Darth Maul appears, the Jedi say \\"we'll handle this\\" and all the others--about a dozen armed men--just leave (to \\"take the long way\\"). Why? Why doesn't everyone open fire and kill the Sith right there?    One could go on listing absurdities and inconsistencies in this silly movie, but enough of examples. The more important question is, why? Why is the film so bad? Why is any thoughtful viewer left feeling he has been cheated?   I think the answer can be found on the commentary track, where Mr. Lucas and several mechanics talk to us.   My chief impression of these comments is one of men so mesmerized by technology that they have lost sight of other things. The animators and CGI functionaries--these hod-carriers of the computer world-- are insufferable. On and on they go with details of how this or that shot was done, incessantly telling us of their cleverness, their expertise, their great accomplishments. One feels a bit \\"wude\\" in saying this, but, folks, we don't care how you did it. What you do is of no more interest to most viewers than the building of sets or the stitching of costumes. You are hewers of imaginary wood and drawers of digitized water. Do your jobs, cash your paychecks, and be quiet. We, the audience, care merely about the finished products. Save your war stories for others in your profession. No doubt you deserve well of your master, undoubtedly other CGI people will care to know the details of your skilled work, but don't monopolize the commentary track with yet another description of how you made dust appear realistic or inserted a suitably jerky movement into a puppet. Sheesh!     Mr. Lucas's comments suggest he is an overgrown adolescent, like Peter Jackson. One hopes in vain for some commentary on things like the government system of Naboo or on what reaction he expected from the startling announcement of Anakin's virgin birth (made before we learn of the midi-chlorians). But it is interesting that he frequently compares his work to that of a composer of music, referring again and again to \\"tone poems\\" and such things. I can only suggest that, if he views his movies as a symphony, he should have let John Williams do the directing as well as the composing. The result would probably have been superior.      Finally, a tribute to Jar-Jar Binks. I am not being perverse. I like him. He brings to the film a much-needed element of humor. He does not take himself too seriously. He is genuine. He is humble. He is grateful. He helps his friends. I bet he wouldn't leave a child's mother in slavery. As for his language, I find his dialect to be more refreshing, alive, and natural than that of a character who for no apparent reason always backwards speaks, whose verbs at the end of his sentences puts, and who so insufferably smug is that I almost wish Count Dooku his little green head had off cut.
B000002UB3|5.0|If you are a fan of angry music, this ain't for you (sorry).  In the context of the times it had a certain charm and still retains much of the original charm.  If you are not a romantic, don't try to understand this album or band.  Because the Beatles were, if nothing else, hopeless romantics who used music to find love. On that level Abbey Road works quite well. For the segment of the population that enjoys romantic rock you will find this collection of songs rewarding.
1400063515|5.0|It's a fantastic book - unless you're one of the \\"predictive\\" model building economists/sociologist/finance types he so blatantly scorns.<br /><br />The book centers around completely unpredictable events that have huge consequences - how humans are horrible at preparing for them and predicting them, as well as some advice from his own experience as a derivatives trader.<br /><br />He says that many real life activities do not follow Gaussian bell curves (like the stock market or project deadlines) because they are susceptible to impacts that are far outside \\"the box\\" (the assumptions used to make the initial predictions). He recommends providing yourself with as many opportunities as possible to run into favorable \\"black swan\\" events and shielding yourself from as many negative \\"black swan\\" events as possible.<br /><br />Anyway, go buy it and read it. A truly unique combination of philosophy, business, network theory, and narrative.
B000006TRV|3.0|My first exposure to the Floyd was in '73 (DSOTM)- Problem is, DSOTM set the bar so high that every subsequent Waters effort work became narrower in scope...so with The Wall we are no longer conteplating the life's looming questions but rather seeing the world from the inside out of an individual, isolated, bitter, musician. It doesn't leave much room for personal interpretation.    That being said, there are enjoyable musical moments on this work.  As others have noted, The Wall, is colored to a much greater extent by the personality of Roger as his works became lyrically denser at the expense of the fine instrumental passages of the earlier works.  There are also songs that you simply want to skip (thank goodness for CDs). Some songs, such as \\"Comfortably Numb\\", have personally become more meaningful due to circumstances occuring in my life (my dad was in a coma). So, I wouldn't dismiss the entire work as rubbish...just be prepared for a Pink Floyd on steriods/cocaine (seems the Lysergic had declined in popularity).
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Hostel is about three young men; Americans Paxton and Josh and their Icelandic friend Oli, who travel to Amsterdam in search of drugs and hookers.  In the long run they take their party to a quasi-Slovakia.  Oli goes missing and so does some Japanese girl.  No big deal right? So Paxton and Josh decide to party with some Russian girls and get a little bit too hammered.  So much so that Paxton ends up passing out in a storage room.  Josh wakes up in a dungeon and some Dutch guy starts to torture him, using a power drill and cutting his Achilles tendons.  By the time Paxton gets back to the hostel, everyone is missing, well almost everyone.  Josh finds those Russian girls again and starts pressing them for answers.  He ends up finding an abandoned warehouse where people pay to torture prisoners and he gets snatched up and tortured himself.  I'll stop there as things unfold in a fairly fun, albeit predictable manner.<br /><br />If that kind of story interests you and you're the kind of person that likes to watch excruciating torture scenes, then Hostel is the film for you.  But don't worry, it doesn't desensitize because Hostel's director is so amateur in handling his actors you will not see Josh, Paxton, Oli and their international congregation of half-nude nymphs as real people.  They are like dolls and the fake setting is their dollhouse.  You see, the Slovakia we see in Hostel is not real.  That's right Eli Roth has said \\"Americans do not even know that this country exists. My film is not a geographical work but aims to show Americans' ignorance of the world around them.\\"  You've got to be kidding me?  Isn't he just as ignorant as his audience?  And why isn't his audience offended by these comments anyway?  With comments like that it makes me wonder, is Hostel not supposed to be convincing?  I'm not supposed to take this movie seriously?  What is the point then?  Anyway, Roth has yet to show that he can make a movie with real acting and a convincing screenplay.  So far, that places Hostel squarely in the great tradition of crappy slasher movies.  Roth is not John Carpenter.  He is not even Steve Miner.  He is simply a guy who capitalizes on a young blood thirsty audience that wants to test itself.<br /><br />I feel like I really just ripped into Hostel.  Something about it bothered me deeply.  On the other hand, something about it also impressed me.  I was provoked in two different directions.  The accuracy and compelling elements that I all too often take for granted in films I think are quality, were absent in Hostel, but that doesn't mean that Hostel isn't a unique and terrifying experience.  I cringed more here than in many films.  I thought Takashi Miike's Audition (Miike makes a brief cameo here, kudos to Roth for respecting his influence) was a classic in the horror genre and had Hostel been any bit as compelling as Audition was, it would've gained great praise from this viewer.<br /><br />There is something hopeless about Roth's films.  Like many good horror filmmakers, Roth will not turn away and will dispatch of a traditional hero-type in a gruesome way without even thinking twice.  No one is safe in a Roth film and his unflinching murders scenes are as intense as any, and they work.  Some people critically call his films \\"torture porn\\" and I'm not so sure I disagree with that label.  Then again as a deterrent, I'm not so sure that is such disparaging classification in terms of horror films either.  Hostel and Hostel II made $105 million worldwide combined, and together they cost about one tenth that amount. \\"Torture porn\\" sounds like a market brand more than a criticism.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This movie was beautifully directed. Everything fit together perfectly. The story was well crafted and edgey. The movie was dramatic and serious, but also had nice actions scenes that made the movie both thoughtful and entertaining.
0307341542|4.0|I bought this book two days before I was scheduled to take a train journey, and kept promising myself I would save it for the train, but I couldn't stop reading. It's just an irresistible book, astonishingly blunt and brutal at times, but not in a gratuitous or shallow way, because it's built on a solid core of humanity.<br /><br />The problem: Though Publisher's Weekly praises Flynn for successfully \\"misdirecting\\" the reader, I saw the ending coming about 70 pages in. And I'm not particularly adept at such things. The twist and even the twist-beyond-the-twist is telegraphed clearly enough (especially for any reader who's seen The Sixth Sense).<br /><br />But even knowing where we were going, I was driven to read on. And will definitely check out Gillian Flynn's next novel.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|It is worth the money for the DVD alone! I have all her cd's and all her videos including the ones in concert with and without Fleetwood Mac so I was really skeptical about getting something new with this cd/dvd compilation. It wasn't until I checked out the reviews from Amazon that i realized she added her own personal commentary on her videos. it is SOOOOO worth it for that alone! She cracked me up! Totally unepected. I was pleasantly surprised at how she absolutely does NOT take herself too seriously. so even if you have all her previous cd's, and dvd's. please consider getting this. there is definitely NEW material here. The makings of Belladonna were revealing too. really really good stuff here.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series was purchased as a gift for my husband, but believe me I've been enjoying it also.  It is unbelievable how much we truly do not know about our home.  The photography is incredible, the dedication in produing it is inspiring.  I'd recommend this for anyone regardless of age.  What a joy to have this in our video library.
B00003CXA2|2.0|when this came on tv a few weeks ago, i was excited to watch it b/c i knew it was an acclaimed movie, everyone loved it and it won oscars. i was shocked to find that it was just an ordinary movie. it was actually boring. i don't get the hype about this movie. it was a bit sad, and i was on the brink of tears, and tom hanks wasn't that bad in it, but i think it is not at all what people say it is. this is highly overrated.
0765316978|4.0|overall easy to read science fiction.  plot was sometimes too obvious and characters' behavior stilted and predictable.    that being said, i found it a nice distraction but would not strongly recommend unless you have really liked his past works and the genre
0425152251|5.0|I enjoyed the story of the book very much and the history of western thought was well represented.  When reading it, the reader is snared into the paradox of the \\"author\\" as part of the story, and from there wisdom, inquiry and knowledge is ingeniously imparted to the subject.    I will recommend this book to anyone searching for knowledge of western thought in order to acquire wisdom.
1576754227|5.0|This book is excellent with wonderful tips on time management.  It is very useful for personal and professional organization.  It's a quick and fun read.
B0000640VO|2.0|After reading the endless rave reviews here I was eager to experience this charming, delightful film. Well, I managed to watch the first hour and fifteen minutes before giving up on it. Yes, it looks beautiful, that's why I gave it two stars instead of one. I guess I'm a Phillistine or something, but wow, this is one *boring* movie. I dozed off several times and had to rewind the DVD to see if I had missed anything interesting, but I hadn't. Even after over an hour I still didn't care the slightest bit about anyone or anything in the movie, so I just took it out of the player.    My recommendation: if you must see this, rent, don't buy!
055313597X|5.0|The Indians but I call them American Natives were here in America before anybody else. Sadly, the fate of the American Natives is that there are fewer than them around. Imagine that only a couple hundred years ago, there were millions of proud American Natives with a rich culture. The author, Dee Brown, constructs a very well researched book about the history of American Natives or Indians of the American West. Much of the Americas were home to the natives whether it is America, Canada, Central, and South Americas. The fate of the American Natives in history is crucial to understanding our own fate. The book has several pictures of well-known American Natives who helped change the fate of our history like Geronimo, Pocahontas, etc.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Not terribly difficult to figure out the plot, but still intriguing.  I enjoyed all the performances and I always relish seeing David Bowie.  Definitely one that still pops up in my mind, wondering exactly what happened...
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Get this bare bones DVD if you'd like -- the movie is excellent, of course.  But director David Fincher's extended director's cut (most likely 3 hours & change) will be reissued in '08.  If it's anything like previous \\"re-issues\\" (Fight Club, Se7en) it should have a wealth of extras:  multiple commentaries, behind-the-scenes, interviews, etc.
B000PHX8QQ|5.0|Incredible album, the \\"Frech Touch\\" to electronic music is always something to delight in. THIS ALBUM NEEDS 10 STARS ********** :-D<br /><br />If you love Techno, Glitchy Electro, Ghettotech, or just enjoying dancing to anything in a club THIS IS AN ALBUM TO ADD TO THAT COLLECTION OF MUSIC.<br /><br />I think Michael Jackson needs to listen to this album (don't know why, he just has to).
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This box set is simply one of the best box set presentations ever released on dvd. Forget buying each season separately: This box set is a must-have for every West Wing buff!
B000ICKPQY|5.0|This episode stands out as clearly one of the very best - not just of the season, but of the entire series. The set design, costuming and makeup were nearly perfect. The directing was the best I have seen yet. The acting - particularly from the person who plays the \\"ally\\" was absolutely riveting. An absolutely fabulous piece of work. Sci-fi noir at its best...
1594489505|3.0|After the Kite Runner - one of my favorite books ever - my expectations for Hosseini's second novel were definitely high.  A Thousand Splendid Suns for most of the first 190 pages reads like a high school student's decent effort to recount Afghanistan's history of war and victimization and the parallel victimization of its women.  It just doesn't grab you. But then, just when you're wondering what happened to this brilliant author who's Kite Runner characters were complex, fascinating and authentic, he shows us the souls of Laila and Mariam, and we are completely engaged.    I only wish Hosseini's editor and publisher had advised him to rewrite the first half of the book and given him the time to do it.
B000009ED0|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out almost ten years ago in my hometown of Detroit. Since then I've bought the Limited Edition LP, all of the singles off of it, and the clean radio edition of the album just to say I own them all. To say that I love the album is probably a bit much.    When listening to this album it's key to remember the source and time that it came out. It was released right around the time of the Limp Bizkit era and the rap / rock fusion sound is what we were listening to at the time. This combined with the fact that Kid was originally a Detroit rapper should alone explain the overall sound of the album. If it doesn't then you should consider the source...    It was released by a Detroit artist for a Detroit audience. You're talking about the town where to this day Bob Seger has outsold the Beatles (and with good reason, if you ask me). The music scene in Detroit has always been a little off kilter to the rest of the country, so if you're buying the album specifically for \\"Only God Knows Why\\" then you'll be disappointed  and should buy the single instead.    You should buy this album if you're looking for a specific sound that you won't hear duplicated anywhere else, before or since.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|excellent with top notch photography and helpful narration. I can watch this several times and notice something new each viewing. highly recommended.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Fascinating. While Ang Lee films are always artful and beautiful, this particular film was worth the watching for the breathtaking cinematography alone.  The romantic landscape is inexorably intertwined with the love story, which is dramatic, poignant and yes, quite romantic.  This storyline plays like the 21st century version of Romeo and Juliet: Characters Ennis, a ranch hand, and Jack, a rodeo bull rider, are essentially products of the American West. In the changing world of the 1960s, they work hard to remain working cowboys, a life they love. They meet herding sheep on a mountain, and despite their respective insistence that each is not homosexual, and with some degree of self loathing, these tough guys fall in love.  Of course, theirs is love that can never be publicized.  Given the conflicting traditional values of Americana societal constraints, they become star-crossed lovers. The story spans a period of twenty or so years, depicting the secrecy with which the men, both of whom marry and raise families, must lead double lives.  This film transcends the surface layer of a gay lover story, indeed it shatters the entire structure of what we consider to be romantic love.  If you have ever had a love that can never be made public or a love never fully realized, you identify with this film. I would guess that even if you are homophobic, you may yet secretly hope these two cowboys will end up together on their own ranch.  Watching this fim, I was reminded of `Lonely are the Brave' (Kirk Douglas, 1963) for understanding the heart of a cowboy, yet also the more widely-known `The Bridges of Madison County' for the portrayal of a life-sustaining love never completely realized. Do set aside all you thought you knew about romantic love before you watch Brokeback Mountain. What an impressive film. A very risky film. A standout.
B000OLGCHA|2.0|When the soundtrack for \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" was released in 2006, John Williams fans rose up in outrage. They didn't appreciate composer Patrick Doyle's big, loud, unvarying score. They demanded back the whimsy and nuance that lost out to tense and ominous overtures in \\"Goblet of Fire\\". And they were rewarded with...Nicholas Hooper, and a soundtrack filled with whim and nuance...but not much else.  Don't get this reviewer wrong--there are some brilliant moments in the soundtrack. \\"Dolores Umbridge\\" is filled with over-the-top cuteness--and it carries over well onto the big screen. \\"Journey to Hogwarts\\" is a reminder of Williams' theme, and plays out with a touch of urgency that lends itself well to the listening experience. And when Hooper wants his score to be tense, it's tense.  Unfortunately, those moments are few and far between. While I can forgive Hooper for choosing to rearrange the track order for better effect, the interesting bits remain quite sparse and aren't enough to keep someone listening through the rest of the score, which, when not filled with complete silence, consists of instruments playing so softly and unmelodically that you could swear Hooper was simply running the orchestra up and down scales for all anyone could tell.  Despite its shining moments, \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" fails to reach the musical heights achieved by John Williams and makes Patrick Doyle's sweeping and grandiose soundtrack look like a giant by comparison. Everyone who has ever caught a scene from a film sans music knows how much its soundtrack is worth--when well done, music adds layer upon layer of depth, emotion and intensity to a scene. But Hooper does not achieve this, and it's unfortunate because the film could have been much more interesting had he done so. Ultimately, the final track, \\"Loved Ones and Leaving\\", sums up the entire disc--it plays a few quiet strains, has no climax, and quietly fades away, leaving but the faintest ofan impression.  Let's hope Warner Bros. decides to rethink their director/composer duo come \\"Half-Blood Prince\\".
B000OYC3J8|4.0|The White Stripes have never made a bad disc, but I don't find anything hugely groundbreaking here. After Jack White's diversions with The Raconteurs and Loretta Lynn, I thought the Stripes might start taking some more chances, and there are a few here such as the bagpipes and the \\"ancient\\" synthesizer. Any other band and I would have given this CD 5 stars, but knowing how much the White Stripes are capable of vs. what appear here and four is the most I can give.
B0009VCSYQ|4.0|I bought this movie because of the unbeatable price for my psp. My husband and I both own the device (psp) and use it quite often while traveling. Coyote Ugly is a great \\"girlie\\" movie you can watch over and over again.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Having read most of the books, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these productions. Any PGW fan can recognize bits and pieces of assorted stories pieced together into one performance. As easy as this is to get wrong, it doesn't happen here. I think PGW would approve.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Interpol makes music with repetitious guitars and bass accompanied by slightly off-kilter vocals delivering nonsense lyrics. It's better than that sounds, but maybe not as great as some critics would think. Turn On the Bright Lights is a fun album to listen to. It's never boring, and they create some deeply affecting melodies that are really quite enjoyable. There's rarely a dull moment throughout. I just really don't see how it's much better than similarly catchy/non-varied music that is labeled as punk and generally ignored. Interpol is about as good as that general kind of music gets, but I think they get a ton of acclaim because they sound more mysterious, not because they're actually that superior musically.    The first track is my favorite. The piano blends with the guitar and works well with the rest of the sounds. \\"Obstacle 1\\" is a good single, since it encapsulates their sound quite well and is one of the better songs. \\"NYC\\" is a slower song and fairly enjoyable. \\"PDA\\" is another good single that represents the band well. The thing is, most of the songs do a good job here, because they all sound pretty similar. \\"Obstacle 2\\" has catchy vocals and nice interaction with the instruments. Towards the end there are a couple tracks over six minutes long that show a bit more range from the band as they experiment a little. \\"Roland\\" might be the hardest track, with a good riff in the chorus. All in all, not a whole lot about the album really stands out from the rest but it is a consistent, good album.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Fit for the most discerning viewer, this visual celebration of the living earth offers an energizing but reverent experience.  Suggest you purchase more than one for special family and friends!
0316789720|5.0|Great book for kids who like to draw but have trouble doing it freehand.  Nice step-by-step instructions.
0743289684|4.0|I am a fairly fast reader, but I have found Infidel to be a slow read.  Ali's story is incredibly compelling and provided this reader with an introductory education on parts of the world that most Americans know little or nothing about.  Her journey from Somalia to Saudi Arabia, to Kenya, and then Holland is important reading.  I think the trouble with the book, alas, is the writing.  Transitions seem a bit bumpy, references are sometimes unclear, and sentences seem rough at times.  I'd recommend it never-the-less because her's is an important story, raises questions and discussion we all need to engage in in today's world.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|Background: The first time I ever heard anything Dream Theater-related was in college while helping a guy I knew who has a small sound/lighting company do a sound check for a show.  That song was \\"Pull Me Under\\".  I&W, Awake, Falling Into Infinity, A Change of Seasons, SFAM had already hit shelves and 6DOIT came out that year.  I've enjoyed all of those albums on a song-by-song basis.      Dream Theater will of course never return to my favorite area: I&W and Awake, but hopefully they won't dive too far down the TOT/Octavarium tunnel again either.  This album is probably the best since 6DOIT, and I've only heard a few songs from that album.  Because I like albums based on a song-by-song basis, there is no need to provide a breakdown since I don't think my interest in individual songs will help the fanbase determine the value of the entire album.  Just understand that James LaBrie should have retired long ago, and that the rest of the band is still making Dream Theater-branded music - complete with all influences shining and all composition skills engaged.  Musically, I am not aware of any competition when it comes to diversity and depth.  Lyrically and vocally, ...well, I wish the band would write the rest of their albums as instrumentals.
1594489505|5.0|I only recently finished reading The Kite Runner when this book was published.  I couldn't wait to see what Hosseini came up with, and I was not disappointed.  It seemed to be a bit slower in the beginning than The Kite Runner, but I found the characters and situations as compelling.  Because I teach Women Studies, I was further engaged by the stories of the two main characters and their parallel journeys.  My \\"heart was in my throat\\" at several points in the book.  Bravo for a wonderful second book!
B0004Z33EG|4.0|I remember seeing bits and pieces of the Rambo movies on TV as a kid, and after seeing the amazing new Rambo trailer, I had to go back and watch the original to get me in the mood for the new Rambo movie.<br /><br />John Rambo is singled out by a prejudice cop when he is passing through a small town.  Brian Dennehy escorts him out of town and then brings him to jail because Rambo doesn't want to leave.  Rambo escapes and decides to go to war with the local police force.  The police have no idea what they are getting in to.  After 5 or so officers are quickly disposed of, the police retreat.  Rambo's former superior comes to tell him he needs to give himself up, but Rambo still won't budge.<br /><br />This is a strong portrayal of a man who has not fully recovered from his experiences in the Vietnam war, and when bad memories are brought back, a screw goes loose in Rambo's head.  Now he has pretty much no choice but to fight the police, because he knows he didn't do anything wrong.  Now that an army is after him, he kinda feels more comfortable than he did in every day life.<br /><br />The action scenes are awesome.  Very brutal and very well choreographed.  Stallone's athletic skills look great and he gives the action a lot of life.<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />The DVD from Lions Gate has good picture quality.  Other than minor scratches and a bit of grain, it is perfect.  Sound is also good.<br /><br />Special features include a commentary with Stallone and an alternate ending.  I have the ulitmate edition, not the special edition.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This suitably quirky, beautifully acted homage to real-life B-movie hack Ed Wood, creator of \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" and other bizarre turkeys, could have played the facts of his strange life strictly for laughs. Instead, Burton portrays this oddball visionary with extraordinary warmth and kindred sympathy, in effect honoring the outlandishly awful movies he made. Depp is marvelous in the lead role, giving Wood a bit of mad naivete as he fumbles his way through Hollywood's lower depths. And Landau's crabby performance as the ailing, morphine-addled Lugosi won him an Oscar. Filmed in glorious black-and-white, \\"Ed Wood\\" is a droll, endearing tribute to an artless wonder.
0553502077|4.0|This one was very good.  My expectations were low for some reason, but I really enjoyed this.  I liked the character in the story, but thought that he should have come clean with one of the main events early on in the plot.  Overall, a good one.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Harold Ramis's oddball comedy tracks a cynical meteorologist's hilarious efforts to free himself from a wormhole that's locked him into one of the dreariest days of his entire life. Murray's deadpan line reading and impeccable comic timing are what really make this such a cult favorite--especially as he devises various schemes to escape the temporal loop (including suicide!), and then decides to take a more productive tack. Chris Elliott, playing a dodo-brained camera operator, and sultry brunette MacDowell, the charming, cool-headed love interest, are wonderful as well. This is a fun, heady riff on petty misery that's tailor-made for Murray fans. Plus, you'll never hear Sonny and Cher's \\"I Got You, Babe\\" quite the same way again.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have experienced Wicked in London at the Apollo Theatre on three separate occasions.  Owning the soundrack enables me to relive the emotion surrounding this amazing theatrical production.  This soundtrack includes an appropriate character dialog and music combination enabling the listener to participate in a continuous story line flow, avoiding gaps and interrupted transitions, providing the opportunity to relieve each theatrical experience scene by scene.    I recommend this soundtract for those who are planning to go to a Wicked production.  The soundract includes printed musical lyrics in the included folio.  Immersing oneself in the music and lyrics will enhance the total experience at the theatre.    Enjoy
B00004XPPB|5.0|Based on the real-life Joe Pistone's memoirs, Mike Newell's \\"Donnie Brasco\\" offers one of the freshest takes on the gangster film since \\"GoodFellas,\\" capturing gritty street life in 1970s New York City as well as the melancholy mood of the times. In one of the great roles of his late career, Pacino excels as Mafia nobody Lefty, combining a wise guy's street swagger with a loving, fatherly air as he takes Donnie under his wing. Depp is equally strong as the conflicted cop, dutifully mining information but increasingly strained by his dual life--so much so that the cracks start showing. A gritty, poignant drama of divided loyalties.
B000IOM9QG|5.0|This collection contains the pop-disco group Boney M's greatest hits from their heyday in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The styles include hardcore disco (Daddy Cool, Sunny) and bouncy reggae like Rivers of Babylon (a remake of a [[ASIN:B00005QD6U Melodians]] song) and Brown Girl In The Ring. (As a 2-sided hit single, this was one of the biggest hits in the UK in 1978 and stayed on the charts for ages).<br /><br />More buoyant reggae can be found on Hooray Hooray, No Woman No Cry and their lovely Christmas song Mary's Boy Child. There's also pure pop like Rasputin, Painter Man and El Lute. Besides the aforementioned songs, other great numbers include of course the brilliant Ma Baker (which tells the story of Chicago gangster Ma Barker) and the deceptively airy Belfast which commented upon the troubles in Ulster. (Disco music wasn't meant to be serious).<br /><br />Like ABBA, Boney M made superb pop music. All the songs have aged well and it's good to hear dance music with personality again. Although the tracks are not arranged chronologically, this is a great compilation, well worth the price.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000NJLXLS Love for Sale]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000NJLXM2 Nightflight to Venus]]
B00005JKG9|5.0|Foley's lacerating, foul-mouthed drama, adapted from David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, is equal parts Arthur Miller and bald critique of Reaganomics-gone-bad. The terse dialogue, dreary office setting, and fist-gnawing competitive tension all push this stylish film into dramatic overdrive. Yet the heart and soul of \\"Glengarry\\" belongs to the tremendous ensemble cast: Arkin, Harris, Baldwin, and Pacino deliver stellar work, and Lemmon is blazingly brilliant as the jittery, deflated Levine, who may be desperate enough to break the law. Edgy and dark, \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" is a great film about white-collar desperation and the instinct for survival.
B000286RNY|4.0|very funny martial arts movie. Funny in the sarcastic sense. good to watch to lighten your day.
B000286RKW|5.0|Scorsese's mob masterpiece, which he co-scripted with Pileggi, is an intimate, insider's glimpse into the rise and fall of the Mafia from the 1950's onward. Period music, costumes, and a bold, intrusive shooting style help evoke a heady, secret world of crime without consequences, a world bound to implode. Liotta is strangely sympathetic and all-too-human as Hill, DeNiro frighteningly combustible as Jimmy, and Pesci electrifying as the savage, psychotic Tommy (he nabbed an Oscar for this). Quite simply one of the best crime movies ever made.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|I discovered Glen Hansard when I saw the movie, \\"Once.\\"  The tunes on this CD are exceptional.  Hansard's lyrics and emotional rendition are moving and, occasionally, haunting.  Irglova's harmony adds a delicate counterpoint to several of the songs.  I listened to this CD non-stop for the first couple of weeks I had it, and still find it one of my favorites.
B00006ADFL|5.0|An unsettling, thoroughly absorbing drama based on a real-life crime, \\"Creatures\\" is the magnificent brainchild of then-horror-movie director Jackson (\\"Lord of the Rings\\"), who brings sensitivity and sincere human feeling to this tragic story of love and murder. Winslet and Lynskey have an intense, wholly credible rapport, playing highly intelligent girls (one of whom, the brash Juliet, grew up to become mystery novelist Anne Perry!) whose fully enmeshed intimacy takes them farther and farther from reality. Beautifully photographed, splendidly acted, and imaginatively directed, \\"Creatures\\" burrows under your skin in a lasting way.
B0000027RL|3.0|I have just gotten in to Pearl Jam, and after listening to their first 3 albums MANY times, I think I can safely say that TEN is NOT their best out of the three. I personally thought the biggest weakness in this album was how EVERY track sounded the same. I mean I seriously couldnt tell which track was which. Thats not to say the album is terrible...I think its actually quite good, just not the amazing ground breaking album everyone makes it out to be.<br />\\"Once\\", \\"Even Flow\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"Jeremy\\" and \\"Black\\" are superb songs which are  gems on their own. I actually cannot class this as a grunge album...Vedders vocals are way too spot on and great, the music is quite normal rock music and the production isnt so distorted. They DID go more grunge with VS. and VITALOGY, my more preffered albums.<br />Overall, Im not comparing this to Nirvana's NEVERMIND which I believe is a better grunge record, but this album isnt the best ever...Try out VS. and VITALOGY..they capture what the band want to do and succeed very well.<br />3.5 stars
630512762X|5.0|Despite the grotesque, almost preposterous premise, Hong Kong director John Woo's second American-made actioner has all the savage bite, black humor, and balletic fight choreography of his best-known Asian films. Deliberately mythic in concept, \\"Face/Off\\" probes questions of honor, identity, and morality while giving Travolta and Cage plenty of leeway to stretch their archetypal good-and-evil personas. Ingenious, kinetic and reveling in its choreographed, over the top violence, \\"Face/Off\\" is a complex thriller that's bloody good fun.
B000002TQV|5.0|After hearing Pablo Honey, one might think that Radiohead was a decent band, but would certainly not be expecting them to become one of the all-time great groups... in fact, Pablo Honey does little to prepare one for the masterpiece that is the Bends!Few groups have ever made such progress in such a short period of time; it's almost akin to the improvement made by Neil YOung between his first and second albums or by David Bowie between Space Odyssey and Man Who Sold the World. The Bends is fresh and modern but also full of classic elements. The songs are expertly crafted, inventive,experimental, yet also thrillingly listenable. The vocals are tortured, beautiful and powerful (York is modern rock's best singer... hands down!!!) and the guitar is out of this world! While Ok Computer is their best album, this is an extremely close second and is one of the only albums from the 90s that ranks with the greatest rock ablums ever made. If Pablo Honey didn't quite show off the groups limitless potential, The Bends does so in an unforgettable fashion.
B000EPR7NE|2.0|While I love the music, I found the disc to be badly recorded.  The music was extremely \\"boomy\\" in bass and often had clicks, as if it had been recorded at too high a level, resulting in cutoff.    I processed my favorite pieces through Bias PEAK software to reduce the boominess and normalize the music to eliminate the clicks; it was more enjoyable, but way too much to expect a customer to do.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|Seems kind of silly to review something like this . . . my husband and I laugh endlessly at How I Met Your Mother every Monday night, so it just seemed like a logical present to get him for Father's Day this year.  We love it and laugh all over again at episodes we saw air on TV.
B000002I2M|4.0|Melvin's Review of Three Songs From The Doors' Album L.A. Woman<br /><br />1.  Love Her Madly:<br /><br />This song is extremely simple and lyrically sparse and seemingly a bit obvious.  However, a lot of poets from the Lerner times, and one presently, Mr. Jerry F., knows quite well the ironic joke set up by this number.  The whole song is a set up to this line:  \\"Don't you love her . . . as she's walking out the door.\\"  So the rest of the song seems like a half-baked romance number, except that finally, he is showing something about the fickleness and inconsistency of our love.  We often don't love her, till she's leaving, or, after she's left, we suddenly realize that we loved her way more than we thought, although we may have been incapable of love the entire time.  Hence, Jerry sometimes ends unrelated songs by exclaiming, \\"Love Ya Madly!\\" and everyone smirks at the joke implicit, \\"as she's walking out the door.\\"<br /><br />2.  The WASP:<br /><br />This song is really called by fans \\"Texas Radio and the Big Beat.  And this is a classic Morrison poetry-song, where he sings, then reads poetry, then sings again.  This song also really makes Texas feel like it's still a separate country.  In fact,I was driving from Lubbock to Abilene at midnight when this song came on my rental car radio.  Texans understand how this tune describes the sense of vast distance and isolation.  But also from this song came the great druggie phrase, \\"We is stoned immaculate.\\"  And being a fundamentally Southern song, a bit of theology creeps in:  \\"I'll tell you about the heartache and the loss of God.\\"  And my other favorite line from this tune:  \\"No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn.\\"<br /><br />3.  Riders On The Storm:<br /><br />This song is flatly a work of Hinduesqe Charlie Mansonism, a kind of cosmic tribute to Buddhist temporality and mandatory human suffering, with a bit of underlying bliss thrown in.  The song almost becomes meolidically sweet as Morrison mentions the random murder of a family along a road.  Right as we resist a concept, Morrison often ends a song with, \\"yeeeah,\\" as though there is no resisting the celebration of all human fates.  This song typifies what Doors keyboardist said about Morrison:  \\"He saw things as they are, Infinite.\\"d.  Right as we resist a concept, Morrison often ends a song with, \\"yeeeah,\\" as though there is no resisting the celebration of all human fates.  This song typifies what Doors keyboardist said about Morrison:  \\"He saw things as they are, Infinite.\\"
0743455967|5.0|This book is excellent. It is incredibly helpful with tips and tricks of the trade, and written in Stephen King's well known style. I highly recommend it.
B0000042MY|5.0|The music in this soundtrack speaks to one's soul; the theme runs through the entire CD.  I've never even seen the movie, but I just love this music with its compelling rhythm and beautiful combination of strings and orchestral arrangements.  It is both emotionally moving, relaxing and motivating at the same time.
1892005034|4.0|This is a good book, and you get the gist of the material, although I have heard from people who have attended Marshall B Rosenberg's workshops or lectures that he is more convincing in person than on the printed page.  It just seems hard to practice in a vacuum.  But I'm going to try!
B00005ASHM|3.0|This is a good album.  Thus said, I don't see it deserving being on any top 10 or even top 50 list of greatest albums ever.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|It is the 2006 Picture of the Year so it really needs no further praise from me. However, as far as the Bluray quality, this movie looked amazingly good on my Sony HDTV via my PS3. The film ran perfectly without any hiccups and has some great shots of Boston that Scorcese captured well for HD. Not the best high-def film for showing off your HDTV or PS3 (Planet Earth gets the nod there), but a great film nonetheless.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Its a shame that so many folks become closed minded to new music at a certain age.  This is as good as anything Dylan has ever done, but because of the above it won't be remembered as well.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Amazing series of nature... and watching on an HD TV with surround sound takes you to these natural wonders that makes you feel like you are there. Would watch this over and over...
B0000TB01Y|4.0|There are two, for me, outstanding pieces to this recording of the Original cast recording of the musical 'Wicked' The wizard and I and Popular. Both sung with great fun and gusto.   Over all I enjoyed the CD, being a massive wizard of Oz fan, it was interesting to listen to the story from an altogether different perspective. Enjoyable, memorable and fun- a great purchase, that comes highly recommended.
6305313687|5.0|Fueled by a powerfully convincing Oscar worthy performance, `American History X' is probably my favorite movie of the given year.  It's an intense portrayal of hatred and racism and the causes behind it as well as the horrible consequences that spawn from it.  In its gritty black and white sequences it establishes an air of hostility and vindictive fervor, but what's strangely enamoring about this film is that, with all it's shocking violence and hate filled propaganda, it raises a level of sympathetic understanding that you'd never expect to find nestled underneath it's repelling shell.  Through the eyes of Derek Vinyard we begin to realize his struggle and understand his viewpoints, no matter how wrong they really are.  The reasoning behind his hatred is explained with such conviction and assurance that he begins to sell the audience.  This is important because Derek is a man we're supposed to connect with and sympathize with, and without understanding him that becomes impossible and he remains a monster to us.<br /><br />So then, much praise must be heaped upon the amazing Edward Norton who completely devours his role here.  His performance is one of the most impressive and earth shattering portrayals of the human heart I've seen in years, perhaps forever.  His control over his character is incredible.  His conviction, his determination, his grip on his characters reality is so strong it's engrossing and absorbing.  Derek Vinyard is a revelation.  As the film shifts from present time, with Derek being released from prison and trying to put his family back together, to past tense, where in that gritty black and white we see the rise and fall of Derek's Nazi days, we are invited into this mans world, and effortlessly we see Norton shift from a man determined to hate to a man determined to fix the mess he started.<br /><br />The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Derek and his younger brother Danny, played brilliantly by Edward Furlong.  Upon arriving home from prison Derek sees that Danny has now fallen just as deep into the race hating ways he was once privy to and he realizes he has his work cut out for him.  Having been reformed while behind bars Derek is now a much different man than he once was and he begins to try and reason with his brother, prove to him that the life they are leading is one only destined for failure and doom.  Unfortunately Danny has fallen into ties with Cameron, the leader of a group of Neo-Nazi tyrants who once worshiped the ground Derek walked on.  Breaking Danny of this pact would not only result in Derek's segregation but could result in his death.<br /><br />Tony Kaye does a fantastic job directing this film, creating an unsteady air about the scenes that adds layers to the message behind this film.  The film is forceful and blunt but it manages to invest itself so deeply in the audience that we become invested in the film and thus and compelled to keep watching despite the at times very harsh sequences of events.  `American History X' may not be the easiest film to sit through, but it's easily one of the most important films to ever address the bounds of racism.  Highly superior to the Oscar winning `Crash', `American History X' sets a profound statement that not only rationalizes with the villain but breaks down his barrier and exposes the scared little child growing within him.  Thanks in large part to the Oscar robbed Edward Norton, this is one of those films that will move you to rethink everything you think you know about the ones you think you understand and realize that maybe, just maybe, you don't know as much as you give yourself credit for.Derek sees that Danny has now fallen just as deep into the race hating ways he was once privy to and he realizes he has his work cut out for him.

B0009VJWSG|5.0|This album was the 'high watermark'for rock/jazz fusion of the 70's.Taking nothing away from Mahavishnu,Beck or any others who put out stellar music from this period. This is the one for me!A desert island disc for sure,it's such a crying shame that TOMMY BOLIN IS STILL NOT WIDELY KNOWN TO THIS DAY!despite efforts by his family in keeping his name alive.I already owned this disc sans the extra track but when i saw that Tommy was on said track i immediately ordered it and promptly gave my other to one grateful freind.I highly recomend this disc to anyone besides Drummers and Guitarists who want to hear some of the most Tightest,exciting,smokin',smooth and soulful music ever layed down to wax!!BUY IT NOW!
1904233023|5.0|Ender's game is amazingly entertaining. One of my favorite books of all time, Ender's game is surely a book that everyone should read. Even to people who don't like sci-fi( I didn't when I read the book) will love it, and its something I want to read over,and over again. In the books following Ender's Game(the adult sequels), the author tries a little hard to be complicated, but the narration and storyline is great in this book and makes a great read for both teens and adults.
B000AP04FG|3.0|It's hard to seperate yourself from this movie considering the hype it generated unwittingly.  The movie itself was overshadowed by the fact that Brad Pitt had left his wife Jennifer Aniston for Angelina Jolie, his costar.  They put down the rumors saying \\"Oh no, we're just friends\\".  Of course, that's anything but true now.  Four children, world travel, charitable causes, and one of the most hyped celebrity couples (but not annoying like Bennifer) later, we all know better.  Trying to put that aside, this movie was pretty good.    Brad and Angelina play a married couple in a rut.  Bored and rather unwilling to change their status as a \\"boring couple\\", they are living in the suburbs, going on with their otherwise mundane existences.  What neither of them knows is that they are both assasins, working for rival groups, and one day they are hired to off each other.  We see a series of events unfolding as they are off on their missions independently, then as their paths cross and realize they are not so boring after all.  Strangely enough, the spark in their marriage returns and they live happily ever after.  They really didn't know each other at all, did they?    It's a lightweight action movie with a lot of shooting and violence, yet not campy like some action movies past.  It has a few moments of humor, but it, like their marriage in the beginning, starts of slow and boring.  But, it's a fun time without being too serious.  Good for some entertainment.
0307245306|5.0|I read The Lightning Thief the week it came out and immediately became a Percy Jackson fan and have eagerly awaited each installment.  I even went so far as to order the Curse of the Titans from Amazon UK because it was available two weeks earlier in Britain.  Percy is the real thing, not just an imitator of Harry Potter.  The Lightning Thief takes Percy on a cross-country quest that puts him and his friend in \\"mortal\\" danger.  The reader does a very good job making Percy and the other characters come to life.  In addition this version is an unabridged production which was a huge selling point for me.  I had previously purchased the audio CDs of the British version.  They unfortunately were heavily abridged and the \\"american accent\\" of the reader didn't ring true.  This is the version to get.
0786838655|5.0|This book has it all. It's a well-written book with a fascinating main character. Percy is the son of a god. But which one? And how can this boy stop the gods from going to war?     Those questions (and more) are answered as you take a joyride with Percy to \\"summer camp\\" then across America and back again. Percy's mission: to find Zeus's master lightning bolt. But he's got to go the Underworld (in L.A., of course) to do it. Not to mention Ares, the war god, finds him and gives him more cause for concern.     With the help of friends, Annabeth (her mother is a god) and Grover (a satyr), Percy is able to get out of more than one scrape. As he heroically pursues the quest, he learns about his father and hopes to eventually save his mother too.    On top of all the excitement and adventure, this story is educational. I've often had trouble remembering which god is which, this story  straightens it out for me. The gods become 3-dimensional characters with foibles just like humans. They get jealous of their cheating spouses and angry at their siblings. When the gods argue, thunder rumbles and storms erupte.     And this time it was Zeus who was mad. Percy has ten days to complete his mission or the world is in trouble. Now, that's pressure.    As for the writing, the author created enough tension and mystery to create a highly engaging story. The language is modern and easy to understand. The chapters are relatively short and each one 'pushes' you into the next. You can't help but keep on reading to find out what happens next. In addition, the end was satisfying. While it leaves Percy's story open to continue it also wraps up the plot of this book.      I highly recommend this! Great story!

630471193X|5.0|I have seen this movie at least 20 times and I still bawl at the end.  In my personal top five of all time greatest movies.  If you are an intellectual person you will appreciate the complexities in the premise.  Don't want to say too much and give away the ending, but it's difinitely not what you think!!!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Once you see the film \\"Once\\" the music will stay in your head for days. The soundtrack captures the magic of the film and the music is 85% of the story. Wonderful music.
B00005MP58|5.0|This production was well written, acted, protrayed - wow - can't say enough about it.  I borrowed my friend's copy and fell in love with the series.  Had to have my own copy.  My husband, who is not into chick flicks, walked by the TV just after it started and he got hooked.  It stays very true to Jane Austen's book.  The characters come to life!
B0000062FL|5.0|While not the very best Santana album (that would be the jazzier Caravanserai) Abraxas really opened the door for more great music just a couple years later for the highly original-sounding Santana.  If you've never heard any Santana before, well, that's just wrong because you HAVE heard at least three of their songs (and maybe even the lost classic \\"Winning\\") you'd know the band is known for mixing latin rhythms into their rock and roll sound.  Every Santana album in the early 70's had this style.  It made them stand out from other musical artists BIG time back then.      Abraxas is the most popular album mainly because it features the two biggest hits from the band \\"Black Magic Woman\\" and \\"Oye Como Va\\".  Those aren't the only great songs, in fact, those are just the tunes that warm you up for the rest of the album, which is probably even better than the two hits.  \\"Singing Winds, Crying Beasts\\" opens the album on a quiet note, building in suspense the great guitar and keyboard work that the Abraxas album pulls off so well.  \\"Incident At Neshabur\\" is probably the best song on here, because it leans more on the jazzy side and gives Santana a chance to really get a feel for his guitar playing.      The second side of the album is just really solid latin rock/hard rock.  I really made a mistake when I originally said this album was overrated.  Nope, far from it.  The music is too good to be ignored.

B000OVLBF8|5.0|If you are in the mood for some short, light entertainment then this movie is a good choice. It is nothing serious like saving private ryan and is not intended to have any deep meaning, but the graphics and music score (e.g. crazy train) are great. The whole movie is like watching a bike jump. This movie is by no means great but there are many, many movie worse than this.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|The Book was more ineresting, as I LIVED that book,(before it was written) and was in virtually all of the places mentioned in the book and with some changes to mach reality experienced all of the insights. The book was from Kilambamba to Machu-Piechu to Iquios and Lima, all places I know.(as well as many more as important).  These were dumped in the DVD (The sight actually shown was San Franciso in Ayacucho District) but they kept the insights at least in recognizable form.

0385333846|5.0|I'm sure most of us here have read a bunch of Vonnegut books, which is a beautiful thing.  I can't think of a single one of his books in which I did not enjoy, though some I do favor.  But for those who don't know Vonnegut, I would say this would be a great starting point.  It's got the Vonnegut personal style....yet it still has a somewhat linear plot/storyline.  It's amazing how Vonnegut witnesses and survives the battle of Dresden, Germany, and somehow is able to write about it in his dark/comical/vonnegut way!    Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist who becomes unstuck in time is perfect.  The simple way of his personality is beautiful, asking for them to leave him behind enemy lines and such, escaping into his own world...traveling to anytime in his life...which also includes his experience of abduction and the planet Tralmalfador.  I don't want to give away to much, so I'll just say the story is told perfectly, transitioning through so many different times and moments that you are never bored, and it's truly hard to stop reading once you get into it.    I'm still amazed, and of course feel somewhat ignorant, for not knowing that there were 2 bombings in WWII that killed more civilians than the great Hiroshima...it's sad this is not taught in schools, especially Dresden....130,000 + deaths. Anyway, it's an awesome book and one of Vonnegut's best...thought most of his are!  A must read....twice!    \\"All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn't his. Another guy I know really did threaten to have his personal enemies killed by hired gunmen after the war. And so on. I've changed all the names.\\"    ....\\"so it goes\\".....
B0006FFRW0|2.0|I don't understand what makes this album referred to as a \\"masterpiece\\".  I guess, compared to other albums of that time, when we're stuck \\"clutching at straws\\" to find a landmark album, this album just happened to arrive when radio had mostly just regrettable crap.  Jeez, the nineties sucked!  I will say though, that I would rather refer to \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" as a masterpiece album for Nine Inch Nails.  \\"Broken\\" (and \\"Fixed\\") are both easily forgettable.<br /><br />On this album, I like \\"Mr. Self Destruct\\".  It's an easy song to get stuck in your head, plus the EP of \\"Further Down the Spiral\\" has a couple of good remixes of that song.<br /><br />\\"Piggy. Pig, pig, pig...\\"  \\"Nothing can stop me now.\\"  What does that mean?  Is Trent into bopping animals or something?  The song doesn't seem to make any sense that I can figure out.<br /><br />\\"Heresy\\" is a song I could do without.  I'm not the most religious guy out there.  However I do believe in God. But I don't practice any religion.  Since there are so many different interpretations of what God is, how can anyone see the authenticity of any one religion?<br /><br />\\"March of the Pigs\\" mentions pigs again.  Again, what's the reference here?<br /><br />\\"Closer\\" is my favorite track here.  However, I hope Trent's not talking about his warped love for pigs.<br /><br />The rest of this album just seems to mix up hard noise and then depressing melancholy moods backed up by strange instrumental passages.  Most of the instrumentation on this album is strange.  He doesn't play many ordinary instruments, and his more electronic sounds are obscure to me, and I usually enjoy variations of IDM and industrial instrumentals.<br /><br />I bought this album when it came out back in 1994.  I hated it back then and gave it away.  I decided to buy it again to see if I've missed something.  But no, it's the same album I was uncomfortable with as before.  I like \\"Further Down the Spiral\\" better than this album.  If  \\"Further Down the Spiral\\" had \\"Closer\\" on it, that would be a fantastic album.  So, I guess I'll just keep both.album.

B00004T8RK|4.0|I've been a Pearl Jam fan ever since I saw them open for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Smashing Pumpkins back in the early 90's.  I'd never heard of them before that night, but the next day I was at a record store looking to pick up all of their albums.  There were none to be found and the workers had never heard of them.      After a while, TEN hit the shelves and I picked up a copy.  It was worth the wait and it is still in my music rotation.  Then came Vs and Vitology and they too were worth the wait and they too remain in my regular listening rotation.  When No Code came out I snatched that up and gave it a few listens, but it found it's way onto the shelf pretty quickly.  It just didn't do it for me and I assumed Pearl Jam had lost their magic.  I lost interest in them and honestly had no idea they were still making albums.    Thanks to Internet radio, I have rediscovered Pearl Jam and their more recent recordings.  Binaural was the cheapest newer PJ album I could find so I decided to give it a try.  It was most definitely worth the wait.     I've had it for a few days and while I like some songs more than others, there isn't a single song on here that makes me reach for the skip button.  This is the Pearl Jam I missed and I'm excited to see what else I've missed out on.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|First off I love Meatloaf, especially with ketchup. But instead of ketchup we get a lot of cheese with this release, and that's a good thing! Bat Out of Hell and Bat Out of Hell II are both classic albums, some of the best stuff in rock history--they had two important ingredients: 1. Meatloaf-one of the best singers in rock history--and 2. Jim Steinman--the second best songwriter in rock history (Bob Dylan numero uno) BOOH III is missing the later and the songs that are his on this album are 20-30 years old and some have been around the block with other singers. Meatloaf does conjure up some magic of old with Blind as a Bat, Its All Coming Back to Me Now, Bad For Good, Alive, The Future Aint What it Used to Be. Basically half the album is excellent, it just isnt brilliantly consistent as the first two. That being said it is still a must buy for Meatloaf fans and rock music lovers alike.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|The new Icky Thump album by the White Stripes delivers the hard driving music and lyrical verse we now expect from Jack.  The two person band delivers a tower of sound and driving rhythm throughout the CD. My favorite is the biting \\"You don't know what love is\\"  which is a  Dylanesque rocker with the bite of positively fourth street.  The percussion is great and the variety of music created by this duo continues to amaze.  Stripers will not be disappointed!
0861714911|5.0|Wonderful introduction by the Dalai Lama and each 'section' of this book has really informative introduction by Bhikku Bodhi. At times the subject matter of the text makes you realise how long ago the Buddha lived but the core teachings are almost always relevant today and there is an authenticity about this work that keeps one's understanding of Dharma grounded. This is the real deal. This book along with a good translation of the Dhammapada really does feel like the closest thing a Dharma follower can get to the Bible. I really feel this is an essential addition to any collection of Dharma books. Just a warning though - the final chapters were really dry (for me) and probably too deep for me to really grasp (I am not a hard core practitioner). This is not the kind of book you read on the bus/train.

B00008DDXC|5.0|Night 2 of my 4 night Harry Potter week!  Each time I view these movies, I kick myself that I have not read the books... One of these days...    The basic plot is that Harry Potter enters Hogwart's for his 2nd year, even though he is warned not to come back!  The adventures start even before he gets to Hogwart's, and continues on as he and his friends try to find the \\"Chamber of Secrets\\".  The movie is a bit darker than the 1st with scary spiders, students being petrified, and one large basilisk slithering around.      It is interesting to see the character growth of the actor's, plus their own growth in real time.  Harry and Ron a looking a bit older than their \\"12 years\\"...  Malfoy is back, and even better is the introduction of his father, Lucius Malfoy, played by Jason Isaacs.  One of my favorite \\"bad-guy\\" actors.  Ever seen \\"The Patriot\\"!  Kenneth Branagh is also new as Professor Lockhart, a pompous, self-obsessed new wizard.  A different take for the usual serious dramatic actor.  And Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are once again great, but I wish they had more screen time.  And it is very sad to see that Richard Harris will no longer be with us as Dumbledore.  Such a loss of a great actor!    Now rating the 2 disc widescreen DVD:  Disc 1 has the movie, plus 2 trailers ( one current and one for Year One).  There is also the cast/crew lineup, which once again, I wish they would go a bit more in depth.    Disc 2 is great!  There are 19 additional scenes.  Some good like  extended scenes of the \\"horror\\" shop, a scene with Lockhart, and talking about the \\"heir\\" in study hall.  Some were very...huh?  \\"Behind the Hogwarts\\" has an interview with JK Rowling and screenwriter Steven Kloves.  Very good!  Also, there is \\"Dumbledore's Office\\" which has the making of Dumbledore's office and the greenhouse scene, and a tour of the office.  The making of the office was a great docu with alot of wow moments on how they put everything together.  There is also various interviews with the cast.  Some good and some bad.  I wish Isaac's, Rickman's and Coltrane's were longer, as they are genuine funny people.  Overall, another great Harry Potter movie in the series, and a great DVD! Highly worth buying and adding to the home collection!
0375759174|5.0|Northanger Abbey is a gem. Jane Austen (1775-1817)has written a charmiing little novel about a charming little lady named Catherine Moreland. Catherine is 15 as the novel begins in Wiltshire. She and the hilariously stupid Mrs. Allen go on a six week trip to nearby Bath to take the waters. Catherine meets the fashionable and fast Isabella Thorpe. Catherine dances with the clergyman Henry Tilney at a ball becoming infatuated with the clever young man. Henry and Catherine share a love for the Romantic Gothic novels of such authors as Ann Radcliff and Fanny Burney. Complications ensue but in the end the couple are wed.<br />  The first half of the novel deals with doings in Bath; the second half is a trip taken by Catherine to the Tilney estate Northanger Abbey. Catherine thinks the house may contain a ghost as she is influenced in her thinking by a vivid imagination fueled by her sensational Gothic reading.<br />  Minor characters are of interest: Captain Frederick Tilney the ladies man brother of Henry; old General Tilney the gruff father of Fred and Henry; Catherine's parents and Eleanor Tilney the kind and lovely sister of the two Tilney boys with whom Catherine forms a solid friendship.<br />  The book includes a spirited defense of the art of novel writing by Miss Austen. It is a light and commonplace tale of young love told with the wit and wisdom of one of England's greatest authors. This less well known Austen novel is a delightful way to become an addict of the spinster from Hawton parsongage!
6305428352|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  I have watched it over and over again.  I find it to be a great source of inspiration for the average Joe.  You can make a difference and not even know it as long as you do your best and help others.      Too bad the movie did not win Academy Awards.  At least Richard Dreyfuss was nominated for his superior, inspiring acting in this movie.
B000KFTWIG|5.0|This is the album that brought the east coast back. Before this, the west coast was running rap. Ready to Die was the first album I purchased with my own money and I was not let down. Puff discovered a diamond in the rough when he found The Notorious B.I.G. Biggy's hard core rhymes made for the perfect marriage with Puff's style of sampling old records. The result was a masterpiece called Ready to Die.    Puff brought Biggy to the masses with the singles \\"Juicy\\" and \\"Big Poppa\\". Biggy filled in the rest of the gaps in with tales of life in the streets. He had a voice that sucked you into his lyrics and brought life to his words. Songs like \\"Warning\\" and \\"Me & My B..\\" show off Biggy's great ability to bring stories to life. Who can forget the line \\"wiped the cold out my eye\\". How detailed is that? If you want pure lyrics, Biggy gives that to the listener on songs such as \\"The What\\"w/Method Man and \\"Unbelievable\\" produced by DJ Premier.     In my opinion, this is the greatest rap cd ever by the greatest rapper. Biggy just had that thing that the others artists could not duplicate. He had a crazy flow and combined that with the ultimate presence.  Jay-Z picked up on that same swag and ran with it after Big died. Ready to Die is a classic and a must for any real cd collection. This album started Bad Boy's dynasty and B.I.G.'s rein as the King of New York and rap. Biggy Smalls is the Illest.....
0375703764|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me.  She said it was really scary and life-changing.  I did not find it in the least bit scary.  I would describe this book as a cross between The Amityville Horror and The Blair Witch Project.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dual-action throughout the book, and was really sorry when it was finished.  My only disappointment was to find it was more \\"lightweight\\" (MUCH less horror) than I had expected.  Otherwise, it was a fun, quick summer read.

0618164413|3.0|Although the illustrations are irresistable, I would not recommend the content of the first few books, at least, for children without some guidance from parents/teachers.  They would, however, be good springboards for discussions about changing perspectives on wildlife and animal rights.  When the Reys wrote their books, human dominance and exploitation of wild animals was almost unquestioned in their culture.  Today, the sight of a young chimpanzee being captured, taken to the city, given alcohol and cigarettes, being imprisoned in a jail and then a zoo and being used in the film industry is disturbing, to say the least.  I could see children learning to think about animals and wildlife, and learning to empathize with other species, from these books.

B000Q3648S|5.0|Disc One is the reissued definitive recording of the 1980's.  Disc Two is chocked full of noisey Daydream Nation goodness performed live.      So often reissues are a ripoff.  This set delivers the goods and then some.
B00000269M|5.0|Michael Jackson is an inspiration. From his breathtaking \\"hee hee\\"s to his stunning \\"aow!\\"s to his vocals - which make every other artist on the planet seem like crap - everything about this incredible voice is unbelievable. BAD is a personification of Michael Jackson - dangerous, sexy, and with a rough edge - and the way this album makes you feel is incredible. Eleven stunning tracks, each individual in its own right, and yet the album is united by the common elements which make Michael such a wonderful singer. Michael Jackson is and always will be the King of Music, and I cannot wait for his new album, which promises to be another wonderful masterpiece. Treasure BAD - there will be nothing like it by any other artist ever again. It is a masterpiece.
B000055Y0X|4.0|I HAD NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE SINCE IT OPENED IN THE THEATERS.  THE IMPRESSION YOU HAD WAS THAT DR STRANGELOVE (ala EDWARD TELLER) WAS THE PRIMARY CHARACTER AND RODE THE BOMB AT THE END.  IN REALITY DR STRANGELOVE (A MAD WEAPONS SCIENTIST; THAT MAY BE REDUNDANT)WAS A MINOR CHARACTER.  IN MY VIEW THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS THE GENERAL (ALA CURTIS LEMAY) PLAYED BY GEORGE SCOTT.  HIS BLIND SPOUTING OF FUNDAMENTAL MILITARY THEORY, UNTOUCHED BY REALITY, IS MORE THAN WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION.
032147404X|4.0|This is a very good book, especially if you are in the \\"sophomore\\" stage of photography (no longer a newbie, but far from being a pro). It's breezily written, and has useful easy-to-read tips on almost every page. The writing is VERY approachable, and the author does a good job explaining difficult technical concepts to the reader.<br /><br />I do agree, however, that the author's jokes wore thin after the first fifteen pages or so. I also think the book is a little slim. Still, I'd happily recommend it.
B000P0J024|5.0|I had this album when it came out. My car was broken into and they stole the tape player WITH the tape in it. I've been waiting for the new release ever since. Can't believe how much I missed it! Great music by some of my favorite musicians. Not as keen on Volume 3, but love it all!
1857988094|4.0|I really liked the book.  It is a quick and entertaining read - especially for being written in 1954. I'm not really in to vampires, but this isn't about vampires. It's about a man who is the last man on earth and he's trying to deal with being alone, and trying to figure out what has happened to the rest of his race. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for some light summertime reading<br /><br />There are periods when Neville's coping with his solitary existence - sometimes he drinks himself into a haze and other times he just zones out for months at a time.  It reminded me of Cast Away when Tom Hanks was just dealing with being all by himself.  It is interesting to read and to get inside the head of a charater like that.  Cast Away had over 40 minutes of silence, but in I am Legend you a exposed to the inner thoughts of the survivor.  I can only imagine what it would do to a man - but it sure makes for good reading...
B000OVLNII|5.0|Brilliant!!!  This is not only the best thing every written about Lincoln, it may be the best piece of non-fiction ever written.  Gore Vidal is a great writer, but his \\"Licoln\\" required amalgamations and the interjection of fictitious characters to give it a novel-quality readability; and even with this crutch Vidal fails to give characters the complexity and motives that Kearns Goodwin reveals.  Similarly readable examples of great non-fiction contain similar flaws.  \\"In Cold Blood,\\" for example, is a great book but wasn't exactly the product of professional journalistic practices.  Typically, readable non-fiction is sloppy whereas responsbile, accurate non-fiction is dry.  Kearns Goodwin has produced an amazing work that suffers neither flaw.  It is one of the most credible pieces of historic analysis ever performed and is also a compelling page-turner.  Kearns Goodwin is a great historian, a great writer, and a great psychologist.  She brings depth to characters without playing loose with facts or engaging in irresponsible speculation.  I swear to God that this book is so well written that I seriously caught myself hoping that Lincoln would survive the gunshot wound.      In addition to all of these things, the book should be mandatory reading for business students or anybody who is responsible for managing other people.  The book's focus on how Lincoln managed his \\"team of rivals\\" adds to its readability.  It also translates into direct, practical wisdom.

0778320448|5.0|I have read the first two books in the series \\"The Shop on Blossom Street\\".   Great book.   Good Stories.   By the time I was done I thought I would like to learn to knit.   Recently in the last several month, I came upon a yarn shop in a nearby town.  I decided to check it out.  When I went in it was cute and had a table in the middle of the shop.  The girl told me after she read the book she knew she had to open a shop. I talked to the girl and she ask if I had read \\"The Shop on Blossom Street\\" and I said yes.    Her shop is designed after that book.   PERFECT!  Without knowing me the girl ask if I have read the second book.   I said no and she grabbed it off the shelf and handed it to me.   It is called \\"A Good Yarn\\"....the name of the shop.    It was also a very very good book.    There is one more in that series.  \\"Back to the Shop on Blossom Street\\".   I do not have that yet.  So, when I took the book back to the \\"YARNS R US\\" shop, the girl handed me a card to see if I wanted to learn to knit.    I am going to the class this weekend. 7/14/07.      What's really neat is that there is a series of knitting instruction books designed from \\"The Shop on Blossom Street\\".  Really neat.  The socks are in there whick is from the second book.  The sweaters from the frist book are there too.    Buy the books, neat clean reading!!
B000PY52EU|3.0|I was uncomfortable watching this movie with the fam (an adult daughter and a more-adult husband) because Black Snake Moan is *so* heavy-laden with sexual content, very graphic sexual language, violence against women and more.<br /><br />The first hour, Christina Ricci is in nothing but wee tiny panties and an equally revealing top and there are more than a few scenes of her performing various sexual acts. Now, if you were a 50-something man (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to rescue this pitiable lost soul, wouldn't you get some clothes on the child as soon as possible?<br /><br />But that can't happen until well past the first hour of the flick because it's more important that we see a naked woman writhing around whilst being bound about her waist with heavy iron chains and an antique padlock. Perhaps there are men who relish the idea of seeing a nearly naked Christine Ricci chained to the radiator in *their* dining room, but I found it all pretty distasteful. Not to mention, I believe such actions can be prosecuted as a felony.<br /><br />It felt more like I was watching a triple-X flick than a mainstream movie. Black Snake Moan has some redeeming qualities and features, and the plot had the potential to be quite interesting and even enchanting, but the overt sexual nature of this movie left me feeling more like I'd just watched a two-hour porn flick, with a plot stuck in the middle as an afterthought.<br /><br />And what about the violence against women? Is this the only way to salvage and save a lost soul like \\"Rae\\" (Christina Ricci)? Bind her with iron shackles and let her scream the demons out? I found the movie to be *very* condenscending to women.<br /><br />My favorite scenes were those which included S. Epatha Merkerson (Miss Angie) and John Cothman (the minister). Had their stories been given a little more flesh and substance, the movie could have been much more interesting and thought-provoking.

B000000W6F|5.0|This record has to be taken in the context of its time. A grim era in rock music. REM was sinking into the quagmire of commerical schmaltz. Elvis Costello had completed his transformation into the \\"balladeer.\\"  There was a glimmer of hope when Neil Young put out Ragged Glory, but that was.....Neil Young, for Chrissakes! Sonic Youth? Maybe, but no air play. Otherwise, nothing. It looked like it was all over.     Then..out of nowhere, comes this record! Wailing guitars..big bass..wallshaking drums..huge chords, psychedelia, loud, loud, loud....most importantly, COOL TUNES! I didn't think anyone knew about this stuff anymore.     This record was the first in the glorious year of 1991 that also saw Pearl Jam, Nirvana and others literally save rock and roll.    Others can argue the merits of this record against the ones that followed, but not me. This will always be the best Pumpkins record, and one of my desert island favorites, because it is the one that dragged rock music out of bed, slapped its face and shouted \\"Wake Up!\\"    For that reason alone it is 5 stars.

1582701709|1.0|\\"The Secret\\" was in my stack of Good Will donations. I changed my mind and put it in the garbage. I choose not to spread such hype. The idea that one brings on one's negative experiences is a partial truth  that can also be a dangerous drug for the mind. I spent many years working as a mental health counselor. While I advocate self-responsiblity, I have seen numerous children and adults who were caught in the spiral of self-blame and guilt for the destructive events that occurred in their lives--rape, abuse, illness, to name a few. Much work was involved to become free of such self-blame. \\"The Secret\\" is not new; it is the bedfellow of fundamental religion's \\"if you only believe,\\" that also imposes self-blame and guilt.            While I am an advocate of positive thinking, it does not take the place of being awake and acknowledging the negative. When I read Vitale's assertion that masses of destroyed people attracted themselves to the event,I scanned the rest of the book and put it down. An image of the death camp at Majdanek in southern Poland kept getting in the way. Only when the existence of destructive people is acknowledged, and we come to face the reality that bad things happen, such as the holocaust, Darfur, abused children, diseases, natural disasters . . . can we become true participants in humanity and take action. The idea that the 1,000 per day put to death at Majdanek was a product of their own doing, is outside any concept I have of true humanity. This hype becomes destructive and feeds what seems to be the primary human desire in Byrne's book: greed, not only for money, but for control. That one is in control of what happens is an illusion, at best.    It seems that the ancient human values (honesty, compassion, the wisdom that comes from owning and learning from our mistakes, and actively working for justice and dignity for all of us) have become the new secret. They certainly were not presented in Rhonda Byrne's book.     The only positive aspect of Byrne's book was that it helped me to examine what truly matters to me. Then I discovered that I already have it.
0439813786|5.0|My sons (16 and 20) and I (51 year old mom) rarely all agree on a book but this did it.  I think the other descriptions are great for a book that is really hard to explain!  My recommendation is to just get it and see for yourself.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|The movie of corse is the same.  The most excellent coming of age comedy ever made.  I had to watch it again and then I checked out the extras.  The interviews with the now older actors is a wonderful reflection of all of their career's and former youth.  It is totally worth getting.  My last copy of the DVD went to my 15 year old niece.  All that I had left was the original VHS from 1989.  I loved it and I hope you enjoy it.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I'm still not sure what this movie is actually about but I freakin love it.  Maybe it's Napoleon, or his brother Kip, or Uncle Rico, or maybe it's all of the above that make this a must see.<br /><br />The entire film jumps from wierd scene to wierd scene making you wonder if there are actually people out there like this.  Just watching Naploeon as he stuffs tater tots into his pocket for a late afternoon snack is enough to create hours of enjoyment. Definately do yourself a favor and watch this dry humor masterpiece which is sure to leave you very confused.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Something good to rock out to.  Will you like this album as much as the first couple pumpkins albums?  Probably not.  Is this a good album? Yes.      Sometimes expectations are too high on an artist to bring back the magic.
B00005JM1F|4.0|Getting to watch Will Farrell and Vince Vaugh start their own fraernity is enough to catch my interest. This is one of my favorite comedy movies and I highly recommend it.  What could be funnier then watching Will Farrell stumble around a kids party after being shot in the neck with an animal tranquilizer?  And thats only one of the many hilarous parts.  It's definately a great one to pop in when you're hanging out with the guys.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|If you dig the Pumpkins material and the variety of styling that Billy Corgan has gone after, you'll like this album.  The low tuning does create a less sonic pleasing tone than their previous albums.  And his recording technique for the vocals seem more \\"front\\" than previous albums as well, which in subtle ways distracts the listener from the guitars/drums.    If you're looking for a frame of reference, think \\"white spider/blue skies bring tears\\" from Machina II, meets Mellon Collie era rock, with a touch of Billy C and Jimmy C's solo albums.  I feel there is less experiment going on, though definitely a return to heart-felt, straight up rock (definitely not Adore era styling).  There are the softer tones, but I guarantee that the first tunes that will jump out at you are the ones that make you think \\"hell yeah.\\"    I'd give this one a 4.5 stars to make the point that this one isn't quite what their older albums are, but it really is a great album once you fall into it.  My personal belief is that if they follow up with another album in the next couple of years, and let two other band members contribute to the material, this will be an amazing platform for them to launch off of.  Skimming through the album, it looks like only Billy C. and Jimmy C. wrote and recorded the music, which seems to me to be the cause of the somewhat surprisingly \\"empty\\" sound when it comes to the experimental and sonic edge you'd expect from the pumpkins. Still...as said a few times here, a great album.
B00005JMYI|4.0|It doesn't get much better then Will Ferrell when it comes to comedy.  Anchorman is about legendary news anchor Ron Burgendy and his large ego as he proves why his is #1 when it comes to delivering the news, and sweeping the ladies off their feet with his pushbroom mustache and lines  smooth as fine cognac.  You can expcet the usual Will Ferrell humor with some guest appearences from Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller.<br />If you like Will Ferrell then this ones for you.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|Its been four/five years since X2 - X-MEN UNITED was released in theaters and was hailed by audiences everywhere (negative or positive). To be frank a lot happened in the span of four years ---Bryan Singer ditching the \\"X\\" production for \\"Superman\\" among other things--- and X-MEN: The last stand really shows what four years without the headmaster and an excellent writing team can do to an over-popular movie franchise that seemed to work even when a lot CBM's didn't. For some reason the characters, the storyline and the movie itself seemed to suffer from its own ego and poor writing. For starters, Brent Ratner did not do a horrible job as far as directing movies go. However, if you gonna blame someone (beyond Ratner) then blame the producers, the scenario, and screenplay writers. Storyline based on Joss Whedon's \\"Mutant Cure\\" storyline in \\"ASTONISHING X-MEN\\" and the ever-famous DARK PHOENIX saga reveals that LAST STAND had potential enough to become third greatest movie of the X-MEN series but falls flat because of lack of depth in the characters and the introduction of way too many NEW characters to merit something wonderful. THE LAST STAND was like watching a big-budget show and tell at school: The mutants would show up on screen, flaunt their gifts in their fifteen minutes of fame, then become a distant memory or in this case an extra actor.                 I was expecting the flashback concerning Magneto and Professor X going to the Grey household to recruit Jean Grey to be interesting or at least impressive. It was none of the above. While the \\"DE-Aging\\" CGI they used on Stewart and McKellen was impressive the scene felt like it was directed and acted out in a campy kind of way. There was not a serious atmosphere about it in short. The storyline from there feels like it wants to become something. Especially when they use about half the movie's hour talking and planning things. Another thing that irked me was that the movie had the humans announcing they, or rather Angel's father, had created a permanent cure for the mutant 'disease' -- with the use of a mutant child named Leech (Camron Bright)-- instead of the diplomatically immune alien Ord [\\"The terrible\\"?] who originally brought the means of the cure to the female Dr. Kavita Rao. In truth, it suffers from the same problem BLADE: TRINITY suffered from. The introduction of new characters, the misuse of the focal character, and weak storyline. Only that movie managed to merit something as memorable opposed to LAST STAND. The storyline in XM:TLS was not fleshed out as well as the previous movies storylines were. The fact that there were far too many subplots attached to many of the new (good and bad) or old characters that were never dwelled on was a bloody shame. And the ending, to me, was just too \\"Happily Ever After,\\" and unsurprisingly unfinal.          Tweaking of the previous characters such as Storm, Rogue, Bobby, Wolverine, Jean, Magneto, and Pryo was a positive and negative. The simple fact that Halle Berry was given something more to do in this film besides look pretty and let the FX do the all the work was major hit with me. If anything she was the true spectacle of the entire film; She acted like the leader she was potrayed as in the comics and her action sequences were the best! Even Halle's acting felt like it got better for some particular reason. I was disappointed with her fight scenes with Callisto. All Callisto seemed to do her was run circles around her then knee Storm in the stomach in both their fights. Plus the camera was in too close on the actresses in some scenes. The disappearance of Rogue's character was an all round disappointment to me: She was literally shoved aside to give the 3d actress for Kitty Pryde for screen time; Even the chemistry between Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman was missing in their short moment on-screen together. This was the movie I was really hoping -- like they did with Storm -- would do something with the timid Southern Belle who was the focal point of the first movie. Alas it was not to be. Pryo's character wasn't shown nor did it change much from the second movie. As far as being Magneto's right hand man and rival to Ice-man he did nothing except show off his funky near bleach-blond hair style and fire mechanisms on his wrists.               Jean Grey was never my favorite character to begin with, though it may be simply because people place her character on such a high mantle of glory, but Famke Jansen's performance was good as the Dark Phoenix. I was both happy and unmoved by the change of personality for this so-focused on female lead. Her darker persona fit her characterism a lot better her good-guy persona did. However, the disappointments I had with her character is that she barely showed remorse for \\"killing\\" Cyclops, and Xavier. Her DARK PHOENIX persona lacked whatever sinister-like qualities that made her so cool in the comics. Wolverine and Magneto were probably the biggest disappointments for me in LAST STAND: Wolverine's character went from \\"loner/father figure (X-Men)\\" - \\"demi-gallant (X2)\\" - to \\"Puppy-dog looking to move in on Cyclops' vacant spot\\" in the LAST STAND. While they stayed true to his obsession for Jean Grey, Wolverine seemed so far removed from his original character from the previous films that I almost thought I was looking at another person altogether.           Sure he still retained the same quirks that made him Wolverine, but he just lacked that certain something that made him so cool to me in the movies. Magneto's character went from cunningly smart to stupidly reckless and absentminded in the span of four years. His character seemed to rush into things and ditch members of his brotherhood quicker than a man could yodel in the mountains. Even his decisions on how to deal with the humans and their cure seemed absurd and unlogical. Ian McKellen's acting seemed way off in the movie; He was very un-Magneto. Lastly, Iceman was more or less a simple unexplored plot-device for the untouched Rogue/Bobby/Shadowcat triangle. He was also among the non-liked characters on my list and his characterization in the movie just gave me more of a reason to dislike him. To be frank I favored the first Actress they used for Shadowcat, Sumela Kay, as opposed to the second actress, Katie Stuart, and Ellen Page. Page just did not have the acting abilities to make Kitty something of a memorable character like Anna Paquin did for Rogue. If anything she made her unbearingly annoying with her less than average performance. Other characters like Beast (Grammar) and Colossus are instant likeables. My only problem with both characters was that Beast was made a diplomat and not a scientist and Colossus was not focused on much as a main character.          The axing of most veteran characters for the barely touched upon new characters was also a problem. While he was never my favorite character to begin with, shunting Cyclops was probably the second biggest mistake the film made just so it could focus on the \\"Wolverine x Jean\\" attraction. I read GIFTED and watched the PHOENIX/DARK PHOENIX arc in the animated series and it didn't dawn on me until the end of the movie what they really could've done with his character. Among other things, it was that dynamic in Cyclops' and Jean's relationship that made the PHOENIX/DARK PHOENIX saga compelling. And he is the leader after all, but the films demoted him to less than a background character. Alas, I really blame SUPERMAN RETURNS for the lack of Cyclops in the movie. Seriously, what is James Marsden gonna do?: Get shunted again by his lady-friend (Lois) for Superman? The de-mutanizing of Mystique was horrible: The coolest female character in the franchise and they axed her with a fate she considers whose than death. It was like they really wanted to focus more on Callisto as Magneto's right hand woman and rid us of Rebecca Stamos' character. Which also begs to the questions: How did the Governmentcatch Mystique in the first place if she was masqurading as Senator Kelly? There wasn't even a mention of her capture on the news in the movie. The death of Professor Xavier, while emotionally moving, was kind of a disaster waiting to happen. It was as though the screenplay writers could not think of what to do with his character and simply decided to kill him off for some short lived arbitrary drama. Which sucked, Patrick Stewart was the probably the best actor in the entire movie.          Now as for the subject of acting?: Most of the originally actors seem to put the same heart they used in the previous two films, even the ones that were wrongfully axed. But as this very short movie progresses you begin to notice the newcomers and other previous actors are lacking in serious atmosphere and talent. But most notably Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen were the weakest of the originals. They hardly seemed to take their roles seriously and thus were far too campy. Famke Jennsen was all right playing her darker persona Phoenix, but when it came to her \\"emotional\\" scenes with Jackman they lacked a serious something that would've made these scenes spark. Grammar as beast is another actor that did surprisingly well in his role as the DIPLOMAT Hank McCoy/Best. Even the sillest lines he made his own and convincing enough to sound like something The Beast would say. The CGI in the film was a hit and miss in most terms of the phrase. Most of the time the CGI looked amazing and somewhat of an improvement over the previous films. Storm's FX was the best out of the entire film. The way they had her performing her attacks or just the simple flying scenes were cool, well thought out. Other times it just looked visibly horrible and unfinished in a lot of the scenes. Most notably when Jean was lifting her house from the ground, Multiple-man (as I dubbed him), when Bobby freezes over (his mouth is not timed well with his words), Juggernaut and Shadowcat were playing tag with each other near the end of the movie, and then Jean's powers shredding everything she focuses on. Another disappointment is that they didn't show the SENTINEL beyond blinding headlights and its head falling to the ground in defeat! A major rip off for fans of this massive robot. The action sequences in the film were something to behold though they were noticeable problems with the wire tricks -- Colossus tossing Wolverine and Beast jumping around pummeling everyone.       All in all they got the adrenaline pumping afterward. The score composed by John Powell was all right; It suited the action-esque atmosphere in the movie but you'll be hard pressed to even bother paying attention to it. Most of the time you'll hear the theme of the movie, maybe an action BGM here and there but the audio of the film itself will drown out the score so it'll be nonexistent to the ears. All in all \\"X-MEN THE LAST STAND\\" is a half&half kind of movie; A major disappointment from such a highly praised movie series. -------- [3 out of 5]
B000NVIXFK|5.0|While there has been something worthwhile in practically every Rush studio release, few have been this uniformly good. The more I listen, the more there is to like. In fact I like it so much that \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" may make it up there in my Top 5 favorite Rush albums (to date, \\"2112\\", \\"A Farewell to Kings\\", \\"Hemispheres\\", \\"Permanent Waves\\" and \\"Moving Pictures\\").    This is an amalgam of diverse styles and influences (acoustic, blues, prog, modern rock, and more), but with signature Rush elements: Power chords, stops, time changes, and the distinctive sound of all the players.    The disc maintains a thrilling intensity until tracks 10 and 11: \\"Bravest Face\\", probably my least favorite track and \\"Good News First\\", which I really do like, just not as much as the rest. But the last 2 tracks are phenomenal: \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" and \\"We Hold On\\".    I saw them live a few weeks ago and it was nice to be looking forward to hearing their latest stuff, not just the \\"classics\\".    My only complaint is minor: The use of overdubbing is a little excessive, and in most places unnecessary.
B00005JPFF|3.0|Undoubtedly the first thought to come to many people's minds after viewing Spider-Man 3, the latest installment in the adventures of everyone's favorite web-slinger, is \\"How?\\" How, indeed, could Sam Raimi and company, the same team that infused the first two Spider-Man movies with such wit and humanity, have screwed up so, so badly? After kicking things off with an excellent origin story and following it with the amazing, spellbinding action and character development of the sequel, it seemed like Spider-Man 3 was bound to not only equal the high-water mark of Spider-Man 2 but in all likelihood surpass it. Perhaps such titanic expectations are unfair but after making what is widely considered the best super-hero movie ever the filmmakers would be hard-pressed to garner that sort of praise again. So where exactly does it all \\"go wrong\\" for Spider-Man 3?<br /><br />The movie starts with everything going right for Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire)--he's been given the key to the city, he's going to propose to Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), and his best friend Harry (James Franco) doesn't hate him anymore. Things start to sour when it is discovered that Flint Marko, a.k.a. the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), was Uncle Ben's real killer. Naturally, Peter wants revenge and as luck would have it he's got a brand new black suit (which amplifies his aggression, bringing out his \\"dark side\\") to help him beat Marko. Before he knows what's happening to him, Peter succumbs to the dark power of the symbiote and makes decisions he will quickly regret. After losing his sense of identity and his relationship with Mary Jane, Peter decides he needs to face the darkness within and make things right again.<br /><br />The concept is sound but even at a lengthy 139 minutes there's a lot of things wrong here that should have been fixed. To start with, the script is nowhere near as tight as those of the previous two chapters. The reason the scripts for the first two movies worked so well was that the action was so tightly woven into Peter's inner turmoil and stressful life. After confronting enemies and personal problems he couldn't seem to beat (and enduring conveniently relevant lectures from Aunt May), Peter was able to learn important life lessons that helped him overcome whatever might have been plaguing him throughout the films. And while Raimi strives for Peter to learn forgiveness this time around the message doesn't stick like it did with the first two--it simply gets lost in the impersonal action-fest unfolding on screen. Of course, it doesn't help things feel more connected when the majority of the plot development rests on coincidence either; for example, the symbiote landing a few feet away from Peter, Flint Marko stumbling into a particle accelerator to become the Sandman, and a revelation from Harry's butler are just a few. Things are established or resolved in a manner so convenient that it's hard not to scoff. It seems screenwriters Alvin Sargent and Sam & Ivan Raimi were so busy cramming all the new characters in that they couldn't squeeze in the simplest of logical explanations. The selection of new characters brought on for Spider-Man 3 is excellent but what's unfortunate about the concentration on new faces is that none of them are properly developed. Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), the freshest characters here, are on the screen for all of ten minutes. Stacy serves no other function than to make Mary Jane jealous and keep her at a distance from Peter for the length of the movie. Topher Grace is effortless as Eddie Brock and his performance is a joy to watch but there is so little screen time for him that the audience isn't even given a chance to explore his fascinating character, let alone the monster that he becomes. Venom is the most wildly successful villain in Spidey's entire rogues gallery so the fact that Venom is barely in the movie (and works as little more than a metaphor) will come as ahuge disappointment to many fans of the comic series. The Sandman, on the other hand, is a sligthly more successful adaptation. He has a done-to-death back-story about a normal guy with bad luck but Raimi and Church humanize Sandman just enough to make him more than the career criminal he was originally. Had Sandman been the primary villain here, with Harry's storyline kept in tact and Venom saved for a fourth chapter, the screen time for all the newcomers could have been shared much more effectively, providing a narrative structure closer to Spider-Man 2. What audiences get instead is an unfocused plot weighed down by wonderful characters that were tragically underwritten.<br /><br />While the majority of the problems with Spider-Man 3 are the result of a subpar script, it's the smaller moments that will make or break the film for most audiences. These scenes consist of a Saturday Night Fever homage, Peter's moody emo hair and eyeliner, two songs by Mary Jane, and a jazzy dance number. It can be said that none of these moments fit with the previously created universe and only exacerbate the numerous problems this movie already has. On the other hand, one can just as easily argue that these \\"laughably bad\\" moments were designed to be just that--Peter Parker is such a geek that his idea of being \\"the bad boy\\" consists of having hair combed over one eye, thick eyeliner and black suits then whispering \\"Now dig on this\\" and one-upping his ex in a dance number straight from West Side Story. These bits uncompromisingly dance the razor's edge between the humorous and the ridiculous and, at the very least, credit is due to Sam Raimi for defying the sylistic trademarks expected of a Sam Raimi film and being bold enough to explore new territory. Whether these explorations work or not depends entirely on the mindset of the viewer.<br /><br />Thankfully, there are still some undeniably good, even exciting, things in Spider-Man 3. Seeing these stories and characters back on the big screen alone is worth the price of admission. After having invested so much time and money and emotions into this tangled web of relationships it is great to see them at it again. Peter and Harry's on-again, off-again antagonism starts out strong in the beginning of the movie with an intense action sequence to kick things off and just keeps on going. Their arc has been the strongest through the trilogy and getting to see Franco in full-on bad guy mode is a blast. Their conflict finally gets resolved here albeit in a way that is both poignant and predictable. Then there's the excellent comedic bits that have made the Spider-Man movies so enjoyable in the past--Bruce Campbell once again makes the most hilarious cameo of the movie as a charmingly sycophantic maître d', J.K. Simmons (as usual) steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, and even Toby Maguire is given a chance to really flex his comedic muscle. Spider-Man 3, with it's enormous budget, also has the most convincing shots of Spider-Man soaring through New York's skyline and more impressive fight sequences than ever before. If the bigger-than-life action spectaculars aren't as intense and personal as those found in the first two movies, then it can at least be said they are on par with the most epic battles of good-vs-evil to be released on the silver screen.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 is likely to make its audience as conflicted as its title character. The series has always been ambitious but this time the script overshoots its reach. It's a simple case of quatity over quality, a fault quite common in summer blockbusters and sequels. That's not to say that Spider-Man 3 is a bad movie. There is a lot to enjoy here for fans and casual viewers alike--the talented cast and crew, the fantastic visual effects, the complex relationships--but an unfortunate case of sequelitis bogs down Spider-Man 3, making it the weakest chapter in the Spider-Man saga thus far. Hopefully when the inevitable sequel comes around the filmmakers attached will be smart enough to scale their efforts back a bit and put a greater focus on all that made this series great in the first place.price of admission.

0316067598|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the war in Iraq and Afganistan.  It is very well written and gives the reader an insite into what goes on over there.  The men who participated in the war make me proud to be an American.
B000P0J02E|5.0|The music that Hans Zimmer has written for this movie is outstanding.  Once you have seen the movie, you realize the music fits it perfectly.  There are several favorites that bring to mind the favorite scenes during which they're played so it's almost like watching the movie while listening to the CD.  I have the CD's from all three Pirates movies and, while I love them all and listen to them regularly, the music from AWE is a different type of music.  I recommend it highly.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The amount of time it must have taken to create this beautiful series! What a cosmic blend of HD technology and nature.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is my favorite album (well, one of them), so I have wrecked mine by listening to it on the beach....  Number 10 to the end are totally WRECKED.  So here I am, buying a new copy.  I haven't heard the second half of the album in a loooong time!
1582701709|5.0|The Secret is easy to read with a powerful message.  Everyone should read this book to understand the power of our thoughts, the path of manifesting our desires, and the grace of the divine.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series was probably the most visually stunning series that I have ever seen.  The footage that was gathered was unbelievable.  This series is why we need to step up and stop the destruction of the world.  The earth is a beautiful place and humans should be protecting it not destroying it.
0316067598|5.0|A true story that reads like a novel from beginning to end.  From the prologue to the last page, I was rivoted.    Marcus takes us thru his youth, his trials during Navy Seal training, thru the mountains of Afghanistan and the amazing heroity and courage of these four Navy SEALS.  His driving force to live was to tell the story of the his Navy SEAL teammates.  I'm Glad he told it, and I'm honored to have read it.    I cried.  I laughed.  But most of all I realized our media half-across the world -  caused the death of these men.  The SEALS' decision to let Afghan \\"farmers\\" live, while hatred spilled from their eyes, was a media-based decision, not a military one.  They knew they should kill them (from the look of hatred in their eyes), but because of the media, and because of Christian values deeply rooted, they let them live, and three men died (not because of YOU Marcus), but because of the media and the week-kneed politicans who run this country and their idiotic Rules of Engagement.    My final thought.  We will never win against Fascist Islamists, who hate us, until we realize we have to hate as much as them.  It makes me sick to my stomach to say that, but the words of Marcus' best friend echo in my head as they do his \\"Help me, Marcus, help me\\"...was a call of help to ALL of us to wake up to what we (and our military men and woman) are facing, before it is too late.    BUY IT.  You won't regret it.  It's a page turner.  I read it in 3 days.
B000001ELL|5.0|I remember buying this album when I was in 8th grade.  At the time, I wasn't sure how I felt about it.  I remember that it gripped me in the back of my mind when I thought about it though.  SNAP to 2007!  The album I had back in the day had been long gone with maybe a few others that I loaned out and forgot about.  I just bought the remaster on CD and after watching KISSOLOGY, I must say, Dynasty was the end of what we all knew of KISS from back in the day.  This album finally gave Ace and Peter a bigger roll vocally, which I was glad to hear.  To me, it was about time that Gene shared the spotlight with Ace and Peter.  Paul is all good, no criticism there!  Dynasty is a group album, no one leads the way, it's shared and I'm glad to see\hear that.  I never listened to any new KISS after this.  I consider this album as a Great End to the band WE all knew, granted it's not as 'core as earlier stuff, but a fine exclamation point to a wonderful run.
0767817478|3.0|So I accepted that Godzilla just isn't Godzilla and watched the movie and I actually really liked it. Until half way into the film when they kill off Godzilla and leave us with a bad Jurassic park. It's almost step by step the original Jurassic Park in side the museum when the raptors are chasing the boy and girl.  Even the way the baby Godzillas interact, with them snapping at each other with a neck curl.<br /><br />So as a Godzilla fan I found myself bored and wanting to see a big monster destroying the city not little babies fully developed running around trying to eat the humans because they smelled like fish.  That also made me sad; that they had to justify the little tikes eating the humans by saying the smelled like fish and not saying they just hatched from their eggs and are hungry for some meat, which happens to be man meat.<br /><br />The films cute and if your not a fan of the original its fun and great for kids my friend raised on it, knowing it line by line watched it with me and he still loved it. It's a good take on the American portrayal of Godzilla, and it still had little tid bits for us fans it just forgot what the fans come to watch.<br /><br />One thing i feel that this film handled so well was the love for the beast and the sadness of it creation.  that it will have to die for humans to live.  this part of the film i felt was amazing and very true to godzilla.<br /><br />For me I love Godzilla and as a kid anytime he was on screen I would run over to the TV and sit about a foot away, but there was also the great stories between the characters.  The boyfriend in Godzilla vs. Monster Zero trying to impress his girlfriend brother so he can marry her, and when he is the one that figures out how to stop the destruction the brother looks at him with such anger.  It's amazing.  There isn't anything like this in this movie and that's why in my option it falls short.  Never giving us anything to hold onto.  Nothing more mature then a teenage drama that as a kid, I had no interest in, and now as an adult I find it immature and boring.<br /><br />But now as a fan there are the Sony classic releases where they're releasing all the originals with the Japanese cuts and American cuts which are great.  Again this film is ment for people that aren't fans, and if so enjoy it a good American big monster movie with some amazing CGI when it was made and still is very impressive.  Just remember there is more to the big guy then him just wanting to eat fish.t in, and now as an adult I find it immature and boring.      But now as a fan there are the Sony classic releases where they're releasing all the originals with the Japanese cuts and American cuts which are great.  Again this film is ment for people that aren't fans, and if so enjoy it a good American big monster movie with some amazing CGI when it was made and still is very impressive.

B00001NFCY|1.0|After their previous CD, which was not too bad on one or two tracks, \\"Human Clay\\" came out. More the same stuff, just on a different CD. This CD was truly a step backwards for Creed, if that were ever possible.<br /><br />It seems like Creed tried to add some grunge elements to their music, and it just didn't come off. Abominable tracks like \\"Wrong Way\\", with occassional ventures into real rock, \\"Say I\\", that borders on the dismal, and more that truly defy the senses.<br /><br />The pity is that the lyrical content is actually pretty good and has some substance to it. Sadly, the overall execution just didn't cut it and match that.<br /><br />Even for fans of hard rock, this would be a CD to avoid. Don't waste your money.
0439813786|5.0|I don't believe that I've ever seen such an overwhelming majority of favorable Amazon reviews for ANY book (my neighbor below notwithstanding). Bravo to Brian Selznick for starting this avalanche of assents with his marvelous project.<br /><br />As is amply pointed out elsewhere on this page, what Selznick has done is create a book that approximates a silent film. (Inasmuch as the book is a tribute to said films, this is entirely appropriate.) Thus, the book's has full and double-page graphics followed by supplementary text.<br /><br />The storyline is advanced separately by either words OR pictures. In this fashion, it is not what is called a graphic novel... rather, it's a silent film between book covers.<br /><br />One Cavil: At over 500 pages long, this book could crush the unwitting child who tries to read it in bed. Thus, I was surprised to see a 4/5ths ratio of open \\"white space\\" on some of the text pages. Was there a reason for this seeming waste that's not immediately apparent?
1582701709|5.0|It a great read, you learn a lot about yourself. The idea of man becomes what he thinks is empowering.
B000A2IPPK|5.0|I ordered this movie for my 12 year old daughter and she watches it twice a day.  She is just as in love with this movie as I was as a child. It helps to bridge the gap between parent and child when we discuss the scenes in the movie. This is a must have for every family.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|i swear the majority of the 'music critics' out there just get off on bashing billy...i've loved the pumpkins for so long, i grew up with them, and at the same time, i wasnt big on zwan and billy's solo stuff didnt really grab me so i'd like to think i can be objective...as much as i was hoping this album would be good i was still caught off guard by how much it grabs you by the cojones and doesnt let go...this album ROCKS hard..i love adore and their quieter stuff but i wanted a harder album so bad and i got it...jimmy's drumming in particular is just fantastic, he shows why he is one of the best drummers playing and he stays locked into the song, pushing the raging guitars and driving the beat...the last 30 seconds of Starz alone is enough to make your head explode...love it love it love it
B000P2A256|5.0|This CD is a refreshing change to the status quo of pop/rock music. Maroon 5 is an awesome band. I look forward to their new releases to come.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Brad Paisley has always made good, cohesive, filler-free albums, and this is no exception. In fact, there's only ONE song I'm not crazy about. The other 14 or so are SO GOOD, that this CD has not come out of my player since I got it two weeks ago!<br /><br />Nowhere in country music will you find someone as talented at singing, guitar playing, and songwriting as Paisley. He makes everything seem effortless, which allows for a very enjoyable album. Start to finish, it's the best album release this year.<br /><br />Some of the highlights are the singles (or obvious future singles) \\"Ticks\\", \\"Online\\", \\"I'm Still a Guy\\", and \\"All I wanted was a Car\\". I have to say, however, that my favorites are the more powerful ballads like \\"It Did\\" and the outstanding \\"With You, Without You\\" (which includes a two minute guitar masterpiece at the end). The lyrics in this song will make you misty eyed, no doubt.<br /><br />It's true that \\"Oh Love\\" could've been much more of a song, but it's still good. And the Kung Pao Buckaroos skit is wearing very thin in my eyes, but the collaboration on \\"Bigger Fish to Fry\\" is an outstanding display of talent. It's especially fun to hear how good Paisley's voice is compared to everyone else's.<br /><br />I can't rant enough about this album. Brad has always made strong, consistently fun and thoughtful albums, and this is no exception. Don't hesitate to pick it up!
0393327655|5.0|I'm no intellectual, which is probably why it took me so long to read (and most important, understand) this amazing treatise, notes and all, but wow, it was worth the effort!  I finally found someone who has articulated what's been churning within my mind and heart for decades, particularly with regard to the devastating impact religious moderates have unwittingly inflicted upon humankind.    Harris has provided me with a name for my philosophy:  ethical realism.  I didn't know that this was my philosophy until I read \\"The End of Faith.\\"      For those who seek a deeper understanding of life that religions are incapable of providing, I recommend this book without hesitation.  Far from being just another anti-religion rant, Sam Harris' book reveals the dangers to our species should too many of us continue to cling to unexamined beliefs that mock reason and deify ignorance.
B000E994KE|5.0|I've been listening to these guys for like ten years and this may be the best thing they've done. This is one of the best albums I've heard in a while.    All Songs great. All songs melodic.    No easy thus great Album. They succeed..
B0000CFW87|4.0|Josh Groban is such a wonderful and soothing artist. If you are in need of meditative 'deliciousness' buy this album!
1582701709|4.0|I found the book to be very thought provoking and somewhat like a sales presentation for a condominium or vacation resort. I am sure that a posative attitude can be a powerful tool, but am sceptical of the mind over matter approach to success.
B000077VR3|5.0|Nicole Kidman has never looked lovelier and Ewan MacGregor has never seemed purer of heart in this imaginative, touching, visually-explosive production from 2001. Some have cited Bollywood's influence on this musical, all I know is this is a brave, quirky movie that works to perfection and tells a story only someone dead of soul could fail to fall for. Set in 1890's Paris and told in flashback (as with 1999's American Beauty, within moments you soon forget you are seeing a flashback and almost discard the fact you are watching a great tragedy unfold) Moulin Rouge imparts its love story between a beautiful showgirl and innocent writer, and does it among some of the most intense sights and sounds ever caught on film. And the soundtrack, which mingles modern music with tunes from the past, has to be heard to be believed. The cast---both the characters and the modern actors who portray them---is terrific, and director Baz Luhrmann pulls few punches in bringing life to this eccentric story of truth, beauty, freedom, and love. Moulin Rouge is a movie everyone who is anyone will probably want to see at some point, and it has never looked better than in this widescreen DVD release.
0316067598|5.0|In this day and age of selfish indulgences and self interest, it is refreshing to see men willing to serve their country with honor and dedication.     I enjoyed this book.     The writing is not the best, but I gave it five stars because the story was well worth reading.    Thank God for LOKHAY.     Thank you for your service and willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice. HooYah!
B000LAZDQA|4.0|Shortbus follows the dysfunctional relationships of several 20-30 something couples whose stories intertwine at the offbeat erotic club, Shortbus.  I found myself able to relate to each relationship in one way or another and felt quite connected to the characters.  The film combines love, humor, a fantastic soundtrack, and, of course, sex (of all kinds, with all genders) to truly show how beautiful all relationships can be, with all the struggles and obstacles that come along with them.  I saw the film, initially, because I am a huge Hedwig and the Angry Inch fan and I wanted to see what John Cameron Mitchell would come up with in this film.  Shortbus was a clear demonstration of John Cameron Mitchell's range and talent as a writer/director.  Shortbus and Hedwig have little in common, but the complexity and emotional variety of characters and relationships in each are very evident.  All in all, I definitely recommend this film for the open-minded movie-goer.  This film is not for children.  Or conservatives.
1594489505|5.0|Wow, what can I say? I loved The Kite Runner and hoped that this book would be good as well. It was amazing! I couldn't put it down and didn't stop reading until I finished it. Dr. Hosseini is a very gifted author with amazing insights into the lives of women in Afghanistan. You won't be disappointed by his second effort. By the way, the veil women wear is a chaderi, not a burqa. Why did Afghans let the media's use of burqa erase the word chaderi?

B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi Carlile has a unique sound and I must admit that I wasn't sure I liked her at first.  But a friend encouraged me to listen to \\"The Story\\" more closely.  After hearing it a few times, I fell in love.  Later, I heard \\"Turpentine\\" on Grey's Anatomy... wow!  I bought the cd and am totally addicted.  It stays in my car because I listen to it regularly.  One of my all-time favorite songs is \\"Wasted\\".
B000LC4CVA|5.0|We saw Celtic Woman on public brodcasting one night and loved them. So I bought it on Amazon.com and recieved the DVD in about 2-3 days. My 4 year old granddaughter saw the DVD and has to watch it everytime she comes over (quite often). She knows all the girls names, and has her favorite songs (all of them.) The girls voices are amazing. We would love to see them live at a concert. The DVD is wonderful. If you love rich, beautiful voices and a fablous orchestra with a varity of music, this is a fabulous DVD.
B000BT97AO|3.0|Ok, I can't blame the seller too much for this one however, it took almost two weeks before I was scheduled to receive the item.  The real problem came when I had not received the movie before I had to move and so since I have a change of address to a new state, I have still yet to receive the item and it is approaching a month.  Now like I said I can not blame the seller for myself having to move or for any issues the postal service had, but I am used to receiving my orders within about a week.  So take from this what you will...
B000002WUD|5.0|Those who say that Elvis was no longer relavant, or \\"setting the tone\\" for music in the 70's have forgotten the most obvious fact.  Elvis had already set the tone in the 50's, and all those who came after were products of that - like it or not.  So they were only following Elvis' lead when you say Elvis was out of the loop.  The boxed set is genius.  Elvis voice is soulful, powerful, and comes with a huge whollop.
0316067598|5.0|Today, we hear so much \\"news\\" on the war on terror that we become immune to what really goes on over there.  Marcus Luttrell is a real American hero.  He tells of his life-long desire to be a US Navy SEAL and how difficult and dedicated each and every US military person is to our country's mission.  Marcus covers his SEAL training in detail, which is interesting and very relevant to the challenges he faces once on the battlefield in Afghanistan.  If he were not a Navy SEAL, I am sure Marcus Luttrell would be a statistic today.    Through Marcus' first-person accounting, the reader gets a full dose of what life is like for American military personnel on the front lines; how political rhetoric influences the life-and-death decisions that combat troops must make in the field.  The reader also gets a first-hand accounting of how it is to fight an enemy who is elusive and unidentifiable; how the battle lines are drawn and change in small villages thousands of miles away.      Marcus Luttrell paints an accurate and moving picture of the young men and women who serve our country and are dedicated to winning the global war on terror in which the US is engaged today.  Make no mistake about it:  The USA is at war--and thank God we have people like Luttrell who are out there fighting and telling the true story of those who are making the supreme sacrifice so that every American can live in peace.  Luttrell wrote the book to honor the memory of his buddies who bravely died in combat while stalking a terrorist leader on his home grounds.    Lone Survivor is a first class piece of work and should be required reading for every American who enjoys the fruits of freedom in this country.  I liked the book because it tells the real story, and is not some sound-bite from the evening TV news.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|phillip glass is a genius.  when i saw the hours i was taken in by the soundtrack along the lives of these women and the music score kept taking me deeper and deeper into the complexities of their lives.  it was a journey i felt so captivated by that i just had to get the soundtrack and it's taken me years to find it.  phillip glass does haunting like no other
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Because of this album, I have become a compulsive Neil Young freak.  This is the CD that made me compulsive about the guy (and anyone he worked with).  Buy it.  NOW.      I have always liked Neil Young, but this album puts him in an entirely new light for me.  I used to think of him as a subpar Dylan -- nice tunes, distinctive homey voice, not as prolific.  All of that changed with Massey Hall's release.  It is mesmerizing.  The sound quality is truly audiophile -- how did they DO that?  The album is so good it forced me to study Neil and his art in depth.     Having studied his work now, I'd now put Neil Young on par with Lennon/McCartney, Bob Dylan and George Harrison as a singer-songwriter.  Most would disagree with me, but I would now put him even above Bob Dylan, for the simple reason that Neil Young has never lost a step in 40 years.  Even the \\"dark years\\" produced wonderful albums.  The songs here are simply stunning.  They will literally bring tears to your eyes.    The DVD is worth having because it has a few interesting interviews -- especially the one with the \\"Old Man.\\"
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Product was as promised. Excellent condition and great speed in delivery. Would definately do business with again.
B00004STDN|4.0|I am a sucker for Stallone movies and this one met my expectations. For one thing, the movie took place outside and we all got to see mountain climbing prowess of all the actors. The other important factor in this movie for me was that, there was a huge amount of money involved (of course that was stolen from the government) by a evil, twisted, John Lithgow-wow, can he act evil--even shoots his girlfriend in the head!!!<br />Anyway, movie is a climb to the top of a huge mountain to save climbing crew and money. A bit of cat and mouse chasing on the peak adds to the fun of the movie--(B)
0895260131|5.0|I have read this book and checked out his references.  Where are the inaccuracies or lies that some are reporting?  Read this book and check out his chapter notes, there is very little argument against his \\"facts\\" as presented.  The world needs to realize that Islam as a whole, is far from a \\"peaceful religion\\" as the media would have us believe.  It is a real threat and must be dealt with!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Don't worry: no matter what the title may imply, Modern Times is not Dylan attempting to update his music to fit current trends. He has yet to do that. Instead, Modern Times is for the most part a bluesy album: he even rewrites a few blues classics (\\"Rollin' and Tumblin\\" becomes, well... \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\"; \\"Someday Baby\\" is a slightly different \\"Trouble No More\\" with the \\"Hip Shake\\"/\\"La Grange\\" riff, and \\"Levee's Gonna Break\\" is little more than a rewrite of \\"When the Levee Breaks\\"). \\"Rollin'\\" is energetic, but it's also probably the weakest moment on a generally strong record - original blues songs like the wrenching \\"Workingman's Blues #2\\" and hard-rockin' \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" (love the guitar solo!) are the two indisputable highlights, and they're perfectly contrasted by jazzy country-blueses such as \\"Spirit on the Water\\", \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" and \\"When the Deal Goes Down\\". The country songs here are all among the greatest Dylan ever did in the genre, though to be fair none of them are \\"Lay, Lady, Lay\\" - \\"Horizon\\" is a bit too long, but only by about a minute or so. And while Dylan's melodies are normally nothing worth getting excited about, I love the melody (and the lyrics, and everything else) found on \\"Nettie Moore\\". In fact, I think \\"Nettie Moore\\" is my favorite song on this album - it hasn't gotten the hype of songs like \\"Thunder on the Water\\", \\"Workingman's Blues #2\\" or \\"Spirit on the Water\\", but it's a fabulous folk song and I will definitely stick up for it. Give it ten years; this'll be one of Dylan's classic songs. You see if it isn't. Oh yeah, and \\"Ain't Talkin'\\" has the best lyrics found on this album. And I really like the song's dark, doomy atmosphere too, with the violins and such. Plenty of albums by awful artists came out in 2006, and it's nice to hear Dylan (who's twice the age of most members of My Chemical Romance - third behind the Eagles and Green Day as the band I unnecessarily insult the most in my reviews, by the way) showing them all up. This is his best in a very long time.hem all up. This is his best in a very long time.
0871137380|5.0|Let me incorporate, by reference the many well earned accolades of the other reviews. This is an exceptional book and deserves the praise. However, there are some limitations.     The first is that two men watching the same person do nothing more than walk down the street may have perceptions of the event that would make it appear that they observed two different events, the second is that some of the intimate observations of those who fought there may have been reserved during interviews and the third is that Bowden may have received some politically correct guidance from above. Finally there is something enlightening in the unedited words of some of the experienced participants.     MSG Howe, a legend in the Special Forces community wrote an excellent book , Leadership and Training For the Fight. Deliberately misses the well edited polish as he uses presents personal combat experience to illustrate the key subjects he is discussing. Much of the action is on the ground as a participant in what became knows as Blackhawk Down.  Howe discusses the critical differences in between the Rangers and Special Forces as they fought together.  The second additional reference are the two books by Durant, In The Company of Heroes and Night Stalkers.     One of the messages of the other books on the subject which directly conflicts with the conclusions of Blackhawk Down is the impact of the removal of the AC-130's from the area had on the operation. The theater commander was denied the AC-130 gunships and American armor.  Bowden repeats the Washington spin that the gunships would have been ineffective in the urban environment. However, Durant notes the huge psych impact when the gunships were returned to the fight a fee days later, while he was still held prisoner. It is further reported that the Secy of Defense came down to the SF camp once they were home to apologize for the removal of the gunships and soften the blow that there would be no formal after action report.     The performance of the gunships in several firefights in Afghanistan clearly demonstrated that they could work very closely with troops on the ground who were vastly outnumbered and fighting for survival within stone throwing distance. There also no doubt that the Little Birds and gunships could have been used together.     Durant and Howe provide the framework to understand the tactics and mission of those on the ground and in the air on those fateful days.     All three books leave the reader stunned at the quality, dedication and effectiveness of those who serve our country.
B000050FEN|1.0|I loved this movie, and spent the extra money to get the special edition. So what do I get when I finally open it. NO commentary. NO making of featurette. NO interviews. There are only a few deleted scenes, probably less than five minutes worth; some technical featurette about the opening that was boring and maybe seven minutes long; and an allegedly alternate ending, that to my eye, looked the same as the theatrical ending shot-for-shot.  Save yourself some scratch and buy the single disc for half the price.
B00005JPLW|2.0|Ok, first to justify TWO stars:  the CGI effects were pretty cool and the sepia tones were a nice 'historical' touch.    Now, I'm all for artistic license but I felt seriously BUSHwhacked by this movie.  I'm a fan of Greek/Roman history as a grown-up replacement for my Dungeons&Dragons youth and I expected to maintain a suspension of disbelief in the qualities of the hero such as in Gladiator or a Die Hard movie.  I hadn't read the graphic novel '300' (in fact ANY graphic novel since I was 16).    My first gripe is admittedly the break from history, but I admit 300 bronze clad Greeks holding off 200,000 half-naked dudes with wicker shields would not quite instill the heroic stance of the fight scenes, though in reality the Spartans are nonetheless heroes for defending their homeland from Persian expansion.  I suppose I was taken aback when the Persians ended up having a bunch of monsters - not that I'm against monster movies per se' - but it's sorta the disconnect of sitting down to watch a movie on the revolutionary war and then the red-coats turn into zombies.  There's a context shift I wasn't prepared for and never quite got over.    My second gripe (and I don't know if this is in the graphic novel) was the political/sociological brow-beating.  Now I realize the movie need not get into the fact that Sparta was in reality a theologically-based monarchy and that part of the intense social engineering of Sparta was to create homosexual pair-bonds between each of the men in 10,000.  But the fact that Gerard actually makes a reference to the 'boy lovers' in Athens and chats-up the defense of democracy, for which he's apparently fighting is humorously off base.  The back-story on the senate not supporting the troops sounds like an oddly familiar theme and the Queen's (BTW, Sparta was ruled by a pair of Kings) dramatic \\"freedom isn't free\\" brought laughter and groans across the audience.    Lastly, this movie depended too much on CGI with not a lot of plot depth or acting (compared to Gladiator or Troy where they had real people talking to each other most of the time).  My wife said Saturday Night Live should do a skit of '300' where they speak with clenched teeth the entire skit, asking about whether they're on the Atkin's diet and what do they think about the tai bo workout.    Like I said, it seemed like a Bush propaganda film held together with (admittedly beautiful) CGI-candy.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|The book was beautiful and sad. It felt like you were reading this girl's diary of her innermost thoughts and emotions. The end was perfect. I highly recommend this book.
6305657947|5.0|There are plenty of Thomas Crowns in the world; maybe not all as rich as the title character, but just as clever at the \\"game of life\\" - and lonely - as a consequence of their insight and talents.    This film does an excellent job of highlighting the frustrations of \\"self made men\\" when it comes to finding trust, happiness, and expressing themselves to women, and society at large.    Anyone who knows the feeling of being \\"alone in a crowded room\\" will find this movie to be a beacon that there is hope out there.    The soundtrack is bangin' too!
B000MR9D5E|4.0|Great series, but this version with David Attenborough narrating is much harder to hear than the US TV version with Sigourney Weaver. Music overwhelm's David's softer voice at times (I have English parents, so it isn't the accent getting in the way, either).    Anyway, even my teenagers sit down with their friends to watch this from time to time., which has to mean something.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|From the opening melody of \\"Either Way\\" to the gorgeous outro of \\"On and On and On,\\" Wilco succeeds in creating a cohesive, moody atmosphere that could best be described as mellow groove.  At various times the listener will detect hints of the Grateful Dead, the Eagles and even Fleetwood Mac, but Wilco also manages to elevate themselves beyond those 70's influences and create a classic rock/alternative album all their own.  And that is largely due to the words and phrasing of Jeff Tweedy.  I won't say that his meaning is always clear, but the words make you listen and draw you in closer, and like the best poetry, are vague enough to allow your own interpretation.  I have my own relationship to the words and sounds on this album, and I thank Wilco for helping me feel something that is at once familiar and entirely revolutionary.
0895260131|1.0|Spencer, in his denoucement of Islam, is guilty of the same manipulation that terrorist organizations use to propagate their message of hatred.  Perhaps the only talent of note he possesses is his ability to find exceptions to history and religion to prove his fundamentalist points.  He claims that Islam demands that believers kill the non-believer where ever he is found, and granted, this is present in the Islamic record.  However, such rare claims are abrogated in number and Shariah-based procedure in claiming that there should be no compulsion in religion, Qur'an 2:256.      As for another claim that Islam is at its core a religion of anti-Semites, one should recall (or in Spencer's case, learn in the first place) that Muhammad did marry a Jew, and when his other wives (polygamy being an economic necessity for women in 7th century Arabia) mocked her for this, he reminded her of her place as a relative of several great prophets, not just one.  Granted, the Prophet did order the expulsion of two Medinan Jewish tribes and the execution of a third, but these actions occured after all three had plotted with the Meccans against the Muslims.  Jewish tribes in Medina that maintained their treaty obligations with the Muslims (which included the right to live under their own religious laws excepting cases when the entire multi-faith community was under attack, when Muhammad was agreed upon as the leader) continued to flourish, as did Jews in Islamic lands for centuries.  Indeed, a detail many in Spencer's camp would miss is that upon the reconquest of Iberia in 1492, the Ottoman Sultan welcomed both Jews and Muslims to his lands, creating the modern Sephardic Jewish community.    Frankly, Spencer's work should be viewed as partially anti-Islamic; it is certainly more anti-Western in its qualities.  Its rejection of a foreign culture demonstrate a complete lack of respect for the ideals of openness and truth that undermine the very pillars that Western civilization rests upon. Additionally, such a work is not only a danger to Western heritage, but also to Western lives, as its demonstration of the ignorance and contempt of some members of Western society for Islam provide the perfect recruiting tool for groups such as al-Qaeda.  Thanks to Spencer, fundamentalist organizations now have supposed Western hatred for Islam in writing.
0452287588|5.0|I have read many books on enlightenment and did not really understand until this book. This book is written in such a way that you easily \\"get it\\". Tolle is free of ego and seems full of compassion in his writings. This book has changed my life.
B000OVLBEY|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie to watch. There is a lot of action with motorcycle stunts and special effects. Nicholas Cage brings the character of the Ghost Rider to life. Just a great movie all the way round!!
074356619X|1.0|Your baby die from drowning? You attracted it. Want to become the next Bill gates? Just wish for it. A tad simplified but not all that much. This is the same old \\"as you think so shall you get to consume\\" business. Personally, only action, not wishing, ever got me anything. One action I'd take if I could would be to return this waste of money and time. Give us all a break from hucksters.
B00000DFSK|4.0|I knew about half the songs on the album when I bought it. Now I know and like most of them. I'd definitely buy it again.
0743289684|5.0|I believe Ayaan would have been utterly content to be an average person in a decent world.  This world, however, has forced her into the exceptional.  And she has had the luck, the instinct and the strength to find her way; she hasn't gone looking for a fight, she just won't back down.  She claims her story is not about her, and it's not.  It's about what we have to do to create and maintain a free, rational society in this changing world.  It seems, apparently, that we must sometimes put some effort into it.  That said, her own story is beyond compelling AND well written.  It's an honor to have her in America.  (Hillary or Barack will be needing an ambassador to the U.N. soon, won't they?)
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor contains great story elements.  It is historically accurate and well-balanced between the tragic, intimate, love story and the horrific world conflict.  Bay's version far exceeds Midway in its evocative exegesis.
1596912855|5.0|I've read the other reviews already posted here, and I understand what some people are saying about character development and predictability.  But, for anyone who's a huge fan of Jane Austen (like me!), this book scratches that Jane Austen itch.  I found it very hard to put down (just like Pride and Prejudice), and I thought the ending was very satisfying.    Another point to remember is that since most of the male characters are \\"acting,\\" character development is limited to when you discover the real people behind the acts.  For those who complained about lack of character development, I'm not sure how well any author could describe characters when the majority of the book takes place in a fantasy world, where no one (except the heroine) is acting like themselves.    Bottom line:  If you're a fan of Jane Austen's books and/or the movie/mini-series adaptations, I think you will enjoy this book immensely.
B00008QSAA|5.0|One of my favourite live rock albums featuring a blistering version of their classic tune Nantucket Sleighride featuring awesome guitar work from big Leslie and pulsating bass from Felix (who really had that Jack Bruce sound) and that reliable powerhouse drumming of Corky. Steve never had much of his keyboards heard over the other three belters but does give glimpses of the lighter side on most Mountain albums. Could have been longer, but great album that must be played LOUD!
B00007L4OM|4.0|Read Cookieman108s review, he says it better than I could. This movie blew me away. I found the movie full of action and comedy. Although not being a fan of foreign films regularly, Jean Reno and Luc Besson are obviously a winning combination. I had seen \\"The Professional\\" years ago, but I hadn't paid much attention to the other movies these two collaborated on. My mistake which I'm correcting. Suffice it to say I will now buy anything the two of them have made. I must say though you probably won't go wrong with anything Reno is in. I caught \\"The Crimson Rivers\\" last night and it was an excellent murder mystery. If you enjoy action movies like \\"The Transporter\\" with some comedy thrown in I think you will like \\"Wasabi\\". I watched the dubbed version and although other voices sounded a bit odd, Reno's voice sounded like his own to me. Next time I'm going to watch it with the foreign voices and subtitles. Be sure to catch Reno in \\"The Visitors\\". I bought \\"Wasabi\\" right after I rented it. It was like a cross between a \\"Lethal Weapon\\" and \\"Pink Panther\\" movie. Very entertaining as Reno as a cop finds out his love from twenty years ago has died and named him the will executor. When he gets into trouble at the airport he is saved by a friend that he worked with in coutner-intelligence twenty years ago. Then on arrival in Japan he finds out his love not only left him her millions but a daughter as well that is being followed by the Japanese mafia. What transpires is excellent drama, action, and comedy. I highly recommend it.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is  amazing, captivating and awesome coverage of the most out-of-the way parts of our earth.  Don't miss it- you will see things that few of us even knew existed.  The coverage of caves is unbelieveable.  The divers in our group of viewers were saying \\"oh no,  OH NO,  ohhh\\"!  We haven't watched the last cd yet-  but know it will be just as great!
B000069KE0|5.0|I saw Chicago perform at a FREE outdoor concert on the campus of American University in Washington,DC Back in 1972(I was a freshman at cross-town Howard University).  They were absolutely FANTASTIC!!! I already had this album, but hearing them perform it live was just awesome.  i couldn't believe they sounded like that outdoors!!! I just got the CD of this album today, and it was like being at that concert all over again.  I know I'll be playing this over and over!!!

B00065MDSQ|5.0|King Crimson made good records throughout the late 60's and through the 70's. This is their best record in my opinion. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B0001US8EO|4.0|I won't go into detail of either film since others have already done that.  In every way Wyatt Earp is far more historically accurate.  Although I'm no Costner fan I thought he did a fairly good job  as well as the rest of the cast, Dennis Quaid was very good.   History is usually less exciting than hollywood would have us think.   Val Kilmore's \\"Doc\\" was over the top for me, especially when he fired 3 shots in   succession from a double barrel shot gun , \\"happens alot in westerns\\".   If you want snappy dialog with a bunch of \\"pretty people\\" go with Tombstone.    If you want the grimness and a more accurate portrayal  of the life and events of Wyatt Earp then choose, well... you know.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Planet Earth on HD DVD has absolutely stunning images. This series is a must have for any Highdef fan. Planet Earth will impress all your friends and is definitely demo material for PQ.
B000LC4TJ0|5.0|After reading some of the critical comments about this performance, I was prepared for really really slow music.  But those who hesitate buying the DVD because they fear Harnoncourt conducts in slow motion can relax.  It's a fine performance with a wonderful cast and a conductor who makes a strong case for a somewhat darker approach.  He is not treating it as a light comedy.  It's on the slow side, but nowhere near what you might guess after reading some reviews from people listening with a stopwatch in their hand.  And the slower (not slow!) pace has its merits.  You will hear things you have never heard before because they usually fall by the wayside.  If you don't like the director's concept or the conductor's approach, buy one of the other 50 Nozze-DVDs out there.  I am sure there is one for every taste by now...
055358894X|5.0|If you travel to the canal city of Cammorra, be warned it's a city thick with thieves and gangs. And the cleverest of them all is Locke Lamorra and the Gentleman Bastards, but their schemes go very badly array when the mysterious Gray King and his sorceries companion move in on the ruling crime boss.     The Lies of Locke Lamorra is one of the best and most unique fantasy stories I've read. It's grand swashbuckling tale of adventure and revenge. For once believe the blurbs, because they are all true this time.     Think Thieves' World in Venice with Don Corleone as boss of the crime syndicate, Farhd and the Grey Mouser as the resident trouble-makers.
B000NA1OXY|2.0|\\"Yikes\\" is the first word that comes to mind when I try to describe this album.  It's not an entirely bad thing to say, but it's certainly not good.  To be honest, I must've been living in a hole because I didn't realize Avril had a new album out until a few weeks ago when I saw The Best Damn Thing used in a local cd store.  I bought it based on her previous two releases, Let Go and Under My Skin, both of which I enjoyed.  Imagine my distaste when I heard \\"Girlfriend\\" upon putting the cd into my stereo.  I had heard parts of that song before.  The parts where I couldn't get to the radio fast enough to change the station, that is.  I didn't realize until that moment that it was Avril Lavigne.  I forced myself to listen to the entire song, which reminded me so much of the horror that has become Gwen Stefani.  The Best Damn Thing certainly seems like a huge step backwards for Avril.  Let Go was a decent debut album.  Under My Skin was a worthy follow up that showed that she was maturing as a songwriter and artist.  I was relieved to discover that Avril decided to purposely create a frivolous album that was meant to be fun.  So let her have her fun.  I just hope that the next album puts her back on her previous track.  There are a few good tracks on the album.  \\"Keep Holding On\\" is one song that do enjoy.  But in the meantime, I can't see myself listening to 3/4ths of this album without wincing.
B00005JLEU|4.0|A hidden Disney treasure that didn't get much press. A wonderful story and excellant animation in the Japanese style of Anime. Totally swept me away and I am thrilled to own it and be able to watch it when ever and where ever. There are some slow parts in the plot, but overall its a very touching story. Definately tempts me to try more Anime by the same director.
0767020308|5.0|I am very pleased with this version of Emma.  I am thinking Jane Austin herself would be proud that so much of the original dialog was used. The story followed true to the book much more than I have seen in any other Emma reproduction.  If you loved reading Emma (which I believe is Jane's masterpiece), then this will make you smile all the way through it.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I bought this at the beginning of June, but hadn't given it a good listen because I had a house guest who doesn't like Linkin Park (her loss). So I had to wait to get into the zone where I could be by myself and really listen to the album.    Anyway, as I listen back now, I think Minutes To Midnight is great. It's different than the previous albums, and in some ways comes across as \\"softer\\" but no less LP. I love Chester's voice, and he proves that he can sing and not just scream or growl. Plus, the band is stretching their musical chops and showing that they are a true band and not just a collection of raps and samples. Huge props to Phoenix from one bass player to another. He's an inspiration.    Others have lamented the loss of Mike in his MC role.  It's true that he's one of the best, but perhaps Mike is changing and growing, too, particularly in becoming a producer and someone who controls the band's direction.    My one worry about the band is actually for Mr. Hahn because his role is the most obviously reduced one, and it would be a shame for him to be phased out.  All members of LP are important.    But back to the music...  Like their previous studio album, Meteora, this is one of those where I can put the album on and let the whole thing go without skipping a track. It works as an album in a way that lots of other music I've heard lately doesn't. This is not a single bad song on here in my opinion.  Some stand out tracks for me worth mentioning are:    \\"Bleed It Out\\"--you can tell just by listening that the band had fun doing this one (also backed up in the liner notes, but on this one you don't need the liner notes to tell you). Sounds like a rave on the corner by a hydrant or something.    \\"In Between\\"--Mike Shinoda sings and sounds amazing doing it. The track starts in a way similar to Neil Finn's \\"Souvenir\\". I've always loved that Neil song (no matter how people object to the content/idea of the song), so that's a win in my book.    \\"Shadow Of The Day\\"--It could have been a very boring song, but it isn't and much of that is because of the pulse and energy in the bass. This one has a feel that reminds me of \\"With Or Without You\\" by U2. It has other sounds in it that seem very 80s, and yet the song doesn't feel 80s itself.    \\"In Pieces\\"--traces of ska, LP style. I kid you not! More than that, they do it well and on their own terms. It's one of those \\"if you squint\\" (with your ears) things, but it is there.    \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" In some ways this is the most surprising of songs from LP because it is mostly a voice with an acoustic guitar. The ending totally sells this one, though, because the song is lyrically simple, but the end layers distinct 3 voice parts over each other (2 with lyrics, one wordless, all effective). It actually reminded me of Led Zeppelin's \\"Battle of Evermore\\" because some of the turns in the voice reminding me of what John Paul Jones had done in that song as a counterpoint to Robert Plant.    In short, I love this album. It is definitely in my personal top 5 of albums released in 2007.
0743455967|5.0|I am normally not a fan of Stephen King. This book was REALLY helpful though. It teaches in a very natural way. It forces you to want to write...not plan on writing like other books on writing.
B00008MLSH|5.0|If you like opera, if you like the lyric soprano, if the vocal range of the colortura causes goose bumps to rise, Anna Netrebko is a must.  Roberta Peters, Beverly Sills, Anna Moffo, Joan Southerland, Maria Callas, she takes a back seat to none of them,she sits he front seat with the best of them and guess what?  She is beautiful too.
1594489505|5.0|Once I began reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  Not only was the story compelling, it was a wonderful lesson on the conditions in Afghanistan.  We see news reports, but often don't think of the people as having feelings and desires.  This book gave me a greater appreciation of the freedom that I tend to take for granted.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series by HBO, goes right to the heart of the matter. Americans from all walks of life, but of like mind, are tossed together to get a job done. They go through Hell And High Water To learn to Do So. In the process they learn what every American fighting man learns...the metamorphosis from a group of individuals into a family unit that will die to protect each other is a magical one, caused by the knowledge and expertise of the NCOs who lead them.  The NCOs are the backbone of ANY militaty Organization.  Officers are superflous.  Good Story, Good writing, good Job.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Excellent movie. Accurate and professional performances. If you like the idea of escaping from the grind. Finding your real self. Becoming a real person.

0316018953|5.0|This book is a light version of the other Harry Bosch novels, but it is still pure Harry Bosch. The story moves quickly and steadily, with no pages of dead material to plod through on the way to the conclusion. If you like this one, you will also enjoy the other Harry Bosch books, where the characters and story have a little more meat on the bones.

B000OQF6N6|2.0|This is hardly a SP record...it really an example of Billy Corgan learning marketing.  His previous projects, Zwan and his solo alubm (both of which featured Jimmy Chamberlain at some point) failed commericially and alienated his fans.....this is really the equal of Pink Floyd's FINAL CUT (which really was a Waters solo venture)...it just that floyd didn't rip fans off by pushing 7 (yes seven) different \\"versions\\" of the album.    Overall, BC doesn't know if he wants to be heavy, political or loving...it just doesn't mesh well as a whole.  With one or two good tracks (the best is the 10 minute epic UNITED STATES which sounds very Machina-era like), this doesn't have much to offer....nostalgia is nice...but this kills the love.
0316067598|5.0|Incredible story of heroism, patriotism and courage. These men will never be forgotten. Marcus is an honorable man who felt a great need to tell his story, and I am grateful that he shared the experience of his comrades during the battle for their lives. I understand so much more about the fighting in Afghanistan. It's a harsh and unforgiving environment where one doesn't know who is enemy or friend. These men are so brave. I don't think I could ever properly express my thanks for their service to the United States. God Bless you all.
1932100660|1.0|I didn't read all the discussions, but the ones I did read were so far from credible intellectual discourse, I wouldn't consider any of them helpful.  It was more like a political debate, and trying to segregate the \\"facts\\" from the \\"fracts\\" was so tiring I gave up in disgust.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Reviews in the future!
B00000AOUD|5.0|As an undying fan of the rock opera, my tastes rank the top three in the following order: Genesis, \\"Lamb\\"; Tull, \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and The Who, \\"Tommy\\".  Coincidentally, few other rock opera exist unless you include Elton John's \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" and The Beatles' \\"Sergeant Pepper\\".  However, I am not completely convinced that a fine line cannot be drawn between what is a collection of songs having a common theme, hence an album, versus a long piece of music that tells a story as is the case with \\"Lamb\\" and \\"Tommy\\". The question I have, then, is: Given that \\"Thick as a Brick\\" is one very long song covering both sides of an LP, does that necessarily qualify it as rock opera? On the CD, Tull comments on the work and clarifies the confusion somewhat by comparing \\"Thick\\" as a followup to \\"Aqualung\\" as a concept album. I doubt that anyone who has listened to \\"Aqualung\\" would fail to understand a story is being told there, but with \\"Thick as a Brick\\", is there really a story to it?  Yes, there's a progression in how heirs to lands and title \\"renew the age-old purpose\\", but a story?  I have to believe Ian when he tongue-in-cheek explains how the band spoofed the media into thinking at the time the album was made that the lyrics were written by a 12-year old boy. That is not to say the the lyrics are stupid, by no means!  If they had been written by a 12-year old, I would certainly guess the kid to be a genius. But, my question is: Does \\"Thick as a Brick\\" tell a story that would qualify it as rock opera? Though, my logical sense says no, my musical sense revels in the marching band cadences, the beautifully constructed acoustic guitar-flute melodies and the way all the pieces mesh. It is truly a rock opera for the ages, whether there's a story to it or not.  I love this album!  Always have, always will.
0974872407|1.0|This is the emperor's new clothers of recent book successes. Its appeal is the same lazy, infantilising escapism that has driven many adults to reading trash like Harry Potter with herd-like conformism. The writing is stale, even when describing the drearily fantastical, and shows a Disneyfied Barcelona akin to the London of Mary Poppins. My toes curl when I hear intelligent people gush praise over this schlock.    Of course, as with all negative reviews on Amazon, this one will be judged \\"unhelpful\\" by those wishing to confirm their conformist hunch. But I hope a few among you won't waste your precious life with this cartoonish pap when the masterpieces of the Spanish-language canon sit unopened on your shelves, or are just a click away on Amazon.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen the versions of Jane Eyre with George C. Scott, Timothy Dalton, William Hurt, and now Toby Stephens as Mr. Rochester.  I must say I liked the Toby Stephens version the best, though I have enjoyed watching all versions and seeing the actors take on such as classic story. I believe I liked this one the best (but Timothy Dalton comes very close) because Toby Stephens took a mysterious eccentric from a gothic novel and made him a truly sympathetic character, and played in every way to be a true temptation to Jane. Ruth Wilson deserves kudos as well for her portrayal - she seemed more like my idea of what Jane would look and act like than any other I have seen. I like that the characters of Jane and Rochester were played as real people, involved in the struggle of being in love with each other with so many obstacles barring the way -  the lunatic wife being only one of them, their differing social classes and the numerous implications of that creating others.  However, it's not only the honesty of the passion that I found so refreshing.  I think this version took more trouble to try to let the viewer understand the characters in general more three-dimensionally.  Mrs. Fairfax, Aunt Reed, Blanche Ingram, St. John, etc. were shown more as living people with their own concerns than as props.  If you are a fan of Jane Eyre, don't miss this one!
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Laughed out loud the whole way through, and made me want to join the MOD Squad!
B00005JPKE|4.0|This movie told a story, it was therefore kept ontrack and couldnt really crank it up. A war movie factual account with some licence to spread its wings. Quite dark visually and a bit stop go. Difficult story to tell in some ways I suppose and overall CE did a good job. May need to see it again to pick it up in more detail but no burning desire to do so which I think sums up how it left me.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Personally I haven't heard an album of this quality in a long time. The last albums to do that for me were Nirvana Unplugged and Elliot Smith XO. The music really stays with you. It is refreshing to hear something so melodic and sad and uplifting, all at the same time. They created something special with this album. Songs 1,3,8 and 9 are classics. The whole album is strong start to finish.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Not my thing at all, found it messy, misjointed and as movies are really about being entertained from the comfort of something like a Layzboy, this was hard work to the point I turned it off and pulled the cork out of a bottle of wine and called it a night.
B000PTYP7U|5.0|This is an excellent cd. They combine a lot of different styles to create well balanced tracks. There's not a bad song on the cd
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I started the Alias series this summer and I was hooked after watching the first couple of episodes! I chose to watch Alias because I am a fan of LOST and I was curious to see more work done by JJ Abrams (Alias Series Creator and LOST Co-executive Producer).  Well I was not disappointed.  JJ and the writers of Alias keep you entertained with great character development and plot twists that will always surprise you. You have to watch with some \\"faith\\" because the number of times these secret agents avoid death makes the story lines a bit predictable.  But, if you are a lover of spy thrillers, this series is well done and fun to watch. Not to mention Jennifer Garner's wonderful performances as Sydney Bristow, she helps to keep you watching. Also, Victor Garber, also is great fun to watch, he plays Sydney's CIA father without a hitch - I looked forward to watching him act.  The price tag shouldn't scare you, the individual cost for all five series is greater than this box set.  Plus you get a few extra's, like a little book discussing the secrets of Alias (Spoiler caution, do not read the little book until you have seen all the episodes), and a there is special Rambaldi DVD found in a hidden compartment at the bottom of the box.
B000002513|5.0|This is a wonderful album, lots of energy, great songs and performances, before Bruce became famous.  I wish this album, as well as Springsteen's entire back catalog, would get a sonic upgrade for CD.  Long overdue.
1594489505|5.0|As with The Kite Runner,I could not put this book down. It is a great book. You will not be disappointed!
1594489505|5.0|You won't sleep well if you read this before bed. Engrossing story that makes you want to read, read, read. The author depicts a culture that is both foreign and familiar. The need for love and kindness transcends the cruelties of life. I loved the characters.
B000QFCD5O|5.0|How many times I've kicked myself since 1982 for not seeing Asia in concert when I had the chance!  How joyful I am today, a quarter century later, that I've seen them at last -- not once, but twice in less than a year!    \\"Fantasia\\" is nearly as good as being there.  Music quality on live albums is either good or bad, never in between.  Fortunately, this one delivers.  The talents of Geoff Downes, Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and (my favorite) John Wetton are clearly evident, both individually and collectively.  When you consider how long they've been at this business, well before Asia was formed, it's mighty impressive how they continue to bring considerable skill and enthusiasm to the stage.    It's also great to see them dig out examples of their individual earlier work, something they were pressured to shun in the '80s.  Asia isn't ELP, Yes or King Crimson, but there's a legacy in those bands that resonates in Asia's music, so those songs certainly weren't out of place.    In short, this is well worth buying, listening to and celebrating four very talented musicians and their considerable contributions to rock music.

1582701709|4.0|As a Substance Abuse counselor for teens, I will be using this book as a guide to run self-motivational groups. I think that our youth and children deserve the right to dream and truly believe.  I think that has been robbed from us as a society.  The more people believe in their selves the better society will become, and why not start with the youth!  Although, I do not feel as though we can change our destiny and that should not be overlooked, I think we can change our path towards love peace and happiness within ourselves.  It is important to take responsibilities for our actions but why not start with our inner thoughts . . . I was inspired by this book to continure motivating the youth, and I believe that it will work!
0316776963|5.0|I discovered this book over someone's shoulder on the subway, and after just a few pages I knew I had to buy it.  It's clever and witty, but there's enough substance to each anecdote that you don't suffocate from laughter.
B000CRQX34|4.0|We are enjoying this set.  The movie quality was great, the extras disc was good, too.  It has a sing along to the \\"Knights of Camelot\\" song that captioned the words and there were a few we hadn't figured out in all the years we have been watching the movie.  The third disc, though, is about \\"Spamalot\\" which was only OK - kind of a stretch in my opinion.  The quiz on the extras disc was pretty tough if you haven't seen the movie in a while, but we had fun competing for the most correct answers.  I would have preferred the 3rd disc to also be about the movie, but it was still a good value for Grail fans.
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|I believe that much of what is being put in the reviews for My December here and on other sites represent blogging-like attempts to either defend or crush Kelly on the new album.  They do not seem to be true attempts at conveying the feel of the album as a whole to a prospective buyer.<br /><br />If you are after the latest KC album because you support Kelly fully and wish to show her that support as she stretches to find her place, then this album is definitely for you.<br /><br />However, if you are after singable, 'hear it three times and find yourself humming along' songs that will stay with you years from now... well, it is just not there to be found.  If you buy it in this scenario, you will later regret it.<br /><br />The verdict will be handed over in time by the Radio world, and that verdict is not going to be a positive one for Kelly.  For the record, I am a huge fan of Breakaway, and Kelly had to really earn that purchase from me before entering my music collection.  Now that I am a fan I was looking forward to what she had in store this time, and on a personal level I am disappointed.  But I continue to give kudos to Kelly for what she is trying to do.  If she will weather the storm the failure of this album will bring - and it WILL lack success - then we will have even more to be excited about the NEXT time around.<br /><br />As for whether to buy the album or not?  Just decide which type of fan you are based on my previous statements.  And if you don't have BREAKAWAY yet, buy it now instead.  You will not be disappointed in the slightest.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Despite a script that has everything but the kitchen sink thrown in, Transamerica still manages to pull off the impossible.  On any given weekday, the characters in this film could be found on the Jerry Springer show and you would just be left shaking your head at the screen.  However, the strong performance given not only by Hoffman but the entire cast successfully draws you into this strange story.  I truely like this road trip much more than Little Miss Sunshine and am glad I took a chance in watching it.  Highly Recommeded.
033041836X|5.0|This book is awful. Really awful. Only because of what happened to her. The candid, detailed recollections she bravely shares with the world are appalling. This book made me much more aware of my surroundings and also made me realize that yes, your worst nightmare could come true. It could happen to anyone. I respect how open she was about what went through her mind during and after the rape and how she shares the horror she faced for many more years to come. Her memoir is breathless. It's like your best friend writing to you about what happened to her. She holds nothing back. I highly recommend this to all women.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Make no mistake about it, when it comes to rating Lynyrd Skynyrd's studio albums, their debut, [[ASIN:B00005RIKI Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd]] (1973) cannot be topped by any of the others.<br /><br />The album features the legendary Free Bird, which is the greatest song in the history of rock music (if you ask this southern reviewer), the anthem Simple Man, the lonely Tuesday's Gone and the honky tonk rocker Gimme Three Steps. Every one of these songs are in the top tier of rock n' roll classics.<br /><br />I Ain't The One and Poison Whiskey are street tough rockers with triple attack guitar excellence and Ronnie Van Zant's indomitable vocal performance. Mississippi Kid presents a short break from the southern rock with acoustic folk-blues. They get personal and political with the bluesy Things Goin' On.<br /><br />Have you ever been down in the ghetto?<br />Have you ever felt the cold wind blow?<br />If you don't know what I mean,<br />Won't you stand up and scream,<br />Because there are things goin' on that you don't know!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005RIKI Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd]] is a great classic southern rock album that includes some great music from a smart, street tough and talented band that has an extraordinary ability to emotionally connect with their loyal fans in a profound way.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Don't get excited.  It's not the first series.  Apparently some very young person at the BBC completely forgot about the first 25 or so years of the series.  You will not find Pertwee or Baker or even Davidson in this collection.  It's actually the new Dr. Who from 2005.  Lets call him... ... ...The New Millennial Dr. #1.<br /><br />Still, this Dr. is the best of them all.  Believe me, it takes a lot to make me switch my favorites!  But here we have what we all wanted Dr. Who to be about from the beginning.  Still the great, campy, well written stories, but now we have the technology to really make them shine.  It doesn't hurt that the new Dr. is good looking, young, and played by a consummate actor: Christopher Eccleston.
B00007J4SI|4.0|Michael Ponti is definitely a virtuoso, and it's pretty amazing that he played through the whole Scriabin catalog.  I felt that his tempos were a little all over the place.  His Etudes were kind of abrupt and rushed.  Overall I think his interpretations were pretty consistent, and overall he did a great job.   He's just not Horowitz or Richter.
0141439580|5.0|And I mean that in a good way. When the movie Clueless came out, I must have watched it a thousand times. Then, I read Emma and was delighted to find that my Clueless was actually based off of this book. The whole story is great and I am once again reminded that sometimes I am also not a good judge of a person's character!    It's a light, fun, Jane Austen read. I recommend it.
0810993139|4.0|This is a book that exists comfortably in the child's own world, seeing it from his or her perspective. It's mishievously funny, with  simplistically-drawn stick figure illustrations that might well have come from the child's own hand. This wryly-written diary of a \\"wimpy kid\\" deals with the quotidian existence of school, teachers and classmates that kids will readily  identify with. It's a perfect companion for the second or third grade child who can read - or  just starting to read - a full-length book. My eight-year-old grandson laughed out loud as he read it.
6304698798|5.0|If there a better western movie has ever been made, I've missed it.  I would praise \\"High Noon,\\" *The Ox Bow Incident,\\" \\"True Grit\\" \\"Lonesome Dove\\" (the TV mini-series)--but they don't measure up to this spaghetti western.  It is odd that Hollywood, with the West in the studios' back lots and plenty of real cowboys to choose from, couldn't make a movie as good as this one, directed by an Italian and shot in Andalucia Spain.<br /><br />The plot is episodic, but what episodes they are--Eli Wallach defending himself successfully while sitting in a bubble bath, Angel Eyes reporting to the man who hired him as a killer, a pointless Civil War battle over a bridge, etc., etc.  The plot finally settles on the attempt to recover some $200,000 in gold, buried in a cemetery.  One man knows the name of the cemetery, but not the grave.  The other knows the name on the grave marker, but not the location of the cemetery.  The finale is a work of art.<br /><br />The atmosphere is magnificent, the sparsest, dryest land this side of the Taklamakan Desert, miserable hovels, ramshackle towns, horse flies that buzz and land on faces, manure--in a word, reality--so real one can see and hear and almost smell it.<br /><br />The non-featured characters are perfect, many of whom were not actors at all, but Spanish and Italian peasants.  There is one actor with no legs, who crawls into a saloon and shouts, \\"Hand me down a whiskey.\\"  Hollywood would never have done that.  Clint Eastwood is fine but mostly silent; his six gun does  the talking for him.  Lee Van Cleef is likewise fine, an evil looking armed man with no conscience or pity.  But the real star is Eli Wallach, a little Mexican thief, liar, sadist, joker who is intent upon staying alive.  He should have received several Academy Awards for his performance--one wouldn't have sufficed.<br /><br />Most westerns are just horse chases and random gunplay, with maybe a song here and there.  The same old stories were told over and over.  Notso with this movie.  If anyone out there remotely likes westerns and hasn't seen \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\\" you're in for a rare pleasure.
B00005JPFC|5.0|Ratatouille is a movie Walt Disney would have been proud of, which I think is rare enough in today's animation industry. A delightful movie that adults and children can enjoys on different levels. (Indeed, I'm not sure the movie is for unsupervised kids- Explaining the difference between dear Remy, a rat that washes his paws before cooking, and real rats in the kitchen requires some Parental Guidance in my opinion.) The movie is packed with exciting and tender moment alike and Peter O'Tool as Antoine Ego delivers a speech to be remembered.
0140449337|3.0|I was excited to order the penguin classic as I now live in Japan and had left my prior copy in NY. However, I am not quite so happy with this new translation as I find it diluted for the masses and less meaningful.  Though Marcus Aurelius offers great wisdom the new translation offers the stoic cliches stated so colloquially that we've heard them all before.  Meditations are statements to be slowly chewed, savored and deeply thought about; while I feel the current translation offers Aurelius in a more ambiguous, predigested and less flavorful form. However, I'm a bit particular! A prior reviewer found this helpful in that it was easier to read.
B000002LQR|5.0|The person below me is an absolute ignorant a-hole. 311 has zero artistic value when in comparison with RHCP. Call me when 311 writes ANYTHING with the merit that even begins to touch \\"Under the Bridge.\\" Have you even heard of something called chord progression? because I'll tell you one thing, 311 sure hasn't.<br /><br />And I can't believe that you even have audacity to bring up lyrics. First of all, most of the songs are funk rock, Thusly, it's party music: i.e. Sir Psycho Sexy, which is brilliant in its own way. Secondly, the songs that do call for different lyrical composition come through in every which way. Are you seriosuly trying to tell me that 311 has a song more meaningful than \\"Power of Equality?\\" Do you even listen to the lyrics? I think not.<br /><br />Lyrical abilities aside, you must realize that you are basically taking Chad Smith, and extremely respected rock drummer, John Frusciante, hands down one of the greatest guitarists of all time, and Flea, (debatably)THE greatest rock bassist of all time, and saying that what many people believe is their greatest piece of work in BSSM, is garbage. I just hope you didn't listen one time and write that bull****. If so, your review is all the more less credible because you fail to realize one of the most key compenents to good music; the fact that it grows on you and it takes more than one listen. You just can't absorb it all in one take.<br /><br />I have nothing against 311, they're not a bad band. But it's hard to give you any respect when you rip a band like Nirvana at the end of your review. I understand you are entitled to your opinion, but you have to see that you are contradicting yourself when millions of people love BSSM and Nevermind and you just shut that down like you are some kind of all knowing god.<br /><br />Anyways, just to add some of my own opinion, this is my favorite album of all time and will always be. I feel like although the chili peppers have moved on and continue to make world class music they will never top what they did in 1991. Just too much emotion, attitude and musical ability when into that album. They went into it with something to prove and just ripped it up. I think Stadium Arcadium is definitely a step down for them. It's a great record but it lacks some of the artistic maerit that they had in their last four albums (minus OHM).what they did in 1991.

0783225547|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Thought it might fall into the 'running from a catastrophe' type movie, but found it to be very family oriented fun with characters that were pretty defined.     I did enjoy the explosive volcanic scenes very much but also loved the way mom/mayor Rachel Wando (played so well by Linda Hamilton), tried so hard to protect her kids.  This made the movie action packed but great family fun.      Pierce Brosnan & Linda Hamilton had good chemistry as well.    Sheryl (shersim3)
B0000DKMK0|5.0|Ive just recieved this product yesterday and its great from my piont of view, because its the uncut japanese edition and has more additional material than the american version. Its a little bit longer (maybe 2 or 3 min more than the theatrical version) and we see in color all the kill at the house of blue leaves!!!!!!!. And a last Tarantino touch: there is the scene when \\"The Bride\\" cut off the second arm of Sophie, maybe that doesnt make a lot of difference, but men its Kill Bill Vol. 1 one of my favourite movies of all time, and this I think is the edition where we can see it as Tarantino imagined it. By the way, this dvd just works if you have a Multi-region dvd player, if you have it and you are a Kill Bill fan buy it!!!!
B00011F5DK|5.0|I was introduced to this fantastic game by my sister in Wisconsin who had bought it to play with her grandsons.  Now I have it for my grandchildren, age 7 and 9.  They have learned to strategize their moves and have fun blocking each other in order to win.  It's compact, colorful, sturdy and will last a long time.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|Yes, this is a romance.  Ande a comedey.  So if you like romantic comedy, or the two protagonists, you will like it.  But the cinematogaphy and the costumes are beautiful, so it is also a periord piece of the most charming kind.  There is sensuality and one extremely short but intense scene of the act of sex, this being Casanova, after all. And finally, the writing--The Writing--is superb.  It is-----so clever and full of things that you will probably miss the first few times you see it.  I say few times, because I have lost count--more than 10--of the times I have watched it, and even this morning, I am picking up a phrase here and there which matters in the story.  I must admit that Heath Ledger is delightful to observe, but his assistant, \\"Lupo\\" and his guest/protege, Paprizzio, are both hysterical.  In particular, the relationship between Lupo and Casanova, beginning with their first scence alone together, sets the comic tone.  The many, many cases of mistaken identity would normally be tiresome, and I would generally stop watching for that reason.  But this one is a charmer.  You will feel good each time you watch. I HIGHLY recommend it.
1400064287|5.0|Think back to the last three presentations you attended.  What can you remember about them?  What were the key messages?    In a world cluttered with information, how do you create messages that are memorable?  This book shows you how.  I found the book easy to read, the authors are credible, the examples powerful and most importantly: the method is simple - even I can use it.    I don't often give books a rating of 5 but this one really deserves it.  I recommend it to anyone who wants their messages to be remembered.
B00005JPHT|5.0|How can you argue with the 9/11 volunteers whose medical issues have been ignored?  How can we call them heroes, and then forget about them?<br /><br />If your house catches fire, do the firemen ask to see your homeowner's insurance before they'll put out the fire?  Of course not, how absurd.  The City road crew, policemen, teachers, coast guard, military, water and sewer department, etc., all provide a service, and are all paid through the government.  Why not health care workers, including doctors, pharmacists, nurses, hospitals?  Why is the level of health care you receive dependent on how much money, or how much insurance, you have? Why should companies get rich off of the sickness and injuries people suffer?<br /><br />Watch this movie, then take action to bring America up to the same standard that every other industrialized country enjoys.  Our health care is substandard, and its a disgrace.
B000Q67DEO|5.0|Both music and videos of Eat to the Beat were THE blueprint for the new wave of the 80's.  This is Debbie and the Band at their best,  so good, that bands such as The Killers are still ripping them off today.  Check out Debbie in Sound-A-Asleep,  the epitome of beautiful and cool.  Also, Clem Burke (drummer). This album was as much his as it was Debbie's.  Outstanding throughout.

1416523359|1.0|The Shining, Pat Sematary, The Stand... not only some of King's best work but in fact, some of the best modern horror fiction around. But, Lisey's Story? Come on, King... please...   Seems like his idea tank is running on empty at this point. Over and over and over he keeps writing the same tired story. Re-worked, i'm guessing, enough to fool even the most intelligent critics. Do any of them not remember Secret Window? the Dark Half?   It's pretty hard to find a King book without mention of child sexual abuse or a spouse dying... and, of course, what would a King book be if it didn't have THE WORLD FAMOUS AUTHOR in it (or as in Lisey's Story, THE WIDOW OF THE WORLD FAMOUS AUTHOR)?  I remember the fear of walking alone down the halls of the Overlook as the storm raged outside, the terror of room 217...  I remember the frightening, hair-raising walk through the woods on a bitterly cold November evening in Ludlow... watching from the dark as Louis Creed buried first his cat and then his son...  The characters in IT and The Stand have become almost like friends to so many of King's \\"constant readers\\"...   But these new books have lost so much of what King used to stand for.    Not so long ago I saw an amusing cartoon of King sitting across from his agent handing him a manuscript entitled MY GROCERY LIST. You get the picture...    Once upon a time, this author really stood out for being original and nobody could deny that his was the most brilliant imagination around. But it seems those days have past. There have been, for some time, rumours circling that King was \\"retiring\\". Maybe now would be a good time.

B00001ZWTT|5.0|There's a lot of fighting (that's a euphemism for violence) in this movie, but nothing you can take seriously and I (who avoid violent movies like the plague) could stand it.  It's a great flick.  It overflows with wit and charm and imagination.  West and Gordon play perfectly off each other.  Their characters are clearly defined (no, this isn't Williams or Bergman), one dimensional though they be.  I loved it.  I've seen it 3 times, again last night.  It's one of my favorite movies.

B000001DQI|5.0|In 1973, Elton John released his first and only double-album, \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\". While he also made several other truly fantastic albums in that era, this one always stands out for me as being a completely flawless and true masterwork.    First off, the album opens with the epic \\"Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" which easily ranks as one of my favorite songs of all time. The placement of the songs on this record make for smooth transitions between each song. There's never a track for me that makes me want to skip. Elton John is in top form here. While technically considered a \\"pop\\" album, it easily ranks next to such classic albums as Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", or Led Zeppelin's \\"Zoso\\". It's a mostly upbeat album, with a few mellower songs (Candle in the Wind, Sweet Painted Lady, I've Seen That Movie Too) and makes for a great album to bring along on a road trip.    It's not as compact and ragtime-ish as \\"Honkey Chateau\\", and not as personal as \\"Captain Fantastic\\", but it's downright fun the entire way through and will always stand as the pinnacle in Elton's career.
0679437223|3.0|I'm more aligned with the reviewers that the trimumphal author takes to task in his 1994 preface, which appears at the end of this edition.  I was expecting more out of a novel that has received such wide acclaim, including on the amazon website.  The novel was flabby in many places, the characterization was thin, and the absurdist aspects wore on me.  In many regards, it read like an extended Marx Brothers movie.  I suppose I understand the origins of television's McHale's Navy and more to the point M*A*S*H a little better now, though I must admit what I found tiresome in M*A*S*H, I found tiresome in C-22.  The wit was too much on display, wanting to be looked at and thought deep and insightful.<br /><br />All of that said, I did become engaged by the second half of the book.  The chaplain and a few other characters did begin to have something to say.  And anyone who has dealt with corporate absurdities will find resonance in many parts of this book.  Additionally, I learned something about how the American officer class of WWII, which strikes me as quite different than that of today.  Heller obviously writes of what he knows.  For my money and time however, I would recommend Waugh's Sword of Honor trilogy over C-22 if it's a comedic, jaundiced look at WWII one is seeking.

It seems that the engineers of this CD have not adequately limited the dynamic range, with the result that the loud passages are too loud and the soft passages are too soft.

An awesome achievement (and a tremendous salute to Michael Ondaatje's fabulous book...one of the finest reads ever.) Lots of Love, Care, and Effort went into getting everything right about this movie. It Truly DID deserve the many Academy Awards that it garnered.<br /><br />One of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen, it is an absolute finalist for the best cinematography, EVER. Music, Costumes, Acting, Editing...all these things are of the very highest order.<br /><br />It ranks right up there with the \\"Great Ones\\" like \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", \\"Bridge On The River Kwai\\", \\"Dr. Zhivago\\", and \\"Casablanca\\".<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to see this fabulous movie...and, it belongs in every respectable personal film collection...it is a Great Work. ~operabruin
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Many of the other reviewers have given the plot summary, I just will say that this is a decent action film. Great camera work and nice effects.  The only thing I had to that was a flaw was the fact that indeed, his friend was killed in Ethopia on a top secret mission when they were left for dead. And yes it left his widow and family grieving.  But where does this justify after getting caught up in a big cover up shooting and killing so many people.  Does that justify the outcome.   In this movie, no.  What did it prove, a corrupt senetor, and an aged evil secret agent (danny glover).   So, bottom line, don't overthink this one, just watch it for the great camera and effects work.
B000002GJH|4.0|Even though Temple of the Dog began as a tribute side project in the memory of Andrew Wood and only put out one studio album, it is definitely worth listening to - especially if you dig Mr. Chris Cornell, formerly of Soundgarden and Audioslave or simply just the grunge of the early nineties, since Sir Eddie Vedder has a hand in this symphony as well...
B000NVL9KG|5.0|I am one who had these great ELP albums on vinyl. I also only have bought ELP,PICTUES, TRILOGY through the Rhino Re-master series. I have BSS on regular CD, but would like to find a definitive CD on that one.  I also bought WELCOME BACK twice on disc. One on the original CD and the other, I believe, was a Japanese import because the sound on the first is awful. Really, it wasn't cleaned up much on the Japanese import either. Now that explanation is over.......on to Tarkus. First of all, I listened to the ELP album (Rhino re-master} right before it. I believe this disc is very well done. You can hear Lake's bass up front along with vocals and the crashing of Carl Palmer's symbols. The piano parts on Take a Pebble are wonderful. This is the first Tarkus I have been able to find outside of vinyl at a reasonable price. As for volume on re-masters and that controversy of loudness issues.....I left the volume in the same place for the Shout Tarkus as the Rhino ELP. For my ears, the Tarkus was exactly the same for loudness. Since I haven't listened to my vinyl Tarkus in awhile, I can say it sounded like listening for the first time in a long time. I thought the Shout sounded very good also. Is it better than the Rhino ELP, Trilogy or Pictures? I don't here much of a difference. As far as Bob's review below. I have not suffer through all these re-masterings. I am now quite happy with my Rhino reproductions only bought once. I hear no  major sonic difference with the Shout Tarkus as opposed to the Rhino's. In most cases, Rhino does a pretty darn good job with everything. As far as the K2HD's, Bob links the Tarkus for 45.49. I have never heard them so I won't comment. Though, I will say, I'm sure for some audiophiles it might be worth it. For me, I'm not sure how much better production you can get from master tapes than what Rhino or Shout has done. I hope this review helps someone in their choices. By the way, Tarkus is a wonderful choice in music. I have loved it since I was a teenager. There isn't much music around like this or Yes anymore.

0061139378|4.0|In the \\"This book is so great\\" notes in front of Coraline one of the reviewers compares it flatteringly to Alice in Wonderland. I think the comparison is faulty. Yes, there are some \\"Wonderlandesque\\" bits, but Mr. Gaiman's work is much more reminiscent of a different (and I think better) master: George MacDonald. The book it reminds me most of is the somewhat difficult but highly rewarding Lilith, though MacDonald is heavier on the symbolism and lighter on the plot. Still, like MacDonald, Gaiman manages a surreal reality while still maintaining a sense of order about it, unlike Carroll who (though I dearly adore his books) is haphazard and quite obviously on something a little bit stronger than coffee (if you get my drift).<br />Coraline is about a bored, imperfect little girl by the same name who is living in a boring, drab world with boring parents who don't pay much attention to her, surrounded by people who won't be convinced that her name is not Caroline. Then her urge to explore takes over and she finds a strange door, bricked shut, in their flat. One night the bricks disappear and she steps through to a flat like to her own, only more wonderful and more ominous. The other flat is kept by her \\"Other Mother\\" who wants to keep her (As the cat says, maybe she wants something to love or maybe she wants something to eat. It is hard to tell with creatures like that.). When Coraline suspects harm she flees, only to have her real parents come up missing. Now Coraline must venture back into that strange world to find them, risking her own freedom and life for their sakes.<br />As a main character, Coraline goes through a believable character arch which any child could learn from, from self-centered and sulky to other-serving and brave. She is driven by her memory of when her father sacrificed his comfort/safety for her (a truly moving flashback passage details this) and her own quick mind. Also believable is the Cat. I love a believable cat character, and this one (unnamed by its own choice) takes the cake!<br />The only disappointments are symbolism which is either much too vague or put there purely as a whim (Why, oh why does one of the children she finds on the other side of the door have wings and eat flowers?) and an extended ending where she escapes and then doesn't and then saves the day for a second time, which is interesting, but really not that necessary and let's just say if I was making a screen play of the book (which would fit very well on screen) I'd probably leave it out for flow purposes.<br />However, all in all Coraline is an enjoyable, true hearted adventure, and both Coraline and myself were much better at the end of the book than we were at the beginning.its own choice) takes the cake!

B000A7S4B0|5.0|This album is so gorgeous, words will not do it justice. You just have to hear it & keep listening to it to uncover what is hidden in these seemingly simple, mostly acoustic gems. There are many highlights, such as opening track, \\"Shuffle Your Feet\\", complete with harmonized vocals, stomps, hoots & hollers.  This is a terrific way to get the listener's attention. Another highlight is \\"Ain't No Easy Way Out\\", another stomper shouting about the perils of love, and yet another highlight is \\"Weight of the World\\", which laments the difficulties we all must face up to in today's complicated world.  Slower boilers such as \\"Fault Line\\", \\"Restless Sinner', and \\"Devil's Waitin'\\" are simply guitar and voice and sometimes harmonica, and are the type of songs that could be soundtracks to a good ole boy's life. There are 2 songs where BRMC truly sound like Bob Dylan: \\"Complicated Situation\\" and \\"Still Suspicion Holds You Tight\\" and these songs are masterpieces, but the 2 songs that make this album worthy of 5 stars are \\"Sympathetic Noose\\" and \\"Promise\\". \\"Promise\\" may just be the most beautiful song ever written by anyone. It is that gorgeous. This song could be Peter Hayes singing to anyone beloved to him: family, lover, the Lord......at times the words sound like he is comforting a dying a friend. It is so delicate yet powerful and emotional, that is easily the finest song recorded in this decade. It is the apex of this beautiful collection of Americana songs.
0061142026|3.0|Disclaimer: The following review is written in reguards to younger fans, parents of younger fans, or people of traditonal morality who might wish to read the book in order to point out some possible concerns in a book which otherwise appeals to both children and adults.<br /><br />There are some books you'd love to whole-heartedly recommend but, because of some unfortunate fact or other, can't. Sometimes you can do so with a disclaimer (\\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich is a great book but it has a lot of swearing.\\"). Others the bad outweighs the good so while even though you want to tell everyone you know about the funny or clever or beautiful parts you feel you shouldn't. Unfortunately Neil Gaiman's Stardust is one such book.<br />Stardust is the story of a likeable young man in love with a beautiful, disinterested young woman. He travels into the fairy lands in search of a falling star for her. However, many others would like this star (or at least a piece of her), so when Tristran finds the star to be pursued and also very much alive, all havoc breaks loose until the ends are all cleverly tied together and a not altogether unexpected but still deeply satisfying happily ever after is achieved.<br />Neil Gaiman presents a beautiful but gritty fairy world which I would recommend heartily except for two scenes which are inserted it seems just to drive the book to an R rating. Both are necessary for plot but handled much too much to be easily read over. In other words, you don't come away unsullied. I suppose I could just make note of the three pages to skip . . . but then wouldn't it be easier just to buy a book that wouldn't require such holes?
B0000630BT|5.0|This was the album that got me into heavy metal.I first heard it when I was around 11 years old, and I had never heard anything like it before in my life.It became my obsession, I would listen to it every day.It also inspired me to look into Judas Priest's older catalog.Lets look at it track by track:  1.Painkiller(5/5) - It starts out with a killer drum solo and then kicks in with the guitars.The solos in the song blow my mind.Tipton and Downing are at the top of their game.  2.Hell Patrol(3.5/5) - Its a good song, but in my opinion its a little bland.  3.All Guns Blazing(4/5) - The octaves that Halford can hit just blow my man.  4.Leather Rebel(4/5) - There is just something about this song that gets me pumped.This song just further proves that Halford is the Metal God.  5.Metal Meltdown(5/5) - Great guitar inro!This song is amazing, everyone is just rocking their hardest!  6.Nightcrawler(5/5) - This is my favorite song on this album.Halford's voice is simply amazing on this song.  7.Between the Hammer and the Anvil(3.5/5) - I enjoy this song, but its nothing special.Another solid track.  8.A Touch of Evil(5/5)- Most likely the slowest track on the album.Its great song.There is some use of synthesizers.  9.Battle Hymn - Its just the opening for the next track.  10.One Shot at Glory(4.5/5) - A great track,Halford is all over the place.Great guitar work.  ---Bonus Tracks--  Living Bad Dreams(3.5/5)- Its a good song, but its not up to the standard as the rest of the album.  Leather Rebel(Live)- Well, its Leather Rebel live!
0156027321|3.0|This is a very beautiful book. I know I say that about a lot of books, but I think beauty is the sensibility most appealed to by the written word. Humans have a God-given thirst for beauty, and we were given the ability to create things in accordance with this. Martel has succeeded in the over all effect, in the descriptions, and in the details, but occasionally this book does dip below standard.<br />The story is of Pi Patel, the son of an Indian zoo keeper who, after a tragic shipwreck, finds himself alone in a life raft with a massive Bengal tiger. Intriguing, no? Pi ends up setting a record for survival at sea despite the added difficulty of a man-eater on board.<br />This book avoids the feel good \\"Animals are our friends who don't bite unless grievously provoked\\" philosophy and goes for the grittier reality. Tigers are pretty in cages but deadly in life rafts. The whole situation provides for a lot of near crude detail about survival, starvation, and animal eating habits but handles them in a straight forward manner, not with a crude humor or what I would consider sensationalism.<br />The detail, the writing, and the story all make for a page turning, heartfelt read. There are, however, two notable flaws, one in plot, the other in philosophy.<br />As far as plot goes this book is completely believable. Everything is hard to believe, but the style and detail draw you in so that you are willing to believe this well thought out tale . . . until you get to the island of the meerkat, a floating mass of edible sea weed inhabited by happy weasel/rat/ferret things . . . I am not describing it well because it doesn't make sense; it doesn't fit the rest of the novel. I can sort of see where the author is going with this, attempting to make us doubt the character's story, doubt his sanity or at least veracity. It doesn't work, though, and I think he could have found a better way to do it.<br />The second flaw is a matter of beliefs. Pi practices every religion he comes across (in the the course of this book his native Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity) without seeing any logical let alone theological conflict. In some ways Pi's explorations into religion can be very moving, very interesting, and in places very true. He has a lot to say about God's love and prayer that anyone could benefit from, but like the floating island, Pi's views simply do not make sense. You're left with, \\"Well, that sounds nice, but how can you cram everything together into a cohesive world view?\\" The answer is you don't and you can't.<br />However, for a mature reader this book is a wonderful escape and an on going adventure, a purely enjoyable read.course of this book his native Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity) without seeing any logical let alone theological conflict.

0807014273|5.0|This marvelous work does for the psychologically wounded what Peter Drucker's \\"The Effective Executive\\" does for the time-impaired. That is give people a feel for what tools to use to construct their own framework for achieving happiness (not someone else's concept of what another person's happiness ought to be).  Both \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" and \\"The Effective Executive\\" should be taken up and re-read at least once a year (pardon me for offering so specific a prescription). Both works are short enough so they can be read quickly. But don't go too fast. Consider Speaker Newt Gingrich's advice when he recommended people go through \\"The Effective Executive\\" stopping at salient points (there are plenty of those) and making notes about how something relates specifically to one's life and incorporate that into one's operating system.  Dr. Viktor E. Frankl's logotherapy (or \\"meaning\\" therapy) springs from his experience in World War II concentration camps. His writing is refreshingly free from veiled (and sometimes not-so-veiled) invective of Holocaust literature. The terms \\"Jew\\" and \\"German\\" are scarely to be found. The Jewish identification is raised only when unavoidable to give a complete picture such as when Dr. Frankl's words give an Eastern European rabbi a new lease on mental health. Frank's statement about mankind's only two groups -- the decent and the indecent -- is telling.  Among other Frankl profundities --  -- Suffering is unavoidable.  -- Man in metaphysical tension is normal and worthwhile.  Perhaps his most important statement is that life is meaningful yet the meaning is different for each person and it changes more often than one might think. Keys to following this bouncing ball include taking responsibility and developing a sense of humor, according to our author.  Freedom is not an end in itself, Frankl correctly notes, although others (especially libertarian thinkers in the tradition of Ludwig von Mises) have suggested that it needs to be treatedas such societally to that the road to happiness be as wide as possible for individuals. Recognition that life is meaningful is essential to a successful navigation of this road, no matter how wide.  Frankl: \\"Freedom is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness.\\"  Frankl and many libertarians/classical liberals would agree that freedom and responsibility call for a delicate balance in the human mind. But who am I to say? Read Frankl, Allport and Fabry alongside Mises, Hayek and Rothbard and judge for yourself.  Something you can't miss about Frankl -- he refuses to be a dictator. He was persecuted through the caprice of at least one hideous dictator yet denied the enemy victory by not taking on the enemy's characteristics. This represents a high level of moral reasoning. Although Frankl isn't an explicitly religious author he has earned the title of \\"Rabbi Frankl\\" through such choosing.  The opposite of the spirit that animates Frankl and other greats (arrived at through attainment of true knowledge coupled with respect for all mankind) was wonderfully encapsulated by Stephen Crane is his story \\"Above All Things.\\" Of this all-too-common unholy spirit of the imperialist, the dictator, the socialist \\"reformer,\\" Crane wrote:  \\"...The stranger finds the occupations (read: lifestyles) of foreign peoples to be trivial and inconsequent. The average mind utterly fails to comprehend the new point of view...'How futile are the lives of these people.'...This is the arrogance of the man who has not yet solved himself and discovered his own actual futility.\\"
0451450523|4.0|The Last Unicorn is one of the strangest books I have ever read. If you take Grimm's Fairy Tales, add a pinch of Shrek, and finish it off with Alice and Wonderland you begin to get some idea of its strangeness but not of its mystery.<br />Wondrous is the only way to describe it. The book whirls like a conjuror's trick. It borrows from everything but steals from nothing. The style encompasses the real and the ridiculous. I think the character Cat summed it up best: Valiant Absurdity. That is what this book is.<br />This book suffers where it shines and visa versa. The characters somehow lack something essential. You never get a grasp on them, but you realize swiftly that this is how it is meant to be. The Unicorn is meant to be distant and intangible. The Magician is meant to be unreal and befuddling. The Prince is meant to be underdeveloped and ridiculous. This is what they are and this is how they should be. Same with the plot which is strange and heroic but somehow also drawn out and flat like a fairy tale map with \\"here be dragons\\" scrawled in the empty margins.<br />I devoured it quickly and will carry it with me always.

078681859X|3.0|My husband bought me this book for my birthday, but I quickly began to doubt his good intentions as he snatched it up before I did and devoured it. Then he proceeded to constantly interupt my reading of another book by gaffawing at the constant commentary of Bartimaeus himself and everytime I asked him what was so funny he told me it wouldn't make sense unless I read the book and kept reading. He devoured book one in an evening, continued on through book two and three the next day, and I am sure if Matt were writing this rating, he would give it a five. For me, it was a three.<br />I'm a character driven reader and character was what this book lacked . . . not character in the sense that the people weren't fully formed or the book didn't hold interest. In that sense the book is full of character. The wise cracking Djinni in the title role can't keep his mouth shut for all the character, and his constant interjections (in the form of foot notes) are hilarious, and in many places more interesting than the text itself. No, it is missing character in two other important senses: A. a protagonist I could like and root for; B. a moral substance or cause for which we (the readers) can root for. Honestly, in this story of a neglected young boy who calls up a magical Djinni to avenge himself on a senior magician who humiliated him, I didn't find either.<br />The two leads are Nathaniel, the neglected boy, and Bartimaeus, the summoned Djinni. Nathaniel, for most of the book, is young, hurt, and pitiable but never motivated by what I consider a good cause. For the first half of the book he is merely out for revenge and glory, to prove that he can weild powers beyond his age and to ruin one who called this into doubt. When the second half of the book begins and it is revealed that more is at stake than just Nathaniel's pride, we are hardpressed to care because the author makes it clear that the government entities Nathaniel and Bartimaeus rush to protect really aren't worth protecting. It would be rather like learning that Hitler and Stalin were going to go at it and being told you could stop Hitler and let Stalin lead a long and happy life by risking your rear end in many uncomfortable ways. Sure, no one wants Hitler again, so you might do it, but it sure as heck wouldn't be for the love of Stalin. Bartimaeus on the other hand is more interesting, but he doesn't want to be there, is compelled to do things against his will, and really only gives a darn because Nathaniel has threatened him with life imprisonment in a tabacco tin (and life is long for an immortal) if he doesn't behave. For him, victory isn't victory either.<br />So what are we fighting for? Who knows. None of the characters seem to anyway.<br />So I kept reading just so I could absorb the footnotes which were hilarious, not really because I gave a darn what was going to happen to the prime minister or the evil villian or even much to good old Nathaniel.<br />But the action is fierce and the tone is hilarious. I just wish I knew what I was reading for other than that.It would be rather like learning that Hitler and Stalin were going to go at it and being told you could stop Hitler and let Stalin lead a long and happy life by risking your rear end in many uncomfortable ways. Sure, no one wants Hitler again, so you might do it, but it sure as heck wouldn't be for the love of Stalin. Bartimaeus on the other hand is more interesting, but he doesn't want to be there, is compelled to do things against his will, and really only gives a darn because Nathaniel has threatened him with life imprisonment in a tabacco tin (and life is long for an immortal) if he doesn't behave. For him, victory isn't victory either.   So what are we fighting for? Who knows. None of the characters seem to anyway.  So I kept reading just so I could absorb the footnotes which were hilarious, not really because I gave a darn what was going to happen to the prime minister or the evil villian or even much to good old Nathaniel.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|I bought this because of the singles that have been released so far, but have really enjoyed the other songs.  After listening to it 3 times, I really like most of the songs.  Good, solid Chili Peppers.
B000002KY8|5.0|1999 is an album for the ages. Bumping funk and creative and fun tracks like 1999, Little Red Corvette, and my personal favorite D.M.S.R. make this album probably one of the 80's top 5 albums and one of musics top 40 albums of all time.    Prince unlike Michael Jackson has not struggled to reinvent himself, because Prince has been constantly experimenting with new sounds and new ways to create his masterpieces.    It is hard to believe that 1999 preceded Purple Rain, but did an incredible job teasing the world's appetite for more of the \\"Purple One\\"    This is a must have for any R&B collection and any run of the mill Prince fan!    Great Album, that should live in the history books of music for decades to come!
B00005JPFC|5.0|Remy (Oswalt) is a rat who wants to be a chef.  He has refined senses and refuses to eat the garbage that other rats eat.  They use him as a \\"poison detector\\", a job which he despises.  One day, he meets Linguini (Romono), a janitor at Gusteau's, a famous Paris restaurant.  Hiding under his hat, Remi can manipulate Linguini into creating amazing dishes.  Soon, everyone is talking about this new chef, but the chef whose position he has usurped (Holm) wants revenge.  Renowned food critic Anton Ego (O'Toole) is also reviewing the restaurant, and Remi and Linguini may be in over their heads.    \\"Ratatouille\\" is the latest in the string of great movies from Pixar.  It's a notch below last year's \\"Cars\\", but still better than the majority of animated movies that have come out in the last decade.  The humor works on two levels as has become Pixar's standard.  Kids and adults alike will enjoy this film.  The voice talents are mostly lesser names, and that works fine; they all suit their characters.  \\"Ratatouille\\" is a great film that young and old can enjoy together.
B00005JPQT|5.0|What a great treat!  I always loved those Die Hard movies (in fact, it's dangerous for me to channel surf if one of them is on TV) and was thrilled when Live Free actually happened.  The story, action, fx, acting, attitude are all there in spades.  Some things are worth revisting when they're done well.  This does not dissapoint.  A reason to actually drag your tired [...] to the movies and pay to watch commercials!!  Can't wait for the dvd.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|As a die hard Miami Vice fan back in the day, I have to admit that I was expecting to see something along the lines of the TV show that I fell in love with as a teenager. So when I saw Miami Vice the movie, for the first 10-15 minutes, I was angry \\"this is not the movie I expected\\", but as I sat tight and got comfortable with my disappointment, I started really paying attention to the story, the character development, Jamie Foxx's performance, and the photography, and all of the sudden I was hooked. If you should get the DVD, the \\"special features\\" behind the scences documentary is a must see. After having watched Michael Mann's commentary about filmmaking and his artistic vision, I went back and re-watched Collateral.    The only draw backs to this film are: 1- a different actor (i can't say who) should have played the Sunny Crockett role and 2- Secondary characters Gina, Trudy, Switech and Zito may have done well with expanded rolls.
B000J103OI|4.0|For me the movie did what the book could never do. It bought life and a human angle to this story. I just didn't find the book and its style particuarly good this is such a visual theme it really works on the screen. There are some absolute classic lines and scenes. Meryl Streep really works as the editor, she is cold, hard, deadly and oh so quiet with it. To me it was Stanley Tucci who stole every scene he was in. I can't see how he does it, he just seems to nail the character he plays with a combination of wit and sensitivity.Extraodinary!    This is the story of Andrea (Andy) who lucks into a job with Runway - the magazine of the American fashion world. Only she doesnt' really want it. It is when she laughs during one of Miranda's fashion scenes that she gets put in her place. Miranda picks apart the jumper she is wearing and its 'cerulean blue' - when it first appeared on the runway, who picked it up next and where it went - showing that Andy was as much a victim of fashion industry as anyone.    Andy decides she wants the job and goes all out to make herself the ideal (second) assistant.  She proves too good for the job having more of a relationship with Miranda than with her own friends, and finding out that fancy consumer goods don't retain friends, or a boyfriend.    There are some utterly hilarious lines in this. All the women are starving themselves down to size 2 and 4 (or less) and Miranda's first assistant confides her diet to Andy - she just starves herself and when she thinks she is going to faint she eats a small piece of cheese. If only this was really a joke!    A great fun watch.

B000OQF6N6|4.0|Personally, I think it's a great record, but would have been even better if they had jettisoned the last song (the aimless, tuneless \\"Pomp and circumstance\\" and included two of the B-sides I downloaded, \\"Stellar\\" and \\"Death from above\\" - but as usual, the record companies prefer to shoot themselves in the foot in this time of declining record sales. The labels aren't being run by music lovers anymore, just idiot bean-counters, who in this case didn't know (or care) that two of the best songs (the aforementioned two B-sides) were actually as good as anything else on the album! It happened with the last Cure album, too. The labels deserve exactly what they are getting, and can shove the four different versions of this CD up their collective a**es!! So, I say, get those two extra tracks, burn them onto a CD without \\"Pomp\\", and enjoy!!
1596061049|5.0|Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch is the first book in the Gentlemen Bastards series. Not only is it the first in the Gentlemen Bastards series, but this novel happens to be the first novel published by Mr. Lynch as well. When I first heard that this was a debut novel I was slightly hesitant, but it came with a glowing recommendation so I took the chance. Let me say right off the bat that I am very thankful that I took the chance on this new author as this novel is absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />There are several aspects of this novel that I think need to be reviewed.<br /><br />The characters really allow this novel to stand out and shine. The characters are well developed and vivid. Each character is done in such a way that they all appear unique, anything from their look to their dialog. While Mr. Lynch has added many curse words, which at times, for me anyway, shocks the reader out of the dialog, it also seems to bring a grittiness to the characters. There are quite a few characters in this novel, but I didn't find any difficulty in keeping them separate and knowing what each was doing. The main character, who I would struggle to call a hero, is a rogue who is bent on stealing from the nobles of the cit. A Robin Hood type character if you will. Mr. Lynch goes to great detail to explain and develop Locke throughout the book, and he pulls this off very well. The other assortment of characters are developed at varying degrees. This just makes sense or else the book would be huge. In my opinion the supporting cast of characters are done perfectly, not too much and not to little. There are many truly memorable characters in this book.<br /><br />The plot, on the surface anyway, seems rather simple in that the main character is a rogue set on fleecing the nobility out of their wealth. However, there are many things that Mr. Lynch tosses into the mix to make this a much more complicated story than just your typical steal from the rich story. This story follows Locke from when he was a very young boy all the way up to his involvement with the Gentlemen Bastards and the escapades that he routinely pulls on the noble class of the city. There are several twists and mysterious characters that are slowly added to add more depth to the story. Even though there are multiple elements added throughout the book they are not done so to cram things into this novel. It has a very steady pace and was obviously well mapped out. It's a well written plot and one that certainly leaves room for further development in later books.<br /><br />This novel is set up in an interesting way, in fact I have not seen a novel like this to my memory. There are regular chapters, but interspaced between these chapters, or sections really, there are flashbacks or as Lynch calls them interludes. Were he harkens back to past events that helped shape the characters actions and choices. This is certainly a unique way of putting a novel together and at times it works beautifully, but there is at least one point where I read an interlude and was a little unsure why it was included in the story or at that point in the book. For the most part though, this idea works rather well and adds a certain depth to the book.<br /><br />There are a few things that I wish would have been better developed, such the way magic works as well as a little more explanation of the `thirteen'. Since this is the first book in this series I expect that these things may be explained in greater detail later.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic book and one I am sure to recommend to many other people. It really is a gem and a surprising first release from a new author. I wonder just how good Mr. Lynch will become if this was the first release from him. I am eagerly looking forward to the second book in this series as I am sure many others will be once they give this novel a chance. Have no fear in picking this up, I think it will appease many a different fans. Certainly fantasy fans, but also others will probably like this as well..
B000O174CM|4.0|I was wary about purchasing Dreamgirls since I did not think the original American cast could be bettered.  I was wrong!  Setting, music and performances were great.  My only concern was that whilst in parts it got out of the 'studio' it was nearly always theatrical and felt restricted by its setting.  Obviously a film of a stage show - but still great entertainment.  Jennifer Hudson is terrific.
0316067598|5.0|This is one of the best real life books based on a true incident incurred by one of our fighting elite that I've read to date. Insight into just what our men and women face overseas is put in a perspective that is not glamorized for the 'media masses' but rather to show the real true honor and courage our fighting forces present. The insight into the elite men of 'SEAL' also gives one insight into the amount of training and conditioning it takes to take on a job few if none want but which many take for granted. That 'sports' figures could earn gigantic salaries above and beyond the earnings of these men and women is to me one of the biggest injustices of this country. All said I wanted to head to Texas to personally shake the hand of Mr. Luttrell and thank him face to face for having endured,perserved, and fought so that I am able to sit here and write a review from the comfort of my home. God Bless America, God Bless the SEALS and God Bless all our personnel serving in our Armed Forces. One can only imagine what stories occurred that can't be told.
0812550706|5.0|Grab your flight suit and don't forget: The enemy's gate is down!<br /><br />Orson Scott Card has written a lot of novels since this one, including a veritable plethora of Ender sequels and spinoffs, but he's never topped it. This book has something few books have: an idea that was, at the time of its publication, wholly new and original. More importantly, readers will identify with and come to love the characters, especially Ender himself.<br /><br />See if this sounds famaliar: a lonely boy, unusually gifted but put-upon by his peers and his family, is taken away to a place where he learns to master his considerable talents and may, in time, save the world. Any chance a certain celebrated English author may have read about little Ender Wiggin? This muggle writer of silly vampire stories thinks so ...<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy \\"Teeth.\\")
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|Kelly is one of my favorite artists, and definately my favorite American Idol. I mean, the girl can sing. I was so proud of her for her success on Breakaway. It was well-deserved too; the album was amazing. So of course I was really excited to see what Kelly had up her sleeve for My December. I heard she argued with her manager to get all of the songs she wrote on My December, despite there supposedly being no hits in it. That's awesome for her. Never Again was ok; I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me. The first time I heard Sober I was blown away, and I've been hooked on that song ever since. In fact, I think it's the highlight of the whole album.    I was disappointed when I first heard the whole album besides the singles. There wasn't any song that I fell in love with, and I flat out hated Hole and Judas (cliche lyrics, annoying melodies). Haunted vaguely reminded me of Addicted, except not nearly as amazing. I really like How I Feel, except for the lyrics, which are whiney and very I-hate-my-life-please-pity-me. Be Still is beautiful, and another one of my favorites. One Minute I've heard is going to be the third single, and that one's alright; nothing special. I do like Don't Waste Your Time; that's probably my favorite non-ballad song. Irvine is cool, but slow with no climax. Chivas is alright, but I think a sixth grader could've written the lyrics (despite the fact that they're about Chivas). \\"You are crap/You should keep your eyes on your new little brat\\". Not very poetic. Can I Have A Kiss and Maybe are nothing special. Sorry Kelly, I still support you, but this whole album is nothing special.
0446613444|5.0|This is the 2nd book in the Harry Bosch Series.  I would recommend reading all the Harry Bosch novels in the proper order.  Most all of these books are either rated 4 or 5 stars by me.  I have been very pleased with the way Michael Connelly writes.  He leaves nothing out and as usual Harry Bosch is a real fascinating character.  You will not be disappointed if you like police investigative mysteries.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|After 27 years, Flash Gordon (Savior of the Universe) is finally being released on DVD.  It was released on VHS for awhile, but for the last several years it was only available at the ridiculous price of $99.00, or more.    Flash Gordon is the classic American Sci-Fi hero, and has had numerous incarnations, but this 1980 version is the best by far.  The acting, directing, and cinematography are all excellent.  The special effects were leading edge for their time.  The soundtrack by Queen is perfect for the film.  This version is exciting, campy, and a classic Sci-Fi adventure.    Buy it!  You won't be disappointed!
006085880X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Jodi Picoult, as I've said before, is an amazing author. I don't think I've read any books that really touch me deep inside like her books do. Or maybe I'm just not looking in the right place.<br /><br />I just know that if I ever need a book that will keep me wondering until the end, Jodi Picoult will have it for me. And The Pact is definitely not an exception. I loved basically everything about it. I loved the characters, and I felt like I knew what they were going through, even though I've never been through it before. I loved how deep that Chris and Emily's relationship was, and I loved how the ending wrapped it up beautifully, in my opinion. There was a little bit of loose strings and just enough resolution.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, although it's mature and intended for older readers.
B000I2J76I|3.0|As with the first Lethal Weapon (LW1) HD DVD transfer the picture and sound quality is not too bad, possible could be better but ok. I am rather dissapointed with the fact that there are no real extras on either this or LW1. I would of thought that as this is on HD DVD rather than just DVD they would of made the effort to put more extra features on considering the room, maybe the price should be lowered when they don't have extras. Apart from that it was good to watch the film again as it is possible my favourite of all of the LW films. I hope they will release the rest on HD DVD soon.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|About three days ago, I went to Wikipedia to see how well Zeitgeist was doing with \\"professional\\" critics. Unfortunately, Zeitgeist was getting mixed reviews. All-Music gave the album a two star out of five claiming that the \\"album sucked because some of the original members weren't participating in the reunion\\". Terrible reviews. Other reviews hailed Zeitgeist as a wonderful comeback album and I'd have to agree completely.     Zeitgeist shows the harder rocking Billy Corgan, there aren't any soft songs in this album. That was the earlier Smashing Pumpkins, and that's the exactly the reason why I love this album. It's something new and fresh.     I've learned that reviews are a waste of time. Everybody's different and it's impossible to have an album that EVERYBODY enjoys. Do yourself a favor and listen to the album yourself, make your own judgments.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I'm french and to have this box set is a great opportunity to discover the show perfectly. There are good french subtitles and it works in our dvd players. Besides, The commentaries are fun and very interesting and i love the featurettes and the new footage included. In France, we've got only the originals episodes and our dvds are double-sides, it's awful!  So, this box is very pretty, small and it's a pleasure to have it in my dvd collection!
075640407X|5.0|...but somehow this book grabbed my attention. It was mentioned by the author of a webcomic I read once in a while, and I was lucky enough to read that post while it was still on the page. Now, as I previously stated, I do not read fantasy for the most part -- I just have a hard time getting into it. I've never even read The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings (though they are on my list.)    This book captured me in the first ten pages. When you think about it, that's no easy feat, especially when the reader in question stays away from that genre. I was amazed at how intricate and detailed the world Rothfuss creates was, and as the story continued more and more details were revealed, until the world almost became real for me and I couldn't put it down. Literally. (I read fast, and I finished it in two sessions, about 11 hours total.)    Another comment mentioned a lack of \\"oomph\\" and a inadequate ending, but in this incidence I believe that this is all for the better. Any different ending, in my opinion, would have broken the enchantment, so to speak, because in real life is any story so exquisitely groomed? And the lack of information about certain plot points is an important part of the story, because if you know all of the information up front, there is no mystery and the tale becomes formulaic right off the bat. The ending intentionally leaves you with questions, and the way the tale is set up you know, for the most part, that by the end of the third day you will know all that Kvothe knows. In my opinion, this is the start of what could be an epic trilogy, and a fantastic debut by an incredibly talented author. Kudos, sir.
032147404X|5.0|This book takes the practical approach of giving specific instructions and camera settings to achieve specific photo results. It's like having a mentor along with you as you venture into digital camera usage. The author also uses a humorous style to deliver the technical advice, adding to the book's 'readability'.
074356619X|2.0|If Ms Byrne only knew how her unprofessional voice and amateur reading style detracts from the powerful messages imparted in this set, she would have it re-recorded by a professional. Good material - poorly presented.
0060763892|5.0|James Rollins' latest novel definitely ranks right up there with his Map of Bones as one of the best action-adventure books I've ever read.  Once again the author takes us on an incredible non-stop ride to amazing locales around the world with a gripping tale that is truly astounding.  I was so intrigued by this story that I found myself researching many of the key locations online (like Turkey's Hagia Sophia and Cambodia's Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom) to better appreciate the escapade of these fascinating characters.  James Rollins has an uncanny ability to take what could potentially be a completely preposterous scenario (like people glowing in the dark) and provide just the right amount of a scientific explanation and historical background to make it not only plausible, but down right awesome.

074356619X|5.0|Perfect to listen to while driving - the positive vibrations fill you up with good thoughts and positive images about your life and your place in the world.  It's perfect to play while doing household chores or working outside - good positive thoughts that reach into your mind and your heart even though your concentration is elsewhere. Many things still reach you.  The Law of Attraction works for you and because of you.<br /><br />Of course, one chapter at a time, or all at once - to sit and listen and concentrate when you want to remind yourself how good the world is, how fortunate you are and always will be.
0553382179|4.0|I've seen this system referenced numerous times over the years on Christian Websites and when I spotted it at the library this week, I grabbed it.      In contrast to the minority of readers who did not care for Cilley's writing style, I found it an easy, breezy read with a great deal of motivation to do better, little by little.    While I've always kept my house tidy, in the back of my mind I've never felt like it was truly orderly.  After leaving the Navy about 9 months ago to be a stay-at-home wife and mother, I've had to deal with my own expectations of what a SAHW/M should \\"be\\" and \\"do\\" and this book has already helped me to put a \\"chink\\" in the clutter I've accumulated over the years.    Cilley has a massive Website that I find rather difficult to navigate... which is ironic considering her work of decluttering... but the information you read in the book is found on the site and in free email digests that she sends out through the week.      My only gripe with the book is that a \\"checklist\\" or outline of the different aspects of the system would have been helpful.  I read the book in a day and then went back with a notebook to take notes as necessary.    Definitely recommended.  You may want to read Judi Culbertson's \\"The Clutter Cure\\" for insight into the \\"why\\" of clutter and good motivation to get rid of the junk.
B000002UAI|5.0|Words Of Love, I'll Follow The Sun, and Every Little Thing....  beautiful songs I can listen to over and over and over and do do do.  There are other songs I love on this album too, but I'd have bought it for just the three I mentioned!
1400063515|2.0|First the negative points : loose structure, mixed styles (feels like a scientific/philosophical/narative essay à la Kundera), and very condescending and pretentious. This is pretty much a \\"look how brilliant I am\\" kind of book with lots of name dropping and personal anecdotes, but it is nonetheless fun to read if you want to think a little while you're flying to the beach. However, Taleb's lack of focus will eventually get to you, and you'll be back in a few hours after a good nap.    You'll find some interesting points on complexity economics and some wordly wisdom too. But if these two subjects are of any interest to you, I would rather suggest Eric D. Beinhocker's \\"The Origin of Wealth\\" (very rich, well structured and arrogance-free),  and Charlie Munger's \\"Poor Charlie's Almanak\\" (not arrogance-free, but in a way that is actually funny and with a very convincing scorecard to back it up).
B00005JPQT|4.0|When the original Die Hard was released back in 1988, I was seventeen, and thanks to Tennessee's antiquated obscenity law, I had to sneak into the theatre to see it. I was already weary of these action heroes who were invulnerable and one-liners which were peppered amidst the frequent explosions that were common in Reagan-era films of that genre.    Willis' John McClane was a refreshing twist of the action hero who was as vulnerable as he was heroic. The one-liners weren't bad puns, and \\"the\\" classic line from that film (Yippe-ki-yay, motherf***er), became an instant addition to the vocabulary of teenagers and adults everywhere.    Now, 19 years and three movies later, Willis again dons the NYPD badge that made him a hero. Of course, during that time, Die Hard became the epitome of action films. It would be used in pitch after pitch for movies ever since. \\"Die Hard on a boat\\" became Stephen Segal's Under Siege. \\"Die Hard on a plane\\" became Air Force One for Harrison Ford.     Live Free or Die Hard brings Bruce Willis back into the genre which made him a movie star. Now, McClane is a dad to a daughter who hates him (the wife who hates him divorced him long ago, apparently, so Bonnie Bedelia wasn't in this film). Thankfully, his daughter Lucy is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead instead of Jessica Simpson (who was reportedly in talks for the role).    The story is simple enough: McClane is asked by an FBI friend of his to bring in hacker Matt Farrell (Mac guy Justin Long) in for questioning after the defense department mainframe is hacked. Unlike the first film, the action begins almost immediately when the bad guys try to assassinate Farrell, and McClane gets there just in the nick of time.    What follows is a string of action scenes that suspend all plausibility and sometimes even reality itself for the sake of a big budget. Here's the amazing thing: It works. Director Len Weisman's fantasy-driven visual style was last seen in the Underworld movies. Since they werehis only films before this one make him an interesting choice for both Fox and Willis to trust with their cash cow.    Weisman effectively mixes the humor with the serious, and the well-placed cast only bolsters the film. Probably the only weak link in Live Free is Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gabriel, the film's big-bad guy. Of course, there aren't too many people who can compare to the deliciously charismatic Alan Rickman in the first film, so I have to give Olyphant some credit here. He's been seen in a few guest-starring roles on shows like Deadwood and was the lead in the 2000 film Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy.    Gabriel's motive is solid, and his plan to systematically shut down the country's resources wreaks the kind of havoc we can all imagine. After all, what would it be like if the entire infrastructure were to shut down? Since \\"pretty much everything\\" is run by computers, the premise of the film has a fun hook.    With supporting roles from Maggie Q as the high-kicking sidekick to Gabriel, and a strangely Vulcan-esque role from Star Trek Voyager's Tim Russ, Live Free or Die Hard carries along the story along its explosive path to a satisfying conclusion. An especially bright point in the film is a cameo from filmmaker Kevin Smith as uber-hacker \\"Warlock.\\" Smith's character has the delight of delivering the film's most insightful lines.    Live Free or Die Hard is a film that's high on decibels and explosions, light on physics and plausibility, yet comes together in a film that is a fun romp through Washington, D.C. as the world comes to an end. Willis and Long have the usual \\"buddy movie\\" banter, with lines like, \\"Listening to this (music) is like having a corncob shoved up my a**.\\"    Amazingly, the film is rated PG-13, so anyone can see it. Sure, die hard fans (pun intended) cringe at not having f-bombs every other word. In fact, even last word of \\"the\\" line is drowned out by the sound of a bullet. Thankfully, the one thing that isn't drowned out is the fact that it's actually good. (8/10)
B000MGUZKM|5.0|In general, I am always very pleased with music by Randy Crawford, and this CD which has her paired with Joe Sample is superb.  It is a blend of previous recordings and new songs which have all be arranged by Sample.  I cannot say enough good things about this CD.  Any money spent to purchase a copy is money well spent!
B00005JPFC|5.0|I never thought I'd be cheering on a rat. But when a rat is concocted by a Bird, all the rules change. Ratatouille, the new film from the on-again marriage of Pixar and Disney, has proven once again that an original story can be delicious.     After his astonishing success with The Iron Giant and the smash hit of The Incredibles, Brad Bird clearly had a tough act to follow. With Giant, he proved he could tell a story. With The Incredibles, he showed that he wasn't a one-hit wonder. With Ratatouille, he's firmly established himself as a master chef of animation brilliance.     All right, I'll stop gushing for a minute. This new tale of a rat who just wants to cook begins humbly enough as Remy (voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt), the film's blue-furred star, jumps out the window of a French country house. He's not particularly cute, but his enhanced sense of taste and smell has given him a special place among his colony. To their delight, they discovered early on that he can smell rat poison.    It's a demeaning and dreary beginning for Remy's newfound skills. He wants something more, and we hope for the same. As a rat, he has to take every risk imaginable to get closer to the finer foods. These are the same risks that Bird takes since a story about a rat is about as appealing as a story about a talking spider and pig, at least when first pitched.    The brilliance of Ratatouille isn't in the animation, the characters, or even the food. Its genius is in its mere concept. Truly, it's a concept that we can all pursue our passion; a lesson I've taught on many occasions. Remy's passion is to cook. And he'd find any way he can to do exactly that.     As he stumbles upon a particularly bad batch of soup, Remy did the unthinkable; he fixed it. In the process, he's discovered by Linguini (Lou Romano), a lanky red-haired boy who's just been begrudgingly hired by a popular restaurant as a garbage boy. The two unlikely heroes begin an even-more-unlikely friendship which elevatesthe story from a tasty hor'dourve into the stratosphere as the film version of a culinary masterpiece.     Bird clearly knows that any food can be made to look pretty, but it's the taste and texture that really matters. With Ratatouille, he's given us a dish that is as rich as it is gorgeous, as tasty as it is meaty. This isn't a cream puff, it's a film that's worthy of repeat viewings by people of all walks of life, and of all ages.     What's particularly interesting is that Disney chose to allow Bird to use a voice cast that's heavy on talent, but light on blockbuster star value. The biggest names attached to Ratatouille are Lord of the Ring's Ian Holm who voices the diminutive Skinner and Lawrence of Arabia's Peter O'Toole who provides the dialogue for the ultra-picky food critic, Anton Ego.     By the end of the film, we're not only rooting for a rat, but we're actually celebrating being different. So many of us can relate to this silly rodent, and who could resist such a message of hope? Without being preachy, Bird delivers Ratatouille as a message of thinking outside the box, and even daring to live outside of any box, with the finesse and deliberate touch of a master chef. (10/10)
0374105235|4.0|For awhile I contemplated on buying this book to read. The title seemed interesting and had good reviews. I finally picked it up the other day and couldn't put it down. Beah's account of fighting for his life was both frightening and amazing. To imagine a child going through what he did astounds me!  I highly recommend this book. You will be awed and at times feel uncomfortable at the gory descriptions Beah gives on witnessing death.
1591841666|4.0|All kidding aside this was a GREAT read for me. I have (had) so many things going on at once, that I am all over the place. The Dip helped me realize how much time I was spending on things that didn't matter or contribute to my ultimate goal.    I have feeling this book could have been much longer. But I believe it's brevity is it's major strength. Godin gets right to his main points so that you don't waste time! I can't tell you how many business books I read that were worthless apart from a few chapters. I found the entire book useful.    The only question I have (and I would be interested in Godin's response) is  what does he think about hobbies, or those things we do for the simple fun of it?
1400063515|2.0|The concept is useful but delivered in a very wordy and condescending manner.  It felt like I was back in college sitting through a rambling lecture by an absent-minded, self-absorbed professor (terrible flash backs!).  The whole book could have been 100 pages without losing impact or meaning.    Most investors understand and accept the persistence of fat-tailed return distribution. Not so difficult. So why does he go on as if most people don't get the concept...    Anyways, I am curious as to how he invests for himself given what he preaches.  How good is his track record, or is he all talk...  In his next edition, he should add just one more page in this painfully drawn out book and publish his personal track record...the way Warren Buffett and Joel Greenblatt do.
1582701709|2.0|I like the physical presentation of the book including the size of the book,letterings, and colors of the pages.  I especially like the different page printings.  It is very easy and relaxing to look at the pages.  I have only gotten about 1/3 through the book and I have mixed feeling so far.  I think the basic idea of the book is the \\"power of positive thinking\\" of which I am a firm believer.....as of now I am finding it hard to get back to it but will finish just because that is the only fair way to really access the book for myself.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Absolutely wonderful show!  Couldn't wait to get the DVD set, and have been having a blast watching it all over again!  A must have for all science fiction fans!  A show that makes you use your brain and have fun at the same time, what more could you ask for? Simply put it's FANTASTIC!
B00006IU73|5.0|\\"Death in absentia is a legal term describing the status of a person who has been declared legally dead. This occurs when an individual disappears but no identifiable remains can be located.\\"- Wikipedia. A fitting title for Porcupine Tree's concept album concerning a pycho killer from his point of view. As always, Steven Wilson's lyrics are not always bright and cheerful, but they do paint a dismal portrait of a twisted mind using an economy of words beautifully. The music takes several spins to sink in properly and once it does you will be hooked by another PT masterpiece.  Amazon's reviewer refered to their brand of music as \\"Alt/Prog\\" and I can live with that. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes heavy metal, proggressive, alternative, and good old rock and roll.
B000GY729M|4.0|The title says the bulk of how I feel.  I listen to the album in its entirety whenever I listen to it... I like every song though there are some that I like more than others (which is the same with Hot Fuzz).      The music is a bit bolder, and a bit more grandiose (musically and lyrically), but the synth is still there and after giving the album a listen or 3 you'll be singing along to each track.  The lead singer's (Flowers) voice sounds a bit different to me on this album, but not for better or worse, just slightly different.  The album definitely seems to be more mature (but I have no idea where the Springsteen analogy came from), the songs and the hooks aren't as poppy (at least not in every song) and it takes more than one listening for some songs to grow on you.  (For instance I didn't like 'Sams Town' (track 1) the first couple times I heard it, but now its one of my favorites).      Overall, if you like popular music, or alternative music in general... its worth listening to, but I wouldn't expect a life altering experience.

B000PA9Q6E|5.0|This cd is a new release of a concert tour in 1977 with Muddy Waters, Johnny Winter and James Cotton. I vacillated for days before I bought this. I have deducted, that listening to the thirty second sound bites, are worthless, especially when making a decision on electric blues. In 30 seconds, the guy might not even be done tuning his guitar! I'm going to attempt, to help you, not to have to go through, the anguish, that I went through, before I made the decision to buy this cd. First of all, you can tell how much these three guys like each other. Since this is a live performance, you hear them kidding each other throughout each song. One guy sings: \\"Your mother ought to know...\\" And one of the guys not singing lead, is yelling: \\"Yea tell em!\\" or you hear enthusiastic screams like: \\"Ow!\\" \\"Yea\\" \\"Do it James!\\" \\"Do it Johnny\\", etc. I personally think James Cotton, and his mind blowing \\"harp\\" (For you non-experienced blues neophytes, that's his harmonica! Please make a note of that!) steals the whole show. That magic harp of his, is either screeching, scratching, waling, and always cooking. If I were to try to draw a verbal picture for you, of the type of blues these fella's are playing, I'd say, think about an old black and white detective movie, and you're inside a bar, smoke is slowly circling its way to the ceiling, and in the background you hear the blues. That's the kind of blues on this cd. James Cotton, when he's not blowing the \\"harp\\", showcases a voice, that sounds like its seen, a lot of cigarettes, a lot of whiskey, a lot of women, and left it with the blues. This entire cd, is old-time \\"roadhouse\\", feeling good, blues. There are 11 songs, totaling just under sixty minutes. This is a classic taste, of old-time jamming, ELECTRIC BLUES, with the \\"harp\\", being the pulse, that never misses a blue beat! Buy this!

0316067598|5.0|[[ASIN:0316067598 Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10]]    I don't read many books cover to cover. The last one I read was Scott O'grady's story about his escape and evasion after being shot down behind enemy lines.    Marcus Luttrell's account of his ordeal captivated me and I found the book hard to put down. He offers perspective on our enemies and an insight on how the ROE's (Rules of Engagement)handed down from the left, are tying the hands of our nation's finest, and can be at the expense of our own. We're at war and it sounds alot like Vietnam, during which I served proudly.  Can do!
0375830995|2.0|When I first picked up this book, I was riveted.  I had to know who Ed would be delivering messages to, and how.  Then see the effect on him afterward.  And when Ed finished hearts, I nearly cried with happiness.<br /><br />Then I turned the page.<br /><br />Oh, how I wish I hadn't.  I understood who the mystery person was, which is what ruins everything.  It takes this beautiful story and turns it into a sermon.  He preached about everything that he'd implied when Ed finished hearts.  It almost felt like he didn't think his readers would \\"get it,\\" so he added that last part just to make sure.  I find that very disappointing, and a bit insulting.  He should have more faith in his readers.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Bon Jovi has done it again.  This is a great CD.  It is very different than much of their music, but the music and lyrics are fantastic.  Lost Highway, Make a Memory, Whole Lot of Leaving, Any other day, Seat next to you, ........I could go on and on.  They are all fabulous.  The duet with LeAnn Rimes, Stranger, is fabulous, incredible lyrics.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't sit down to watch Firefly when it first aired on television.  I love scifi, but can't stand westerns.  So when Firefly aired with that western feel, I changed the channel, then promptly forgot about it.<br /><br />Years later, a friend of mine badgered me into borrowing his DVDs, and made me promise to watch at least four episodes.  I grudgingly agreed.  I was hooked after the first.  I kicked myself, hard, for not giving the show a try when it was on television, for not lending my voice to the fans who tried to keep the show on the air, and for not trusting that Joss Whedon can spin an amazing story no matter the setting.<br /><br />The characters felt real, some episodes had me clutching my sides with laughter, and the subtle plot clues promised many enjoyable seasons.  It's a shame they didn't happen.<br /><br />After watching all the episodes on my friend's DVD set, I went out and bought my own.  :)
B00002493G|3.0|This 1993 album is an ambitious project that does not come across as cohesive but contains some great songs. In overall sound, it reminds me of [[ASIN:B000NA2348 Young Americans]] but it is even more detached, like his plastic soul style carried to the extreme.<br /><br />It opens with the semi-instrumental The Wedding, a beautiful lilting melody which is followed by You've Been Around, a song that doesn't go anywhere. The funky texture of I Feel Free makes it a worthy cover and the title track, a duet with Al B Sure, is quite engaging with its complex arrangement.<br /><br />Jump They Say, Pallas Athena and Nite Flights, the Scott Walker cover, are all interesting but not really emotionally appealing. I like Miracle Goodnight with its rhythmic and vocal variety but the jazzy ballad Don't Let Me Down comes across as unfocused and messy. Looking For Lester is a lively jazz instrumental and the album concludes with The Wedding Song, a vocal reprise of the stylish opening track.<br /><br />The problem with Black Tie, White Noise, is that although pleasant to listen to, the music does not remain with you for long. With a few exceptions like the two Wedding Songs, the tracks are not memorable. I recommend this album only to hardcore fans or Bowie completists.
0061191981|5.0|This book gave me an in depth look at Gordon Ramsey and his need for perfection.  It was well written...the only part I had trouble with was his English phrases, well known to him but not to the everyday American.  It was an easy read!
0385522401|2.0|The author is dead on in his description of sexual frustration, I'll hand him that. One does indeed feel as though one knew these people, because what he is describing in the end is the fear of sexual contact. These days such experiences are rare, because by the time they are married, most people have been around the block. But fifty years ago in the world McEwan describes, sex came for the first time on honeymoon night. If the couple can be described as naive, it is only in this one area; otherwise they are sophisticated, if not jaded. The bride is having a hard time accepting French kissing, and fears she may vomit if he probes too deeply. He is afraid he may experience ecstasy before she's ready. This is described in excruciating detail. In fact, the details pile up until one is taking the bride's side: This sex business is an ordeal. The couple is a nervous wreck. The reader finds oneself wondering how the modern age ever was born with this sort of Victorian repression pressing so heavily. This all sounds very 19th  century but the author is right to locate this so very late in the 20th century. We may never be free of it. These deeply disturbed individuals need help  - not just sexual counseling but probing psychoanalysis and possibly shock treatment. In this sense the book is a revelation - what in God's name was done to these decent people in their childhood to make them so sick? We believe them to be permanently scarred. McEwan no doubt accomplishes what he set out to achieve, but I wonder if it was worth the trouble.

B000MGUZKM|5.0|I attended their concert last night in Istanbul, Turkey. They played their songs from this album and expectedly, Street Life, and some other tunes. I had a great time and the music was a feast. The crowd was enchanted by Randy's voice, and Mr. Sample had a very good connection with the audience. My favorites were her interpretations of Feeling Good and Tell Me More and More. I hope she sings a lot more in the years to come.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|While I'm not the biggest Scorps fan, I really like this a lot. You can hear that the band is having a blast. The sound is very good and balanced, and the performance is intense. Sad for me to say that I never checked out their early (pre-Mattias Jabs)material--and it's my loss--when it was first released. Now that I have, I can honestly say I like the early stuff better. This one's hard to get tired of and is becoming one of my favorite live albums. Get it, at least, to hear Uli Jon Roth tear it up.

B00005JPHV|5.0|It's no secret what a travesty privatized health care has become in this country, but leave it to political firebrand and social provocateur Michael Moore to present our dismal situation with his unique combination of passion and insouciance in this compelling 2007 documentary. Coupled with his innate showmanship, his dexterity in making his viewpoint seem like the logical one is what makes his films resonate in ways that make more fair-minded filmmakers pallid by comparison. This time, his target is almost too easy, that the entire health care industry needs to be overhauled. In order to prepare for his film, Moore made an open online plea to Americans to share their own health-care horror stories, and in turn, he received over 25,000 e-mails.<br /><br />The film's first half dives into the most egregious cases of those who paid their insurance premiums to feel secure about their medical coverage only to discover that their insurance companies abandon them when they needed them the most. Several of these accounts are inevitably heartbreaking, and Moore is wise to let those victimized by the system speak for themselves without his prodding. The capper is the 1996 Congressional testimony of Dr. Linda Peeno, a former medical examiner for Humana, who confesses that her top priority was to save the company money and how in turn, the company rewarded bonuses to examiners who denied the most number of claims. The second half shows Moore in more familiar form as he acerbically visits Canada, Great Britain, France, and Cuba, all countries where free health care is available.<br /><br />The international section is where Moore makes his most pointed jabs in showing how socialized medicine has worked almost too effortlessly elsewhere. Although he does not divulge the substantial amount of government funding needed to subsidize these programs, Moore successfully makes the intentional oversight beside the point, as these nations simply emphasize how dysfunctional our HMO system has become. Former Member of Parliament Tony Benn is particularly insightful in explaining the rationale behind free medical care in the U.K. and how it was borne out of the ongoing bombings going on during WWII. The most interesting and controversial sequence is when Moore takes a group of perpetually ill 9/11 volunteers by boat first to Guantanamo Bay to see if they can receive the same medical treatment being received by the terrorists imprisoned there and then to Havana to get the health care they have been denied in this country.<br /><br />The filmmaker somehow manages the precarious balance between funny and poignant throughout the film. He, however, is not without his self-aggrandizing moments, for example, in taking the occasional potshot at Bush, which while funny, is not terribly relevant here. What is pertinent is a taped conversation in 1971 between Nixon and his chief aide John Ehrlichman about passing legislation which would give birth to the current, profit-seeking concept of HMOs. Moore couldn't help himself by mentioning an anonymous $12,000 check to the Webmaster of an anti-Moore site, who could not afford his wife's mounting medical bills. Naturally, the anonymous donor was Moore. Regardless, he hits his valid points about the U.S. health care system hard and with both emotional precision and idiosyncratic finesse. For that alone, this film is essential viewing.mer Member of Parliament Tony Benn is particularly insightful in explaining the rationale behind free medical care in the U.K. and how it was borne out of the ongoing bombings going on during WWII.

1400032717|3.0|Knowing a bit about autism I guess may have detracted from my enjoyment of this book. Whilst this was a refreshing way of writing, it is certainly not a literary masterpiece, though I guess it does not pretend to be one. The story itself, given it is fiction, is a little weak, and I found in parts a little laboured. If you want to see things from the autistic point of view please go for this text-all the classic traits are carefully presented. As a story per se...too depressing for me. By the way the authors atheist perspective is unnecessarily utilised here when it need not be mentioned at all.
0736063684|5.0|I have the original first edition of this title, and I continue to refer to it for fun and inspiration.  This second edition, however, has a few extra pages on common sports injuries associated with the various body parts worked, which is excellent.  Unfortunately, everything is done is an \\"overview\\" manner so further details will require reference to another text.  However, as the introductory book to strength training and weight-lifting that this is clearly intended to be, it is quite excellent, and now all the more so by giving some attention to the topic of sports injuries.  They should hand copies of this book out at every gym!!
B000O76PEE|4.0|Frankly, i wish megadeth win the grammy. This new album called 'united abomination' is great.The first 5 track are fast, heavy but melodic too. Others track still good but the most interesting is the solo part on the end track called 'burnt ice' .....increase your volume before listen! The japan release come with bonus track 'Out On The Tiles', another great performance from the deth dealing with cover version. Surely...one of the best metal album of the year. If you have more money, get the japan release one. Enjoy the cd.

1592401791|2.0|I have never been so anxious to read a book and subsequently so let down by one. One would think that Emerick, with help from McCartney, were the only two responsible for the Beatles success. It seemed to pain him to give George Martin any credit what-so-ever and the three remaining Beatles were trashed on nearly every page. It seems as though he feels he must tear everyone else down to make improve his own status. This man is clearly bitter that he hasn't achieved the legendary status of Martin and the Beatles. But what he forgets is that to Beatles fans he has! It is also clear that the book is so slanted toward McCartney that it almost gives it a ring a fiction and gossip rather than an inside look at the music, which is what we all thought the book was going to be about. I gave this book two stars because there were a few interesting nuggets in it, but really it deserves one star for turning what should have been a landmark book into a gossip column.

B000M4RG42|1.0|\\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is a globdiferous film of twisted storytelling and bent logics.  The essential objection that I would raise against it is its negativism.  From  professional reviews all the way through the amateur reviews,  it is generally conceded that the film adopts a cynical view of heroism.<br /><br />  It may be nothing more than the Director's fiat,  but  it is sufficient as a theme to find resonance in a host of equally negativistic reviewers who wish to deny the sacrifices of  the Marine and Navy personnel who fought the battle,  and find some obscure angle from which to hold forth authoritatively  and show delight in heaping their scorn and contempt upon those who sacrificed for their fellow combatants and their nation.<br /><br />  Thus far,  not a single claim that this film reveals some kind of a TRUTH has been substantiated, and I believe I've challenged each and every reviewer who made that ridiculous claim.<br /><br />  Yet another common contradiction which appears in reviews is that it is suggested that the Marine and Navy personnel  engaged in the bond drive were suffering variously from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  or Combat Fatigue,  alcoholism,  and all other manner of diagnosis grounded in the nature of their combat experience.  What is peculiar in this regard is that many reviewers still engage in polemics supporting the film's  characterization of these men as something other than heroes.<br /><br />Can you see that?  They were in combat,  and suffered for it by this characterization,  but because the film generates such a negative view of these men,  the reviewers decide to mimic the film's negativism to deny that these men were heroes or heroic at all;  but the same reviewers will claim that the men suffered as a result of their experiences in combat. This contradiction permits the reviewer to argue both ways at once.<br /><br />  The logical dialogue might go like this:<br /><br /> Did the men endure horrific combat?  Yes.<br /> Did the horrific combat induce stress and other maladies?  Yes<br /> Were the men heroes?  NO.<br /> Why weren't the men heroes?  Well,  because  they weren't the original men who raised the flag.<br /> So only the original men who raised the flag were heroes and no other men fighting on the island could be characterized as heroic?  Yes.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />  There is another issue which comes into play in considering whether this film is respectful of the men who fought in the battle for Iwo Jima. Although it may not be apparent at first.  The film and those whose reviews endorse the film, claim that the film abolishes MYTHS regarding heroes and heroism.  This is a continuation of the film's negativistic suggestibility.<br /><br />  I would like to indicate that the film industry itself is accountable for the popularization of certain MYTHS concerning heroes and heroism.  Film  like \\"RAMBO\\" and even  Eastwood's  portrayal of Sgt. Tom Highway in \\"HEARTBREAK RIDGE\\"  convey an image of the American military that is largely MYTHOLOGICAL, and it capitalizes on this for purposes of profit.<br /><br />  Afterward,  \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is credited with destroying  the MYTH of the American  heroes  fighting on Iwo Jima,  including the American heroes who served on  the bond drive.<br /><br />  Also,  the film never does make it explicit whether the Marine and Navy personnel either  WERE  or  WERE NOT  heroes.  The film creates a confusing scenario of flashbacks  which confuses the chronology and the viewers perception of events.  By this standard, interestingly enough,  one could call into question whether the film is a great film.<br /><br />  The film also confuses FACT & MYTH  by  the shifting and some of the worst stereotyping of characters  as has ever been presented in films.  Several characters serve in this negative stereotyping.<br /><br />(1) the businessman on the train offering  post-war jobs<br /><br />(2) the manager of the bond drive, who is so easily targeted for public contempt<br /><br />(3)  the tourists approaching Ira Hayes in the farm field to snap a photograph.<br /><br />  This is merely cunning film-makiing, not brilliant film making.  There really isn't that much of a distinction between obvious propaganda  and \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" the film is so manipulative that it becomes itself,  a form of the very type of propaganda effort it purports to expose and condemn.<br /><br />  Finally,  I would like to fault the film for the simple fact that it just isn't  fun.  As a purchase,  I'm very disappointed  with it for its broken storytelling and  its flashbacks.<br /><br />  I find justification for comparisons between \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" and other films.  For example,  it is clear that \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" was an attempt to show great respect for the  \\"citizen soldiers\\" who participated in the Normandy landings on D-Day, 6 June 1944 and afterward.  It showed very carefully,  what the men were, and what they did.<br /><br />  In direct contrast,  \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" shows many characters as different from what we have historically accepted them to be.  The negative stereotyping, the confusing  handling of the subject of Heroes and Heroics  leaves the viewer with a hollow empty feeling, a cynicism about the self-sacrifice of many American families whose sons never returned,  or returned home  with injury.<br /><br />  You see,  the very nature of heroism, is that it is itself a kind of truth.  It isn't a truth merely because it is portrayed in some movie or book, or even with a medal.  The men who sacrifice,  whether it was Marines in Korea on Pork Chop Hill, or at the Chosin Reservoir, or in South Vietnam,  or the Army personnel landing on Normandy on D-Day,  or even an American Infantryman fighting at Concord Massachussets during the American Revolution.  Self-sacrifice and the shedding of blood  is honored in the hearts of those those who saw it as their duty to give of their life to the uttermost, and in the hearts of those who were there to witness.<br /><br />  I am deeply offended in this film. Those men gave all so that Americans would remain free, to enjoy life, to write books and make movies.  I just don't think they made the sacrifice in expectation that their own people would turn and and depict them as hypocrits and villains and phonies and liars.<br /><br />  ***[They've actually been called all of these in various reviews of this movie on Amazon.  Look at that;  HYPOCRITS,  VILLAINS,  PHONIES, and LIARS]***<br /><br />Furthermore,  to present these men as  \\"victims\\" of prejudices,  as though the world had to be perfect before  the men made their sacrifices, is also absurd. You see, that is the nature of the genuine hero. He doesn't sacrifice only because the world is perfect and free of prejudice. The Hero sacrifices himself so that the world can become perfect.<br /><br /> Those who expect that the world  must be perfect,  before  giving of themselves or performing a sacrifice,  are not actually living.  It was Confucius, I believe,  who indicated that those who fear death,  die a thousand times.  --Semper Fidelis,  Bruce Bain(3)  the tourists approaching Ira Hayes in the farm field to snap a photograph.

Finally,  I would like to fault the film for the simple fact that it just isn't  fun.  As a purchase,  I'm very disappointed  with it for its broken storytelling and  its flashbacks.          I find justification for comparisons between \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" and other films.  For example,  it is clear that \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" was an attempt to show great respect for the  \\"citizen soldiers\\" who participated in the Normandy landings on D-Day, 6 June 1944 and afterward.   It showed very carefully,  what the men were, and what they did.       In direct contrast,  \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" shows many characters as different from what we have historically accepted them to be.  The negative stereotyping, the confusing  handling of the subject of Heroes and Heroics  leaves the viewer with a hollow empty feeling, a cynicism about the self-sacrifice of many American families whose sons never returned,  or returned home  with injury.         You see,  the very nature of heroism, is that it is itself a kind of truth.  It isn't a truth merely because it is portrayed in some movie or book, or even with a medal.  The men who sacrifice,  whether it was Marines in Korea on Pork Chop Hill, or at the Chosin Reservoir, or in South Vietnam,   or the Army personnel landing on Normandy on D-Day,  or even an American Infantryman fighting at Concord Massachussets during the American Revolution.  Self-sacrifice and the shedding of blood  is honored in the hearts of those those who saw it as their duty to give of their life to the uttermost, and in the hearts of those who were there to witness.I am deeply offended in this film. Those men gave all so that Americans would remain free, to enjoy life, to write books and make movies.  I just don't think they made the sacrifice in expectation that their own people would turn and and depict them as hypocrits and villains and phonies and liars.      ***[They've actually been called all of these in various reviews of this movie on Amazon.  Look at that;  HYPOCRITS,   VILLAINS,   PHONIES, and LIARS]***     Furthermore,  to present these men as  \\"victims\\" of prejudices,  as though the world had to be perfect before  the men made their sacrifices, is also absurd. You see, that is the nature of the genuine hero. He doesn't sacrifice only because the world is perfect and free of prejudice. The Hero sacrifices himself so that the world can become perfect.       Those who expect that the world  must be perfect,  before  giving of themselves or performing a sacrifice,  are not actually living.  It was Confucius, I believe,  who indicated that those who fear death,  die a thousand times.  --Semper Fidelis,  Bruce Bain

0316010669|3.0|The content was fascinating and the writing was engaging (though with more vulgarity than was necessary.) However, the book promised in the beginning promised to teach the reader how to make use of the principles. Perhaps I was reading into it more than it said, but that is what I understood the promise to be. At the end, I was left hanging. It was the work of a journalist, who discussed what others have done, but ended abruptly with no usefulness.    (This was from the audiobook version.)
B000MCH5P4|4.0|\\"Babel\\", as the title suggests, is partly about miscommunication and misunderstanding caused by culture, language and even hearing impairment. Its other subtext is that as human beings we all share the same human concerns - love, loss, importances of family. And that we sometimes do silly things.<br /><br />In a technique used by other recent films (\\"Traffic\\", \\"Syriana\\", \\"Crash\\") \\"Babel\\" follows four connected stories - a father and his deaf daughter in Tokyo, a family of goat-herders in Morocco, an American couple travelling in Morocco recovering from the death of their baby, and their kids and Mexican nanny back in San Diego.<br /><br />The performances are all excellent including Brad Pitt as a troubled husband.<br /><br />The last half hour of the film is excruciating as some plot threads come together but the film resolves in a satisfying conclusion. \\"Babel\\" is a thoughtful commentary on an increasingly troubled world.

They save the conservation and environmental problems until the last dvd.  The other dvds show and decribe only the beauty and uniqueness of this earth.  I enjoyed the short clips at the end of each topic that talked about the difficulties they encountered in filming.  They often put their lives in danger to film this series.  You can't believe how beautiful it is until you see it.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|An extremely well done series. The photography (on HD) is beautiful and the series covers most of the major habitats on Earth. It shows what they are like with very few humans or human activities visible.
1596912855|5.0|I've been a Shannon Hale fan for awhile now (mostly due to her amazing lyrical writing and overall humor), so when I found she was writing an Austen-related book, I nearly squealed. I knew somehow I would find myself in the story.    I wasn't disappointed at all in Hale's writing; it still shines in this geared-for-adults novel and isn't clouded or tainted with lusty \\"harlequin\\" details that can be common with modern hommages to Austen. Austenland was hilarious, fun, and cleverly written! I can be a stickler for anachronisms, but I was too sucked into the language to even bother being overly critical. And of course, I found myself secretly wondering where I could find Pembrook Park...    The main character Jane Hayes goes back and forth with reality and fantasy. What is her reality? What is her idea of perfection? And does she really want this ideal? I think most Austen devotées toy with the same notions. Most women (including myself) idly wonder if there is such a thing as the \\"perfect man\\" for us. With this novel, we can at least live vicariously through Miss Hayes for a few hours.    All in all, the book rings with humorous self-assessment and ends with a \\"conclusion\\" that we all hope to have.    Like other reviewers, I do wish this book would have been longer. Many of the scenes and characters could have been fleshed out more, but I think it's a good sign when readers are craving for more.    I don't re-read very often, but I certainly will re-read this one in the future!

B0000AUHQF|5.0|Directed by David Anspaugh (\\"Hoosiers\\") and based on a true story, this triumphant film recounts the incredible odyssey of Ruetigger (played by a pitch-perfect Sean Astin), from dyslexic, small-town nobody to Holy Cross student, stadium groundskeeper, and unlikely tryout for the fabled Fighting Irish. Rudy's rugged path to achieving his dream is an admirable, uplifting journey, and Astin is tremendously likeable in the role, winning your heart and respect. Ned Beatty (as Rudy's humble dad), Charles Dutton, and Jason Miller round out a top-notch cast in this skillfully executed crowd-pleaser.
B00005ATQH|5.0|\\"How did they ever make a movie of 'Lolita'?\\"  So teased the posters for Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's classic and highly controversial [[ASIN:0679723161 novel]].  Anyone who's read the book would wonder the same thing.  Nabokov's masterwork is apparently unfilmable, because so much of the book rests upon his peerless storytelling skills and lush style.  But while Nabokov is a master of literature, Stanley Kubrick is a master of film, and with Nabokov himself scripting Kubrick's adaptation, they crafted what may very well be the best movie of \\"Lolita\\" that could ever be made.    Naturally, as the film was produced in the early 1960s, censorship prevented any of the more scandalous elements of Nabokov's novel from making it to the big screen.  A lot of the power of the book comes from those elements, and it seems any adaptation of the book made before the 1970s stretched the limits of censorship would fail.  It's a testament to the mastery of Stanley Kubrick that his film remains buoyant without any of that raunchiness.  In fact, though the lack thereof makes Kubrick's film such a different work than the book, it's those differences that make the movie so fascinating.    The story hasn't changed, though some elements have been changed slightly, and a few sections have been clipped.  Compressing the novel into a 153-minute film is quite impressive, especially since it never once feels like something is missing or like Kubrick's rushing through things.  His timing is impeccable, and his structuring of the tale is nothing short of masterful, particularly beginning with the chronological end of the story.  All this is captured through daring photography by Oswald Morris, who, interestingly, never worked on any other Kubrick film.    So much of the effectiveness of the film should be credited to the cast.  James Mason delivers the performance of his career.  His Humbert Humbert is a very normal and very human character, not someone like Peter Lorre'spedophile in \\"[[ASIN:B00065GX64 M]].\\"  From the film's beginning, Kubrick paints Humbert as a sympathetic figure, very successfully.  Maybe that's because his attraction to the titular nymphette is made all the more conceivable by Sue Lyon, whose beauty, spunk, and youthfulness is perfect for the part.  Similarly, we sympathize with her mother and Humbert's brief wife, played by Shelley Winters, whose character is a pathetic one indeed.      Kubrick makes the movie work so well because we are on the side of Humbert.  When Peter Sellers' crafty Clare Quilty, who came off as a vaguely heroic figure in Nabokov's novel, steals Lolita from him, we don't cheer - we feel sorry for poor Mr. Humbert.    On top of this, there's seamless editing by Anthony Harvey (who also edited \\"[[ASIN:B0002XNSY0 Dr. Strangelove]]\\"), and a score by Nelson Riddle which is nothing short of delightful.  One particular cue, which has a rock-oriented sound accompanied by childish \\"la-la\\"-ing, is wonderful.    The most impressive part of the film, however, is the transition from page to screen through Nabokov's screenplay.  Nabokov's script is an exercise in excellent adaptation, brilliantly condensing his novel while retaining the key elements, transferring certain techniques from the book (such as Humbert's narration) to the screen, modifying scenes ever-so-slightly in order to make the film work as a whole.  Most movies based on books simply borrow the source work's storyline and primary characters, then modify them as they see fit to make a good movie.  Perhaps never in history has an adaptation been so true as Nabokov's.    To ever bring Nabokov's \\"Lolita\\" to the screen in its entirety is impossible.  Too much of the tale relies on its telling in literary format by so detailed and vibrant a writer as Nabokov.  Nevertheless, Kubrick's \\"Lolita\\" is probably as fine an adaptation of the book as one could ever hope for.  It is generally agreed that it's not one of his most brilliant works, but thanks to a superb cast, masterfully-structured filmmaking, and a flalwess translation through Nabokov's screenplay, it remains one of his most interesting, enjoyable, and perhaps undervalued efforts.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Dismissed by some for turning the Holocaust into tasteless humor, Benigni's Oscar-winning comedy is actually a tragic, poignant story carefully swathed in a flurry of wacky gags and witty hilarity, courtesy of the talented star/director. \\"Life\\" begins as a delightfully frenetic love fable in which goofy waiter Guido charms and wins over Braschi's Dora, then turns into a spirited look at Guido's efforts to shield his son with the gift of humor and fantasy--a manic, heartfelt performance for which Benigni won a Best Actor Oscar. Though it tackles a tough subject with surprising exuberance, \\"Life\\" never feels cheap.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|Unfortunately, I think a lot of people expect this movie to be something its not when they rent it which would account for some of its negative ratings because this is a great great movie.  Just keep an open mind when watching it, and dont dont try to figure out whats going on in the middle becasue it makes sense in the end. This is one of my favorite movies because of it's ability to use subtleties to scare the crap out of you.  I've watched this movie over 10 times and i still find things out about it every time i watch.  It's not a very popular movie so it's kinda hard to find but if you can find it, its definitly worth it.
6305308659|5.0|\\"Pleasantville\\" is a sparkling, witty, highly original film that examines the nasty underside of quaint family values as they are embodied in every age, especially as it critiques the social rigidity of black and white (i.e. prejudice) with its thinly veiled conceit of \\"color\\" (i.e. diversity, individuality). William H. Macy and Joan Allen are well cast as the teens' parents, playing nicely off Maguire's low-key, conformist David/ \\"Bud\\" and Witherspoon's wild girl. Enhanced by some charming special effects, \\"Pleasantville\\" is a blissful comic fantasy with a message of tolerance for us all.
B0002JJBZY|4.0|So, where to start this review ? Shall I talk about the content and what impact Star Trek-The Original Series (henceforth referred to as \\"TOS\\") has made on the imagination and conscience of SF-lovers ever since? Neh, besides from mentioning that TOS has done for TV-SF, what \\"Forbidden Planet\\" and \\"2001, a Space Oddessey\\" have done for cinema-SF (granted, in hindsight), namely providing us with well written and often thought provoking SF (admittedly with the occasional exceptions) ever since, me think not, others have done this on this site, the web and in writing far more eloquently than I'll ever be able to do. Let's face it, SF , before them on the small as well as the big screen has been juvenile and \\"aiming for kicks\\" at best for most of the time. That we now enjoy the well written and thought provoking TV-shows and Movies, is in no small part due to the before mentioned events.    So, instead let's talk about releases. Albeit long, long overdue it is gratifying that Paramount finally released TOS in a format a series of the stature of TOS deserves. Not that they had a choice though. In this DVD-age other studios very early on understood that fans of TV-shows wanted to have their favourite shows released in tight season wise boxed dvd-sets (Fox-studios has to be credited for this insight, for being one of the first in regard to the X-Files series). Paramount was relatively late in understanding this. But picked up on the idea when they brought out The \\"Next Generation\\"\\"-series and the subsequent Star Trek series, at least where DVD-releases were concerned.    A small history lesson is at it's place here. When Paramount Studios took over Desilu Studios in the late sixties (if memory serves Star Trek was well into it's second season), they were gunning for the then hit-series \\"Mission Impossible\\", no matter what they have stated since then. \\"Star Trek\\" was just part of the bargain and really not wanted. However when \\"Star Trek\\" begot a life of it's own far after cancellation, Paramount very, very slowly began to realise that they inadvertently hit upon the unintended motherload. To this date, the acquirement of \\"Star Trek\\" must stand out as the most profitable deal in TV-history. Paramount has earned billions on a show they didn't pay squat for (remember: They were after \\"Mission Impossible\\"). The result? Especially US-based fans have been paying very dearly ever since (quite literally) for releases aimed at maximizing earnings for the studio. The 1-episode/tape videotapes (repeated for the \\"Next Generation\\"-,\\"DS-9\\"-and \\"Voyager\\" series) and 2 episode/disc dvd-releases are the most evident examples that come to mind. In stark contrast, we Europeans were treated better. Even the poorest of our releases at least contained 2 episodes. Especially the latter release (2-episode/disc dvd-release) has stirred up some strong emotions amongst US-fans after the boxed sets were released, judging from some of the reviews I've read and in my modest opinion rightly so, since they were released at approximately the same time Star Trek- TNG boxed-sets were being released (A fate we Europeans were blissfully spared), Although I agree in small part with one reviewer, who stated that the \\"complainers\\" could not resist \\"instant gratification\\", fact remains that Paramount took advantage of the passion of dedicated people, much like your average street corner dope dealer does. They have not done so with overseas fans (although w've had our share of confusing releases), we got the definitive dvd-version to date at the very first go (Makes you wonder though on how Hollywood considers it's own home public). Don't get me wrong though, I do not begrudge anyone making a buck, heck it is after all \\"The American Way\\" and for that matter everybody's way, American or otherwise, but let's keep it in context here. And as far as another gripe goes, their pricing policies: Yes, they are very expensive compared to other studios, however as long as w're willing to pay for it, we can not in all fairness complain. In this matter I can't really blame them (see my above statement), but only provided we are getting from the get go the version we want!!!    So back at business at hand, how do I rate this edition. Well I give it 4 stars, solely based on how it is released. We Europeans for once had a first, We got this edition before you Americans had (well over a year), mainly because the infamous 2 episode/disc-edition run was not completed yet at that time in the US-market. As far as I can ascertain the US-edition is both in packaging as in content exactly the same as the European one. Quite a few reviewers had gripes with the way the series were packaged i.e. in a hard plastic case per season. I grant them this: it is a bit ackward and yes not the very easiest of boxes to handle. However they are in line with the earlier European releases of the other Trek-series, with which the Americans are not familiar with, since they were issued with the more common standard slipcased cardboard box-sets. I can imagine that this series (together with the Animated Series-Box)looks like an ugly duckling on the shelves in any American Trek-dvdcollection, however on my shelves it does look quite natural with the other series which were released in Europe/Japan(as a limited edition) as hardplastic cased editions from the get go. From a commercial pointview, it made sense that this edition was brought out in the US, based on the European mold. And let's be honest, gripes notwithstanding, this is to date the most compact collection of TOS ever to be released.    Many reviewers commented also about the transfer being used for this edition...Here I've to agree to a considerable degree...Although something has been done for the better to the soundtracks, this is not necessarily so for picture. I know for a fact that there are least two transfer-version floating around. One is a US-version, cleaned up perhaps, used on the US-laserdisc edition and most likely used for ALL of the the dvd versions(including this and the European one). The second transfer-edition is a very much cleaned up (at the time called: re-mastered) version, then especially commissioned for the Japanese Laserdisc boxed version of TOS. I once owned a Japanese LD season-box. And truth to tell, at the time, it was much superior to the US-laserdisc edition picture qualitywise. Anyone who has ever imported Japanese discs, be it laserdisc or dvd, know that japanese do take their special editions very seriously and that their picture/sound-quality is second to none. This transfer is later used for the very last time (as far as I can ascertain) TOS has been released as VHS i.e. the (quite rare) 30th Anniversary UK-VHS edition (3, yes 3 episode/tape-edition, even for European standards quite unique)...But I'm quite sure this transfer-edition is not used for any of the dvd-releases. The big irony of this is that until the enhanced series is being released, that the Japanese LaserDisc boxed-sets is by far the most exceptional edition you could get, This discussion is, however, becoming quite moot though , since TOS is in a stage of being (digitally) re-mastered and enhanced at the moment. So expect a version being released in the future that is quite superior to everything been released to date. That being said however, this edition is the best affordable way to enjoy TOS to date, no matter what anyone else says...    On a final note. I come to my personal grievances to this release, namely the specials. I admit on being one of those nuts who are wanting their movies/tv-shows being released on dvd as complete as possible, specials and all...Or I want the most complete version commercially available and not being afraid to pay for it...That being said I found this edition of TOS lacking, much to my chagrin I've to add...This is not only true for this Trek-dvdincarnation but for others as well, on which I'll comment as I'll be able to. First things first,to be fair to Paramount, TOS is a very old show, shot in days were no one could even imagine the need for extra material intended for releases to the home market. Much of the extras had to be shot after the fact, simply because there were no contemporary extras salvaged at the time (However, there's this guy, Curt McAloney, who's made it his life mission to gather and restore as much of these extra's as possible, including some deleted scenes, which are not to be supposed to exist as is shown on his website \\"startrekhistory.com\\". Paramount definitively should contact this guy for future releases). Most interviews with cast for example concerning TOS were shot when they were doing the features and relied on their memories at the time, A very large proportion of the extras were made recently for this edition (a whopping 40 years after the fact, much like Paramount's \\"Once upon the West\\"), and admittedly quite well done, with some notable exceptions. However my gripe is that there are some glaring omissions and I'll just state the ones which come to mind:  -)The famous or infamous \\"Blooper-reel\\"; since the early 70ties this has been floating around fan circles and has almost become an legend of its own. Granted, the quality is poor but to have it denied is denying a part of trek-lore...  -)25th Anniversary Special; One of the best done specials about Trek ever...Hosted by Shatner it gives a light hearted overview of 25 years of Trek history. Released on both VHS and LaserDisc, officially endorsed by Paramount, this probably is the most painfull omission....  -)\\"Inside Star Trek, The Real Story\\" By H.Solow and R.Justman, based on the book with the same title. True, not sanctioned by Paramount. But the japanese LD-version gives an insight into the makings of TOS provided by two people who made Star Trek as much as possible as G.Roddenberry did: The Producers...True they have some perceived wrongs to correct (the moneygrabbing moguls, in which service they were supposedto be) but they provide an insight in the making of TOS from a different point of view, which would be a very, very welcome counterbalance to the self-congratulary and selfindulging statements made on the extra's(a mishap occurring on all the extra's of every trek-incarnation). The problem with all the extra's on every Trek-Dvd incarnation is that it sometimes feel like an ongoing glorification of the makers and performers of Trek who made it into the limelight...Some much needed perspective is called for...Her at least is one. Unfortunately Paramount doesn't have the guts to include this one despite their usual disclaimer that everything said does not neccessarily correspond with their (or their mothercompany's) view; So what else is new...  -)The introductions per episode by cast and guest stars for the  UK 30th Anniversary VHS-edition, mentioned above, especially from the ones who are  not around anymore...They have it, why not use them  -)The Discovery Channel Special:\\"How Star Trek Changed my Life\\" hosted by W.Shatner; True, this special (covering on how Trek science became reality in this day and age) was almost certainly still in the making when this set was brought out, but I mention it as a reminder for a future (enhanced ) release    These are omissions I  recall from the top of my head, but I'm sure that I'm missing a couple or so. Hopefully others will amend to these...It is also in conjunction with the transfer-issue the main reason why I can not give this edition the full rating of 5. However knowing the poor track record of Paramount in this respect, they have done a respectable job, Hopefully,very hopefully, their next release will include the remastered series along with the original ones (Japanese transfer, please) along with the omissions I mentioned above...For such a release I would be willing to open my coffers one more time, but knowing Paramount, I would not hold my breath...
6305910340|5.0|Warm, intelligent film boasts a powerhouse cast (including Laurence Fishburne, William H. Macy, Laura Linney, and David Paymer in support), and sends an important, often unheeded message about handling competition: the will to excel and win should always be counter-balanced by other interests, to cultivate a broader, balanced life perspective. For a touching, involving, and relevant family movie, search no further.
B00005QFE5|4.0|For generations, filmgoers have used the phrase \\"Betty Davis Eyes\\" to describe the ineluctable power that a charismatic actress can wield over an audience.  With this film, we have seen the launching of the phenomenon that will one day be call \\"Zhang Zi Yi Eyes.\\"  With a vividness reminiscent of Deborah Winger in \\"Terms of Endearment\\" Zhang embodies all the hopes, yearnings and passion that young village girls have learned not to express openly.  She can say it only with her eyes, and she does.  This is a simple tale, but one that holds the viewer, because it talks of things that are most vital -- literally the future of two people whose love for each other never wavers, and whose belief in their future binds them tightly.  The atmosphere is real, the action is genuine and the emotions are ones to which we can all relate.  This was the beginning of what has become a great career and makes it abundantly clear why Zhang has become such a huge star.
B00012QM8G|5.0|While Spielberg's most serious, personal work is inevitably disturbing, it also constitutes important viewing. The director demanded painstaking authenticity, and achieves it in a variety of ways, shooting the film on location in period-appropriate black and white. Both Neeson and Kingsley are convincing, but Fiennes stands out as the embodiment of sadistic evil. Grim and graphic in places, the film faithfully tells a true story about a flawed man who transcends his sins with one sustained act of courage.

0792838068|5.0|Filmed on a shoestring by Figgis, who also contributed the haunting jazz score, \\"Vegas\\" is a fearlessly downbeat love story about desperation and despair that was rapturously received at the box office in 1995. Cage won an Oscar for his gritty, go-for-broke portrayal of the suicidal Ben, and Shue made the leap from TV's \\"Melrose Place\\" to the big screen with her convincingly raw, Oscar-nominated performance--especially in one horrific motel scene. Adapted from John O'Brien's novel, \\"Vegas\\" is one cinematic bender that leaves a strangely blissful hangover.
0316067598|5.0|I have never before read such a story of courage, patriotism and strength of will. Probably never will again.     May God bless the SEALS and Marcus Luttrell as he studys to become a Doctor.
0790734850|5.0|Atmospheric, twisty thriller benefits from brisk pacing and lots of suspense, but it also manages to tell a rich, character-driven story. Crowe's smoldering Bud is a tightly wound spring, Pearce's Exley the quintessential straight arrow. Spacey almost steals it as Vincennes, a slick celebrity cop in the mold of Dragnet's Jack Webb. Basinger won the Supporting Actress Oscar as the bewitching Lynn, and Danny DeVito has a ball playing the editor of a sleazy tabloid. Top-notch noir, in living color.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Sophisticated, hand-drawn animation and an epic storyline about the conflict between ecology and the industrial ambitions of mankind turn Miyazaki's film into a marvelously potent parable. This unusually thoughtful and transporting tale never falls into a simplistic portrayal of good and evil, but rather asks how man and nature can live in harmony. Set in mystical, long-ago Japan and populated by wood spirits, nature gods, fierce demons, and other marvels of mythic dimension, \\"Mononoke\\" is a rare visual treat for dreamers of any age.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|The first mainstream film to deal squarely with the issue of AIDS, Demme's groundbreaking \\"Philadelphia\\" is a profoundly moving drama that digs into the ethics of how society views gay men. Strong performances by Best Actor winner Hanks as the ailing Beckett and Washington as a city lawyer who comes to see his client's disease not as a scourge to fear, but as an opportunity for compassion, will not leave a dry eye in your den. This is an eye-opening film, and still tremendously relevant today, with a memorable title song by Bruce Springsteen.
6305428522|5.0|Tackling the quiz-show scandals that rocked the days of early television, Robert Redford's intelligent, absorbing drama digs into the murky ethics of mass-media entertainment. Turturro and Fiennes are both excellent, playing antagonists whose ethnicity is as much a concern to image-conscious programmers as their smarts. Paul Scofield won an Oscar for his turn as Van Doren's patrician father, while Rob Morrow is memorable as a Boston attorney who helps Turturro blow the whistle. \\"Quiz Show\\" remains one of cinema's best meditations on our tricky dealings with the almighty tube.
B0000639FE|5.0|Cameron Crowe's directorial breakthrough (he also scripted) is an infectious comedy-romance buoyed by a star-making turn from Zellwegger, and an Oscar-winning comic performance from Gooding. Young Lipnicki is pretty appealing too, and all provide Cruise with plenty of opportunities to shine. Razor-sharp yet very human satire ends up really warming the heart.
B0006J28L4|5.0|Built around a commanding performance by Denzel Washington, Spike Lee's \\"Malcolm X\\" is the writer-director's most ambitious, impassioned film to date, as it presents a turbulent and eventful life filled with self- transformation. The Oscar-nominated Washington never lets you forget his hero's fiery charisma, the emotional impact and candor of his speeches, or the resentment he faced from both sides of the racial divide. With a top-notch cast, and Ernest Dickerson's fluid camerawork creating immediacy, \\"Malcolm X\\" bristles with energy and impact.
B000A88EV4|5.0|Leigh created his most disturbing and loathsome character in the garrulous drifter Johnny, but his brilliance is in making us empathize with this viciously sociopathic personality. Thewlis gives a virtuosic performance as Johnny, spewing abrasive, apocalyptic vitriol about women, God, and bourgeois society, when he isn't simply humiliating those in his immediate vicinity, like Louise and Sophie. Dreary settings and encounters with a variety of sad characters transform Johnny's bleak rants into an indictment of sorts against England's rotting welfare state. Not for all tastes, \\"Naked\\" is raw, fierce, and unforgettable.
B00008RH3L|5.0|A sharp, innovative send-up of everything from \\"The Public Enemy\\" to \\"The Godfather,\\" Joel and Ethan Coen's brilliant \\"Crossing\\" has enough surprising twists, gnarled plotlines, and double crosses to fill several noir movies. Byrne is excellent as Tom, a loyal, boozing mobster whose inveterate gambling and torrid affair with the boss's girl (Harden, in her debut), eventually land him in hot water with Finney's Leo. Coens fave Turturro also has a brilliant turn as the weaselly Bernie. Evocative, clever, and beautifully played, \\"Crossing\\" is an under-rated homage to the gangster movies perfected by Warners in the 1930s.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Based on Michael Crichton's best-seller, this nerve-jangling monster movie takes time to gather steam, but once it does, look out! Groundbreaking computer effects make dinosaurs frighteningly real, and once more, Spielberg knows just how to build tension, inch by gut-wrenching inch. The initial Tyrannosaurus scene is downright terrifying (particularly the first time around), along with those raptors in the kitchen. Whole cast is fine (including Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight in supporting roles), but make no mistake: the dinos are the real stars. Original feature is vastly superior to the two sequels.

0060578793|5.0|This book is priceless, it literally teaches you everything you need to know about surviving in just about any situation. I may not ever find myself needing this knowledge but if i did, i will be glad that i bought this book and had a good time reading it.
1596912855|5.0|Talk about a dream come true this would be such a fun place to visit. This book gave such great details that you felt you were right there with them. I can't say anything negative about this book except I wish it was longer it was to short I would have loved to read more. If you're looking for another similar book try Me and Mr. Darcy another great book.
0060736267|5.0|I read this book in my late teens as part of required reading in a high school lit class I loved it then I loved it even more as a adult.    This book has an old soul feel to it. I loved reading about that time in America.  Though it was very sad it still shows what America was made of; courage, inter strength, family & love.  Growing up to be a responsible adult even with the odds against you.    Betty Smith was a powerful writer with strong characters.  I felt I was watching one of those old movies and took comfort in some how knowing that everybody was going to be ok in end.  Well done Betty Smith
B000OCXFCO|5.0|The Megadeath realse United Abominations is great!! it has awesome sound and great song writing if you like metal this is a must have
B000ICL3KG|5.0|No matter how you feel about Al Gore, you should see this movie.  It's time (actually it's long over due) for us to start thinking about what we are doing to our environment and this movie does a great job of getting you to think!  If we all just started making small changes it could make a HUGE difference.  Our family made some changes after watching this and we have committed to continue trying to do what we can to preserve the Earth.  We switched all of our light bulbs to compact florescent bulbs and we are using reusable bags for all of our shopping...it doesn't seem like much, but it's a  start and if everyone did it the impact would be significant.  If the movie can motivate others....I say watch it.  The scenery is breathtaking....just see it RIGHT NOW!
B000002JSP|5.0|In Through the Out Door has been the subject of mixed opinions for quite some time.  True, the album wasn't regarded as a classic the year it came out, but over time I think people are slowly but surely beginning to realize the quality of the songwriting is pretty much on the same level that it used to be for the Zepsters.    My dad is convinced that \\"In the Evening\\" is the only song on the album that stands up with everything else the band had done previously.  I might agree, to a certain extent.  I mean, it's a really experimental type song that actually works well.  \\"South Bend Saurez\\" is perhaps the most under-appreciated song on the entire album.  It's SO catchy, I love it!    \\"Fool in the Rain\\" has a nice rhythm section and pretty good vocals too.  It's the kind of vocal melody that grows on you, or more specifically, something you'll appreciate more when you're by yourself and listening to it on headphones.  \\"Hot Dog\\" is just a short funny little rocker.  \\"Carouselambra\\" is straight-up awesome because the sythns really give the song a futuristic feel, sort of like Michael J. Fox's first reaction upon entering the world of 2015 in Back to the Future II.  It progresses into other themes that are equally as impressive.  Maybe the best song on the album.      Everyone knows \\"All My Love\\" as being the famous ballad.  We all know what the lyrics are about, and because of the importance of the lyrics, it's a very meaningful song where Robert Plant pours out his honest emotions.  \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" reminds me of something Elvis Presley would do, had he been alive by this point in time.      Overall, good stuff.  Worth owning.  It's not a classic on the same level as previous Zeppelin albums, but by itself it stands tall.
B00006AW2O|5.0|Don't pass this up regardless of what kind of a review you read.  \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" (Jaggers/Richards) is a formidable blues tribute (worth the price of the CD itself).  Classic covers of \\"Around and Around\\" and \\"It's All Over Now.\\"  The Stones reveal their blues roots on this CD more than they do on any other and the material is more cohesive than that found on their first release.  I count this as the fourth best of the Rolling Stones releases--Jagger is in his prime and Brian Jones makes his most significant contribution as a Stone on this CD. If you enjoy blues/rock, be sure to add 12 X 5 to your collection.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Y'know how when someone was sentenced to death, and they would be hung, once the floor dropped out from under them, they would start kicking and flailing wildly in a desperate attempt to live? This is the musical equivalent of that. Just when this band had pretty much outlived it's relevance, they come out swinging with a blistering, original piece of the rock. They even had the balls to call it \\"Zeitgeist\\". Awesome.<br /><br />Go buy it now..........
B000P0J024|5.0|No recuerdo el dia exacto, en que despues de buscar por cielo mar y tierra el disco de los Wilburys apareció frente a mi en una feria popular donde venden cosas usadas. Claramente el dueño hasta ahi de ese disco no sabia lo que tenia en sus manos (pague solo 6 dolares !!!). Gracias a Roy, George, Bob, Tom y Jeff ese fue un dia TREMENDO en mi historia de busqedas de joyitas de la musica...  hasta hoy.  Cuando vi esta edicion reeditada de los discos por fin en mis manos pense, ¿en que momento me llamaron para preguntarme que me gustaria que un disco de los Wilburys tuviera? Creanme, esta hecho a la medida con todo lo que siempre busque y no estaba en ninguna parte (ni en ferias populares).  Gran sonido, Bonus Tracks, Edicion de lujo y un documental con la historia del grupo que te lleva al borde de las lagrimas en un homenaje a Roy Orbison viendolo en sus ultimas horas. Si eres un fan perdido de los Wilburys esto es para ti, si quieres descubrir a los Wilburys esto tambien es para ti.   Creanme...    I P R E S I O N A N T E !!!!!
1594489505|5.0|The Kite Runner was about fathers and sons.  This novel is about mothers and daughters.  Amazingly Hosseni's second novel is as good as his first.  I could not put the book down.  It is a real page turner and every bit as good as the Kite Runner. Further, it deals with the cruelty of women's lives under the Taliban and Islamic fundamentalism. These two books together make me curious enough about Afghanistan that I would consider traveling there. For an insider's view of Afganistan read both these terrific novels.  You won't be sorry.
6304806418|5.0|I wanted this product long time ago, finally I got it in my hands, I can't believe, Thanks a lot Amazon.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|This is a decent, well done action DVD, with an interesting and somewhat different subject!  However, well done as it was, I would've really loved to see this movie made, totally following Stephen Hunter's book, \\"Point of Impact\\" on which it was VERY loosely based on!  Now THAT would've been a superior movie, that could've won an Oscar or other award.  As it is, if you enjoy this movie, do yourself a favor and READ Hunter's book!!  I happen to love firearms, and this movie is based on the fictional exploits of a Marine sniper.  Intricate plots are interwoven, and the ending is not all that is expected.  Maybe too much violence for younger viewers...
6305907145|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and the best film version of Mansfield Park that has been made. Frances O'Connor does a wonderful job of capturing Fanny's emotions and letting us see into her mind. What's more, the romance between Fanny and Edmund is full of the tension and yet sweet, innocent, and deep love that Jane Austen portrayed in the book. All in all, a wonderful a film, one you have to see if you loved the book!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|While substitute teaching an Honors English class, the teacher had me show this DVD to the class.  At first, I wondered what it all was about, but I quickly got involved in the story!  Similar to 1984 and other \\"futuristic\\" scenarios where the earth or various countries have a top-to-bottom make-over, and a super hero emerges to restore the people's power and goodness!   One problem I personally have is that movies of this genre usually make the group or govt. that wants to restore order to a decadent culture gone mad, into the bad guys because they do want to restore decency.  Other than that, i.e., if you are conservative and would LIKE some decency restored, and you don't like to be portrayed as some right-wing religious nutcase for wanting this done, you will probably like this story.
B000NVIGC0|1.0|I grew up in St. Louis, watching the first Wilco and Son Volt shows.  I threw myself into the last break-up [God bless Uncle Tupelo], beaming over AM and Son Volt's \\"Trace.\\"  Wilco's albums changed immensely with the introduction of Loose Fur [Jim O'Rourke] and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  Jeff Tweedy, the band's melodic creativity, and clever lyrics prevailed in spite of various additions and subtractions [Bennett], until now.    I honestly would pay to see this band live no matter what came of an album.  -Now?  -oof.      When did the already accused \\"dad band\\" plummet into the background of a Tide commercial?  Will I hear their sound bites on NPR?  I am waiting for the newest TV drama to add \\"Hate it Here\\" to a young girl's emotional breakdown in her bedroom.      What happened to Charles Wright and Woody Guthrie's influence?  Where is the competent composition [shown briefly in \\"On and On and On\\"]?  I fear O'Rourke's dreamy sonic influence led to gravitational boredom.  I expected so much more...    No one is forcing the hand to make tons of albums, here.  It's a damn shame.
B000002LJA|5.0|Ordinarily, I am not a fan of hip-hop or rap, but this showcasing by Quincy Jones has given me a whole new perspective on these art forms, endowing them with elements of relevance & respectability (in the best sense).  The array of talent on this album is nothing short of awesome (a much overused term, but of particular relevance here).  As with \\"The Dude\\", my daughter has once again introduced me to another of Q's masterworks.  What can I say; the man is a genius!
B000K9L32U|5.0|I saw them perform for Princess Diana's concert.  I really didn't know who they were until I checked out some of their other music on Amazon.  I recognized them almost at once.  This is a wonderful offering, Patience caught my ear, and I had to hear more.  I'm glad I bought the CD, and have downloaded older tracks as well.  Well worth buying, I would recommend this to anyone.  I may be wrong, but I felt the last few tracks were influenced by some of the Beatles music, and maybe a little of the Bee Gee's.  ENJOY!
B000002GC2|5.0|This is another album I have been after for some time.  I originally heard it when my daughter acquired it, and was blown away!  Q's music really strikes a chord with me, ably abetted by the stellar vocals of James Ingraham & Patti Austin.
B000RJO58M|5.0|I have yet to purchase the HD-DVD of this movie so I can't speak for the image and sound quality. However, I have seen this move in theaters, 3 times to be exact. I admit I was not that big of a fan of Shaun of the Dead. I normally don't find \\"British Humor\\" extremely funny (It has its moments however).    That being said, Hot Fuzz is one of my favorite movies of all time! It has an amazing quality to it that puts it above and beyond almost any other comedy I have ever seen. Hot Fuzz is hilarious on multiple different levels.    First off, Hot Fuzz has some of the greatest one-line-type humor I have ever seen. It has so many quick quips where if you miss it you lose nothing but if you hear it you can't stop laughing.    Along with that, the general plot of Hot Fuzz is hilarious. The last 45 minutes of the movie is just completely ridiculous in a good way. It has some of the most random moments where on one hand you think \\"What the H***?\\" and on the other you laugh to the point of tears. Once the movie is over and you mentally reflect on what you have just seen, you won't be able to hold back chuckling.    I will edit this review once I purchase the disk to comment on the visual and audio qualities. Until then I hope that this helped you and your decision. If you only have the budget for one comedy to add to your collection. Make it Hot Fuzz!
1400049628|5.0|it was interesting. it doesn't take general stuff from movies. this is a genuinly creative write, that can be fun to read or used for real actions. i recommend it for anybody who is a zombie fan, even though it doesn't always fit in with the popular knowledge of the average zombies is still worthwile. i was even apporached by another zombie fan while reading to get a scope of how the book is layed out...they are thinking of buying a copy for themselves.
1594489505|5.0|Amazing. Again, Hosseini takes the reader to a far away place where a culture makes life almost unbearable for some yet shows how some can overcome the lot life deals them. Fantastic. A quick read seeing that it's impossible to put this book down.
0060578793|5.0|Very helpful book, and highly recomended especially during these hard times luring over our heads. We were also amazed to find many new things out about our own backyard
1582701709|3.0|Save your money on this one - Get \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" by Napoleon Hill. He wrote about this so-called law of attraction back in 1937. It's a classic. The Secret? Titles are a sure fire way of selling more books. \\"Hey! I'd like to know 'the Secret' is!\\"
B00008PX8P|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars had they slipped in D'yer Mak'er & the Song Remains the Same somewhere, anywhere!  But this is a great compilation of several Led Zepplin concerts and for those of us who never got to see one of the greatest rock and roll groups live, this is the next best thing.  It's on 2 DVDs and over 5 hours of fantastic listening.  It's even more realistic if you have a big screen and a BOSE surround sound system--with this, you feel like you are at the concert, but then you come to the realization you're not in the 70s and you aren't wearing paisley...Great Listening.
0066214122|1.0|I found Prey to be pretty boring and not much of a thriller.  Not really entertaining because the storyline was written poorly.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|First, and most important, this is music I can listen to with my kids around. Someone remembered how to make great music without swearing.    Everyone has their opinion about Wolfmother influences: White Stripes, Zeppelin, Hendrix, etc... I think that it has been so long that a band this original came out that people assume they must be ripping off the last bands to play original music.    Wolfmother stands alone, and they rock hard! This is music that will get you pumped, get you singing, banging your head, and ready to conquer the world. CHeck them out on Youtube, they are even better live, but this album is a daily listen for me.
B00000JRTX|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot.  I liked Hugh Grant a lot in this movie, he did a great job.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B000002OVJ|5.0|If you'd only heard the poorly recorded vinyl of this set, this will be a revelation to you. And if you've never heard any live Who, this will make you jealous of those who did. A fine, fine set, wonderfully remastered and hugely expanded.<br /><br />FYI - if you stumble across the \\"Live At Leeds Extended Edition\\", note that it's this set plus their live performance of \\"Tommy\\". IMHO the live Tommy isn't nearly as interesting as the studio or film versions, so if you're trying to choose between them, I recommend this one.
0316067598|5.0|I do NOT believe that any normal person that reads this book will ever forget it. As the other readers have said below, Marcus takes the readers from start to finish, and does not leave out any detail of this truly heroic American story.It brings the entire harrowing experience of becoming a Navy Seal, and then goes on a mission where no one but very few Americans  have ever been, or ever hope to go.

1569242739|5.0|I was a happy vegetarian just chugging along in life when a ferocious allergy to dairy kicked in a couple years ago. I was on the verge on remaining forever locked in a fetal position fearing I would never once again enjoy the simple things in life. Then, my friend Heather Corinna (author of [[ASIN:1600940102 S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-To-Know Progressive Sexuality Guide to Get You Through High School and College]]) showed me her copy of this very book. The very next day - THE VERY NEXT DAY - I made tracks to my local co-op (represent!) and bought my own vegan-y cupcake-y goodness-y book. I've only managed to make the golden vanilla and chocolate cupcakes with mint icing, but they've been a success with everyone who's tried 'em. I should also mention that I am the only veg*n amongst my posse. If I can get omnivores to embrace a vegan cupcake, you know this book is worth its weight in fair-trade gold.    I still miss cheese, though.
B000003N7K|5.0|The only reservation with this album is that is sadly very short (about 31 mins), but it's a truly marvellous album.<br />Hartman is blessed with as clear a baritone voice as you're ever likely to hear. There are a couple of moments on this recording where the Tenor Sax stops and Hartmans voice starts and its completely seamless.<br /><br />These are all classic ballad songs, so if you're expecting long Coltrane solos forget it. This is mellow, and laid back. Think of Coltrane on the Ballads album but more so. A number of people I've spoken to over the years have used this as springboard to get into Coltrane.<br /><br />The track listing is:<br />1. They Say It's Wonderful<br />2. Dedicated To You<br />3. My One and Only Love<br />4. Lush Life<br />5. You are too beautiful<br />6. Autumn Serenade<br /><br />Sadly Hartman doesn't seem to have recorded much else (or its unavailable) but this album from 1963 is an absolute classic.
B000P0J024|5.0|I'm so glad that this excellent recording is back in print.  The DVD and the bonus songs on the 2 disc CD set were excellent.  It's wonderful to see these gifted musicians again, especially since 2 of them are no longer with us.

0618711678|5.0|In the annals of atrocities committed by human beings against ourselves, the historic and ongoing mistreatment of Africa by the Industrialized World takes the (highly dubious) prize. While an extremely generous revision of history might forgive the arrogance and naivety of the colonial powers for believing that clothing, Christianity, modern weapons and free markets would be enough to make Africa like Europe, King Leopold II of Belgium seems to stand out ahead of the pack. King Leopold's Ghost by Adam Hochschild, in one respect, is a depressing narrative about how MILLIONS of Africans were \\"civilized\\" by trading their lives and liberty to grow Leopold's personal fortune. But it is also an inspiring story about how a few people, through their passion for the inalienable rights endowed to all people, shook Europe and America awake and their efforts to bring about real change in the Congo.    Hochschild, as he explains in his preface, first became aware of the crimes against humanity instigated by King Leopold by accident. A quote from Mark Twain (active in the Congo Movement during the decades around the turn of the 20th century) about the 8-10 million people that were helped to their graves by Leopold's regime in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Such a tragically huge tally is striking, and it inspired Hochschild to find out as much as he could. King Leopold's Ghost begins with a whirlwind synopsis of the first 400 years of European imposition upon Central Africa -- the Portuguese, Afoso, Prester John, the Colonial Era. The pace slows once Henry M. Stanley and Leopold enter the picture.    The lives of Stanley and Leopold, the two major do-ers in the tale of the subjugation of the Congo, are discussed in detail. Stanley, the explorer, ended up on Leopold's payroll because he really didn't have much else to do. His explorations down the Congo, though courageous and admired, did not raise the kind of interest he though it should in the Foreign Office of his native Britain. Stanley became available for employment just as Leopold's machinations and Machiavellian dealings were justifying (among his fellow monarchs) his desire to take over control of the Congo. Of course, according to Leopold, this was all just so that he could lift up the poor Africans and encourage free trade. Leopold, who never actually visited his kingdom in Africa, needed a surrogate in-country to clear the bush and establish trading stations. Stanley was his man.    Once trading stations were established in the Congo, Europeans came to trade. At first, the primary object of plunder was ivory, but then, with the  advent of bicycles (and later automobiles) with inflatable tires, wild rubber became the main export. And so began the \\"Rubber Terror,\\" where the people of the Congo were forced upon pain and death to harvest the latex. The result, as described by Hochschild, was unbelievable savagery on the part of the civilized world.    Fortunately for the world, the tale of the subjugation of the congo has some undo-ers as well, foremost among them E.D. Morel. The Congo Reform Movement had a worldwide following that made Leopold miserable. Unfortunately for the cause of justice, Leopold died and the Congo Free State (as it was then known) was merely transferred to Belgium -- Leopold was never punished for his crimes against humanity. In 1960, with the rising tide of anti-colonialism beginning to wax all over Africa, Belgium handed power over to the Congolese to rule themselves and try to pull a reasonable government of the people from the humid air. That has not faired particularly well either.    Adam Hochschild's book is well written and engaging. He made a valiant effort to find the words of actual Africans describing their plight during their struggle -- rather than just the victors, or, at best, some sympathetic compatriots of the victors. The paperback edition comes with an extended afterward where the author describes some of the consequencesof bringing this too long forgotten take to the forefront again.

B0001LJCMK|4.0|...but when you listen to them all together on the disc it gets repetitive because they are similar.  This probably should have just been an EP with a few of the better songs.  When you hear one of the songs on a radio station it sounds pretty good because there is contrast.  Personally what I think makes Queens so good is that their discs offer a lot of contrast so each of the songs stand out.  My recommendation is download a few of your favorites but I can't recommend the disc as a whole.

Marcus was meant to live through this tragic ordeal, in order to tell everyone the true story of what happened up on that mountain. I don't know if it will mean as much to someone that didn't know these guys, but it's worth reading, to find out the truth about this war and the senseless deaths that are occurring.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I think this movie is really all about Al Gore as opposed to being about the environment. This is a self-promotional film and we see that from the very beginning. The first five minutes are a montage of someone we are supposed to regard as a being great man. We hear all about his childhood, where he lived, his mom and dad, him, him, him. Why not just call this a bio pic? Why pretend that there's another angle here than Gore-o-philia? I was astonished to see so many clips of the 2000 election crisis as it had nothing to do with global warming, but it has everything to do with making Al Gore look like a rock star. An Inconvenient Truth is more a glossy series of sound-bytes than it is a work of legitimate science. This is the narcissist as confessor and preacher which are the hazards of having a politician function as a narrator.<br /><br />Furthermore, there's far too much emotion here which undermines the seriousness of the message. Comparing the threat of global warming to the Nazis in the thirties is absolutely ridiculous, as unlike with the measures taken by Britain and France in that decade, there is little impact that the United States can make on worldwide weather patterns. Even if we voluntarily thrust ourselves back into the stone age we will not change what India and China do to the environment. Educating the public about global warming is a fine idea, but stating that our present days are like those described in the book of Revelation are the words of a propagandist as opposed to those of a meaningful thinker.<br /><br />Gore's attitude towards his critics is both politically correct and disturbing. He condescends to those who disagree with him and sets up numerous straw man arguments to toy with rather than taking on tough positions. Global warming is an issue we should actively debate in order to increase everyone's overall comprehension. The last thing we need is a guy like Gore telling us just to accept his views because they are not political but \\"moral and ethical.\\" They are not. His positions are political and we know this from the clips he shows of Republicans alone as opposed to those of Democrats. The Senate preemptively rejected the Kyoto Treaty 95 to 0 so its scuttling was a bipartisan affair but you wouldn't know that from this documentary. Bill Clinton's refused to submit the final version of the protocol to the Senate but that's also something that is never mentioned.<br /><br />Furthermore, if what Gore has to say is accurate then he should not be bothered by others trying to refute him. With the environment, we don't need conformity and acquiescence; what we really need is the constant exchange of ideas. His attempt to give viewers every answer is both cowardly and weak. There's a whole lot of self-righteous leftist personality stuff on display here and it grates. His narration was every bit as self-righteous and haughty as the man himself. He wonders why other politicians aren't as concerned about these matters as he is. Perhaps it's due to their wishing to deal with global warming as a logical problem rather than an emotional one. However, I'm sure he thinks that their lack of hysteria about the matter is due to their lack of goodness. What malarkey..\\" They are not.

B000OQF6N6|1.0|I have been a DIE HARD Pumpkins fan, since 1991.  I flew to Chicago to see them play their final concert, and paid a ridiculous amount of money to see the last show at the Metro.  I have been in love with ALL of their music...including Machina, and Zwan...I wasn't a huge fan of the solo album, though there were a couple songs I liked.  But I must say, that Zeitgeist is a huge disappointment for me.  I agree with all the negative reviews about this album.  Billy is trying too hard to prove something, and the music sounds like it.  Basically, this album is unlistenable to me. What a bummer.

0316067598|5.0|Bar none, this book is an incredible read from start to finish.  Beginning with Marcus Luttrell's explicit detail of his Navy SEAL training through his exhilerating escape from the clutches of the Taliban in the mountains of Afghanistan after his SEAL team is ambushed, you won't want to put this book down. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about what our wonderful men and women in uniform are going through to protect our freedom in these seemingly dark days.  Written in the first person Luttrell provides stunning detail of his emotions throughout his ordeal and immediately you feel like this guy could be your brother.  The story of a true American Hero.
0893860220|5.0|I had come across this book many times over the years, and had thought that Nisargaadatta looked like a \\"wild-eyed crazy person.\\"  This scared me away from reading his book, until about a year ago.  I had been completely wrong about him, and judged him only by his looks.  I had also thought that the black and yellow cover of the book was so bold and intense that it seemed really \\"fringe,\\" but I was also wrong about that.  My mistake!  I judged a book by its cover, thinking that Nisargadatta was out to convert people into a cult, or something like that.  That's a bunch of NONSENSE.  It's bold and intense because the publishers know that the book is dead-on about the truth and are not afraid to announce it, not because Nisargadatta is trying to blind you with a bunch of pseudo-spiritual crap.    So, one day I became curious about the book, and read some sections on Amazon.  I was amazed at the quality of the communication!  No riddles, no bullsh-t, no vague leading-on of the reader, no mindgames.  It was as clear as a pure diamond, and incredibly INTERESTING.    I am so glad that I finally got over my prejudices and read this book.  Before and after I read this book, I'd read works by Ramana Maharshi, Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, Sailor Bob Adamson, John Wheeler, Leo Hartong, and many others, but this one is THE MOST LUCID BOOK ON THE SUBJECT, period.    Unlike some Advaitan authors, like Gangaji, for example, Nisargadatta DOES NOT PLAY \\"HIDE THE BALL\\" with you.  Gangaji hides the ball behind opaque, riddle-like nonsense and she makes money off of it, too.  I've seen Gangaji speak in person, on videos, heard her on audio, and read some of her writings, and while many like her, I think that she's leading people down a path of needless confusion and makes people worse-off by leading them astray through a maze of irrelevancies and BABBLE.  Clearly thinking herself ABOVE the masses--although she claims to be an Advaitin, which is purely contradictory!--she'll just look her stage guests in the eye and start in on her \\"knowing\\" laughter, or smile at them silently.  Whatever.  There's no mojo flowing from her during her \\"Satsang,\\" just a bunch of devotees plopping down $20 to hear her prattle on in circles as she leads them into a paralyzing maze of verbiage.  It's totally annoying.  Her delivery is so baffling and time-wasting that few people in the audience even knew what the hell she was getting at.  I felt like standing up and shouting:  \\"Look, people, what she's trying to say is that YOU ARE GOD, DUH!!!\\"  She's completely cryptic and self-obsessed, and of course being obsessed with your own ego is the OPPOSITE of Advaita.      Many \\"teachers,\\" like her, mean well.  Yes.  But if they can't communicate, they should go home and leave people alone before they do any more damage.  They may have understanding inside of them, but if they can't inspire understanding in others, they have NO BUSINESS acting like they're \\"teachers.\\"      Nisargadatta, on the other hand, doesn't f-ck around with his audience in order to make himself seem larger than life, or in order to make a buck.  He was poor his whole life, but still communicated the message with vastly more clarity and directness than any white-robe-clad goon with a fat bank account and a penchant for acting like The Riddler.        Even writers like John Wheeler just repeat their vague assertions thousands of times in a row with no new content delivered.  Nisargadatta, on the other hand, has an astounding knack for communicating LUCIDLY with the reader.  His questioners aren't \\"nice and polite\\" like Gangaji's are.  No, they ask him tough questions and sometimes argue with him, and he answers their questions dead-on.  They don't worship him and treat every word he says like it's true, even if they don't understand it.  No, they challenge him, and the reader is better off for it.        He's down-to-earth, he's incredibly insightful, and the book will change your life!      I also heartily recommend Leo Hartong and Ramana Maharshi...
B00023B1LC|5.0|Most of this genre leaves me with a feeling of \\"why should I care? My popcorn's gone, this is loud, I wish they'd all just die.\\"  But Matt Damon and Franka Potente are compelling and give pathos to the implausible.  In between the loud parts there is actually dialogue and acting and character progression, and it's all entertaining!  It's still an amusement park ride of a movie that's best suited to summer air conditioning, but that's all it aspires to be and it's the action movie at the top of its form.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I couldn't find this DVD in stores for Father's Day.  My husband couldn't believe I got the collection for him!
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I really despise *ick flicks as a genre, but this (and its predecessor) entertained me and my typical male husband equally.  Matt Damon makes the fantastic believable, AND makes you forget you're watching Matt Damon.  The pace is taut without being geared to short attention spans, and the plot twists are neither telegraphed nor \\"oh come on\\" revelations.  This is a sturdy franchise that doesn't leave you feeling dirty for having enjoyed it.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Kelly has a great voice. I like her edger songs(Never), but this album shows off her vocal talents and that she can sing any type of songs... Looking forward to her next release! :)
B00005LC1H|5.0|Anyone who claims to love British comedy has to watch this, if for no other reason than to have the basis for appreciating more modern fare like The Office or Clatterford.  If you are put off by the geekfest that is the Monty Python fan club, fear not - this bears no likeness, and there are precious few catchphrases to repeat ad nauseum. This is a classic, but it is by no means highbrow or even a little bit intellectual - it is replete with sight gags, slapstick and rats in the restaurant.  It may not sound like it, but this series is necessary viewing for the BBC set.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|When I heard this CD the first time I did not enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed LP's older CDs. I have to be honest and state that I was disappointed. Fans had waited so long for LP to release new material only to find that they had changed so much. I undertand that change is good but I think they were too drastic and I don't enjoy it nearly as much as I do their older material. They mentioned that they no longer wanted to be part of the rap-rock \\"nu metal\\" genre but their old sound is what made them. To have them turn their backs on it sucks. After having listened to the CD more often, I can say that this is a decent CD, but not up to LP's standards. I am not sure what I feel about the CD anymore and sadly, being confused about your favorite band's latest CD is not a good thing.    I still love LP and they are still one of my favorite bands but I hope they go back to their roots in the future.
B000QXDHDI|4.0|While VS had made plenty of solid albums in the past, the stars truly seemed to align on this release. The production is fuller than on some previous albums where it was often thin, robbing the songs of some power. The songwriting and performances are truly inspired, capturing the passion, anger, and defiance outlined in the lyrics perfectly. The sound effects are used well, giving the album a soundtrack quality that suits the material well. Earlier albums never consisntently captured this level of majesty, and later albums, while following a similar formula, have contained more filler material that tend to hold the albums back somewhat (e.g., the rather large number of short 'interludes' on the Atreus albums). 'Invictus' is IMO the VS album most deserving of the 'barbaric romantic opera' label applied to the band's music. Think of the best Manowar albums with more grandeur and less cheese, and you'll have a good idea of what to expect.
0894803123|1.0|This book features a few basic icecream recipes and many simple variations.  There is little technical information about ice cream or the freezing of ice cream.  Many of the recipes use raw eggs, a dangerous practice putting consumers at risk for infection by Salmonella enteritidis.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|The movie has a deeper meaning to it than what most people will see on the surface. It's got it's funny parts but it is also serious. It's an all around werid movie but I'll watch it again. Everyone should give it a try.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|Even as a baby boomer, I really like this CD. As ebay seller, I could not understand why I was selling these so fast,..UNTIL..I listened to the CD.   I can at least understand and hear the words!! Very smooth music. I guess  WS are still creating the music we ALL LOVE!!
B000LPS47U|5.0|Awesome collectors edition. I've always enjoyed this film. Thank You for having this one available!!!
B0000019PA|5.0|It's great.  There's not much else to say in 2007 that hasn't already been said already...certainly one of the top ten of the last decade.    If there's one track that I don't think gets enough love it's the Untitled track.  No lyrics but just an awesome blast of bagpipes and organ.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|This movie shows that everyone faces difficuty while trying to reach their goals. However, it's left with every individual to decide or set plans on how to ovecome his/her difficulties. If you chose to sit and let your stuggles take over your life it will, but if you stand on your feet -like this man in the movie- and keep on fighting against your struggles to reach your goals, there will be a day when your succes will come through.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|ManStar took a swipe at Sufjan as a cold practitioner making sterile music for self-important women dating closet cases for boyfriends.  He later lamented that music, whether it's folk or rock is best served with some outrage, protest and emotion.  I have to admit when I first read this I laughed.  I went to a post-Illinoise show (in Chicago) and was a little annoyed at Sufjan's campy stage presence, how serious most people took themselves, hanging on every word and not moving.  Nobody drank, nobody spoke and heaven forbid if I wanted to whisper to one of the people I was with.  A quick \\"shhhhhh\\" quickly followed.  I understand the idea that Stevens' music is extremely vulnerable to hipster pandering because the result is that humorless, insecure, high IQ, well-educated d-bags seem drawn to it because it confirms that their opinions of themselves.  They get the local and historical references, and it seems emotional.    However...that's painting with a broad brush in many respects.  First, music doesn't have to be punk, protesty, or in-your-face to be excellent.  Folk and rock music is big enough to include music made by and for people who aren't railing at some government/inner demon/society.  Second, this music resonates with more than just the aforementioned well-read d-bags because it manages to be celebratory (Chicago), smooth (Jacksonville), narrative (the whole album), quirky (Zombies song) and relatable in its forays into tragedy (Casmir Pulaski).  I agree with the people who dislike the Gacy song for its disingenuousness and faux attempt to \\"relate\\" to a serial killer.  Even if Sufjan is sincere in his relating to Gacy, it's still ridiculous and stupid of him to try to sell his audience on our similarities to mass murderers...and the song comes off as creepy.  Sufjan Stevens, and the people who or are listening to him, are not on the precipice of some Gacy-like meltdown.    There is no percentage in calling out an entire fanbase and tarring them as either self-important or \\"closet-cases.\\"  That shows how small-minded you are.  What, are all guys supposed to be so jacked up with testosterone at every given minute that even in their free time, when they listen to music, they need to unwind to something that stokes the fires of anger and aggression?  Dude what kind of way to chill out is that?  There's a time and place for everything.  To people who think like that, sorry, but the Minutemen aren't coming back and there are people out there who need a little bit more than three chords and a hollow slogan about how the government sucks.

If you haven't used a test like this to analyze your talents, I highly recommend it.
B00012FXB8|5.0|I've been looking through all the reviews for Alien 3 on here and it's pretty surprising. The reviews are from one extreme to the other. I never relized that this was the most controversial film in the series until now. For Me this film's greatness has never been in question. I know that David Fincher was never fully given a chance to bring his vision to the film because Fox had no faith in the first time Director. However I still think that this is such an underated film. It's visually stunning and the plot was clever and very brave. I mean very early on in the film we find out Ripley is infected with a Queen and is going to die. Man that's as anti-Hollywood ending as it gets. I admit the CGI for the Alien is extremely dated but that was the best around at the time. In my eyes the first Alien will always be the best hands down and Alien 3 is the second best. I know that comment is going to piss off the fans of James Cameron's sequel to the first. Don't get me wrong I truly love Aliens but I have some problems with it. What bothers me most about it is that once Ripley and the others disturb the hive they're killing Aliens left and right practicly every 30 seconds. It's more of a shoot it 'em up Hollywood Action film. It's kinda like Terminator 2 in space. The Film relies more on hordes of Aliens attacking from all side, than just a single Alien or a few hunting down the crew. Not to mention Bill Paxton whining really wears are my nerves. \\"Game over man, game over!\\" I always felt like Alien 3 was more like the original film in the way it creates the suspenseful atmosphere of the Ten little Indians. There is an intruder in your midst and it's systematically killing you off one by one. You have no real weapons or heavy artillery, instead you have to try and out wit the creature. That in my opinion is so much more suspenseful than the approach that is taken in Aliens. Now thats not to say that Aliens is not suspenseful, it is. It's just not as suspenseful as the other two. I also think that Sigourney Weaver does her best acting in 3 and her shaved head was such a bold move and has become so iconic for the Ripley chararter. Again these are not facts, these are just my opinions and I sure many of you disagree with me. Which is okay because ultimately we all love this series, We just prefer different parts.wo.

B0000W3YIS|5.0|In The Zone is the 4th album by Ms. Spears and it is her best yet. You can tell Britney has really grown up and is sounding better than ever and more mature. This Australian Edition is the best because it comes with two bonus songs. They are The Answer and Don't Hang Up. They are worth the extra price because they are very great songs. So don't dwell, go pick this CD up today. I promise you won't regret it.
B00000IMTF|5.0|Yeah, the first one had its moments. MORE than moments, actually...\\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\" was as good as any truly \\"greatest hit\\" from Deep Purple and it opened the debut album with a bang. Killer trademark Blackmore riff, and DON'T tell me you haven't driven along in your car with this in the CD player as you sang \\"Come and make me holy AGAIN...\\"    You HAVE! ADMIT it and don't be ashamed of it! I HAVE!    But \\"Rising\\"...wow. Probably the single greatest non-Purple album Ritchie's cranked out in his career. Ronnie James Dio deserves equal credit. I strongly recommend the recent \\"Live In Munich 1977\\" CD & DVD for a closer look at the power this band served up in its prime. YES, there are a few technical difficulties...like Dio's mike cutting out during \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\"...but you'll see prime footage of Blackmore, just LOOKING for the right spot on that stage to EXPLODE. You'll see Dio as a confident frontman, a full year before Diamond Dave ushered in a renaissance of no-nonsense rock & roll with Van Halen. I seriously doubt that R.J.D. will EVER receive proper credit for his Rainbow / Sabbath work. Black Sabbath recently released \\"The Dio Years,\\" and Rainbow owes him the same respect (Although, to be fair, disc one of \\"Catch The Rainbow: The Anthology\\" basically IS \\"The Best Of The Dio Years\\")...    :-)    YES, it's a shame that \\"Long Live Rock & Roll\\" squeezed \\"Stargazer\\" out of the band's set list during the aforementioned 1977 tour, because it IS a jaw-dropper. It's Rainbow's \\"Starship Trooper\\" or \\"Roundabout\\" or \\"I've Seen All Good People\\"...a SIGNATURE song. There are a few other songs Ritchie could have kicked to the curb, but I doubt that he cared THEN, and I'm almost positive that he REALLY doesn't care NOW...\\"In the heat and the rain, with whips and chains?\\"...huh? \\"I see a rainbow rising\\"...YES, Ronnie, YES...I do TOO!    :-)    \\"Tarot Woman\\" opens the album with a weird little synth riff and then, at the 1:20 mark, Blackmore's riff comes in, followed by the rest of the band, and you're FLYING, baby.    \\"Starstruck\\"...chugs along like an out-of-control train, reminiscent of Uriah Heep's \\"Easy Livin'\\" but maybe a zillion times BETTER.     IF you're a fan of Ritchie Blackmore...and if you're not, why are you reading this...\\"Rising\\" is so essential that the word \\"essential\\" seems like a cop-out. There's GOT TO BE a better word.     IF you're a Ronnie James Dio fan...and if you're not, etc. etc. etc., THIS album is every bit as good as \\"Heaven And Hell\\" or \\"Holy Diver\\"...maybe BETTER. No, let me take that back...IT IS R.J.D.'s shining hour. Period.    Also...and I say this as a consummate Deep Purple fan...\\"Rising\\" proved that he could record a five-star album without the name \\"Ian Gillan\\" appearing in the credits.    I can't listen to \\"Down To Earth.\\" Yes, I KNOW \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" was a hit, but I hated it the first time I heard it and each of the 999,999,999 times I heard it AFTER that. I'm pretty much ecstatic that Graham Bonnet has faded into the \\"Where Are They Now\\" ether. Irritating, generic, like a million nails scraped down a million blackboards. BUH-BYE. Schenker didn't keep him around EITHER.     The Joe Lynn Turner years? Blackmore trying to be Journey. Or maybe Loverboy. Or Glass Tiger. Or A-Ha. Or any one of a zillion MTV 80s bands I didn't care about THEN, and I don't care about NOW. Sorry, Joe, and YES...I WOULD like fries with that. You were Micky Thomas in search of Starship and you never really found it. The smartest thing Ritchie did after \\"Bent Out Of Shape\\" was head back to Deep Purple...until they couldn't stand his diva behavior anymore...but hey, \\"Perfect Strangers\\" is nothing to sneeze at.    :-)    But the Dio albums? ESPECIALLY \\"Rising?\\" They still sound vibrant and fresh and full of attitude. \\"Long Live Rock & Roll\\" INDEED. \\"Rising\\" is a triumph, a wonderful ALBUM...\\"all killer, no filler\\"...BUY IT already! Don't sweat the fact that it's only 33 minutes long. It's the best 33 minutes you'll ever spend.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This set contains the most beautiful and amazing images of nature in our planet.

The music used is also absolutely amazing and perfectly in sync with the picture.    A true work of art.
0156027321|2.0|Honestly, the first 350 pages of this book are excellent.  I thought the author did a great job of illuminating the main character of Pi.  You care about him, you empathize with him, and you want him to triumph over his dire circumstances.  I stuck with this book (As a disclaimer, I'm usually a fan of well-written nonfiction, so I tend to be more critical of fiction books) for these reasons.  HOWEVER, you must understand that the ending is completely disjointed, unexpected, and downright disappointing.  I honestly felt that it invalidated the initial beauty and drama of the story.  Sure, you can have some philosophical discussions about magical realism, the value of storytelling, and moral relativism, but what's the point?  The ending was unsettling, both for its darkness as well as its disappointment.  Just be prepared for that if you decide to go on this 400-page journey with Pi.

1400064287|4.0|I would recommend this book to everyone involved in presentation, marketing, or other fields involving the transfer of meaningful, long-lasting information.    I read this book immediately after I got through \\"The Tipping Point\\" by Malcolm Gladwell.  I think this was a good choice: the authors even state that parts of the book were written with Gladwell's book in mind. For people who have read \\"The Tipping Point\\", \\"Made To Stick\\" is a well-crafted exploration of \\"The Stickiness Factor\\", one of the three keys to making things \\"tip\\".    However, this book isn't just a continuation of some of Gladwell's points.  Rather, Made To Stick is a truly original work in which Chip and Dan Heath explore ways to produce meaningful, memorable messages in the days of information overload.  Many of the other reviews do a good job of discussing some of the book's strengths, but I think one underappreciated aspect of the book is the pertinence of the examples provided, which aid in providing \\"concreteness\\", one of the authors' 6 elements of \\"stickiness\\".      I didn't give this book a 5 because of the relatively narrow subject matter contained in the book, which requires the authors to sometimes stretch ideas beyond necessity, but it is a very solid book and provides you with many novel and useful ideas.    P.S.  This is the best book I've found on Gladwell's 'Stickiness Factor'.  For Gladwell's 'Law of the Few', I suggest \\"The Anatomy of Buzz\\" by Emanuel Rosen.
B000QEIORG|5.0|The Foo Fighters' second album, their first as a \\"real band\\" (the first was just a Grohl solo project, essentially) has stood the test of time remarkably well. It has the all-too-rare combination of hard rock and melody. From the outstanding \\"Monkey Wrench\\" to the dramatic closer \\"New Way Home,\\" the cd works as individual songs and as an album as a whole.<br /><br />This edition with bonus tracks doesn't really offer anything new, but only enhances an already excellent cd by conveniently gathering together the b-sides from this era. I wouldn't describe the b-sides as necessary for anyone other than the hardcore fans (though, if you don't already own this album, you might as well get this edition.)<br /><br />For those new to the Foo Fighters, this is a great place to start, but don't let the \\"special edition\\" stuff fool you: the real greatness of this cd is the main album itself.
B000PKG4SC|4.0|When I first learned that Shirley was releasing yet another remix album, I was disappointed, as I was hoping for an album of all new material. But I was pleasantly surprised. The entire album is very enjoyable, and the two new songs, Get The Party Started  and The Living Tree, is some of her best work. At 70, her voice is still amazing and a joy to listen to. I would have rated this album 5 stars if it contained all new material. To this day, Dame Shirley Bassey rocks my world!!!!
B000002GFT|5.0|If nothing else, Liege and Lief is probably the definitive English folk-rock album. By combining traditional music with more modern sounds, the album takes on a timeless, intoxicating quality that draws immediate comparisons to groups such as The Band. The songs are warm, earthy, and inviting The rousing \\"Come All Ye\\" leads listeners into the album with irresistable flair- Richard Thompson's electric guitar and Dave Swarbrick's fiddle do a dazzling dance around one another, melding the traditional and the contemporary with effortless proficiency. But the real star of this song (and most of the album, really) is vocalist Sandy Denny, whose voice is simply one of the most evocative, sonorous, and outwright beautiful sounds ever concieved. She lends a kind of enchanting majesty to \\"Come All Ye,\\" creating sounds that arc gracefully over the music, hypnotizing the listener within seconds. Once that stunning introduction is complete, the band launches into a few electrified renditions of traditional English folk songs: \\"Reynardine\\" is a strange, haunting, and tension-filled performance, in which the instrumentation is used to create dramatic bursts of pure sound rather than an actual melody, while Denny's voice flits and flutters to fill the gaps between notes. The result is an ominous, mysterious classic. The group also does an excellent instrumental medley, a joyful mixture of sounds that threatens to make you dance like a crazy person. \\"The Deserter\\" and \\"Tam Lin\\" are equally evocative, and just as expertly performed. The highlight of the album, however, is the group's epic reworking of the traditional \\"Matty Groves.\\" It's an incredible performance, one that sees the group at its very best: Swarbrick and Thompson duel eachother with mounting intensity accross the song's eight minutes, while drummer Dave Mattacks lends the song a strutting, storming rhythm. Denny is simply amazing, narrating the story of the song's ill-fated title character with equal parts sympathy andsarcasm, letting her voice dart in, above, and under the melody, bending notes and stretching sounds, twisting and shaping every word with a kind of prodigious abandon. It's a resonant and irresistable sound, and it makes the song an absolute masterpiece. The Richard Thompson-penned \\"Farewell, Farewell\\" is the icing on the cake, a beautiful and mournful ballad with dreamy instrumentation, a gorgeous collection of sounds melting and blending into one another. Liege & Lief is an inescapably excellent album, a masterpiece that should belong to every fan of folk or rock.
B000GIWS7E|4.0|I love the idea of a concert with an orchestra, especially when the band is worthy of orchestral backing (take note, Metallica).  Overall this was a great dvd, but i thought the song selection takes away from it a little (not a lot).  I would have liked to hear more old stuff, but I guess I can't have my cake and eat it (never understood why I couldn't).  Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was great, as was Octavarium (I LOVE that continuum!), Metropolis, and the entire orchestral part of the show.  i just thought there wasn't enough diversity in the first set.      My only other complaint is that the cameras in every Dream Theater DVD bounce around too much.  Take note, mike portnoy- we wanna see musicians for more than half a second at a time.  I realize it is hard to make a concert DVD perfect, but I am grateful to Dream Theater for putting so much material on DVD.  More bands (see Symphony X) need to take note!!
0670034711|4.0|I loved this book.  Couldn't put it down - it was a fine, fine summer read.  Elizabeth Gilbert is witty, sensitive, a damn good writer, and is both humorous and earnest in her attempts to eat, pray, and love her way through the narrative.  And while I wouldn't minimize her pain and her search - everybody's got a hungry heart - I was a little (envious?) self-conscious of the fact, when I was reading it, that everything seems to turn out okay - there are no horrid meditative faux pas, no horrendous gastronomical distresses, she gets the guy she wasn't even looking for, she has the friends who have the means to supply monies for her Balinese friend - it's all too beautiful.  Also, is it still a struggle for women in their thirties to feel guilty for not wanting a 'conventional' life?  Haven't we gotten past that?  All that said, I DID love the book - there is just a weird aftertaste that lingers.  Maybe it's just hard to cheer very much for someone who doesn't seem to need cheerleaders.
B000OCXFCO|2.0|I seem to stratch my head in wonder when I read reviews that tell me Megadeth's \\"United Abominations\\" is going back to their 1980's roots. To be honest, I just dont hear it. There are some good solid songs on this such as Sleepwalker, United Abominatinos, Gears of War, and Pray for Blood. The rest? Not so good, in fact just plain bad. I am in no way trying to compare this to the likes of any material, just judging it as I would any other album. But since everyone else is, then let me give you my two cents worth.  Its NOTHING like the material written in the 80's. Even \\"So far, so Good, so what\\" (which was not well recieved by Megadeth fans at the of its release) is much better.  Even \\"more modern\\" Megadeth such as \\"Cryptic Writings\\" is a better effort. (but its no where as bad as \\"Risk\\") Its not a total failure. There are four solid songs here, but that is about it. The rest, you decide, But it just sounds like filler material to me, and the band (new line-up) just doesnt seem to flow good with Dave. Try it out, but dont expect \\"Peace Sells\\", \\"Rust in Peace\\", \\"Countdown to Extiction\\" or \\"Cryptic Writings\\" because those are Megadeths best work..
6301562925|4.0|I really enjoy all of the Halloween movies, even the sequals. This one brought in plenty of perky young teenagers and rookie cops to mutilate. Some of the death scenes are really quite scary, and the actress who plays Jamie, and the dependable Dr. Loomis really carry this moive. I still get chills when I what this in late autumn, alone in the house, jack'o'laterns lit.
B000002X2B|5.0|I had this as a tape when it first came out, when I was all of 15. It has not lost a bit of its appreciable power. As all the others mention, this is one of the grand \\"rock and roll\\" collaborations of the Era. Among the many fine tracks is \\"A Child Is Coming\\", which features a mesmerizing chant / duet between David Crosby and Grace Slick, punctuated by some of the finest and melodious of Gracia and other's guitar blending into feedback ecstasy. \\"Mau Mau (Amerikon)\\" at the start is one of the strongest rock protest songs I know, and really should be played out of a Vogon Constructor Ship at ear shattering level over Washington DC today. And every hour on the hour.    The remaster presents this jewel in fine audio. Everything is clear and and the very central Bass work is great. The extra tracks aren't needed as an enticement, the original version of the lyrics in \\"Let's Go Together\\" are already restored. And yes, that is Grace playing a fine piano, evoking Nicky Hopkins.    If you are a fan of the Airplane, the Dead, or the less sugary side of CSN (think Wooden Ships), you won't regret this at all. \\"Take only Babies who smile, smile, even triplets and twins if they'll smile....\\"
1400049628|4.0|I got this book for my cousin and ended up reading it myself. It's a great, clever book, and Max Brooks writes it as if real live (sort of) zombies could come staggering down your street at any moment. I actually found myself making mental plans about what I would do in case of an \\"outbreak.\\" Although at times it can become a bit dull as it reads like a real survival guide, it has a collection of zombie stories near the end that are wonderfully entertaining, plus pages at the back to record your own zombie sightings! All I can say is that now I am prepared for anything the zombie hordes can throw at me!
0062502182|4.0|I enjoyed this book though with all of the hype, honestly was a bit underwhelmed. I will read more from the author though and give his other books a try.
B00004XPPC|5.0|The movie is just as I remembered it. A wonderful movie that won many academy awards.  A must see.
B000NA77YO|4.0|This is an awesome idea to put the best of Dio's years with Sabbath together on a collection, with addition of some unheard material. But unfortunetely, this is missing a few great songs, and in my mind, that really makes it or breaks it in a 'hits collection'. This should have expanded as a double disc set, or better yet a small box set with all the Dio/Sabbath material. This is a nice disc to have though, but honestly, it might be just better to buy the albums Sabbath and Dio were together on to encompass it all.
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|This movie started off pretty good in the first half building up intrigue and suspense with a girl's murder and making you wonder what happened to her; then it totally blew it and became comical. I come into all movies with an \\"open\\" mind and give everyone of them a chance by watching them instead of going by reviews but...SPOILER ALERT>>>>>THIS IS THE SCENE THAT \\"BROKE\\" THE MOVIE: I have a hard time buying the fact of a teen power figure dressed up like someone from Goodfellas and let alone having a cane with a duck head on top scaring anyone.  Give me a break, it just doesn't do it for me. How could anyone be afraid of this \\"dealer\\" especially living in their mother's basement?  Give me a break!!! If you want to watch great acting of this genre, I suggest watching the 1st season of \\"The Wire\\".  People are either going to love or totally hate this movie.  If you have an intellect over the average 13 year old, I think you'll be in the latter crowd.  A rental at most as shown by the current standing of 111 new/used for sale on Amazon. People don't get rid of good movies. Think about it.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I just saw this with my family.  I have also read a variety of the reviews.  We can attack Gore personally, but there is a point to the message of eliminating waste.<br /><br />There are limits to everything, including our natural resources.  When that will end, is up to debate.  So, what do we do now?  See the film, think & question, and start with the 10 simple ideas noted in the related homepage.<br /><br />1.

B000O179A4|5.0|Okay. So it's not about the Supremes-- excuse me-- Diana Ross and the Supremes. Never mind that \\"Dreams\\" sounds a lot like \\"Supremes.\\" Forget that the name \\"Deena\\" sounds terribly close to \\"Diana\\" or that Beyonce Knowles has an uncanny resemblance to Miss Ross and sounds like her. And the last song the women sing as a group has the same sentiment as \\"Some Day We'll Be Together.\\"<br /><br />The story line is a little thin; the film gets off to a slow start but gathers a lot of momentum as it progresses. By the time Jennifer Hudson sings her incomparable rendition of \\"I Am Not Going,\\" the most skeptical viewer is hooked. Besides Ms. Hudson's knockout performance, the other surprise for me was Eddie Murphy who in this film is not to be believed. He plays the character James Earley (a James Brown reflection?) with grit and passion and dominates the screen when he is on-- and he isn't a bad singer either.<br /><br />In the end it's all about the music. The production numbers are quite wonderful. It's worth whatever you paid to see this film to see and hear Jennifer Hudson. Finally the dedication to the late Michael Bennett, involved in the stage version, was touching.<br /><br />A film not to be missed.

B000MGBSI0|5.0|the 2nd season is the where the show really started getting so good. I love watching all the episodes again, and remember why I loved this show so much at the first place.  Can't wait for the 3rd season to be released!!

B000OQF6N6|1.0|I am absolutely appalled at how blind (or deaf) some of you are!  Have any of you actually heard the pumpkins before?  Because truly, if any of you were actually intimate with the group's catalog, you would realize this album is complete hoax.  With that said....it's impressions time!      BILLY CORGAN:  \\"So let's see here, I've got all these b-side songs from Machina, Zwan, and my solo project, what to do, what to do?  Aha, I got it!  I'll just add some distorted guitars and then release them as the new Smashing Pumpkins album.  Genius!\\"    I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to download this album rather than purchase it.  8 years and this is the best they can come up with??  The songs really do sound like a terrible mix of the aforementioned albums/groups.  And yeah, I know, you can talk all you want about the upsides of those past releases, but fact of the matter is we all wanted (and were promised) some classic pumpkins, and the group came nowhere close to delivering.  You know the album is in trouble when the lead single (which is only bordering on \\"pretty good\\") is hands down the best song on the album.      And so, the truth finally comes out:  the triumphant, explosive return of the Smashing Pumpkins turned out to be nothing more than a balding, middle-aged hasbeen grasping a fading sparkler for dear life.
1582701709|1.0|in the tradition of EST or The Forum, this is another \\"self-help\\" philosophy that is really just simple ego boosting. it tells you that you control your universe, which i guess can be empowering for some, but is filled with dangers and traps.  first of all there is the blaming. if you're sick, if your life is hard, well it must be your fault. this is the negative, flip side of empowerment, and the book strays in to this blaming territory often. it really doesn't help someone who is sick to tell them they've brought it on themselves.   secondly, while this book boosts the ego, it stops there. yes, i'm sure there are many fractured people who need a little ego boosting, but when you stop there, you are left with selfishness. you are left with things like \\"yes, i slept with my best friend's ex, but if it bothers my friend, that's his problem.\\"  Not running your life based on what other people think is one thing. Stomping on the feelings of those around you, those you care about, is wholly another.   i hope it's helpful for some people but i fear it will turn most of its readers into egocentric, boorish, rude individualists.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Of all of the daughter of the president romances, this is by far the most tasteful.  Katie Holmes is portrayed as a young,sweet, innocent woman, wanting to experience college life.  Marc Blucas is a stunning young man who takes the time to get to know her and they have clean fun.  I love this movie!
B00003CWPL|4.0|I first saw this film in my 20s and was awed, scared, horrified, and repulsed by it, all of those things making it quite memorable to me. Had not seen it for 30 years, but on second viewing, it is still repulsive and the film that typifies a horror film for me -- EVERY thing about it is horrifying... the actors, the setting, the lighting, the costumes, the bab (ee gads, who knew a sheep's head could be so repulsive!!) This dark vision of life comes from DAvid Lynch, the master of dark visions. I recommend it with a caveat -- your jaw will be on the ground from the first scenes and it does not matter if you understand it all, you will NOT forget it.
1572704861|4.0|Set in India during the British colonial era (and published twenty-some years before Indian independence), Forster tells the story of an Indian surgeon, Dr. Aziz, and his sometime gratifying, sometimes harrowing, and always complicated interactions with the British. He also gives the perspective of several of the British residents and guests, and through this ensemble assembles a compelling picture of how colonialism affects the colonialized, the colonializers, and the relationships between the two. Some of the ideas remind me of Paolo Freire's [[ASIN:0826412769 Pedagogy of the Oppressed]], in which he explains the dehumanizing impact of an oppressor relationship on both the oppressor and the oppressed.    The prose is beautiful, and Forster contextualizes his message with lively dialogue, beautiful images of rural India, demonstrations of the difficult relations between Hindus and Muslims, and other elements of conflict within Indian society as well as between the Indians and the British. The story isn't fast-paced, but with a little patience it draws you in. And the language is delicious. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Sam Dastor, and he does a very good job with distinctive voices and accents in a book filled with essential dialogue (except in the one paragraph when an American missionary makes an appearance; his accent was unlike that of any American I've ever met).    A reviewer for The Guardian wrote when the book was first published in 1924 to \\"congratulate him [Forster] upon the tone and temper of his new novel. To speak of its `fairness' would convey the wrong impression, because that suggests a conscious virtue. This is the involuntary fairness of the man who sees.\\" Forster's vision is well worth reading.    [The Guardian review is available online: C.M., \\"A Passage to India,\\" Guardian Unlimited, June 20, 1924.]

When the hell Hollywood will stop treating us as if we're goddammed piggybank?!    Wanna know what I'm waiting for, when it comes to Robocop? I've heard MGM were interested in remaking \\"Robocop 2\\", but with Frank Miller's uncensored original sceenplay, and as an animated flick! Now why didn't I heard nothing new on that project?! Is it so goddamn hard to greenlight a production that will so obviously be MONEY?!!!    Anyway, doesn't look like I'm stupid enough to pay this new edition too... or so I hope.
0385522401|4.0|Ian McEwan seems to have cornered the market on epic days (Saturday) or epic families (Atonement) and now on epic relationships with On Chesil Beach. We can see, smell, taste, and feel these characters so vividly and understand their pasts so well, that the story makes perfect sense. Not as perfectly drawn as the other two novels mentioned, but still a compact character study looking at what pulls people together (expectations) and what can rip them apart (again, expectations).

B000068IEU|1.0|This movie is not scary, nor was it well thought out. The story line is pretty good, however the movie just plain sucks. It's really not even worth the rental fee. The characters were unreactive & lethargic. Furthermore, the music was pretty corny. I'm a huge horor movie buff, but this movie was a major disappointment.
B000002UAI|5.0|I'm assuming that this is the same version of the CD that I have. I love the music but the CD is in mono as are all of the early Beatles CDs until Help! I have the Parlophone LP in Stereo and it's so much better. Hopefully, they'll release this CD again in stereo.
B000000WG4|5.0|A true master piece from the early seventies though I wonder if people would have known about if if it hadn't been the theme song to the Exorcist.<br /><br />When you listen to the CD you realize the musicianship is incredible and then you realize that Mike Oldfield was only nineteen when he created this. There are only two very long songs on this CD. Beyond the AM version to this song thee is so much there. When people bought this album in the seventies they where buying it for the AM version of Tubular bells (The Exorcist theme) so they bought the forty five rpm didn't realize they where missing the best part of the song buy not buying the album. Oldfield set the bar high for himself with this release but amazingly enough though he continues to clear that bar with his new releases. Sit back relax end enjoy this CD. Let it take you on it's musical journey.<br /><br />A master piece indeed.

B00001OH7T|5.0|I don't think this was one of Bowie's most critically acclaimed albums, but it is one of my favorites, right up there with \\"Ziggy\\", \\"Aladdin Sane\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\".  While it doesn't have much in common with those classics technically, the \\"spirit\\" is the same:  musical moods and lyrics that hint at darker, alternate worlds, vocals and arrangements that sound like no one else's.  This time around, Bowie is singing soul, complete with \\"soulful\\" back-up singers.  Most of the tracks are dance-oriented, but that's not surprising since the album was released right at the dawn of Disco.  \\"Win\\" and \\"Somebody Up There Likes Me\\" are both positive and inspirational to a degree, and I like that.  \\"Right\\" is a smooth-as-silk dance track that takes you on quite a ride.  It contains an intricate vocal \\"debate\\" between Bowie and the back-up singers that is so tricky and precise, they must have needed about 100 takes to get it down, or else inspiration struck and they were lucky enough to improvise it.  The first and last tracks, \\"Young Americans\\" and \\"Fame\\", have similarities.  Both are strong, dynamic tracks, especially if you crank them up, with interesting lyrics.  And both have a John Lennon connection.  In fact, John Lennon is all over this album.  In \\"Young Americans\\" we hear the back-ups sing \\"I heard the news today oh boy\\", an allusion to Lennon's \\"A Day In The Life\\", and \\"Fame\\" was co-written and co-sung by Lennon.  There's more:  \\"Across The Universe\\" is one of Lennon's songs from \\"Let It Be\\", and Lennon contributes guitar to this cut as well as to \\"Fame\\".  Most reviewers don't like Bowie's version of \\"Across The Universe\\", and I admit it took me time to get used to it, but now I like it.  Moving on, \\"Fascination\\" is another good dance track, and \\"Can You Hear Me\\" is a slower soul ballad, very effectively conveying the singer's desire to rekindle a relationship that was once meaningful and real.<br /><br />Although I admit that the transformation seemed rather abrupt (Ziggy one day, Thin White Duke the next), still the songs on \\"Young Americans\\" strike me as genuine.  We all go through changes (no pun intended), and this was a big one for David Bowie.  I guess his huge success in America pointed him in this direction.  All I know is, I never get tired of listening to this album.<br /><br />By the way, I've seen this album compared unfavorably to \\"Station To Station\\", and I've heard it called just a transition to \\"S 2 S\\", but I like \\"Young Americans\\" MUCH better.

B000MGBSI0|5.0|Season 2 was \\"Melrose Place's\\" breakout season; cementing it in primetime soap history forever. This is when \\"Melrose\\" really began to rock. There are tons of awesome eps during Season Two. Get Season Two and your DVD player will sizzle!!!

Keith pays a homeless man to make filthy calls to Alison. Michael and Kimberly shack up.     A Long Night's Journey 9/15/1993   When Alison goes back to Keith's hotel room to take him to the airport he tells her that he has been stalking her and then tries to rape her! This ep was sorta unrealistic (in a foolish way.) Because Alison was attacked by Keith, reported the attack to the police, Keith was arrested and interrogated by the police and the DA decides not to file charges ~ this all happens in 1 evening!     Revenge 9/22/1993  Billy shows up at Keith'swork to tell him to stay away from Alison. After being shot down by Alison over the phone Keith takes his own life. Sydney gets her kicks by cleaning Michael's dirty laundry.    Fire Power 9/29/1993  Amanda almost fires Alison when she enjoys just a little too much of some of the hair of the dog that bit her!    Of Bikes and Men 10/6/1993   Jake realizes that he accidentally burned down his shop.    Hot and Bothered 10/13/1993   Billy and Alison try to get Jo and Jake back together. Jane's divorce is finalized. She goes out to celebrate with the girls and then feeling lonely goes to Robert's apartment and has sex with him on his floor. Sydney passes out on Michael's couch after his party.     Flirting With Disaster 10/20/1993   Furious, Jane throws turn-coat Sydney out after she learns that Sydney went to Michael's party. Amanda rents Sydney an apartment. Michael and Sydney get it on when Kimberly is out of town.    No Bed of Roses 10/27/1993  Palmer offers Jake a job. Sydney blackmails Michael into sex by threatening to expose him. Jane wants to take things slower with Robert.    Married to It 11/3/1993  Sydney takes a job at Shooters as a server. Kimberly catches Sydney in bed with Michael then runs to Jane for sympathy. Alison is jealous (yet again) when Steve starts to casually see Jo. By the way, I love it when Jane says to Alison, \\"my sister, that's really sick.\\" Honey, she ain't seen nothing yet.     The Tangled Web 11/10/1993  Jo, Billy and Alison go to Steve's ranch. Jake finds out that Palmer is a cheat.    Collision Course 11/17/1993   Michael gets back into Kimberly's good graces by having dinner with her and then giving her a fancy diamond (engagement) ring. On the way home from the restaurant Michael drives d runk and gets into a h orrible a ccident. The police suspect d runk d riving and in an effort to save Michel's b utt Matt agrees to change his blood level on his medical hospital records. Sydney meets Lauren Ethridge, a proprietor of a high-classh ooker ring.      Cold Turkey 11/24/1993   Amanda sends Alison out of town on business during Thanksgiving. The FBI orders that Jake help out in their on-going investigation against Palmer. When Jane refuses to spend Thanksgiving with Syd she goes over to Lauren's home to spend the holiday with her new \\"family.\\" Marion brings her daughter home to Cleveland.     Duet for One 12/1/1993  Matt gives Michael the bad news; that Kimberly has died! Michael arrogantly says, \\"I should sue that b itch for taking her out of here;\\" obviously referring to Marion Shaw! He's then transferred to a rehab center but is able to guilt Jane into letting him come stay with her. Furious with Alison (for spending Thanksgiving out of town with Steve), Billy goes to stay with Jake. Meanwhile, Syd goes to work for Lauren. One of her clients enjoys kinky sex games which isn't something Sydney is into so she skips out. Suffice it to say, Lauren is FURIOUS and threatening when she says to Sydney, \\"don't you ever put my name or my livelihood behind the 8-ball!\\"      Strange Bedfellows 12/15/1993   Alison goes to Steve's ranch but (like Kirstie Alley did) realizes that he isn't the man for her. When Michael falls off the sofa (at Jane's apartment) Syd hears his agonizing cries and offers to help him, only after he agrees to apologize for the way he treated her. On the rebound from Alison and on the rebound from Jake, both Amanda and Billy spend the night together.     Under the Mistletoe 12/22/1993   Billy is able to sneak out of Amanda's apartment without Alison seeing him (although he is half nude.) I really like how they played the Christmas Music as Billy was scurrying through the courtyard holding his pants; it really added a touch of class & Christmas cheer! Matt puts together a Christmas party for his stepdaughter, Nikki. In the spirit of Christmas, Alison and Billy get back together. Sydney makes a tearful confession to a priest, \\"I'm a p rostitute.\\"    Reunion Blues 1/5/1994  Amanda makesthreats to Billy when she finds out that he's back with Allison. When Sydney is busted for hooking Michael bails her out. He then blackmails Syd into helping him chase away Robert (from Jane's be d!)    Michael's Game 1/12/1994   Alison goes over Amanda's head at D&D and complains to Bruce about her. Bruce doesn't like Amanda (any more than Alison does) so he rightfully doesn't take Amanda's side. (It's absolutely surreal to see Amanda be put on her place, and by a man, no less!!) Sydney gets one of her little h ooker-friends to sleep with (a very h orny) Robert during a business trip. The s ex is videotaped and an anonymous package is sent to Jane who subsequently throws Robert out in the middle of the night (when she finally gets around to watching the video.) With enjoyment in his eyes (and ma lice in his heart,) Michael watches the fight from upstairs out Syd's window!      Arousing Suspicions 1/26/1994  After Michael rejects her (once again) Sydney tells Jane about Michael's involvement in scheming to break her and Robert up. Michael tries to explain to Jane but she throws him out anyway as he says, \\"like I drove her kicking and screaming into the w horehouse.\\" Jane tells him that Syd has made her mistakes but she would rather have her sister in her life than his sorry self!! I loooooove it!!    The Young Men and the Sea 2/2/1994   Amanda and Jake invest in Reed's business. (Who knows why, because about the only thing that Reed looks qualified to do is strip.) Jane files a restraining order against Michael when he starts harassing her. When Michael shows up at her apartment Sydney comes running down to hide him so he won't get arrested.     Parting Glances 2/9/1994   Jake and Amanda bail on Reed's business venture. Sydney hears Michael talking in his sleep and puts two and two together; finding out that Michael was drunk on the night of the accident. Alison goes to NY to see Billy.    Swept Away 2/16/1994   After being kidnapped and held captive and beaten, Joharpoons Reed! Somehow he's able to get back onto the boat when Jo shoots to kill. Sydney blackmails Michael into letting her move in with him.    With This Ball and Chain 2/23/1994   Amanda gets an excellent attorney to represent Jo (on the murder charges) who's able to get the charges dropped. At Billy and Alison's engagement party Jake punches Billy because of his little Christmastime fling with Amanda. Despite his protests, Sydney thinks that she and Michael are made for one another.     Otherwise Engaged 3/2/1994   Sydney and Jane get into a horrible catfight that spills over into the swimming pool when Jane sees Sydney wearing her wedding dress. Inside her apartment Jane says to Syd, \\"OMG, take it off now and get the hell out.\\" Syd says, \\"fine I'm leaving,\\" as she runs out with the dress still on! The girls' fight spills over into the pool as Jane says to Sydney, \\"you are trash Sydney, with the rap sheet to prove it.\\" Later in the ep, Mrs. Andrews (Gail Strickland) comes to the beach house to try to get Sydney to come back to Earth. Syd says to her mom, \\"why don't you take your broom and fly back to Chicago!\\" And, she goes ahead with the wedding and the only guest is Matt (who little Syd is also blackmailing.) Michael takes Sydney on a honeymoon and implies to Matt that he is going to be a widower in the near future!     Love, Mancini-Style 3/16/1994   Michael attempts to try to kill Sydney but just can't do it. Matt confesses to Jane why in fact Michael agreed to marry her little witch of a sister. Jane uses this info to stir up trouble for the new Mr. and Mrs. Mancini.     The Two Mrs. Mancinis 3/23/1994  Billy goes back home with Alison for a family event. Alison begins having strange nightmares. Michael and Sydney show up at Gram's will-reading hoping to get a piece of the action when Jane is awarded $100,000.00. Katherine Andrews says to the two (in such an overdone, over-the-top way,) \\"I will never forgive you for showing such disrespect during my mother's funeral.\\" Later on, Matt shows just a little backbone when he decks Michael.    In Bed With the Enemy 4/6/1994   Alison sees a therapist to help her find out what her dreams mean. Amanda acts as a go-between for Michael and Jane.     Psycho Therapy 4/20/1994   Amanda and Jo catch Ted (a handyman that Amanda recently fired) (Christopher Gartin) peeping from a vacant apartment. Michael learns that Dr. Levin enjoys dirty sex with hookers and uses the info to his advantage. He brings one of Levin's favorite hookers to an event at Levin's home prompting the good doctor to say, \\"how dare you bring that trash into my house.\\" In which Michael replies, \\"trash today, bucking bronco tonight.\\" Levin has no choice but to promote Michael. Michael's finally starting to enjoy being married to Syd; as they kiss the screen pans very far away to the outside beach...to a watchful Kimberly! (Incidentally, Marcia Cross is unbilled in this ep, I suppose that was so no one would know that she would be seen at the very, very end!!)     The B itch Is Back 4/27/1994   Kimberly shows up, \\"looking like a refugee from the night of the living dead\\" as Michael put it (in Season 3.) Michael then dumps Sydney and she sics the cops on him. When Kimberly shows up again at the hospital Sydney faints at the shock of seeing her. \\"Finally the response I was waiting for,\\" evil Kimberly says.     Imperfect Strangers 5/4/1994  Amanda hires her mother's lover, Chas Russell (Jeff Kaake) which really annoys Alison because the only thing Chas likes to do is talk about his sexual proclivities with Amanda. Meanwhile, Sydney goes to Jane saying between pathetic sobs, \\"I think I'm having a nervous breakdown, can you help me.\\" Jane says to her in such a hateful (and incredibly condescending tone,) \\"No Syd, I can't\\" right before she slams the door in her face! Later on, Kimberly threatens Sydney when the little idiot won't take \\"no\\" for an answer. Sydney's hooker party is broken up by the newly freed Lauren who also threatens Sydney's life. Boy, Syd isn't have a very good day, is she?     Devil With the G-String On 5/11/1994  Billy tells Alison to keep quiet about Chas (there is actually nothing to keep quiet about because Chas made all this up to start a little trouble.) Michael and co. find Sydney stripping under an assumed name, \\"Jungle Jane.\\" Billy blurts to Jake that Amanda slept with Chas when he becomes drunk. Michael is demoted when Kimberly set him up to sabotage. Kimberly then bullies Jane into forking over money from the business and tires to use the money to take out a hit on Michael.     Till Death Do Us Part 5/18/1994  Jo just wants Amanda to step aside so she can be with Jake. Hilary Michaels (Amanda's mother) (JR's wife, Linda Gray, of course) refuses to believe that Amanda did not seduce Chas. Chas then files suit against D&D and Bruce refuses to support Amanda. Sydney is assaulted by a few street hookers. Kimberly consoles her and over some ice-cream in the park they plot to kill Michael. Billy's old college buddy comes to town for the wedding and gets really chummy with Matt. The two men share a passionate kiss, but FOX was too h omophobic to air it; so it was completely edited out. Jake and Amanda fool around and Jo catches him coming out of Amanda's place half nude. Jo then breaks it off with him. Amanda tries to butter Alison up in the hopes that she will not testify against her during the sexual harassment arbitration. Kimberly and Sydney attempt to kill Michael but Jane comes to his safety (by accident.) Kimberly steals Jane's car keys at the wedding. Just before Alison is to walk down the isle she remembers that it was in fact her father who molested her as a child. Mr. Parker (Monte Markham) threatens to kill her if she says anything. And Alison flees out the window and goes to Meredith's (Tracy Nelson) home in San Francisco. Chas' claim is thrown out when Hilary hears him taunting Amanda. As Michael is coming out of the hospital Kimberly runs him over in Jane's car. In syndication, this is a 2-part ep.     The Cast of Season 2 was awesome. It's hard to say who my favorite is. Perhaps Reed Carter. Wasn't he so hot? He looked a lot like Jake but he had some more meet on his bones. He was a crazy ex-con, but that didn't seem to matter to Jo. I loved when Reed said to Jo (when she broke out of the boat-dungeon that he put her in,) \\"stupid Jo, really stupid.\\" I guess the writers liked that line a lot, too. Because they used the exact same lines (in a very similar plot) a Season later with Jo and Jess (Dan Cortese.) Although, this time it lost some momentum because Jess was no Reed Carter! I also really started to appreciate Syd during Season 2. She proved that she wasn't just a stupid hooker when she blackmailed Michael and then turned around and plotted with Kimberly to kill him!     Michael wins the hutzpah award. Of course by Season 2 he shows his true colors and we all learn that he's nothing more than a cheat. But he is intent on living his life according to his own set of rules. You gotta give him credit for that. I especially loved it when Michael set Robert up with one of Syd's hooker-friends. When Robert comes to the hospital and accused him Michael even admits it! And Robert says, \\"Jane still knows there's a big difference between you and me.\\" And, Michael replies (without blinking,) \\"There is a difference, I cheat with doctors, not WH*RES!\\" I also liked how Michael used Ingrid (another of Sydney's hooker-friends) to blackmail Dr. Levin (Carmen Argenziano,) saying, \\"trash today, bucking bronco tonight.\\"     (Very) Slight Continuity Error:  I am not sure which ep it is. Perhaps \\"No Bed of Roses\\" or \\"The Tangled Web\\" or another ep around this time. It's a very brief error, you have to be watching very carefully and closely. Jo comes to D&D to see Amanada. I believe it was about photographing Jake. Anyway, before she goes into Amanda's office, she stops and chats with Alison. You will notice that Jo's hairhas that \\"just woke up look\\" with fly-aways. It was cute, but it looked somewhat undone. Anywho, Alison directs Jo to Amanda's office; more or less, you know how people at D&D just barge right into everyone else's offices. And by the time Jo gets to Amanda's office her hair is fixed! Keep in mind there wasn't a commercial (that would at least help to explain if Jo stopped and went to the restroom.) Nope, she kept walking right from where she was with Alison straight into Amanda's office! And when you look at Jo's hair (while she's inside Amanda's office) you can see that her hair is nicely styled. It's soft and flat without any fly-always. We all know that they film, take after take after take. I suppose the director noticed that her hair wasn't \\"Melrose Perfect\\" and decided to splice 2 scenes together? But couldn't he have re-shot the first part?    You'll be shocked.... ...You'll be mortified... You'll be stunned... You'll be terrified... ...You'll hate yourself... ...if you miss it...!! You never know what they're gonna do, you just want to be there when they do it!
0345347951|4.0|An appraisal of \\"Childhood's End\\" by George Debrowski once claimed that Clarke wrote \\"a what-if scenario for the sake of a story, and it got away from him.\\" Debrowski meant this as high praise; for me it underscores the frustration I have with a novel whose story I love--but whose moralizing tone I find distracting.<br /><br />The \\"what-if\\" portions are nothing short of genius. In one of the best twists in sci-fi, humankind's first contact with extraterrestrials is with a race whose physical appearance taps our deepest mythic fears. As a result, for fifty years, this race of \\"Overlords\\" hides themselves until they earn our trust. Their presence brings peace and luxury to the world's inhabitants, and a particular child living in a utopian colony ultimately piques their interest. And in the meantime, a stowaway manages both to sneak his way to the aliens' home world and to return as the only human witness to the outcome of the Overlords' undertaking.<br /><br />All these plots (and other subplots) are beautifully interconnected and satisfactorily resolved. It's the part \\"got away from him\\" that blunted, for me, Clarke's otherwise compelling \\"what-if\\" story. Specifically, the metaphysical elements of the book, whether meant allegorically or satirically, fall flat.<br /><br />Some of the conversations between the humans and the Overlords and the almost defensive depiction of the occult are, at times, laborious or (worse) didactic. Ponderous exposition (see, for example, most of chapter 6) and lengthy orations (chapter 20) can ruin the best novel. Even if, as I believe, Clarke didn't mean to be preachy in the manner of, say, Robert Heinlein, the book flirts with the same moralizing tone in its debates on and discussions of subjects (e.g., telepathy) that are ultimately meaningless in the real world the reader inhabits. While it's true that Clarke's belief in the paranormal has changed drastically in the last fifty years, \\"Childhood's End\\" would nevertheless have been much stronger if he had presented its mystical elements as givens, in the way (for example) Roger Zelazny successfully and unapologetically incorporates Hinduism in \\"Lord of Light.\\"<br /><br />Unlike some readers, however, I liked the ending (which I won't give away). Here, I think, Clarke's willingness to remain ambiguous and avoid discursiveness enhances the philosophical undertones of his work. While some have argued that the book presents \\"what humanity can become and its importance to strive towards that,\\" it seems to me that Clarke shudders at the utopian and evolutionary visions he depicts. The book does not simply anticipate the passing of our collective innocence (\\"childhood's end\\") but instead seems to mourn it. Civilization's foibles and even its faults, not its potential perfection and transcendence, are what make life interesting.<br /><br />Then again, perhaps I'm reading too much into the book. Fans of the book will argue, as Clarke does in his introduction to the 1989 edition, \\"It's a work of fiction, for goodness sake!\\" But it's Clarke's fiction, rather than his soapbox philosophy, that I enjoy--and I would agree that he remains one of our best science fiction authors whenever he keeps the high-minded prose within the boundaries of the plot and the allegory within the realm of our experience.resented its mystical elements as givens, in the way (for example) Roger Zelazny successfully and unapologetically incorporates Hinduism in \\"Lord of Light.\\"    Unlike some readers, however, I liked the ending (which I won't give away).

B000LXHK2C|5.0|....so instructs Max to his flock of traders or bond people or whatever you call them. As they follow the masters words, another fortune is secured and a satisfied Max Skinner returns to his opulent high-rise and opens a piece of mail from overseas. He learns of his Uncle Henry's passing and dutifully travels to midland France to tidy up the details.<br />Once there Max finds himself surrounded by the memories that have been mothballed way, awayyyy back in a mind devoted to other things for the past 20 years. What to do...what to do. Sell this old house of course a.s.a.p. and get back to the business of the day. But, that empty pool in back, with the bottom covered in soil was the same pool young Max would impress his uncle with a swan dive. That unused tennis court with the sagging net......the same court Uncle Henry would explain to the young frustrated mind of Max that losing should be as graceful as winning. And what to do with the vinyard, his uncle's passion maintained by the loyal Duflot who has been singing to the vines these many years. Warm memories, one by one come creeping back as Max's week-long stay at the old house turns into much more. Max runs into a local woman who he thinks he remembers from his boyhood summers? Max's blackberry is constantly vibrating courtesy of Gemma, Max's secretary played by Archie Panjabi with expert comic timing holding down the fort back in London(\\"mission control\\") and reminding him of the urgency of his returning presence. A heartfelt plea from<br />Duflot for Max to reconsider selling the beloved estate and winery to nameless buyers. Tiny TaTi scampering inbetween everybody's feet. And a young woman, from America, arriving one day to find her father, Uncle Henry is no longer part of her life. All of this must Max juggle. This film is pure delight with ample amounts of humor mixed with thoughtful reflection and love. A wonderful wonderful movie and let's not forget the soundtrack....hearing Hey Joe sung in French completely blindsided me and the couple of songs sung by Harry Nilsson came out of left-field as well.....a smooth big band jazzy swing number played in one scene as Max sits at the desk writing was wonderful. I guess the only drawback is that if you want to buy the soundtrack [[ASIN:B000JBWWBK A Good Year]] you will not be getting all the songs that you hear in the movie which is a shame. Nevertheless I still think it is a good buy for what you DO get because all of the songs are....here we go again...wonderful!  :)<br />Just like this movie! Points of interest that i must name specifically: Marion Cotillard as the young french woman/Archie Panjabi as Max's all-knowing assistant/the matchbook car Max rents,the microscopic Smartcar, and i saw one in Connecticut today, I couldn't believe it!/the disc comes with a feature-length commentary between director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Mark Klein that quadruples the enjoyment of the film you've just seen......in summation, all of the acting is top notch, the French countryside and grande estate are a beautiful escape and just let me savor the face of Fanny Chenal a few thousand more times please?

0060574216|4.0|I recently read an older hardcover edition of this book, which I am reviewing, assuming that it is 99-100% the same as this latest version.    I started with really low expectations because I expected the book to be full of platitudes and generalities, and to contain silly 10-step programs to having a better relationship. I was pleasantly surprised.    The author shows how some of the basic social needs of men and women differ and how not to misinterpret the opposite sex's behavior and intentions. I recognized some of my own behavior in this book! Also, there are specific and actionable examples, e.g. when A says \\"X\\", you are tempted to answer something like \\"Y\\" but instead do or say \\"Z\\". The book looks at issues from both male and female perspective, so there is something for everyone. In fact, it makes for fun couple reading.    That said, the book is *very* repetitive and towards the end there are some mini-chapters that devolve into \\"unresolved childhood issues\\" psychobabble.    Overall, the book is solid and worth the time and money to read it.

I went to school near Durban, SA and the album floated around at parties and such. His haunting music has stayed with me ever since, I will be buying Cold Fact now!
B000H7JD4A|5.0|A Matter Of Life And Death (2006.), Iron Maiden's fourteenth studio album<br /><br />The new millenium has been a huge revitalisation for Iron Maiden. It cannot be denied that the `90s was a barren period for the heavy metal gods. The departures of guitarist Adrian Smith and later frontman Bruce Dickenson left a huge hole to fill in the band. `Virtual XI', released in 1998 was an extremely disappointing album and marked a low point for the band. However brighter days were ahead as Bruce Dickenson and Adrian Smith both returned to the band. The restored line up then released `Brave New World' and `Dance Of Death' which were both fantastic albums. So could Iron Maiden, heavy metal giants of more than just a generation pull another serving of classic metal out of the bag? With the band's popularity again surging, `A Matter Of Life And Death' couldn't have been released at a better time...<br /><br />Over their career, Maiden have had more than  a fair share at successful attempts to push musical boundaries. Their early career, sparked during the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal was revolutionary and then their progressive and conceptual stuff at the end of the `80s was revelatory. `A Matter Of Life  And Death' is very much a progressive album but it goes one step further and incorporates a grand, epic feel giving it an imposing, `magnum opus' style. There is plenty of life in Maiden yet and this album is an awesome expansion of their classic sound. For me and a number of other fans, this album is definitely the best of the band's work since the re-union of the classic line up but it is in many ways one of the best albums of Maiden's career, full stop. This brilliant album deserves more than just a mention alongside `Powerslave' and `Number Of The Beast'. In terms of songwriting, there is some extremely impressive stuff on here which can easily be put down as some of the band's best. There are giant epic songs which ooze the prog metal style that Maiden often incorporate into their music throughout the album. However, I personally find that what really makes this album a result is how the band performs the music. The album has that great `live' feel to it and the chemistry of the band seems better than ever. You can see this on the DVD which comes with some versions of the album. The band seem to be loving playing their new music and the new directions it takes them in. All of the band have a hand in the songwriting through the album which furthermore makes this work a proper band effort. Guitarists Smith, Murray and Gers all play out some fantastic riffs and memorable melodies across the album and Steve Harris' bass work always adds to the colour of the songs. Bruce is on top form with the operatic vocals and Nicko McBrain exhibits some of his finest drumming on this album, providing a mix between beats with heavy prescence and the more understated lines.<br /><br />`Different World', the album's opening track has proved to be an immensely popular track. The main riff is inescapable and some of the melodies in this brilliant opener are great. `These Colours Don't Run' is a classic heart on sleeves song from the band. Bruce gives an expressive vocal performance in a song dedicated to those serving in wars. `Brighter Than A Thousand Suns' is the first epic of the album, with a theme about the Manhattan Project. The song has some rousing choruses and plenty of varied sections which weave together seamlessly. `The Pilgrim' is equally strong  musically, with an eastern flavoured riff. Bruce Dickenson returns us to the themes of war with `The Longest Day', a song about the D-Day landings. There are some beautiful melodies in this one as well as racing guitars and a gripping chorus.<br /><br />`Out Of The Shadows' is more archetypal Maiden, with a nice mix of electro acoustic sections and heavier choruses. A song about birth and entering the world. The curiously titled `The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg' was another single off the album. The song opens and closes with a slow, atmospheric guitar work whilst the main part of the song features more classic riffs and inspired Dickenson Vocals. `For The Greater Good Of God' is a slower, more reflective epic which grows much more enjoyable with repeated listens. `Lord Of Light' features more impressive solos and melodies and a galloping section; something we haven't seen from Maiden in a few albums. `The Legacy' is an amazing closer, my personal favourite track on the album. This final epic is built up into different sections, each with their own melodies and themes. However this doesn't break the flow to the song and each section stands tall in their own right, lyrically covering humanity through time and the trail left from war and opposition. The acoustics are fantastic on this one!<br /><br />`A Matter Of Life And Death' is Iron Maiden's finest album in a long time and a classic in it's own right. Easily one of the best metal albums of 2006 this work is an epic journey of massive proportions and never loses it's life or spark. The band embarked on a great tour for this album, often playing the whole thing right through at some of the gigs - testament to the greatness of the material on here I guess. If you like Iron Maiden or music with an epic style, this album is a must!<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10h a slow, atmospheric guitar work whilst the main part of the song features more classic riffs and inspired Dickenson Vocals. `For The Greater Good Of God' is a slower, more reflective epic which grows much more enjoyable with repeated listens. `Lord Of Light' features more impressive solos and melodies and a galloping section; something we haven't seen from Maiden in a few albums. `The Legacy' is an amazing closer, my personal favourite track on the album.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Your illustrious Seer is at the beach now. The warm sun and ocean breeze are invigorating. The white seagulls circle overhead (watch out!), and I have been busy all afternoon trying to build a summer sand castle for myself meanwhile sweating to death in this Seer's cape. They said the fabric breathed and would be good in all temperatures. They lied. And, aside from all that, just when I get the sand castle to a stately form, some freckle-faced, red-headed bratty boy comes around and knocks it down. I threatened to report him to The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Seers, however, an ice cream cone made him go away. Dealing with Guido has made me very adept in any situation. Now if only the tides would stop being a threat. Ah well..........<br />Anyway, I am in the perfect setting to examine the rewards of \\"Pet Sounds\\" by the Beach Boys. Much has been written about this seminal album. And why not? It consistently ranks in the top 10 pop-rock albums of all time. And rightly so if you ask me.<br />Of course, it wasn't greeted ethusiastically when it came out. At least not as much as their prior hits. Brian Wilson took the hit most of all. Probably unjustly. But time has proven that it was the right move and the right time. To most, perhaps a little early and maybe they would say the wrong time. But I would have to disagree with that. Brian was ahead of everything on the scene at that time. He saw that the music was changing. Plus, artistically, you can not stay in the same place. Artistry needs real growth. Meanwhile, the other Beach Boys needed more hits- and this is why the chasm happened.<br />But, lets get into this a little more. The Beach Boys were (and still are) the ultimate summer group. Songs about California Girls, fast cars, high school life, requited love, and teen angst, angst, angst.  These songs were incredibly successful. But Brian knew that, as he got older, his audience were also doing the same thing. He wanted to try a new direction and add some sophistication. Looking back to 1966, this album is a monumental achievement- and remains so until this day. Sure, some may downplay the importance of this recording, however, that cannot eliminate the fact that it was a monumental change that influenced the musical landscape at that time forever. It is essential, and one of the very best.<br />But, getting to the main point. Brian Wilson was moving towards greater musical compostion and more adult and inner emotions on record. This was a mega step- and quite a risk at the same time. Most of the music is lush, well thought out, and instruments used precisely to get the right nuances that bounced around in his mind. Certainly the songs are confessional, i.e; \\"You Still Believe in Me\\", emotional, i.e, \\"That's Not Me\\", \\"I'm Waiting for the Day\\", and quiet, heartfelt romance, i.e; \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on my Shoulder)\\".  One must, of course, listen to all the colours and passages in this music. All these songs have a way of revealing certain moods that marry the music perfectly. Beautiful lilting breaks, shifting meter, an array of musical instruments heretofore never thought of in the pop-rock genre. Excellent.<br />And songs? We are treated to different, but essential, gratuitous hits with \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"Sloop John B\\". But more than this, Brian gives us 2 more considerable high standard gems. Yes. We get to \\"God Only Knows\\" which I nominate as the most beautiful song ever written in the course of popular music. Grandiose, glorious- I am fairly convinced that a higher power is somehow behind this remarkable song. Sweet, yearning, beautiful beyond compare. Angelic vocals as well. If anyone doubts Brian Wilson's genius, have them look to this song. Absolutely the highest gem. Then we get to the wispful \\"Caroline No\\". Brian reflects upon how time can change a relationship. He looks back to a time when his love was new and exciting and wonders why she changed. \\"Where is the girl I used to know\\"? He hurts badly from the change and yearns for a return to a satisfying relationship, knowing full well that it has changed forever. Listen to the end. A train in the distance, approaching at a rapid pace, getting louder, and then quickly passing by. A dog barks in the distance-urging its return. But it gone and then silence. What an incredible conveyence of mood this is for the ending. Superb.<br />In a way, the outtake of \\"I know There's an Answer\\" entitled \\"Hold On to Your Ego\\" to me, conveys the frustration Brian was going through in order to have the other members of the group in compliance with his new direction. But he knows he's alone and he knows that he's \\"going to lose the fight\\". Well, he may have lost it to them- however- he won the classic album. And we are all so much better that he did.<br />Now, I must go and make sure that kid isn't planning some new attack on my new home. I don't want to lose the fight anymore than Brian does.<br />In conclusion- a classic and a must have in any considerable music collection.<br /><br />Goats say \\"feed me\\", Seers say \\"read me\\". -- yours, Metamorphohange and yearns for a return to a satisfying relationship, knowing full well that it has changed forever.

It cannot be denied that the `90s was a barren period for the heavy metal gods. The departures of guitarist Adrian Smith and later frontman Bruce Dickenson left a huge hole to fill in the band. `Virtual XI', released in 1998 was an extremely disappointing album and marked a low point for the band. However brighter days were ahead as Bruce Dickenson and Adrian Smith both returned to the band. The restored line up then released `Brave New World' and `Dance Of Death' which were both fantastic albums. So could Iron Maiden, heavy metal giants of more than just a generation pull another serving of classic metal out of the bag? With the band's popularity again surging, `A Matter Of Life And Death' couldn't have been released at a better time...<br /><br />Over their career, Maiden have had more than  a fair share at successful attempts to push musical boundaries. Their early career, sparked during the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal was revolutionary and then their progressive and conceptual stuff at the end of the `80s was revelatory. `A Matter Of Life  And Death' is very much a progressive album but it goes one step further and incorporates a grand, epic feel giving it an imposing, `magnum opus' style. There is plenty of life in Maiden yet and this album is an awesome expansion of their classic sound. For me and a number of other fans, this album is definitely the best of the band's work since the re-union of the classic line up but it is in many ways one of the best albums of Maiden's career, full stop. This brilliant album deserves more than just a mention alongside `Powerslave' and `Number Of The Beast'. In terms of songwriting, there is some extremely impressive stuff on here which can easily be put down as some of the band's best. There are giant epic songs which ooze the prog metal style that Maiden often incorporate into their music throughout the album. However, I personally find that what really makes this album a result is how the band performs the music. The album has that great `live' feel to it and the chemistry of the band seems better than ever. You can see this on the DVD which comes with some versions of the album. The band seem to be loving playing their new music and the new directions it takes them in. All of the band have a hand in the songwriting through the album which furthermore makes this work a proper band effort. Guitarists Smith, Murray and Gers all play out some fantastic riffs and memorable melodies across the album and Steve Harris' bass work always adds to the colour of the songs. Bruce is on top form with the operatic vocals and Nicko McBrain exhibits some of his finest drumming on this album, providing a mix between beats with heavy prescence and the more understated lines.<br /><br />`Different World', the album's opening track has proved to be an immensely popular track. The main riff is inescapable and some of the melodies in this brilliant opener are great. `These Colours Don't Run' is a classic heart on sleeves song from the band. Bruce gives an expressive vocal performance in a song dedicated to those serving in wars. `Brighter Than A Thousand Suns' is the first epic of the album, with a theme about the Manhattan Project. The song has some rousing choruses and plenty of varied sections which weave together seamlessly. `The Pilgrim' is equally strong  musically, with an eastern flavoured riff. Bruce Dickenson returns us to the themes of war with `The Longest Day', a song about the D-Day landings. There are some beautiful melodies in this one as well as racing guitars and a gripping chorus.<br /><br />`Out Of The Shadows' is more archetypal Maiden, with a nice mix of electro acoustic sections and heavier choruses. A song about birth and entering the world. The curiously titled `The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg' was another single off the album. The song opens and closes with a slow, atmospheric guitar work whilst the main part of the song features more classic riffs and inspired Dickenson Vocals. `For The Greater Good Of God' is a slower, more reflective epic which grows much more enjoyable with repeated listens. `Lord Of Light' features more impressive solos and melodies and a galloping section; something we haven't seen from Maiden in a few albums. `The Legacy' is an amazing closer, my personal favourite track on the album. This final epic is built up into different sections, each with their own melodies and themes. However this doesn't break the flow to the song and each section stands tall in their own right, lyrically covering humanity through time and the trail left from war and opposition. The acoustics are fantastic on this one!<br /><br />`A Matter Of Life And Death' is Iron Maiden's finest album in a long time and a classic in it's own right. Easily one of the best metal albums of 2006 this work is an epic journey of massive proportions and never loses it's life or spark. The band embarked on a great tour for this album, often playing the whole thing right through at some of the gigs - testament to the greatness of the material on here I guess. If you like Iron Maiden or music with an epic style, this album is a must!<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10h a slow, atmospheric guitar work whilst the main part of the song features more classic riffs and inspired Dickenson Vocals. `For The Greater Good Of God' is a slower, more reflective epic which grows much more enjoyable with repeated listens. `Lord Of Light' features more impressive solos and melodies and a galloping section; something we haven't seen from Maiden in a few albums. `The Legacy' is an amazing closer, my personal favourite track on the album.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Big Joss fan, very sad Firefly was cancelled, but since it's on DVD, I watch it whenever I want.    Really wish they'd suddenly release a complete second season directly on DVD. I'd buy it on the spot.
B000002J2D|5.0|Well it came down to this one, which was essentially a sink or swim for the remaining trio. I love this one. It seems to me that the trio set out to prove a point- that they could make a quality album and boy, they did just that. I think this is very strong and certainly on a par with Duke. The tracks , the production - it all came together for them. An absolute deleight to listen to. Rutherford rises to the challenge and shines on the guitar(ala Deep in the motherlode is brilliant let alone the other tracks).Banks performs to his usual excellent standard(Undertow, Burning rope, Many to Many, The lady lies.)To say that Banks and Rutherford dominate the album is incredibly ignorant.Collins cowrote a few tracks and participated significantly in the others.Oh yes ,for students of fine drumming, listen in to how its done.  The guys rose to the challenge and put together a gem with this one and never looked back-to bad it is often overshadowed by Duke.
0778321606|4.0|A quick and easy read, with believable characters... which one were/are  you?  I found myself accurately predicting the ending too early for there to be much suspense, yet I enjoyed the stories of each of these ladies and their friendships.  I used to knit... maybe I will again... with a group of ladies after reading this first book of the knitting series.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Having read many poor reviews I was relieved after listening the album for the firs time. No doubt that it is different, but I'd say different in a positive way. I believe that it's great to experiment and search for unexpected approaches. The album is less aggressive, but the lyrics still are still trembling..    The only thing that I missed was Chaz + Mike combo, which worked great in previous releases. This time it looks like it's Chaz's album and Mike was busy with Fort Minor. Another thing - explicit content. I was really proud of LP for revealing emotions without that, cause it's the easiest way, and now.. For that and because LP fans had to do 4 years without new releases - a four.
B000PFU9GA|4.0|I thought this item was a bit overpriced but it was a gift for my daughter and she really wanted it. I couldn't find it in the stores. It arrived in good time as usual though.
B000LC3IDI|5.0|I'm an avid viewer of horror movies, so I'm not easily impressed or easily entertained.<br /><br />However, THIS film kept my attention and at certain points, made me realize how craftfully this story was written (and acted).<br /><br />No empty scares. No meaningless slashings. This is a story of mind games and punishment for the weak or undeserving. &lt;shiver><br /><br />Jigsaw, the main-mean-man, is in rare form, and his sidekick, Amanda, is a nice, rounded character. I loved hating her and felt sorry for her at times.<br /><br />The tale is layered and deep with theme. The gore is fun and realistic! Love the hog slaughter! The torture devices in this volume are HARSH.<br /><br />I highly recommend this one for a rainy night at home. However, after watching SAW III, I will wonder if I'm even safe in my own home. Some nut case might be hiding behind a door, waiting to drug me and drag me to his/her torture lair!
0385522401|4.0|That \\"On Chesil Beach\\" is written by Ian McEwan should be enough to convince readers to open the book, for in his hands he could write about anything, even the distasteful details of two virgins' wedding night, and it would be interesting, and captivating; and that's what's he's done here.  The cynic, which I am on most days, would say this short novel is a cautionary reminder of how important it is for people to take each other's bodies for a test ride (or a few hundred, one would hope) before they decided to get married.  But, set in 1962, the story is a summary of the prevailing mores.  In retrospect, laughable, but the protagonists, Edward and Florence, are so well drawn that it's difficult not to feel sympathy with both of them, for the \\"mess\\" they find themselves in, on what should be the happiest day (or night) of their lives.    The book, from its smaller physical dimensions to its limited amount of action, has a stifling quality to it, which plays out as Edward and Florence are squeezed toward their inevitable conclusion.  It's best summed up in this passage:  \\"They barely knew each other, and never could because of the blanket of companionable nearsilence that smothered their differences and blinded them as much as it bound them.\\"  And that condition determines their future.

My favorite songs songs on the CD are \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Gravity.\\" If you are fan of incredible songwriting, as well good someone who really can show off their music, This CD is just for you!

B000MR9D5E|4.0|This video series is facinating and causes us to reflect even more on the greatness of our God.  We were disappointed with the evolution scattered throughout the narraration, but the footage is simply amazing.
1400063515|5.0|The author is expanding upon his earlier work and as such is well worth the reading.  The idea behind the title and the book is that the most important events in financial markets, as in life itself, are unexpected and not presaged by earlier experience.  The examples are illuminating and the insight worthy of the time spent.    He spends some time bashing the improper application of Gaussian models (normal distribution statistics) to many financial market analyses and predictions.  Taleb properly recognizes his debt to Mandlebrot's books and papers.  This corollary to the eponymous black swan and other anecdotes is worth the reading time as well.  I was disappointed that Taleb didn't explain how he makes this insight work to improve his outcomes, either personally or financially.  So it is sort of half a book.  'Here are my observations,' but the application is left to the readers' imaginations and understanding.  It reminded me of another great book, Jane Jacobs \\"Wealth of Nations\\" book which was also excellent, but ended where volume two should have begun.
0380973839|4.0|Presented is an interesting take on a \\"futuristic\\" takeover of Mars by inhabitors of the third planet from the Sun. What transpires is a series of expeditions to Mars by men from America.     They are greeted with everything from murderous rage, indifference, nostalgia, and an extinct planet.     Throughout the tale, which spans a period of 27 years, there are hints of a global breakdown on Earth, which is slowing tearing itself apart.     While an entertaining read, the only complaint that I have is that this reads like a collection of tales, with only slight hints at continuity throughout the novel. Otherwise, I very much recommend this book.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|What a delightful insight into the person that is Streisand.  The apperance of Barry Gibb for the duet still fills me with a warm glow every time i see it.
B00005JPHT|4.0|\\"Sicko\\" is an entertaining, occasionally funny, but ultimately disturbing look at the health care system in America.  It is Michael Moore's impassioned plea for universal health care in the U.S.<br /><br />Government-sponsored health care has not been accepted in this country because many people fear that it would lead to a decrease in the quality and availability of care.  Moore brilliantly turns that argument around by showing us we have more to fear from the current system.  He presents real life horror stories of people who did everything right, who were supposedly well-covered, but then had the misfortune of a serious illness or accident and their insurance companies abandoned them.  Using loopholes from the arcane to the insane, the evil insurance companies found ways to weasel out of their coverage, with the result that people were either wiped out financially or died because they could not get life-saving procedures.<br /><br />Moore is out to scare us where we feel most vulnerable--we all face the possibility of serious illness over which we have no control--and he does a good job.  You may find yourself noticing subtle symptoms while watching this, and wondering if you will be the next person to get some rare tumor that your insurance won't cover.  Essentially Moore's point is:  what good is the best medical care in the world if you can't afford it and your insurance company won't cover it?<br /><br />Then, after scaring us silly, Moore shows us what he believes is the solution: a health care system run by the government, as in Canada, the U.K. and France.  In these places, people don't worry about paying for medical bills because the government pays for everything.  In addition, no one is uninsured and everyone receives good care.<br /><br />It's a compelling argument, and if you didn't know any better, you'd wonder why we don't rush to adopt such a system.  Moore's explanation for this is that the insurance and drug companies are evil, have bought and paid for Congress, and keep the rest of us too much in debt and afraid to lose our jobs to speak out and demand better care.  While this will appeal to left wing zealots and conspiracy theorists, the rest of us should be more discerning and look deeper...<br /><br />But since this is a Michael Moore film, we don't get an objective, balanced look at this complex issue.  The film presents one side of a debate on an issue about which reasonable people can and do disagree.  By structuring his film around selected interviews and anecdotes, and a selective look at facts and statistics, Moore is free to show us the absolute worst about the U.S. health care system and contrast it with the absolute best about the systems in other countries.  For example, we are told that the U.S. ranks 37th in the world in health care, but we are not told that many nations with government health care systems rank even lower.  We are told that people in Canada have free access to medical care, but we are not told about long waits for standard medical tests or elective surgery that have been widely reported in that country.  We are told about all the wonderful benefits that the French government provides, but we are not told about the spiraling growth of taxes and unemployment and the dismal performance of the French economy as it struggles to keep up with its health care costs.<br /><br />There are benefits to a private market health care system which you will not hear about in this film.  The best specialists are often found in the U.S., and many state of the art drugs and new medical procedures are developed here.  In short, if you have the means, you'd probably choose the U.S. over Canada, France or the UK for your medical care.<br /><br />That said, it's hard to watch Sicko without coming away with the conclusion that the US system has some serious flaws.  In the film's most powerful segment, Moore takes a group of ailing 9/11 rescue workers to Guantanamo Bay to see if they can get medicalcare.  Apparently, the US government provides full medical care to imprisoned enemy combatants, whereas the 9/11 rescue workers cannot get coverage.  Turned away at Guantanamo, Moore takes his group of patients to a local Cuban hospital where they apparently get excellent--and free-- medical care.  This is Moore at his best; creating dramatic and provocative scenes that force us to see the absurdity in our current system.<br /><br />In the end, Sicko succeeds in unsettling us, and presents a powerful case for making changes to the US health care system. Whether a government-sponsored universal health care system is the ultimate solution or whether there are options that would improve upon that system is a topic deserving of further debate beyond what Moore has given  us.ent provides full medical care to imprisoned enemy combatants, whereas the 9/11 rescue workers cannot get coverage.

B000AYEL1A|5.0|been waiting for this epic film of streisand at her best to come out on dvd for ages, finally I've got it!.  dosen't dissapoint, Streisand at her best, evergreen is as fresh and beautiful as when i first heard it. the emotion that comes across is touching.  Fans of Streisand will love this classic.
B000O1799U|3.0|I enjoyed this movie because it is based loosely on the story of one of my favorite Motown groups, the Supremes. But the downside is that there's not much bonus material (at least not on this edition). The #1 thing I look for on DVDs is commentary by directors, producers &/or actors; I found none here. So I'm glad I saved money & storage space by renting instead of buying.
0618680004|4.0|A rational book on the subject questioning a personal God.  I found myself agreeing with the conclusions as they were unveiled.  This was done by stating facts, not by attacking one's religion.
B00006F2TV|3.0|I've been a spidy fan for ever and when I saw they were making a movie I thought Awesome.The move was'nt bad but tobey in the peter Parker role was a disapointment for me after reading the comics.He made a pretty good spidy but Peter he did not.
0671027387|5.0|I read this book in about 3 hours, and I think I tried to hold my breath most of the time. Although the escapes are a bit far-fetched, it is still a great plot and a fast read. If you want a book that keeps you reading, this is one of those.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I vaguely recall hearing about this film, and I don't even remember what it was I heard.  All I know is I had no desire to see it because Mars Attacks! kept coming into my head, and I hated that film.     In 2006, on a Chrismtas flight back home, I happened to look up at the monitors from time to time and caught a few bits and pieces of the film while listening to my MP3 music. Without sound, the film seemed stupid, the villain seemed corny and the acting looked horrible.  The only thing that kept my attention was wondering if the blonde was actually Sigourney or just a younger look-alike.  Hey, the in-flight monitors are small!  Bottom line is, I never realized the film was mainly a comedy.    Flash ahead four months when I was moving into a new place and a friend had given me the Galaxy Quest DVD as a house-warming present.  I hooked up the home theater system first thing so I could get some activity going in the new place, and I took a break and watched a little of Galaxy Quest - and the rest is history.  I instantly loved it and have watched it more times than I care to admit.    For all the reasons and more that many of the previous reviewers enjoyed this film, I do, as well.    It's a solid story with great acting and writing, terrific spoofs, excellent special effects, and is tremendously pure and funny.  Move over, Spaceballs, there's a new kid on the block!  Without a doubt, the single-best sci-fi comedy ever created!  And the drama is good, too.  It's a great combination of everything, which is why it's so entertaining and can be watched countless times.  Can't believe as an avid sci-fi moviegoer that I somehow neglected to find this gem sooner.    Other sci-fi flicks I enjoy include: Alien, MIB, Evolution, Deep Rising, Zathura, Explorers, Bi-Centennial Man, iRobot, H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, King Kong (2005), Jurassic Park 3, Cube Zero.    Sci-fi flicks I don't like include:  Star Wars series, Harry Potter series, LOTR series,
B00005JPQT|4.0|I have not seen Bruce Willis' detective John McClane since the first DIE HARD twenty years ago. Action films are usually my least favorite genre. Who cares! This was one edge-of-your-seat,formulaic,tense and funny film for pure entertainment. I didn't think about the plot or character angst for one minute. I was entertained and had fun. What I did enjoy was the seamless editing and Michael Kamen soundtrack for this film.This film was shot in my neighborhoods of Baltimore and D.C. and it was great fun watching the two cities shot and pieced together to make Washington. For those wondering about Woodlawn in the film, it is a Baltimore suburb where the Social Security Administration is located. The only thing that goes on there is the highest murder- rated neighborhood in the city!The packed theatre where I saw this film howled when we saw that!!!

B00003CXN3|5.0|TRAFFIC is the film for lovers of the seamless screenplay brought to the screen with thought, care and professionalism of direction and acting.Three stories all separate and disconnected, but all beautifully bound together in the drug trafficking war.You will not know from one minute to the next where   this is going to wind up.Highly recommended.    CRASH is an excellent companion film as well as THE FRENCH CONNECTION.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|The White Stripes provide a great feeling that music can still mean more than all the Top Pop out there. The Stripes reinvent themselves with every album. Thanks goodness we have them. Grab this disc and enjoy. Better yet, go see them live and breathe in the experience.
B000022TSH|5.0|If you are a person who loves great screenplays, then CHINATOWN will have you wrapped up in it's perfect little web of intrigue. The who, what,where,when and why are all there.Though I am a tremendous fan of Roman Polanski films, I must say that neither Faye Dunaway or Jack Nicholson are favorites of mine in the least; but I could not ever see this picture done another way with other people.I am not a fan of \\"film noir\\" either.But if you are a movie fan who values characters and plot done well, then CHINATOWN IS the perfect screenplay brought to the screen with the perfect actors and perfect direction AND IT IS A WHOPPING SUCCESS!!! After knowing what happened in California a few years back concerning the electrical blackouts, this film was all the more compelling for a 2007 viewing.The ending is pure genius and pure reality!
B000022TSH|4.0|This movie really does get better as the years go by. Jack is an all-time great. I think any movie buff needs to make sure it is in the library.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series breaks new ground and reveals the planet in all of it's complexity and interdepencies.  The photography is amazing and provides visuals that most of us will never be able to see any other way.  The content is so diverse and introduces the viewer to numerous new facts and images about our world.  I was amazed by the segment on caves.  I had no idea how many big caves there let alone how beautiful.    I think this is important for our children to view.  I was on a plane that showed the \\"Pole to Pole\\" segment.  There was a young man seated in front of me.  He wasn't watching the film initially, but when the sequence with the wild dogs came on the screen, he put on his headphones, and continued to watch the rest of the video.    It has that impact--to draw you in and elighten and educate--

B000LC55F2|4.0|After watching Cristopher Nolan's Batman begins, I watched this movie carefully because of the high impression we all got after batman.  The movie is quiet a bit entertainment, the plot is curious and the performance of Hugh Jackman is far superior than Christian Bale.  I think that the ending was a little unfair due to the body of the movie.  Sure the movie is covered with tricks and always changing performances and that's what makes the movie interesting but besides that, I will say good for a one night rental with cheddar cheese pop corn but not for buying.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|I had previously rented from the video store the movie Stone Cold, with Tom Selleck.  I really enjoyed the movie. The characters, plot and the complexity between each person. I then saw \\"Night Passage,\\" which appears to be the first in the \\"Jessie Stone Series.\\"  The movie was a great hit in my household, and we now own all three movies.  Night Passage introduces you to the main character, Jessie Stone, and also the other returning characters. Who, where, when, etc., without deterring away from a great story/plot. I highly recommend this movie, especially if you have seen Stone Cold or Death in Paradise. This is great to watch over and over at any time.
B000OHZL1C|5.0|This is my 3rd favorite movie of all-time, and I'm a 19 year old guy, but it is a perfect movie. The HD DVD version looks good, not as good as The Hulk, or the Matrix Trilogies, but still good.     The movie itself, is something everyone should see. As the previous reviewer wrote, its 3 hours but it goes quick. I actually find myself checking how much time is left and wishing it was more, even when there was still like 2 hours left (its that good). Its about life and death, and all the things that truly matter in life. It doesn't make me cry, but it is an emotional movie that makes you tear up, especially the last 45 minutes.     Go buy it. Now.
0898705525|5.0|A simply fascinating piece of literature.  This is the type of book that you will find yourself putting down to ponder what you just read time after time.  I can't say that I agree with every point that Mr. Chesterton raises, but, reading Chesterton is exhilarating.
B000OY8NII|2.0|The acting, cinematography, costume, and set design are all conservative, more like The OC and CSI if not Days Of Our Lives than you'd expect from a supposedly creative cable show. The plot development is slow and dialogue often redundant enough that the show could be more engaging if each one hour episode was edited down to a half hour in post-production. The character development, in terms of both comedic quirks and emotional depth, is mimimal and generic. The acting is relatively stiff, with speech patterns leaning away from realistically conversational towards monologues projected at the audience. The way the dialogue is written seems to lend itself to this type of delivery though. The quirkyness and creativity I anticipated in this show based on a Northern Exposure comparison were not forthcoming. I'd consider the show worth watching if the episodes were edited down to half their length, but as it is they're carrying too much dead weight to hold my interest. If you're a fan of CSI and Lost you'll probably enjoy it though.
B000PFUAO6|3.0|I don't know if I was expecting to like this album or not when I bought it, because just looking at the song titles can give you a pretty good idea of the path that DT is now set on. The songs on this album are so sickeningly inconsistent; gone are the days that you could put in the CD and listen to it all the way through, without skipping halfway through songs to get to the fun parts. Song progressions are generally as follows: boring structures/time signatures, annoying noodling, pretentious musicianship, obnoxious Metallica-style vocals... then the occasional awesome riff and soaring melody.... followed by more over-the-top lyrics and some video game keyboard sounds that, sorry, DO NOT fit in. With anything.  They've probably come up with about 20-25 minutes of good, original music with this album. I especially like \\"In The Presence of Enemies\\" and \\"Repentance,\\" the continuation of Mike Portnoy's saga. Parts of the CD are worth listening to; me, I'll stick with Images and Words.
0316067598|5.0|Don't be put off by the first fifty or so pages of this terrific book. I almost was and that would have been a shame because Marcus Luttrell has quite a story to tell. You see, in those initial chapters, as we first hear Marcus speaking to us, it is with the type of voice we seldom hear around these parts. There's no aura of academia, no pretense. We hear the voice of a real, air-breathing young American hero. And he talks to you as he would his friend or his brother - candidly and with no BS. Without trying to impress with polysyllables or philosophical allusion (see, I can do it pretty well myself, don't you think?)    The previous 70-odd reviews do a better job than I could on summarizing the text of this thrilling account, so I won't even try to add my take in that regard. No, what I'll note is that this is THE book to read if you want to know what it's like to face supreme disappointment (if you drop out of BUDS, i.e. SEAL school), to witness the death of your pals (and with that, the loss of the firepower you need to survive), and to confront your own, very imminent, death.    Ignore the occasional political swipes that Luttrell makes. And ignore what you might mistake to be his puerile enthusiasm. Ignore them so you can begin feasting on his stellar story.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Huge Gerard Butler fan so this movie was a must. I never read the poem so I don't know how it holds next to it, but this movie made me curious about it. Sarah Polley is awesome in this movie too.
B000NIVJEU|4.0|First, I must admit that I get a little disappointed when trying to determine if a video is worth getting when the reviews only reference how disappointed they are in how it was made. While it could have been better, this was still a fine movie.    As far as the Blu-ray edition of this movie, the picture and sound quality met my expectations. There's nothing like watching a beautifully animated dragon fly through the air in HD. WOW!    There are minimal bonus features on the disc, which I'm always disappointed in when producers have access to a possible 50 GB of space with a Blu-ray disc. Instead, you get a single layer 25 GB disc with minimal extra features.    Generally speaking, if you enjoyed the movie in general and have a Blu-ray player, pick this up. Don't let low reviews regarding comparisons to the book and what it \\"could have been\\" ruin your decision.
B00005Y228|4.0|I'm not really a big fan of pop music. I find most of the genre to be annoying. I will though make the occasional exception like with Kylie Minogue. The first time I heard Kylie was back in the '80s with her dance version of \\"Locomotion\\" with was uber cheesy. It wasn't until the late '90s and early '00s did I re-discover her through two dance classics \\"Light Years\\" and \\"Kylie\\".<br /><br />Personally I prefer \\"Light Years over \\"Kylie\\" simply because I think the material is better. Nevertheless \\"Kylie\\" has some really solid pop songs. \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" is by far the best track on the album because it is so darn catchy. Even after five years since it was unleashed on to the public, the song still sounds good as ever to me. \\"Fever\\" is another great song on the album. It's a bit slower than its predecessor but I like the pop hooks. I am still not big on \\"Fragile\\". This is when Kylie's helium-pitched vocals gets on my nerves. I also wasn't really fond of the bonus tracks. I just didn't care much for the melodies. Overall \\"Kylie\\" is a great pop album. Too bad her follow up was a real turkey for me.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Imagine that u are a band that recorded nearly 15 studio LPs throughout your career. Add the fact that your name is affiliated with the genre heavy metal. In the last 5 years you have been selling out all the stadium concerts throughout the world. And you become over 50. What do you do?<br /><br />U record an album in which the sound has a live feeling, all the songs are LONG, progressive and radio un-friendly. This is a GOOD Maiden album, considering that they have recorded worse LPs such as (Fear of the Dark, No Prayer for the Dying and Virtual XI). It is not as good as Seventh Son, Powerslave, Piece of Mind but within the lines of the new Maiden recordings such as Brave New World. It is less atmospheric then Dance of Death but still very melodic with catchy riffs (yes riffs) and vocal lines.<br /><br />It is not groundbreaking, but hey who is groundbreaking nowadays? At least there is no doubt that this is Maiden and yes it is still metal. What would u expect more?
B000OXHRRC|1.0|The book was wonderful.   The movie is just awful.  I wonder if the screenwriter actually read the book.   A real shame.
0142000671|2.0|What confuses me more than why I was forced to read this book in school was how anyone could call it a masterpiece or a classic for that matter. I'll admit the relationship between Lennie( mentally retarded) and George was sweet. Although as the book so uneventfully progressed, things turned terrible between Lennie accidentally killing Curley's wife and George shooting Lennie. As in both The Pearl and Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck seems to love writing about innocent people getting shot. Steinbeck is a pessimist to say the least and I will never read his works again.

B000MM1I5C|1.0|Dvd will not play in region 1 dvd players other than that, the cd is great
B00006JLX4|4.0|When I first bought this album, five years ago, I knew very little about indie/punk rock. I was into Nirvana, the Smashing Pumpkins, and Nine Inch Nails (all great bands, but hardly uncommon preferences). I hated it. I found it boring, noisy, and uninteresting...  One year later, I stumbled upon the discs, and thought I'd give them a second chance. All I could think was, \\"What the hell was wrong with me, back then.\\" The openning track, \\"Summer Babe\\" is a shining example of amazing lo-fi indie rock. \\"Here\\" is a beautiful, downtrodden ballad. Full of lyrics that start off nice, then a split second later, become rather depressing - \\"I was dressed for success... But Success, it never comes.\\" And \\"Perfume V\\" is a small but very clear window into Stephen Malkmus' undeniable ability to write a good, solid pop song.   This album defines late 80's-early 90's underground rock. It helped birth bands like Weezer and Bright Eyes. If you already own the original release, you're probably a fan, and should get this for the extra thirty-something tracks. If you've never heard pavement, don't start here. Try something more palpable, first. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain and Terror Twilight are excellent records and are very listenable. Start there, then get this.
1582701709|5.0|In 1995, I was scheduled to attend a conference on Power Therapies for PTSD.  I was simply attending as a participant, but I thought I'd like to present a workshop at the conference, since I felt that I had something of importance to offer.  Not in a conceited way, but I just simply knew that what I could present would be of value to the participants.  I recall telling my wife as I was getting ready to leave for the event that I felt very strongly that I was going to be asked to present.  I said that I didn't know why I felt this way, but my feeling was very strong.  As it turned out, that's exactly what happened! It just so happened that the organizer asked me to do it, and I didn't even approach anybody about presenting!<br /><br />Several years ago I returned from a seminar that I conductec in Europe.  I saw Anthony Robbins on TV and it occurred to me that I'd like to connect with him.  I even said this to my wife.  And two weeks later I received a call from him, inviting me to present at a workshop with him in Fiji!  I never met him before and I never made any efforts to contact him.  But here it was again.<br /><br />This sort of thing has happened to me again and again throughout my life.  Is this The Secret?  I think so!  This book speaks to elements of mainfesting your heart's desire.  I don't know if there is a Law of Attraction, but there's something going on.<br /><br />Fred P. Gallo, author of [[ASIN:1572245018 Energy Tapping for Trauma: Rapid Relief from Post-Traumatic Stress Using Energy Psychology]]
B000NA28A2|5.0|I just love it, the english songs and new jazz rithems are a great complement to the other merengue, salsa and bachata songs.    Well rounded album full of poetry and dancing!
B000S0YL3Y|5.0|What to say...I am a soul and jazz fanatic. I was so surprised to  listen to this album... from a new artist... so good and refined that I was really emotioned.<br />I am not giving this album 10 stars because Amazon doesn t allow it :)<br />Amy, just in case you read this review, congratulations !!!
0451169514|1.0|I read IT twenty years ago and admit that it was a great summer escape from a boring life in a small town.  As an adult and with 1990's political correctness hindsight, I was unable to make it to the halfway point on my visit to paper back past.<br /><br />I realized on page 450 that all of the lousy parents belonged to the white kids and that the golden examples of parenthood belonged to the \\"minorities\\"<br /><br />Looking back further I noticed that the white male bullies were such because  of the poor role models (crazy Dads) and not  because of the unnatural  public school setting they were compulsed to suffer through . Notice that  the good kids  (despite also having lousy parents too) loved their public school teacher and did well.  it's like King is selling Hillary's, It Takes a Village communitarianisms.  Soviets (teachers, librarians, Irish Cops) good,  parents bad.<br /><br />In conclusion:<br />Stephen King's IT is just another communist  attack on what the commies consider their main target,  white  parents<br /><br />Oh!! and the Bush Communitarians are just as bad as the Clinton Communitarians<br /><br />Ron Paul for Prez!!!
B00005JPHT|4.0|Moore, with acute wit and insight, points out the shortcomings of the U.S. Health-Care system. I found this film entertaining, enlightening and at the same time somewhat sad. I would say this is a \\"must-see\\" for those who, perhaps, do not have this kind of insight into their health care system. Whether you're from the U.S. or not, there are some serious lessons to be learned here about your health-care system, democracy and  our societies' fundamental values. Even if you're not a Moore fan, challenge yourself to see this film. Moore, perhaps, tends to glorify other countries health care systems but his message is important none the less. And by the way, I'm not a real Dr. -It's just an Pseudonym.
0790734850|4.0|I hate violence and usually stay away from movies that have as much bloodshed at this one does.  I just picked it up in a hurry from the local library and stuck it in the DVD played for entertainment while I did a sink full of dishes.  At a few points I thought of stopping it but for some reason kept it running.  By the time I got to the pots and pans (I had a Lot of dishes) I was actually enjoying it.  Then, I sat down on the couch and started paying attention to it.  To my surprise, by the time the movie was finished I was wishing I had watched it more carefully from the top.    Others here have written some great reviews, eg. that of Tom Benton, so I'm not going to bother to duplicate their efforts.  This is just to give encouragement to others who are not violence fans that they might actually like this, too.  What saves it, besides the exciting twists and turns in the plot, are the very well written characters.  The actors are superb in bringing these guys to life.  I disagree with those who complained about Kim Basinger's performance; I thought she was perfect for the role.      For what it is, this is a very well made movie.  I certainly agree that it deserved an Oscar more than Titantic did.  I guess I'm with-holding one star, though, just on principle---it really did have an awful lot of blood and I have to wonder if it's a good thing to put these images into our minds. (spare me nasty comments, please! :-) )
0061142026|5.0|Stardust is much different than other books by Gaiman I read. It's much more lightweight and prefect both for bigger kids and adults. Its a very cute story of a boy, who wanting to marry a girl from his village promises to do anything fr her to say yes. It turns out she wants him to get a star that they saw falling and shortly after that Tristran leaves his family and sets out on a long journey to find that fallen star.

B0002DB52M|5.0|Makes you think... it could have done with less display in the rape scenes, but the visual does drive the point stronger... either we are more repulsed by it, take part in it, or both.  That's how twisted we can be.    I was so angry at the hypocrisy and unfairness that I thought Grace should have been more cruel, but that almost makes her one of them.    Maybe its not what the director intended, but Grace makes a good metaphor for Jesus, except when she turns out to be just human, like all of us and chooses justice over mercy.  I can't imagine choosing otherwise.    We have all betrayed, used, and abused Him (directly and indirectly) and others in some way (what we do to others, we do to Him).  Don't get me wrong, God is patient and forgiving in ways that humans can't be, but justice will be served eventually, but God is hoping we will change before it is too late, before we bring the day of judgment on ourselves.    For those of you asking \\"if God's almighty, why is there evil...\\" - God is  not the one committing the crimes, people are.  God is the one begging us to stop, but he does not chain us down, he has given us free will.  There will come a time when everyone's thirst for justice will be satisfied, no matter how much they have suffered.    I even wonder if there will come a time in heaven when those that have suffered from others will realize that the punishment for their oppressors has been sufficient, and at their request God may gladly set them free...

B0000039QA|5.0|This album is Biggie at his best before his music got corrupted by a sniveling weasel named Sean P Giddy Combs. It has guest appearances like 112, Too Short,  Jay-z, R. Kelly, The Lox etc but Biggie shines regardless of guest appearances. The album kicks of with vivid storytelling by Biggie on Somebody's Gotta Die but that's not the only track where Biggie tells a great story. N***** Bleed is another cinematic track and Story To Tell is Biggie telling a story of some chick he was messing with whose husband ends up coming home while he's still there. Miss U is a touching tale with some good vocals by 112 on the chorus. Big keeps it true to the MC side of him with tracks like Kick In The Door(Nas Diss), the sinister sounding What's Beef, the first single Hypnotize, My Downfall(feat DMC), Long Kiss Goodnight(obvious 2pac diss but the track could do without Puffy's bipolar ranting. We all know Diddy is a cupcake), Last Day(feat the Lox). I Love The Dough is another highlight which features Jay-z and Angela Winbush as both Jigga and Biggie drop some hot verses on the track. Bone Thugs N Harmony join in on the festivities on Notorious Thugs as everybody delivers some fast-paced verses on the track. Going Back To Cali is Big's ode California and Biggie teaches the rules to the game on Ten Crack Commandments. The album does have its flaws like Playa Hater which is awful and anybody who can tell you that track is tight is borderline insane. Last Day is suspect only because of lackluster verses by The Lox(Biggie killed it!). I never felt The World Is Filled(feat Too Short and Fluff Diddy) and thats another song, with guest appearances where Biggie had the only notable verse(case in point for Mo Money Mo Problems). After that this album is smooth sailing. Biggie has his songs for the ladies like Nasty Boy and F*** You Tonight(feat R. Kelly) which he makes work for him. Lil Kim joins in on the battle of the sexes record Another. 112 makes another appearance on the magnificent Sky's The Limit where Biggie recalls his past. The second disc ends with the gritty You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You) as Biggie brings it to you raw and uncut. Bottom Line: The Notorious Big's Life After Death is easily the best rap album of 1997 and is a necessary requirement for any rap fan's collection. Biggie excelled on every track(even when the guest spots didnt) and the production was the best that Bad Boy could get. Standout tracks on Disc 1: SOMEBODY'S GOTTA DIE, HYPNOTIZE, KICK IN THE DOOR, F*** YOU TONIGHT, I LOVE THE DOUGH, WHAT'S BEEF, N***** BLEED and I GOT A STORY TO TELL. Standout Tracks on Disc Two: NOTORIOUS THUGS, MISS U, ANOTHER, GOING BACK TO CALI, TEN CRACK COMMANDMENTS, NASTY BOY, SKY'S THE LIMIT, MY D0WNFALL, LONG KISS GOODNIGHT and YOU'RE NOBODY(Til Somebody Kills You).<br /><br />RIP to Christopher Wallace aka The Notorious Big.

B000OLGCHA|3.0|First off, I will not throw in the \\"John Williams needs to be brought back to score Harry Potter\\" line as its already been well overused at this point.  Nicholas Hooper's background in television music is very evident in his score work for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and unfortunately, having to overcome the melodic envelopment of John Williams' work in the first three movie soundtracks is not something most people can even attempt to try.    The arrangement of the tracks on the soundtrack is not sequenced as they were played in the movie, which is jarring for those of us that like to follow a storyline based on its music.  And sadly, the choice to do the order in this manner just proves that Hooper's music is not textured or rich enough to give each song track its own voice and yet be part of a larger chorus, but rather that each song was cookie cut and freeze dried to be placed anywhere that would keep the listener's attention level up.    The opening track, Fireworks, was not one of the best introductions to a Harry Potter soundtrack I would ask for but I guess that comes from being spoiled by always hearing \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" in its various incarnations opening a soundtrack. Listening to the CD in its entirety, I could honestly say that Hooper's music was so much in the background that most of the time you hardly noticed it. While William's music in Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber, and Azkaban accompanied the movie hand in hand, and Doyle's music was so jarringly in the front that you had to notice it, Hooper's music was so low-key that even in the \\"taking flight\\"-style songs you barely notice the music-if at all.    Sadly, Umbridge's \\"theme\\" was not something I found appropriate for her character. The theme gave me the impression that Umbridge was more of a character to be ridiculed at a sideshow than the truly menacing Ministry of Magic member to be watching out for.  The music in relation to Voldemort felt forced and nothing made it stand out for his level of evil power.  I enjoyed the \\"Flight of the Order of the Phoenix\\" track primarily because of the high hope feeling it placed upon the listener, but Hooper cuts it short (the song was only 1 min, 32 seconds) before it becomes a truly beautiful and sweeping song.      The finale song, Loved Ones and Leaving sends our Hogwarts family off into the sunset, with feelings of grief for those lost during the journey but hope for what the next adventure is to bring.  Beautiful song, but for some reason, the song felt like the ending of a TV series and less an ending for a movie like Order of the Phoenix.    Overall, Nicholas Hooper did a decent job of creating the score for Order of the Phoenix but the score ends up being just another soundtrack to join the other unexciting soundtracks.  Unfortunately, there are no tracks in the soundtrack that I will find humming years later such as John Williams' \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" and for the most part, only one or two tracks will be replayed due to most of the tracks either being forgetful or just outright not appropriate for the scene it was attached to.  Avid Harry Potter fans will fetch this one up just because it IS Harry Potter, but for the casual soundtrack listener, I would say stick to the Harry Potter soundtracks done by John Williams to remember the true musical legacy for the franchise.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|seriously, it's an adaptation, I am sick of people reviewing it based on the book. If they wanted to make the book into a movie, they would have. This is supposed to give the director and screenwriter's view on the story, it's not meant to be exact. Study French new wave and maybe some would understand why it is done this way(basically books should not be made into movies, there should be a screenplay made for film, not the exact book because they are two seperate arts. A book cannot have the same effect on film, it needs to be changed. Look at movies like the DaVinci Code, that is how not to do it)    I think the film captured the spirit of the story and characters. The front page reviews express my feelings on the film. Mcfayden was an amazing Darcy and the chemistry and passion of the film was amazing. I am OBSESSED with Pride and Prejudice, and though there are many encounters in the book that I would have enjoyed having knightly and Mcfayden act out because they were so good, I understand the vision the director had. Making it in that manner made it far more passionate then my former favorite, the A&E version. There were scenes that could be watched over and over. The filming was beautiful, and certain scenes lookedlike paintings. Some differences from the book and Austen I believe were made to help understand the story and the feelings, such as the hug between Darcy and his sister. It shows the love between them because we have no narator.    The casting was amazing, I do feel that the characters were more convincing in this version(thank god Jane was cast much better in this than in the A&E version). I think Judi Dench was perfect along with Jena Malone, and actually every other cast member.    I am happy though that many people watched it without expecting or only accepting Jane Austen's vision, because you cannot make a film from a vision that is not your own. Jane Austen is not here to make her own, so I will enjoy the adaptations not basing them on how closely they follow the book.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have tickets to see the play in Philadelphia this August. I purchased the Music CD, the original Wicked book, and the Grimmeri, a well designed book about the Broadway play, its history, costumes, and character profiles with full color pictures and stories, a great trio. The book tells a story, so unexpected, when I got to the last page, I sighed and smiled. I was totally satisfied. Even more I had already been listening to the music, which is totally fabulous, I listened again and again, some of the songs are happily stuck in my head, and then my reading the book made the music make total sense, it brought the story to life in the songs. I can't wait to see the play.    My sisters refuse to read the book they are afraid it will take away from the show. I say they are dead wrong and the book and music reviewed ahead of time will definitely enhance the theater experience. You decide, either way it's a great read, 5 stars for the generation who grew up with the Wizard of OZ classic.
B000HC2LIK|2.0|I'm a Harrison Ford fan, and was dissapointed in and depressed by this film. The plot, doalog, and action were glacial. The ceaseless rain, 2019 LA smog, gloom, hyper-stimulation, and overcrowding were depressing; and I didnt care much whether Ford found the \\"Replicants\\" or not. The Hollywood formula guaranteed he would, with suitable travail. The film's special visual effects were well done for the time, and added to my depression. I wondered if the directors / produceers meant this to be a visual morality play about our current overpopulation / media overstimulation / and ecological shifts in California. If so, it didnt make much impression on our society.<br /><br />I wound up skipping ahead on the downloaded CD to see what happened. I will not watch this film again or buy the CD. Ugh.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|For better or worse, Billy Corgan has resurrected the Smashing Pumpkins.  While only he and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin are the only returning original band members, make no mistake that \\"Zeitgeist\\" is a pure Pumpkins record all the way.  Corgan's lyrics are more politically charged and forceful than anything we've heard out of him in recent memory.  This can be found on the opening \\"Doomsday Clock\\", as well as \\"7 Shades of Black\\", \\"Starz\\", and \\"United States\\", in which the band rip roars their instruments into a sonic frenzy that hasn't come out of the band since their early, pre-fame days.  While Corgan blasts on with tales of doom and gloom, he also illustrates that all hope is not lost with the more melodic \\"Neverlost\\", and in particular \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\"; which also illustrate that Corgan and co. still know how to make varying emotional impacts on the listener.  To be honest, I wasn't too fond of the idea of Corgan bringing back the Smashing Pumpkins (especially minus D'arcy and James), but as a whole, I was pleasently surprised with how \\"Zeitgeist\\" turned out.  For better or worse folks, the Smashing Pumpkins are back from the dead, and as \\"Zeitgeist\\" illustrates, in these times we are living in, we can all be glad that they are.
630460288X|4.0|The future: A split has developed between the uptight politically correct media-academia fascists on the one hand and the hippies, and the latter have literally been driven underground where they are free to do and think what they want except that, since everybody in the world above has been implanted with a microchip to enable the society has keep tabs on them, there is no money and the hippies cannot get any food except by raiding a food truck now and then.      The designer and hence Leader of this Santa Barbara - Los Angeles - San Diego megalopolis is annoyed with the hippies and thaws out an old-style psychopath to get rid of them.  The psycho, however, has megalomanical plans of his own.  We are not told what the rest of the United States is like, but it is certainly indicated that this megalopolis is independent, so we can guess that other megalopolises formed to deal with the urban riots of the past and have developed various other totalitarian societies.  Perhaps the more rural States still have some semblance of American democracy.  It would have been nice to have more information on this society of the future, but such appears to have exceeded both the knowledge and the interest of the filmmakers.      Yes, there is the usual action, but it is not as well motivated as when Sly writes part of the script.  (See The Specialist which came out the same year.)  The only other flaw in the action aspect was that the end (the defeat of the bad guy) was too abrupt.      If the Amazon reviewer had watched and listened to the audio commentary, he would have known that even for the Hispanic filmmaker, this is \\"political correctness run amok\\", not a picture of a \\"conservative\\" society, as the Amazonian so naively remarks.      Sandra Bullock adds a dash of comic spice to the mix.      In sum: an entertaining reflection on some future possibilities if present trends continue.
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|This movie bricked in a big way. The only reason I continued watching this horrible cinema vomit is because I hoped that it would get better. The moive had a fade to black scene about every fifteen minutes. I'm not sure whether to take that as 'artistic' or just not knowing what to do next. It seems that this movie was made frame for frame all the while hoping that something would come to them after each take. This movie was a good attempt to be 'art'. If you're like me, reviews do not mean anything. I have to find out for myself; if you are like me and buy movies on impulse, be sure to rent this one first.

0743496728|3.0|Is it my imagination, or is Picoult becoming formulaic? Maybe I've just picked up a certain kind of her book, but if I have to read yet another novel by her that spends the last 30 percent of the book in a courtroom, with a last minute shocking ending, I'm going to scream. She often even features the same lawyer. This is starting to get quite tedious.    I also found that certain things in this book were quite unbelievable. Could Matt REALLY say, \\"There has to be a THEM, so there can be an US?\\" This doesn't seem realistic for the jock-like, rather violent character that he is -- could he really think that deeply? Yes, of course I've been in high school, though it was a while ago; maybe people really do talk like that. And because I wasn't in the \\"in\\" crowd, I didn't experience that kind of thing. But it struck a wrong note, as did the ending. That was unbelievable too, even given the set-up we got.    I also get really annoyed by the way writers never seem to check their facts. Jordan and Selena's son has BLUE eyes: genetically impossible, Jodi. Green, or gray; yes, possibly. But BLUE? I don't think so. There were a couple of other really basic, really irritating factual things, as if once you get to be as good as Jodi you don't have to worry about it as much. I find it very distracting and sloppy.    Finally, is anybody else bothered by the speed with which people have raced to make books out of Columbine? This isn't the first; there's also \\"We Have to Talk about Kevin,\\" which I found much more compelling and with a much more believable ending, though some of the other stuff in the book was trite and hard to accept. Something about this is a bit offensive, though I know that people do use writing to make sense of big world events around them. But sometimes it seems as if the authors are counting on the event to rack up sales for them. There are a lot of pretty bad 9/11 novels out there already....    Why did I give it three stars? My complaints aside, it was a goodread. But definitely not her best; that, in my mind, goes to \\"The Pact.\\" But maybe that was only because I read it first.
B000MG1ZG0|1.0|I needed a new copy of this album due to my cassette tape is worn out,boy I was totally surprised when I heard all the original songs are revamped with new music over Jim Morrisons original vocals it sounds terrible with the new added guitars etc. how can they ruin a original album like this ! I think they wanted to modernize it but for who ? the young crowd today will not know about this if they never heard this album but know this music it is like taking a original muscle car from the 1960s and putting in a modern motor in it,what have they done to this it is shameful do not buy it look for the original soundtrack and album very ,very, disappointing ,now what can I do I suppose they messed up L.A.Woman too I will never sell my older remaining cds of these albums the extras on this cd are fine but they should have left the original tapes intact of the original albums songs and riffs it is a modernized ruin unbelievable I am frustrated about this just awful period.
032147404X|5.0|This is a absolute must have for every serious shooter or the beginner looking to learn without wanting the technical explanations. Great info on everything from equipment to advice on shooting situations and preparation. I've read it several times, and use it as a quick reference source.<br /><br />The author's sense of humor bugs me at the beginning of early chapters, but I tend to be very focused. I am an advanced amateur.

0316018953|1.0|Skip this book.  I've read every one of Connelly's novels and am a big fan.  He has had, until now, good stories, well-developed characters, and - most enjoyable to me- good writing.  None was present here.  When I bought The Overlook, I didn't know it had previously been serialized in a periodical.  If it was not meant to be taken as a novel, it should not have been marketed and priced as such.  But it was, and so it has to be appraised as such.  It is a bad novel, by Connelly standards, and even by mass marketing standards.  Hopefully, Connelly will regain his footing on his next outing.  I think a good idea would be to leave Bosch for awhile, maybe revisit Jack McEvoy.  Either way, I have a bad feeling Connelly's muse is circling the drain.

B000LXH0AE|1.0|Vacuous, pretentious and annoyingly predictable. You can tell how and when this movie is going to end looong before the end actually comes. To top it all, Will Ferrel just can't play dramatic roles... but is this a drama?  I guess Marc Forster and Zach Helm just invented a new genre: the 'feelgood' artsy film. I only wish i'd spent fictitious money on it.
0743496728|5.0|I've been reading her books for a while now (Mercy, My Sister's Keeper, The Pact, Keeping Faith, The Tenth Circle, Picture Perfect for example) and this is another great book with solid messages spread throughout the book on how to treat others, the importance of having the courage to stand up for people, and for adults to keep the lines of communication open with their child. It really reminded me of The Pact, my favorite book by Picoult, and I don't think that is a bad thing. I really enjoyed the style of the book, switching between the present and past, as well as the theme. However, there were some very minor things that bugged me in this book that may not have bugged other people. Whenever she was talking about the media at the trial or at the school covering the shooting, she NEVER mentions FOX News as one of the media affiliates. She'll mention CBS, ABC, NBA, and CNN, but not FOX News, no Court TV, etc. I find that very unrealistic as FOX News ALWAYS covers these major cases in real life, as does Court TV. Anyway, that's my major rant with this book. Otherwise, it's very solid and realistic.

B000B5XOY8|3.0|It's a pretty good movie with all the right actors. Michael Keaton is a good Batman and I love Jack Nicholson as the Joker because he always makes me laugh.I like how the film is dark and scary but sometimes when you see the city it's not realistic.I hate the way Batman kills villians in the movie.He would never do that in the comics.Batman Begins is way better with better acting and a better cast but I think this is one of the  best Batman films evermade.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|\\"Thank You for Smoking\\" is a superbly assured effort from first-time director Jason Rietman.<br /><br />Based on the book by Christopher Buckley, \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" tells the story of Nick Naylor, a big tobacco spin doctor who slowly comes to realise the error of his ways.<br /><br />Cleverly, Naylor - in a brilliant performance by Aaron Eckhart - is portayed as a likable guy - even at his most oily. The film lands solid punches on big tobacco executives, politicians, reporters, and of course lobbyists.<br /><br />\\"Thank You for Smoking\\" is a nice companion piece to \\"Fast Food Nation\\", which takes its aim at the fast food industry and if you loved that film you will love \\"Thank You for Smoking\\".
B00005ATQD|4.0|Those seeking sexual gratification in this movie will find it, but they will also be confronted with reality. 2 incredible actors show us what's just below America's still somewhat Christian surface. Amid lighted trees and \\"Merry Christmas'\\" we see the depths of carnal lust, unbridled. Yet there is the revelation that sexual \\"freedom\\" is not as satisfying as it promises to be. In fact, it brings pain, fear, and destruction. Self-contol and faithfulness bring joy and peace.
0451169514|5.0|I first read this book at the age of 14; I didn't understand some of the words, some of the dialogue, and alot of the references to popular music of both the 80's and the fifties. I had a appreciation for the book on the kid side of the story; a group of friends, fighting to beat the devil. A true adventure story.    I reread the book again when I was twenty going on twenty-one. I fell in love with the book all over again- this time for different reasons. I could now see what King was going after; it wasn't about the monster, Bob Grey aka Pennywise aka \\"IT.\\" It was about friends, the end of adolesence and the change into maturity and adulthood, and how the past can come back to haunt you. The characters are all fleshed out and real; with their own problems and realities, their own family dilemas; but once they all get together, that all washes away and their just friends.    I won't go into an entire detailed synposis of the book; other's have done it far better than I ever could. And besides, it's unneeded- read the book and judge for yourself.    I highly recommend this book to any King fan, or someone looking for a great, and somewhat long read. But not to any fourteen year olds.
0618680004|1.0|On pages 157-8 of his book, Dawkins summarizes what he calls \\"the central argument of my book.\\" It goes as follows:     1. One of the greatest challenges to the human intellect has been to explain how the complex, improbable appearance of design in the universe arises.    2. The natural temptation is to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself.    3. The temptation is a false one because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer.    4. The most ingenious and powerful explanation is Darwinian evolution by natural selection.    5. We don't have an equivalent explanation for physics.    6. We should not give up the hope of a better explanation arising in physics, something as powerful as Darwinism is for biology.    Therefore, God almost certainly does not exist.    This argument is jarring because the atheistic conclusion that \\"Therefore, God almost certainly does not exist\\" seems to come suddenly out of left field. You don't need to be a philosopher to realize that that conclusion doesn't follow from the six previous statements.    Indeed, if we take these six statements as premises of an argument implying the conclusion \\"Therefore, God almost certainly does not exist,\\" then the argument is patently invalid. No logical rules of inference would permit you to draw this conclusion from the six premises.    A more charitable interpretation would be to take these six statements, not as premises, but as summary statements of six steps in Dawkins' cumulative argument for his conclusion that God does not exist. But even on this charitable construal, the conclusion \\"Therefore, God almost certainly does not exist\\" does not follow from these six steps, even if we concede that each of them is true and justified.    What does follow from the six steps of Dawkins' argument? At most, all that follows is that we should not infer God's existence on the basis of the appearance of design in the universe. But that conclusion is quite compatible with God's existence and even with our justifiably believing in God's existence. Maybe we should believe in God on the basis of the cosmological argument or the ontological argument or the moral argument. Maybe our belief in God isn't based on arguments at all but is grounded in religious experience or in divine revelation. Maybe God wants us to believe in Him simply by faith. The point is that rejecting design arguments for God's existence does nothing to prove that God does not exist or even that belief in God is unjustified. Indeed, many Christian theologians have rejected arguments for the existence of God without thereby committing themselves to atheism.    So Dawkins' argument for atheism is a failure even if we concede, for the sake of argument, all its steps. But, in fact, several of these steps are plausibly false. Take just step (3), for example. Dawkins' claim here is that one is not justified in inferring design as the best explanation of the complex order of the universe because then a new problem arises: who designed the designer?    This rejoinder is flawed on at least two counts. First, in order to recognize an explanation as the best, one needn't have an explanation of the explanation. This is an elementary point concerning inference to the best explanation as practiced in the philosophy of science. If archaeologists digging in the earth were to discover things looking like arrowheads and hatchet heads and pottery shards, they would be justified in inferring that these artifacts are not the chance result of sedimentation and metamorphosis, but products of some unknown group of people, even though they had no explanation of who these people were or where they came from. Similarly, if astronauts were to come upon a pile of machinery on the back side of the moon, they would be justified in inferring that it was the product of intelligent, extra-terrestrial agents, even if they had no idea whatsoever who these extra-terrestrial agents were or how they got there. In order to recognize an explanation as the best, one needn't be able to explain the explanation. In fact, so requiring would lead to an infinite regress of explanations, so that nothing could ever be explained and science would be destroyed. So in the case at hand, in order to recognize that intelligent design is the best explanation of the appearance of design in the universe, one needn't be able to explain the designer.    Secondly, Dawkins thinks that in the case of a divine designer of the universe, the designer is just as complex as the thing to be explained, so that no explanatory advance is made. This objection raises all sorts of questions about the role played by simplicity in assessing competing explanations; for example, how simplicity is to be weighted in comparison with other criteria like explanatory power, explanatory scope, and so forth. But leave those questions aside. Dawkins' fundamental mistake lies in his assumption that a divine designer is an entity comparable in complexity to the universe. As an unembodied mind, God is a remarkably simple entity. As a non-physical entity, a mind is not composed of parts, and its salient properties, like self-consciousness, rationality, and volition, are essential to it. In contrast to the contingent and variegated universe with all its inexplicable quantities and constants, a divine mind is startlingly simple. Certainly such a mind may have complex ideas--it may be thinking, for example, of the infinitesimal calculus--, but the mind itself is a remarkably simple entity. Dawkins has evidently confused a mind's ideas, which may, indeed, be complex, with a mind itself, which is an incredibly simple entity. Therefore, postulating a divine mind behind the universe most definitely does represent an advance in simplicity, for whatever that is worth.    Other steps in Dawkins' argument are also problematic; but I think enough has been said to show that his argument does nothing to undermine a design inference based on the universe's complexity, not to speak of its serving as a justification of atheism.

B000JLTR8G|5.0|Robert Mitchum had a mini comeback in the 70s with this film and also as Philip Marlowe in Farewell My Lovely.  While he was a great-- if old-- Marlowe, this is the better film.    Sidney Pollock does his best Howard Hawks impression with this story of world weary macho men, the eager young gun, and a code of honor that must be satisfied-- on both sides.    The Yakuza has it all, action, romance, exotic locales and customs, and suspense.  The climax is one of the best martial arts sequences in movie history, because while fantastic and very bloody, it keeps its feet on the ground just enough to stay believable.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a most amazing DVD set.  If you have seen the pbs series you know that it is good but if you are able to view this in blue-ray or HD you'll be even more amazed.    Good for ALL ages.
B00005JPAO|5.0|The film is exceptional in every way, I loved it, BUT, for some reason the powers that be, decided to crop the film to fit a 16X9 TV, not content to just cut off the sides of the film, the top and bottom were also cropped, which leaves the tops of peoples heads cut off, about 99.9% of the time, I found that to be very distracting, keep that in mind before ordering this DVD, if you aren't bothered by such mutilation of a great film, have at it, personally I am sorry I bought it, and will hope for a DVD of the Queen without the constant distraction of people without the tops of their heads.
B000MRNWII|5.0|I've watched both the Lisbon and the London DVDs and Mariza's passion for Portugal, Lisbon and fado come outs strong in both DVDs.  However, performing next to the beautiful Tower of Belem adds authenticity to the performance that cannot be duplicated.  This might be stating the obvious since the performance is in Portugal, but there is no English in this DVD, so if that is something important, one might be disappointed.  I only speak English and had no issues with this.  Her voice is magnificent, she is humble and charming.  I adore her.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This is Kelly's first album without Clive Davis as the executive producer.  Kelly proved she could have hits without Clive's input as \\"Never Again\\" became a top ten hit on the billboard hot 100 and got good radio airplay.  If you liked \\"Never Again\\" from listening to it on the radio there's even better songs on the rest of the album!  \\"Sober\\" is a good ballad which showcases her great vocals.  It's one of my favorite tracks from the album.  Another good one is \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" which could have been a big hit.  All the songs are listenable and she sounds great with the pop-rock material.  Some of the songs even fall into alternative rock catagory.  While not as mainstream as \\"Breakaway\\" or \\"Thankful\\", \\"My December\\" remains Kelly's best album to date and her most personal as she co-wrote all the songs on it!  I highly reccomend \\"My December\\" to any pop or rock fan.  You won't regret buying it!
B00005JPHT|5.0|Michael Moore made a film showing voters in other countries got their governments to provide them with universal military , police & fire protection as well as health care and even college educations.  People in this country who are opposed to that seem to be afraid to say so.  Instead they heap scorn on Michael Moore for pointing out those simple, basic, important facts.  Me?  I think taxpayers and voters in America should follow the lead of taxpayers and voters in other countries.  After all, the money that our government spends is . . . ours.

I never got bored of this movie like I did with \\"The Pursuit of Happyness.\\" This is the best movie of the year so far.  This is a great family movie and I highly reccomend this to anyone who doesn't mind animated films.  This movie was even better than \\"Dreamgirls\\"!
1594489505|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and didnt want to put it down.  I was very impressed with the author's talent to write about such a different culture in a way that brings it down to a human level that everyone can relate to and understand.  It really helps the reader think about how far womens rights have come in many countries and why these rights are important to a successful society. The author makes many thought-provoking points, but he does it by by wrapping them up in an amazing story that has stayed with me long after I finished the book.
B000007VCM|5.0|I quickly collected all the cult (Southern Death and the Holy Barbarians, also); LOVE is the one I keep going back to. There are few singers who have a voice and inflection that can become a musical instrument. All these albums need to be played loud and on nice equipment to be appreciated. Billy Duffy and James Stewart are phenominal. The drummer for this venture is, in my opinion, one of thier best. I'm not getting up to see who, just trust me, he is all over the place. If you want to get the the merging of the Goth Cult towards the Electric, get this. Then go and get them ALL!

B000FP2OPY|5.0|'Supernatural' is the top of my must-watch list and this first season box set is worth every penny!    I have always loved ghost stories, so for me, the idea of watching a ghost story every week (with the added bonus of two gorgeous lead actors, that can act) was always going to appeal.  In addition, this show has the right mix of drama and humour.    As for extras, you get commentaries, making of's and an entertaining blooper reel.  To top it off, you also get to see what Jared and Jensen get upto on set, what more could a girl ask for?
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Recipe for the \\"Shooter\\" cocktail:  Take one multiplex theatre screen.  Add two measures star power, stir in one measure conspiracy plot, add a dash of characterization, a soupcon of Hitchcock, garnish with attractive leading lady, and fill to the brim with explosions and shoot `em ups.     \\"Shooter,\\" directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a nonstop action thriller that despite its predictability -- a pleasant roller-coaster ride in what Hollywood does best:  a star-driven, action-packed tale of good guys and bad guys painted in solid whites and blacks and loads of eye-filling, ear-pounding pyrotechnics.     \\"Shooter\\" works primarily because it does what it does well without making excuses or aspiring to great themes.  There's nothing wrong with a good action picture.  Hollywood rose from the lemon groves with silent-screen Westerns, gangster flicks, and historical epics.  Staged fist fights, one-on-one duels, bullet ballets, and full-scale wars have brought buckets of bucks into box office coffers.   \\"Shooter\\" introduces us to Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), who has retired from his job as Marine sniper after his spotter and best friend is killed during a mission gone wrong.  Swagger retreats to a wilderness mountaintop cabin where he's lived with his dog the last three years.   One day, several government agents, headed by Col. Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover), come to Swagger, asking him for help.  They've uncovered a plot to assassinate the President of the United States.  The shot will be taken from a mile away.  They want Swagger to help them figure where and how the fatal shot will be fired.  Reluctantly, Swagger agrees.   But things are not what they seem.  The shot is fired anyway.  Swagger has been set up.  His own murder is thwarted, and a badly wounded Swagger must elude a massive dragnet in an attempt to clear his name.  At this point, the film employs a device Alfred Hitchcock returned to again and again -- the innocent man thrown into a dangerous situation who must extricate himself or face death.   Wahlberg carries the film effectively with a combination of attitude, physical prowess, and acting chops.  Though \\"Shooter\\" doesn't offer him the meaty role \\"The Departed\\" did, he anchors the action stuff so that we stay involved.   Michael Pena (\\"World Trade Center\\") stars as FBI agent Nick Memphis, a man the Bureau is targeting for incompetence in allowing Swagger to escape.  Nick looks at the evidence from the shooting and sees that things do not add up.  Using the Bureau's own resources, he attempts to find out the truth.   Pena is very good as Nick, playing the character with intelligence and humor.  The subplot of Nick doing the legwork -- often dangerous -- necessary to piece together a puzzle whose pieces don't fit, is juxtaposed with the Swagger-on-the-run main story line until the two converge, with Nick showing he's skilled in the field as well as with computers and forensics.     Veterans Glover and Ned Beatty (as a corrupt U.S. Senator) add stature to the film, and Kate Mara is on hand to provide a sort of romantic interest, most improbable given the plot and the fact that Swagger is all over the media as assassin on the lam.     In a scene which goes beyond straining credibility she -- a third grade school teacher -- removes a couple of bullets from Swagger by performing surgery in her bedroom.  It's not possible, you see, for Swagger to mosey into a hospital with every law enforcement department in America on his trail.     But why nit pick?  This is a forgivable sin in a movie whose prime goal is to entertain us with a tale of a good guy taking on powerful forces in a solo, Dirty Harry-style attempt to right the shortcomings of bureaucracy and a molasses judicial system.     \\"Shooter\\" is rated R for graphic language and violence.  It's not the best action picture ever made but, with Wahlberg delivering star luster, it is enjoyable divertissement.

0451191153|4.0|Probably spelled that wrong.  Anyway, it is a great story.  So many people around today that remind me of James Taggert.  Heck, look at the Dem's and most Rep's.  Anyway, I felt kinda sorry for Ayn.  She was so close.  She must of missed the parts in the Bible that stress a strong work ethic.  Like if you don't work you don't eat.  Being responsible for yourself, and if you lived your whole life refusing to ever lift a finger to help someone, well then, not even John Galt would of been successful at that.  Look at the ones he helped.  The ones he saved.  Reminds of some other story that Ayn refused to believe.  Her choice of course, and remember, we do live in a country where choice is just a little important.<br />Would be awesome though to see someone stand and say some of the things the heroes in the story said.

B00005JPLW|4.0|In reading other reviews I see the largest complaint being the movie wasn't historically accurate.  Well, I don't think it was meant to be a documentary.  I think the movie was meant to be told as heroic folklore, a legend, or tall tale.  Everything was exaggerated on purpose! i.e. Chiseled to perfection warriors who embark on a journey with nothing more than their shields and spears, foes who were giant and never ending and an enemy leader who was quite exocentric to say the least.  All facets of the movie fit if you change your mindset.  This was a movie of the imagination handed down from generation to generation by word of mouth.
B00005MP58|5.0|Many people name the 1996 A&E version of Pride & Prejudice as their favorite ever. I own all the versions of this story and it certainly is mine. This was a full miniseries - not just a movie - so they were able to fit in ALL sorts of sub-stories and characters that movies often had to trim away. Colin Firth was brilliant at Mr. Darcy. A&E worked with the BBC, so the costumes, locations and backgrounds were all extremely authentic.<br /><br />Most of the lines are straight out of the book, again a luxury you can have when the mini-series gives you so much time to work with. They could include many different scenes, and many different situations, that a 2 hour movie would have to cut for time reasons.<br /><br />I adore many parts of this miniseries. It's great to contrast Mr. Collins' list of reasons why he WILL mary Lizzie against Darcy's list of why he didn't WANT to marry her. Where the dad is shown as a quiet angel in many other versions, in this one he is shown to have his dark side too, in how he snipes at family members even when they're sad. The timing of Darcy coming to Lizzie to ask for her hand is *perfect* - she has just heard of his behavior with Jane, and she deliberately stayed home from dinner with him. You can really feel that she has been stewing all evening and he presents a perfect opportunity for her to lash out. The scene regarding Mr. Wickham at Pemberly is just great ... and the Collins visit after Lydia runs off is brilliant.<br /><br />In this version, Lizzie never reveals to her family how Darcy helped with Lydia's situation; she simply asks them to accept him on her say-so. Also, there's no \\"reconcilement\\" early on between Lizzie and Darcy. During the various parties early on, they don't agree to be friendly at any time. It's just constant antagonism along with the attraction pull. I have to admit that I like the 1939 version of the early parties, where there is much more of a powerful attraction going on. Still, each version is going to be different.<br /><br />Highly recommended - set aside a rainy afternoon, get yourself some wine and cheese, and enjoy it straight through!be different.<br /><br />Highly recommended - set aside a rainy afternoon, get yourself some wine and cheese, and enjoy it straight through!

1416911049|4.0|I am NOT a fantasy/science fiction fan, the only other fantasy I've ever listened to and enjoyed was the Harry Potter series. I've also listened to books 1 and 2 of Twilight by Stephenie Meyer, but I really did not like either books (I gave book 1 one star and book 2 (in my mind) two and a half stars (3 IRL b/c you can't give half stars on Amazon.)<br /><br />I listened to this book over 2 days time. The reader has a good voice and can do accents well but I absolutely hated the voice she did for Shay. It was annoying and kinda sounded like Susie from Rugrats.<br /><br />The story itself was okay. The concept is really interesting. I'm not gonna duplicate it here, you can just read someone elses summary. One complaint is, it was way too describey with action scenes just stretching for minutes and minutes and minutes. I really don't need to know Tally's every single move, it got boring. SOmetimes just saying 'After some stuggle, they escaped the danger.' Is enough! LOL well okay, don't be THAT brief, but what seems like 5 pages worth of action/description over and over again got really old.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />I really didnt like David's character at all. for all his posturing about beauty being on the inside, he totally was physically attracted to Tally more and just dumped Shay like a hot potato. like I understand that he was also into Tally for other reasons too (and also, hes some hormonal 18 year old kid, can he really help it?) but I think it was lame how he went behind Shay's back and let Tally deal with Shay's anger. not nice!!!!<br /><br />I also dont think it was cool of Tally to go with David since she supposedly loves her dear friend Shay so much. I mean whatever happened to 'chicks before d*cks?' LOL<br /><br />that's basically it. The book is pretty acessible to non-fantasy/scifi readers and the concepts are real easy to grasp. if you like action and reading long descriptions of action scenes this book will be perfect for you.

Khaled Hosseini has certainly broken that mold with this magnificent novel which examines the recent history of Afghanistan through the eyes of two extraordinary women.<br /><br />The first, Mariam, is the bastard daughter of a wealthy man from Herat.  She is relegated to living in a mud hut with her seemingly mentally disturbed mother.  Upon reaching adulthood (as defined in rural Afghanistan), she is married off to a middle class merchant from Kabul.  This man, Rasheed is a fundamentalist Muslim and Mariam suffers many indignities at his hands.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the same neighborhood, a young woman named Laila is growing up in relative freedom.  While Mariam is locked into a rigid existence, Laila's life changes with the various governments in power at the time.  From the original monarchy, to a short democracy, the Soviet takeover and subsequent Communist rule and finally the civil war and Taliban supremacy.<br /><br />Hosseini brings the lives of these two women together seemlessly and the result is an engrossing story of human suffering difficult to imagine.  Reading this novel is an outstanding history lesson, both for the region and for the lives of women living in fundamentalist Muslim culture.  In my opinion, Hosseini has actually improved upon his earlier, outstanding work.
B0007OASII|5.0|This cd from beginning to end is fantastic. I have finally found another band to add to my collection. I would recommend this album and any other from Kamelot.
0374105235|5.0|There are three parts - life before a child soldier, life as a child soldier, and life after a child soldier.  The only negative to the book is that I wish the author had gone into more detail about his life as a soldier, but he certainly provides enough information to paint a pretty gruesome picture of what it is like to be a 13 year old and wiping out entire villages of individuals.  Simple language and easy to read which I believe helps the reader to believe that they are personally being told the story by the author.    SIDE NOTE:  Read the chronology at the end of the book first to get a better understanding of the conflict in Sierra Leonne and all of the events that have occurred there.  This helps to set the scene for someone like myself who was not aware of everything that had occurred in the country over the past 50 years.
B000035P7X|5.0|Bob Dylan often was in a shroud of mystery.  That's why J. Robert Van Dyke's documentary, `Don't Look Back' is so valuable.  Caught in the throes of his tour in England, the 1967 copyright only gives the release date of this fun and illuminating look at the great singer/songwriter/musician.  Taking from his newly released album, `Bringing It All Back Home,' the footage undoubtedly came from 1965 when he controversially went electric and invented the folk-rock hybrid.  The feel of the black and white film sometimes seems shaky and impromptu,  and scenes transition at times like a home movie.  Yet, the editing is the real gig, capturing some essential moments in the life of Dylan and his entourage at a consequential time in his career.    The highlights are many.  There are times for him to \\"meet the press\\".  What is so revealing is how he turns the tables on one British reporter and a 'Time' correspondent later.  When a British reporter asks Bob, \\"What is your attitude about life?\\"  He's put off by the ubiquitous question; so when he asks the reporter the same question, the reporter says he can't answer the question in two minutes.  Dylan responds, \\"How do you expect me to?\\"  There are other great moments.  Joan Baez can be the real ham sometimes, but when she sings in their room her voice resonates beautifully.  Similarly, we get a brief, intimate performance by Donovan who visits Dylan.  There are also some fine behind-the-scenes action.  It becomes heated when the reporters come to interview Dylan, and one man tells his manager, Alan Grossman, to get out.  Another scene shows him making interesting negotiations for a couple of Dylan's performing nights in London.  Of course, the whole affair is worth the price of admission to be able to see and hear the \\"Bard of Hibbing\\" onstage doing numbers like \\"It's All Right Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" and \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\".  The whole film starts with a bare-bones video of \\"Subterreanean Homesick Blues,\\" with Dylan changing display cards with his lyrics before the Beatles put theirs on `Sgt. Pepper'.     Although not as polished as Scorsese's film, 'No Direction Home,' it is essential.  The real comparison is not with Scorsese's work, but a comparison of this film with what it would be like to have gone without it.  (I discovered this movie from `Rolling Stone,' as a list-topper from their \\"Best Films of Rock `N Roll\\".)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is so great because it is so close to reality.  No warp drive, no beaming, no shields or phasers.  Just people on a ship, trying to stay free from government control.    At first I didn't get the series completely, but the more I watched it, the more I began to understand all the different plots and levels of the characters.  (Personally, I want to know Shepard Book's story.)    This series has a lot of leg room to continue.  I hope they make a season in the time frame after season 1 and before the movie [[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]].    There are some great lines in the series and unbelievably funny.  A must have for any Sci-Fi fan.

B000P0J024|5.0|This group of outstanding Voices (Petty, Dylan, Harrison and Orbinson) united to make this wonderful music.  When Roy Orbinson died a legendary candle went out in the music world.  I can't say enough about this fantastic sound that this group made and the CD and DVD in this package really is a classic.  Buy it - u will not regret it.
B000O77SOK|5.0|I found this series very very good the series is quite old but does not come across as being out of date  all the episodes are linked in some way which makes you keen to watch the next one  its very well acted and really worth watching  i just hope there is a series two
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a MUST for your movie collection.  James Garner is at his best in this movie as he plays the patient man waiting on his wife to remember a mere second of their past as she has alzheimers.  Buy this movie and share it with anyone that is experiencing this disease in their family
0553011804|5.0|A true masterpiece of the classic science fiction genre.  Packed full of interwoven stories that depict a world that is all too familiar.  It has  the same social impact today as it did when these stories were written.  The fact that human nature does not change.  Bradbury captures that perfectly in these stories.  These are not tales for anyone looking for uplifting, life affirming prose.  These tales border on the macbre and deliver it in a way that is often humorous.  This book is simply a MUST READ for anyone who loves science fiction.  This is not a high-speed, action adventure, sceince fiction read.  It will appeal to those who are respectful of the genre and not those looking for a fast high.
B000N0WCLC|1.0|Gosh how I hated this movie. The biggest problem is that you just don't care what happens to any character in the movie. So what you have left is HD blood and gore. My advice, rent the movie if you must and if you still want to watch it over-and-over, then buy it.
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|The movie is good, but the book is better.  The whole idea is a bit on the \\"New Age\\" side of things.  But it is a good adventure - both in reading and in thinking.  Both the book and the movie are well worth the time.
0618680004|1.0|...patently absurd, moderately delusional, painfully erroneous, insidiously misleading, mildly comical, and only rarely hits the mark.    Judging from all the 5-star reviews, you would think Dawkins actually wrote a compelling and intellectually challenging work, but reality could not be farther from the truth.  These listings show that many reviewers suffer from the same flawed reasoning and emotive appeal as him.  When you read this book critically, however, you see why it is so appalling.  I wish I could have given it no stars, because in its hundreds of pages there is so little that has any merit at all, and that paltry amount is more than obscured by pages upon pages of drivel, bad scholarship, juvenile tactics and outright misinformation.  Pointing out Dawkins' errors is like shooting fish in a barrel.    To be fair, I admit that Dawkins' book is not a complete waste of time, only nearly so.  The few valid points he makes are: (1) people too frequently have no intellectual basis for their faith and/or religious beliefs; (2) you cannot pick and choose morality or biblical interpretations based upon whim or necessity; (3) it was wrong for Edgardo Mortara to be taken from his parents (but the case involves more than Dawkins reports); and (4) female circumcision is a gross mutilation perpetrated upon women's bodies.  These points account for no more than 20 pages in the book.  What remains is little more than Dawkins' childish ranting.  He apparently knows the support for his arguments is so lacking that he must resort to something else to sway his readers.  Whatever else it may be, it certainly is not an intelligent, rational, internally consistent and substantiated exposition of the subject matter.    The book is fatally flawed in its thesis and approach for a few reasons: (1) If God is pure spirit and transcendent, attempting to verify His existence by using strictly scientific methods grounded in a physical realm will, by definition, always fail because of a paradigm disparity.  It's like using your eyes to detect a smell. (2) Dawkins cites religious practices and teachings very selectively, using only negative examples and fault-finding, and he knowingly overlooks enormous good motivated by religion.  After all, Christianity did build Western civilization. (3) Dawkins proves merely that people's sinfulness and shortcomings distort their understanding and practice of true religion.  So the problem is people, not their belief systems.  With the exception of Islam, no major religion formally advocates the ill deeds that Dawkins rightly derides.  Dawkins is unwilling (not unable) to see this; he therefore beats the wrong dead horse for hundreds of pages.  (4) A non-theologian is treating a theological matter (even though he insists it is strictly scientific in nature), and this fact should raise our suspicions.  He is eminently unqualified for the task.  Can you imagine, by contrast, a theologian attempting to debunk a biological treatise on the basis of limited misinformation?  We might chuckle at the prospect, but since Dawkins unfortunately reaches a wide audience, we need to take his incompetence more seriously, as it could mislead otherwise well-intentioned readers.    You would expect a book about God to be especially accurate along theological lines.  Sadly, Dawkins' inexcusable mistakes and shoddy research in this area are numerous and substantial, and the following list is representative of the \\"quality\\" of Dawkins' work:    -he fails to understand the nature and scope of the Arian controversy (p. 33)  -he distorts official Catholic teaching about Mary (p. 34)  -\\"Paul of Tarsus\\" [sic] founded Christianity! (p. 37)  -Jesus didn't think He was divine (p. 92) [John's entire gospel says otherwise.]  -unnamed scholars have shown the gospels to be historically inaccurate (p. 92) [In fact, archaeology is the Bible's best friend.]  -the four canonical gospels were chosen arbitrarily (p. 95) [Not even close.]  -nobody knowswho the four Evangelists were (p. 96) [Maybe Dick doesn't.]  -Jesus is confused with God the Father (p. 177)  -being moral to avoid God's punishment is wrong (p. 226) [The Bible says this is a valid, though imperfect, motivation for behavior.]  -the heterodox beliefs of Episcopalian bishop John Spong are \\"so advanced\\" (p. 237) [Many Episcopalians find him to be an embarrassment.]  -the story of Noah was derived from another myth (p. 237) [Similarity doesn't automatically mean derivation.]  -Jesus may not have existed! (p. 250)  -Jesus departed from the scriptures of His day (p. 250) [Jesus expressly said He came to fulfill the Law.  His behavior was not a departure from it but a restoration of its true interpretation.]  -the authorship of Hebrews is wrongly attributed to Paul (p. 253)  -Adam and Eve were merely symbolic and not actual people (p. 253)  -\\"love thy neighbor\\" meant \\"love only your fellow Jew\\" (p. 253) [Jesus explicitly taught in the Parable of the Good Samaritan that everyone, even the Jews' bitter enemies the Samaritans, is a \\"neighbor.\\"]  -it was Paul's idea of \\"taking the Jewish God to the Gentiles\\" (p. 257) [No, it was Jesus who commanded the Gospel to be taken to \\"all nations\\" in Matthew 28:18-20.]  -Christianity teaches unquestioned faith to be a virtue (p. 306) [No it doesn't.]  -a Q.E.D. is the only basis for the doctrine of purgatory (p. 360) [There are actually several bases in Scripture.]    Other blunders of a logical or scientific nature--and especially of a moral nature--abound in this book. For instance, Dawkins is clearly obsessed with evolution, and he is completely unable to see beyond it--despite its many problems.  I counted a total of 18 items (too wordy to list) that Dawkins, without any support whatsoever, just asserts were the products of evolution.  Yet he hypocritically admonishes supporters of intelligent design:  \\"...do not just declare things to be irreducibly complex; the chances are that you haven't looked carefully enough at the details, or thought carefully enough about them\\" (p. 124) and \\"Some biological organ...is *decreed* without further argument to be irreducibly complex.  No attempt is made to *demonstrate* irreducible complexity\\" (p. 128, emphasis in original).  Or try this blatant side-stepping, said in rejection of those who have the nerve to demand actual proof for specific evolutionary mechanisms:  \\"It is utterly illogical to demand complete documentation of every step of any narrative, whether in evolution or any other science.  You might as well demand, before convicting somebody of murder, a complete cinematic record of the murderer's every step leading up to the crime, with no missing frames\\" (p. 127).  Actually, Dick, we're just asking for ANY substantiating evidence for all your lofty claims.    I could easily document dozens of other examples, but I am already beyond my word limit.  I apologize.    If you have already *chosen* to reject religion (any evidence to the contrary notwithstanding) and want to be validated in that decision, this book will certainly strike a resonant chord in you.  If you are intellectually grounded in your faith, on the other hand, this book may come across as little more than an annoyance.  I recommend borrowing it from a library rather than putting one cent more in Dawkins' pocket by purchasing it.    One final observation--perhaps Dawkins' most entertaining comment of all is:  \\"The atheist view is correspondingly life-affirming and life-enhancing, while at the same time never being tainted with self-delusion, wishful thinking, or the whingeing self-pity of those who feel that life owes them something.\\" (p. 361)  Considering the whole of Dawkins' book, falser words have probably never been spoken.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Ok lets face it, most  \\"come backs\\" are boring, nothing new and defiantly nothing better. Zeitgeist is nothing new, defiantly nothing better but is in no way boring. Billy's vocals have lost nothing. Instrumentally the album holds up. Lyrics are highly political and hold attention. The album rocks the first listen and only gets better. Overall Zeitgeist is a worthy addition to the SP catalogue. In a weird way it kind of sounds fresh, probably because its been so long since SP have released material. Anyway,buy it, SP maybe classified as golden oldies music these days but this album still sounds better than most contempary releases. Welcome back looking forward to the world tour.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|This is a really cool movie with an actual budget, and its something only the Japanese would make. Hollywood doesn't have the balls to put out something like this. A story of an over-populated Japan and a government bill called Battle Royal, what better way to solve the problem then send all the teenagers to an island and have them battle it out? This is a VERY violent movie, all students are each given weapons and nobody leaves until there's only one left, so there are many deaths, well, with over 50 students on the island, you do the math. Highly recommended.
B000002LQR|5.0|Everyone likes saving money right? Ok, here's how to save money if you like the RHCP, buy this album from their catalogue only! If you must listen to the new stuff, turn on any popular radio station for no longer than ten minutes and get your fix. This album falls into the very exclusive \\"masterpiece\\" club. Every and I mean EVERY song on this album is perfect. The songs flow in unity from start to finish. This album sounds like nothing before it and nothing after it, besides every RHCP release which follows. Which brings me back to saving money. Now there's nothing wrong with the RHCP releases after this album there all good but only one or two songs from every album stands up to the complete Blood Sugar album. Its almost as if they release new albums to suck in new young fans that haven't heard the album before the new one. This is the RHCP at their very best and all one needs to satisfy the RHCP bug.
B000OLGCHA|3.0|While watching the terrific movie this score comes from, I was very positively impressed by the work Nicholas Hooper has done: it works extremely well within the context of the movie, which, after all, is the ONLY job a score is required to get done.    However, when I got the CD and listened to it, I was VERY disappointed with it.  This has got to be THE most poorly sequenced score CD I have ever heard.  The CD has absolutely no dramatic flow, but what's worse is that much of the best music seems to have been left off, so that you can't even make a particularly good self-sequenced album out of it.    There are still a few good tracks here -- the \\"Dumbledore's Army\\" sequences, at least, are fairly well represented -- so hardcore score collectors will enjoy having it.  For most everybody else, it's an enormous letdown.    Here's hoping that someday, when the series is complete, we'll get nice, complete presentations of all seven scores.  It's sorely needed in this movie's case.
B000P6YNSE|3.0|I don't have time to wrire an essay about season 3, but I can tell you it was by far the weakest, if not the worst. I am a Lost fan, but the truth is season 3 tested my patience, and my overall interest in the series - with season 1 -2 I could not wait for the next episode to come about, on the other hand season 3 was kind of \\"whatever\\"... Had it not been for TIVO I would have stop watching it all together. I loved season 1-2, I will not buy season 3.
0399215980|3.0|The book seems to present a narrative similar to P.D. Eastman's Are You My Mother?, which presents the very normal process whereby a lost young bird searches out the identity of its as-yet-unseen mother by unsuccessfully speaking to, among other other things, a boat, a plane, and a cow. The difference, as I see it, between the two, is that every attempted friendship sought out by the mouse in Carle's story is with another creature, until he finds the companionship most suited to him, that being with his own species. What a young child might take from this is probably very basic: mice probably find more in common with other mice. However, if applied to human relationships, it may be that the \\"message,\\" if there is one at this level to deal with, probably favors the notion that of all the possible friends out there for someone, one is more suited to a person than all the rest. I wouldn't go so far as to say that the book condones some kind of rejection, because, after all, in real life it does take some effort for any child to find a special friend. Further, I wouldn't say that the book reinforces the idea that only people like us can be our friends because, once again, it is a good thing to encourage a child to imagine a uniquely suitable friend just for him or her. If they don't seek out the child who is most different from everyone else, it does not mean that child is insensitive, just that finding a friend might be more spontaneous and innocent than we parents and teachers may like to admit-even when the child finds someone who happens to look like him or her.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|To be honest, I am a huge American Idol fan and truth be told, there has been loads of talent to come out of the show, even people who haven't made the top 10-12 have released CDs, so it goes to show that the talent is there! This is Kelly's 3rd disc, and the CD starts out blazin' hot! It starts with the Alanis tinged \\"Never Again\\", hell has no fury than a woman scorned. To break up with someone and have them be the last to know is completely scandalous! The guitars and drum compliment the points made in this song very well! \\"One Minute\\" has sort of an 80s rock vibe (way to go, Kelly!), this song is about all that flip flopping that all relationships go through, for the most part, there is at least one participant that doesn't know what he/she wants, changing one minute to the next, I feel Kelly's frustration (Hang in there sister!). \\"Hole\\" is that missing space in all of us, caused by betrayal of a loved one, whether it be a friend, lover, or relative. I have definitely been there, the question is, do we refill it or let it scar over...hmm?<br /><br />  \\"Sober\\", comes to a realization of an ending relationship. She doesn't want to compare any relationship to other ones in her past, but learn from them. However the relationships ended, are never over because we take a part of each person with us to hold in our hearts. \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" is letting your ex know it's truly over. Unfortunately, every relationship ends over an imperfection, whether, it be death, infidelity, or just plain ignorance. She is letting him know that everything has all led to arguments or hurt and in the end, she has to cut her losses. \\"Judas\\" is all about betrayal! Someone has been very selfish, but it is unclear whether it was a lover, a friend, or whom. Although being betrayed by anyone you love hurts, just the same. (Been there, done that). \\"Haunted\\" by that memory of an ex-love can be so emotional! In truth, there are still memories of exes in my life that haunt me everyday, luckily we can be creative (right Kelly?) I suppose we all need some mystery in our lives, so thats why we make up scenarios in our head to keep a part of this person.<br /><br />  \\"Be Still\\" is a slow ballad, taking time out to look at the relationship for what it is. Weighing the good, with the bad, letting emotions go, and revealing feelings, love is worth saving in this song. \\"Maybe\\" finds her letting her beau know, that if he just tries to hold and love her for who she is, both can look past things and take the good with the bad. It seems beneficial on both parts, just to show some understanding. \\"How I Feel\\", is an upbeat song recognizes feelings and accepting those feelings for what they are. I know we don't want to feel hurt, but sometimes, it's necessary for personal growth.<br /><br />  \\"Yeah\\" has sort of a country rock vibe. I think it's about being up front and honest. She lets him know that she will be honest , if he is and for him to only say what's up. Only, if more people were like this, up front and honest, we would all at least get along. \\"Can I Have A Kiss\\" finds her trying to reconcile and accept things that go wrong in their relationship. If not, at least working it out, to have something sweet and tender to remember the relationship by. \\"Irvine\\" is a calm, quiet ballad. To love someone and be held and remembered. I say \\"remembered\\" because, Irvine is dead and looking down on her from heaven, he is free from pain on earth, but showers her with love from heaven, in this instance, he has become her guardian angel. However, at the end, there is a hidden track that shows she has a little resentment from being hurt, so does she have a little resentment.....it's a quandry.<br /><br />  This CD is great for reflection because it has all the emotional prowess of a great love story, the tenderness, the betrayal, and the coping.

1401307450|5.0|All I can say is that I wanted to have a book to read over the course of about half of the summer and instead I read it in just a couple of days! It's heartfelt & candid. And its written through the voice of Anthony Kiedis rather than someone taking his thoughts and trying to put them in some dull, refined, intellectual way. Anyway, now I have to find something to read that won't bore me after reading this great book!

0761536434|5.0|This book is very detailed and well done.  It is 600 pages.  I think a minor typo (p561) is that Playstation DVD hold 8GB or 17GB dual layer, I believe it is half that (4.7 GB and 9 GB).  I also think a fun \\"fact\\" that wasn't mentioned in the book is that Donkey Kong Country on the SNES was thought to be the Ultra64 (N64) demo at the show.  Otherwise, very in depth, lots of insights into the beginning of pre-pong games, creation of companies like Atari, etc., up to PS2 and Xbox timeframe.  This took me a little over 8 hours to read cover-to-cover, but I was always very interested since I grew up playing a lot of arcade games, and enjoy home consoles too.
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 Days has been hailed by some as a monumental success, while others have labeled it a failure. Many who were disappointed, felt that Tool had lost their aggressive and hard hitting sound in favor of a softer, more progressive flavor. Many also complained that this album was filled with a lot of filler in the form of numerous moments of minimalist soundscapes between songs. To some, Tool had softened up.  While I agree that this is not by any means Tool's heaviest offering, I think that to criticize them for changing (or rather evolving) their sound is unfair and an illogical contention. Tool has, and always will be, a band focused on musical progression and evolution. If they just kept making more albums like Aenima and Lateralus, they would be betraying their own goal of musical advancement. After all, Tool, like it or not, has always been about doing things their way.  10,000 days is simply a newer more mature Tool, just like every new Tool record. The lack of heaviness would indicate that the members of Tool have found other ways to express themselves, as they have moved on from simply just being loud. Tracks like Rosetta Stoned and Vicarious are still aggressive and hard hitting, but are performed in a controled and deliberate manner. The highlight of the album, however, is the two song epic Wings for Marie and 10,000 days. Very rarely do you find the best part of the album to be the softest songs, but in this case, it is undeniably so. Here the minimalism only serves to build up the tension all the way to the very end. In my opinion, this is one of the most powerful songs that Tool has ever written. Other notable tracks include the schizophrenic track Rosetta Stoned, and The Pot.   To sum up, this is just business as usual for Tool. Every album is meant to stand on their own, and is meant to push them as musicians. Those who expected another Lateralus or Aenima are approaching this in a completely backwards manner. For a moment, forget that Tool ever wrote prior album and just listen to THIS album and let it stand on its own merit.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This video series is excellent. Our entire family has enjoyed watching.  Our children ages 20,16,12,& 8 all really liked these videos.  The video photography is amazing.  I especially enjoy the \\"Planet Earth diaries\\" at the end of each video.  The diaries help the viewer understand the logistics and painstaking effort involved in filming these scenes.  Each disk is made up of 4-5 videos, each about 1 hour long, so you can choose to watch one topic or more as your time permits.  The topics are broken down into areas such as:  caves, mountians, deep seas, shallow seas, ice world, jungles, etc.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|It's Rent... What's there not to like? If you have never seen this musical, DVD or on stage, just watch it. It is NOTHING like your typical musical. With it's heart wrenching roller coaster of emotions, excellent acting, amazing music, and astonishing talent it is well worth every penny. I LOVE IT!
B000EGFVQS|5.0|There are so many views of what will happen to us after we die.  No matter what yours is, I think anyone could appreciate the fictional Heaven that the author has created in The Lovely Bones.  This is the place where the main character, 14-year-old Susie Salmon, begins her story, after her tragic murder.  Throughout the book, we are taken on a continuous journey of grief and healing, discovery and  redemption, all the while wondering if her killer will ever be discovered. The book jumps between the past and the present a lot, but that added to the suspense of the story.  Through Susie's innocent narrative, I anxiously awaited what would happen to each of her loved ones as well as people outside her circle who were still affected by her demise.  I was not disappointed.  It was a moving portrayal of a family and community who found a way to move on and learn something about themselves in the process.  We also get to see the change in Susie, the reflection of her past as well as the continuous discovery about herself and her relationship with the people who loved her.  Wouldn't we all like to look down from Heaven and watch how the rest of the world continues on without us?  Some previous reviewers may feel that the story was too simplistic, but remember that this is being told from the viewpoint of a 14-year-old in the 1970's, a time when she was just leaving the realm of innocence.  I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased it so I can read it again and again.  I believe it holds many life lessons for us all.
0345457692|4.0|My first Richard Morgan novel.     In the relatively new genre dubbed as cyberpunk, British author Richard K. Morgan's first Takeshi Kovacs novel ALTERED CARBON (2002) leaves an indelible impression. A captivating blend of suspense/mystery, hardcore first-person detective story, and action/adventure in the midst of a science fiction backdrop, ALTERED CARBON is sure to hit you hard with its unique style and flavor. Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs is exactly the sort of kick-butt, intelligent hero I love to read about. Although I'm not a huge fan of first-person storytelling, our narrator Kovacs manages to admirably build the science fiction universe of ALTERED CARBON with its futuristic vocab and prose. ALTERED CARBON's settings, including the bureaucracy, economic social hierarchy, the vernacular, and futuristic sights are thorough, if not confounding at times. For a debut novel, Morgan ably sets the scene and builds his universe which support his story. There's plenty of related history too. Again, the prose can be ambiguous at times, but it depends on how you receive it; don't let the futuristic vernacular bog you down, just take it in stride. Richard Morgan doesn't shy away from explicit language, brutal violence and sex to grab your attention either. His science fiction world is very morbid, and these things are a part of its \\"culture.\\"    In the futuristic ALTERED CARBON, human civilization conquers death itself. \\"Poor Death, no match for the mighty altered-carbon technologies of data storage and retrieval arrayed against him. Once we lived in terror of [Death's] arrival. Now we flirt outrageously with his somber dignity, and beings like these won't even let him in the tradesman's entrance.\\" Ouch. But these things are a reality for the universe of ALTERED CARBON: cloning, mind data storage/retrieval, resleeving (brand new body or same body but younger). In a macabre observation, the book notes how virtual prostitution is actually more expensive than sex with a real prostitute, since bodies don't have much significance anymore. Many \\"Meths\\" (rich, influential people, socially and economically high on the food chain) have stacks on storage, and they transmit their current memory over regular intervals of time to a data center containing hundreds of their cloned bodies. \\"Meths\\" are often thousands of centuries old. Other, common people also have \\"stacks\\" for storage and retrieval in their spinal core, though they often don't have the monetary means to afford more than one clone, let alone hundreds. As the story begins, Morgan weaves in religion as we learn of religious Catholics demonstrating with placards against any form of data storage and retrieval on Earth, arguing such altered-carbon technology destroys the soul. In fact, many Catholics still live a traditional lifespan and forgo any form of cloning and resleeving in a new body.    Ex-U.N. Envoy (military conditioning and training) and criminal Takeshi Kovacs has just been hired by a Meth, Mr. Laurens Bancroft to investigate Bancroft's apparent suicide. The story begins as police commandos gun down Kovacs and his friend Sarah to death on Harlan's World. Next thing we know, authorities \\"needlecast\\" (transmit) Kovacs' \\"stack\\" (stored mind) over to Earth to be resleeved in a new body sanctioned and paid for by Bancroft. Bancraft is convinced it was a murder not a suicide, and he maintains he wouldn't try to kill himself when they'd download him to a new cloned body later anyway. Unfortunately, his last \\"update\\" to his personal data center was well before the events preceding his apparent suicide and now, he has no memory of his suicide or the time before it. Bancraft hires Kovacs on the strength of a recommendation by Reileen Kawahara, who Kovacs did some work for a few years back. The police and the ranking officer Lt. Kristin Ortega have already closed the case, declaring an open-and-shut suicide.    As Kovacs pursues the investigation, we learn more and more about the variouspieces of the puzzle. If you're astute unlike me, you may be able to figure out some links well before the end. Kovacs investigates Bancroft's proclivity for blue-collar prostitution establishments like Jerry's Closed Quarters, he learns more about Bancroft's wife, the drop-dead gorgeous Miriam Bancroft, and even Kovacs' current \\"sleeve\\" (body) and its rightful consciousness currently stacked away seems to bear some disturbing connections to the leading police officer who closed Bancroft's case, the austere Lt. Ortega. Everyone except Bancroft himself wants Kovacs to leave well enough alone, and drop the investigation. The wild joy ride seems to intrigue Kovacs and he doggedly continues his investigation.    Morgan intersperses a lot of history and world-building into Kovacs' characterization. Although not as old as a Meth, Kovacs is an ex-Envoy and a few hundreds of years old himself with a rich and dark history. He often recalls gruesome wars, gritty experiences and brutal people he's met.    Here's just a taste of Kovacs' hardcore characterization. The following passages comes relatively early on in the book when there's a cold fury raging through his veins. It's actually a lot of fun. In a book Kovacs often quotes throughout, he notes: \\"And make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous, marks the difference -- the only difference in their eyes -- between players and little people. Players they will make deals with. Little people they liquidate. And time and again they cream your liquidation, your displacement, your torture and brutal execution with the ultimate insult that it's just business, it's politics, it's the way of the world, it's a tough life, and that it's nothing personal. Well (screw) them. Make it personal.\\"    There's traces of love in the story, but don't hold your breath there, the book's focus rests on the hardcore first-person characterization of Takeshi Kovacs and the mystery he's hired to solve. What I like about the book: the nihilistic Kovacs' motivations behind his actions are very personal, drawn from a caring for the people he values. Nonetheless, Morgan explores some interesting themes here in the midst of his scifi world. In love, is it the body we love or the consciousness behind the body? Can you love a new consciousness in the body of your lover (Ortega/Kovacs/Ryker)? Can you love a new body with the consciousness of your love (Victor & Irene Elliot)? Is any of this cheating? It seems that a true long-term relationship hinges equally on both: the person behind the body and the body itself. And in Morgan's science fiction universe where bodies are interchanged as quickly as shirts, love is tricky.    My main criticism with this novel has to do with the prose. Because of the rich fabric of history and science fiction vernacular Morgan sprinkles into the first-person narrative, the prose takes some patience to follow, and if you don't really care for this brand of hardcore cyberpunk detective story, you're not going to like it. I dropped this novel in favor of others for months before I actually came back to finish this one. Having finished it, I will definitely continue reading other Takeshi Kovacs novels.    It's an interesting ride to say the least.
0743454537|5.0|I've always been impressed with the subject matters that Jodi Picoult takes on with each of her books, but this one by far was the most controversial.  What I loved about this book were the various narratives that told an emotionally-charged story revolving around genetic planning.  There was Anna, the teenager conceived for the purpose of saving her sister's life, their mother (an attorney fighting for her older daughter's life), troubled older brother Jesse, and Anna's attorney (she hired him to sue her parents for medical emancipation).  Once I started, I honestly could not put this book down - and my opinions of who was doing the right thing teetered back and forth until the shocking conclusion.  Some may not like the ending, but I thought it was brilliant!  Excellent writing does not, and should not, constitute a neatly wrapped-up fairy-tale ending.  This certainly is a story that will leave you thinking and re-thinking your beliefs about life and what it takes to sustain it.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these headphones a few months ago, and I am very very pleased. Some pros of them are: superb sound quality, light weight, and great value/price. The headphones go in your ears and over your head. They are great for really any activity; they won't fall out during jogging, biking, or sitting around the house. I don't have any complaints, but some may not be careful and may break/crack them. Also, some may not like the L-shaped plug.
0618680004|3.0|I recommend \\"The God Delusion\\" to anyone having misgivings about the influence of religion throughout history.<br /><br />However in my opinion Professor Dawkins is mistaken in one of his main arguments.<br /><br />The dust cover of the Houghton Mifflin edition describes Dawkins as \\"a preeminent scientist - and the world's most prominent atheist\\". I do not question his credentials as a scientist, but I seriously doubt that he has applied the scientific method to the \\"God Hypothesis\\".<br /><br />Contrary to the blurb, Dawkins is not exactly an atheist. He doesn't actually deny the existence of God; he goes no farther than to say that there almost certainly is no God. That's because he thinks that the existence or non-existence of God is a scientific question. While he allows that God's existence cannot be disproved, he claims that it could conceivably be proved.<br /><br />In Dawkins's own words (on page 50): \\"God's existence or non-existence is a scientific fact about the universe, discoverable in principle if not in practice. If he existed and chose to reveal it, God himself could clinch the argument, noisily and unequivocally, in his favour.\\" But Dawkins fails to explain how, in the event of such a revelation, man would be able to tell that the revelation actually came from God rather than from natural causes.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia, \\"Scientific researchers propose hypotheses as explanations of phenomena, and design experimental studies that test these hypotheses for accuracy. These steps must be repeatable in order to predict dependably any future results\\". Further, any scientific hypothesis should be testable and potentially falsifiable, in that there should be a way to show that the hypothesis is false, thereby disproving the hypothesis.<br /><br />If the above description of the scientific method is correct, any revelation of God, by God, would have to be repeatable by scientists, and there must be the possibility of the hypothesis being found to be false. But I cannot see how God's self-revelation could be tested scientifically, and therefore the question of God's existence or non-existence falls outside the scope of the scientific method as commonly understood.<br /><br />P.S. If I knew how to (without losing votes) I would upgrade this book to four stars, to show that I found it interesting and I agree with most of what Dawkins says. Not so sure about the memes and memetics, though.ion could be tested scientifically, and therefore the question of God's existence or non-existence falls outside the scope of the scientific method as commonly understood.    P.S. If I knew how to (without losing votes) I would upgrade this book to four stars, to show that I found it interesting and I agree with most of what Dawkins says. Not so sure about the memes and memetics, though.

0060578793|5.0|After seeing this book on Amazon I went to my neighborhood big book store to check it out in the flesh. Just for fun I thought of a few extreme situation and then looked them up in the guide and almost magically they were in there, after a little bit of searching. As a big fan of the \\"survivor\\" shows on Discovery Channel, such as Survivorman and Man Vs. Wild, I was hoked on this book from beginning to end. Every bit of information is written in an interesting way that kept me wanting more and more. Since I bought the book I have read it through about three times and each time it seems that I catch something that I did not notice the last time. I have also gone to the Sierra Nevada mountain range once so far during the Spring and tried out a couple of the survival techniques near the cabin I was staying at. If your a buying this book it must mean that you have an interest in survival in the wild, therefore I would recommend that you get some Swedish FireSteel, a type of fire starter commonly used on Man Vs. Wild and a good knife, Gerber, Cold Steel, Buck, or if your really serious SOG or Ka-Bar. My personal favorite is the Gerber LMF II, it is seriously strong as hell and easy on the hands. Regardless if you buy the other stuff this book is the most important because it contains all the helpful information a guy starving for information could ever dream of. A+
B000OQF6N6|1.0|If your like me and you love the old albums like Gish and Siamese Dream this album blows chunks. Compared to the delicious crunchy bite of the old true Pumpkins line up the new Pumpkins is like nibbling on a stale wafer. Zwan was better than this. However, if you are a fan of the new stuff by the new Pumpkins you may think this is ok. For me the good Pumpkins equals loud distorted melodic guitar & Billy pulling his lungs out and showing them to you. Thats not here. Not even close.
1416911049|4.0|I bought this for my kids, hoping to lure them away from video games.  It hasn't worked--yet--but in the meantime, I read it and enjoyed it.  Westerfeld creates a believable dystopian world where all is not as it seems.<br /><br />It reminded me of The Giver, although Westerfeld's character development is not as thoughtful as Lowry's.  (Oops, we can't use html tags to underline?)<br /><br />Still, I plan to read the remaining two books in the trilogy and will continue to encourage my kids to do so.
B00005JP97|3.0|Black Snake Moan is the story of 2 unlikely individuals who cross paths and strangely heal each other.  I was expecting a very Quentin Tarrentinoish flavor to this movie considering the DVD artwork, use of similar imagery and storyline but this movie was not executed as well as it could have been.  The movie drags on and is about 1/2 hour too long.  The acting is good but certain scenes are just dragged on for too long such as some of the guitar scenes.  Overall, I do suggest you check this movie out but its not one of my favorites.
0765348780|2.0|After hearing comparisons to GRRM's series \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" I jumped on this book given I love military and fantasy settings. The only thing that comes close to GRRM in this book is length and an attempt at creating an interesting historical fantasy world. Too bad the author wrote  a rather droll, generic fantasy adventure with cut out characters to introduce us.    The Battles I read were unexciting/confusing for a military novel involving an over-reliance on wizards who seem to function like artilery pieces, The magic used was also vague(what is \\"waves of magic\\"?) and everyone has apparently has access to \\"a lost spell for over 400 years\\" or \\"Powerful, rare skill of  _____ that I can pull out in a jam\\". Heck, within the first 75 pages alone, one character is resurrected after dying not once, but twice! Of course, someone used a \\"spell that has been lost since _____\\"....apparently resurrection spells went out of style despite the ease in casting them. Characters were not only flat, generic, and loosely described, but were introduced at rapid speed.....the author helps by giving us a a few pages  of character listings and one sentence description for them.....too bad it's like 50+ people of which many are unimportant. The biggest crime is that unlike most generic fantasy drivel, it parades around as if this is an epic series rivaling the best in the genre. Nothing is worse than an OK story expanded into an epic.    I suppose if you think every Dungeons and Dragons inspired novel is a decent read, you'd very much like this book. It's basically a well written  generic fantasy story turned into an epic 10 book series. If your looking for a work of fantasy that is high quality and worthy of critical praise, look elsewhere.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|I got this DVD from the mail last month and view it once with enjoyment, to see the current golden couple of the opera world in action, and ,of course, the enduring placido Domingo in his midsixties and still doing magic; this I can't help thinking about Jerry Hadly who at 55 lost his voice and in debt and in a depression killed himself and is brain dead in a hospital at this moment.  I can't help also thinking about people who know how to manage their lives and those who don't, in this case you do know who does and who doesn't.  This is no place to discuss other people's personal lives.  So, I'll leave it right here.  Certainly, I watched the DVD in its entirety before I write this review, I enjoyed it more the second time because I was wide awake.  However, at my age, I can't open my eyes all the time; actually, I have to close them most of the time so I missed the commotion created by Netrebko while she sang Musetta's Waltz, If you add ten years to Domingo's that would be about my age.  I have a feeling that you can't put up with my rambling anymore, I'm sorry, I'll stop right here.    Domingo starts his program with a difficult to sing famous aria from L'Alessiana that only he can deliver at 65.  It's amazing that at his age he still can sing like this, of course, Roberto Alagna does a much better job in his debut album.  Netrebko, then sings beautifully 'O mio babbino caro' from 'Gianni Schicchi' although the aria doesn't exactly fit her vocal cord. Villazon then displays his singing skill the aria 'Ah! Parais' from his famous GOUNOD/MASSENET album.  Next on, the caressing duet from Verdi's Otello.  Here, I would like very much to introduce a DVD of the Met's production of Otello with Renee Flaming, Domingo, and James Morris. Flaming is simply divine in the role of Desdemona.  She sings and act beautifully and naturally.  I don't have to say anything about Domingo, Otello is his most prominent signature role.  And James Morris gives me goose bumps in his evil invoking soliloquy, I don't know the name of the piece, you'll know when you watch the DVD anyway.  I simply can't help letting other people know about good stuff.  Then the Carmen moutain Entr'acte.  The famous tenor/baritone duet from the Pearl Fisher.  Here, again, I would like to introduce a beautiful complete opera set CD from EMI with Barbara Hendricks, John Aler, and Gino Quilico.  Though, Domingo and Villazon sing well, but they are both tenors the voices don't blend as well as tenor/baritone.  You can get carried away by John Aler's 'Je crois entendre encore' even if he doesn't end the aria in the high region.  And Hendricks happens to be very good too. And Michell Plasson, a Frenchman conducts a French opera there should't be any problem.  There you go, another good thing for you.      Good and exciting numbers continue till the end.  Things get more exciting as the concert proceeds.  The three of them sure know how to generate reciprocation with the audience.  And the audience, according to the disc box cover there were 20,000 of them and I believe it, view from the TV screen it's huge.  I would like to mention one more number on the program, it's from Lehar's operetta 'Giuditta'.  Netrebko does a very good job of course, but I would still love to introduce Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's OPERETTA ARIAS album.  13 songs altogether, everyone of them is a gem, and she is of course the genuine article.  This album has been with me for over three decades and yet my fondness for it never fades.      Here you go, a five-star DVD for you and at discount price too.  I have to pay expensive shipping cost but you don't.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|America's sweetheart, KELLY CLARKSON, unveils an explosive tour-de-force masterpiece career album with MY DECEMBER! I bought this album the very day it was released and have listened extensively and thoroughly to it before coming here to share my perspective. During the past few weeks, I have also seen Kelly on the talk show cicuit promoting MY DECEMBER, being interviewd \\"Live\\" on local morning radio shows, and read the extensive professional reviews on the net as well as the fans' perspectives. I initially, first round, was highly impressed at how well crafted and rounded the entire album is and it grows even more on me with each repeated listening. The most compelling and focal point, are KELLY's vocals, front, center surround sounding and she is never drowned by instrumentation in the mix of any track - her voice remains the ultimate \\"instrument\\" featured, as should be, to stunning effect and perfect quality production. MY DECEMBER by KELLY CLARKSON is a spectacular and illustrious album of a great first rate musical statement you should have to explore and enjoy, so do NOT listen to negative points of views/reviews - get your own copy because every song on here is noteworthy and very fit to be a hit single, as there is not one bad track, misstep or note within the entire album.  KELLY will rock your world! MY DECEMBER can be viewed as a collection of songs about relationships and can also be clearly interpreted as a musical letter from Kelly to her audience about her last five years in stardom, what she proposes for the future and the tug-of-war controvery surrounding her \\"take responsibility/control of my career\\" decisions and direction. The album contains a tremendous sure fire seven to eight [definite] hit singles which will literally smash and obliterate all the schmaltzy, indistinguishable Top 40 fare on the radio/charts these days. KELLY delivers a tremendous cache of well written/composed and executed pop and rock jewels and gems from the creative depthsof her mind and soul. She succeeds all over the colorful map of MY DECEMBER and produces memorable rock music which as single track editions, deserve Top 10 successes as well as massive multi-format radio exposure. This young lady is a phenomenal talent and artist who delivers stunning results! Clive Davis is a foolish old man who doesn't fully appreciate the vaults and vaults of capital and awards Miss Clarkson has earned for his record company and it is her hard earned $$$money$$$ lining his personal wallet and paycheck. Davis needs to drop his evil demeanor to wake up and HEAR the music the vocally gifted and creative KELLY CLARKSON is spewing forth in an eruptive muticolored volcanic flow of skyrocketing fireworks and glowing, gold laced white hot lava which displays a kaleidoscope spectrum of colors in both her vocals and self penned compositions. I was not a fan, I could have cared less, I don't watch American Idol, I scan my car radio nonstop, only stopping to listen to whatever grabs my attention and ears, but by the third smash hit single from her BREAKAWAY album, KELLY had won me over with her spectacular interpretive skills and expressive vocals. I have not heard any female artist that demanded attention simply by singing, since Linda Ronstadt ruled all over the radio/charts - and several have come and gone since then, some were singers and others screamers. KELLY CLARKSON possesses an exceptionally compelling voice with an alluring effect and interpretive skills that even the most jaded music listener can't resist. Her musical vision and intuitions of keeping in tune/step with the music industry's audience tastes have made her a profound and winning talent. Her music is clean, nonsense free and void of the disgraceful \\"parental advisory\\" warnings, yet, she is able to execute and create fun, catchy, impressive and memorable recordings that a teenager, a grandparent and everybody in between can fully enjoy. Now, the new album...The Top 10 success of the initial single, \\"NEVER AGAIN\\" opens MY DECEMBER with a roaring fervor and segues right into the bombastic and delightfully fun and surprising future Top 10 gem, \\"ONE MINUTE\\"! You can't help but want to get up and dance to the quaking energy of \\"ONE MINUTE\\"'s ongoing explosive rhythm and Kelly's decisive hot vocals. \\"ONE MINUTE\\" is Kelly's joyful declaration for liberation from her record company's treacherous confining limitations on creative freedom - and she explodes with imposing independence! \\"HOLE\\" a sharp, edgy Top 10 ripping rocker, will easily blast its way up Alternative and Pop Rock Radio playlists. \\"SOBER\\", a heart warming, touching power ballad, slowly builds momentum to an incredible stratospheric vocal crescendo with Kelly flexing her vocal instrument to full throttle/full blown vocal effect. Already second single, \\"SOBER\\" finds our beloved Kelly recuperating from the spellbinding, dizzying effects and aftermath of BREAKAWAY's massively exhausting world success trying reach out to her Pop audience with tenderness and a longing to remain in hearts who loved her from the outset of her career, stay with me, she seems to say, and we'll see this ongoing walk through this opportunity you all have given me, together. Another Top 10 radio ready track, \\"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME\\" pounds away at a hypnotic, above midtempo pace and delivers one of Kelly's finest vocals to date. \\"Don't Waste...\\" implores to all the production puppets, high profile songwriters out there to leave her be and let her chart her own musical course - \\"thank you for your help, friendship, all the success, but, PLEASE let me stand/fall on my own!\\" as I hunger to go forth in my own explorative and rightfully chosen direction. She's paid her \\"dues\\" and earned her way! \\"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME\\" is a WOWzer! \\"JUDAS\\", a track Miss Clarkson has stated in interviews as one of her preferred future single releases is right on the mark to skyrocket up the charts to the Top 10 with its propulsive, hard driving guitar and drum beats, a trailblazing rocker highlighting KELLY's lead and backup vocals. Could \\"JUDAS\\" be Clive Davis? Will \\"JUDAS\\" be Clarkson's secret \\"You're So Vain\\" mystery? Will she offer up several throw off tales to keep the secret for decades like Carly Simon? Next up #7, \\"HAUNTED\\", obvious Top 10 radio friendly track, takes us to the halfway point of the album and every track so far is strong, polished, well crafted and worthy of hit single status, yet, more surprises await ahead, as there is no filler on MY DECEMBER! Some of these tracks have an edgy, diamond in the rough, polished finesse appeal that explodes everywhere from the system speakers - this lady ROCKS with the very best of the rockers! ***CLIVE DAVIS is either/all deaf, ignorant, blind or simply the destroyer of today's youth's American Dream, of which KELLY CLARKSON is a divine role model. Here I am at middle age, been buying records since I was 13 and the past decade of music and its artists has left me jaded and bored, save a handful, but, KELLY CLARKSON has restored my faith in quality music. I'm no expert, but, I've seen them all come and go, and my library currently stands at 8500 Cds, 3000 vinyl records and a couple hundred box sets. KELLY's career is very reminiscent of the fever pitch, highly anticipated, golden hit single laden careers of the Carpenters, Bee Gees, Madonna, Fleetwood Mac, Eagles leaving many unforgettable charting tracks in their wake. ***Now, back to MY DECEMBER...Kelly offers, \\"BE STILL\\", an affecting and appropriate paen to circumstances surrounding her new album's current chart status/predicament and struggle against her record company for control in artistic self fulfillment. \\"BE STILL\\" is a beautifully crafted and executed ballad in which Kelly's heartfelt vocals penetrate to endearing effect, providing even more Top 10 status here. On the highly autobiographical and painfully honesty of \\"MAYBE\\", she pleads desperately for support, trust, unconditional love& understanding with tear stained, confident clarity, hoping for the ultimate best from her audience, yet exerts an astounding self confidence and comfort within her own skin that burns heavily on the touching, eyes welled up, teary, but self assured ballad turned rocker. KELLY is treading deep water here in defining about who she is as an artist, a human being, glamour-warts-and-all included to stunning effect - even more Top 10 material here, a possible #1! \\"MAYBE\\" is a baring it all winner in fearless win or lose honesty. She confirms she loves the attention and affections her audience has lavished on her and likewise, returns it with appreciation. Being an underdog and artistically defiant in the music business is rough'n tough, I'm complicated like a rose with thorns, but, don't abandon me, forgive me for being human, she pleads to her audience, let's maintain harmony and I'll make you proud if you stay with me. We love you Kelly - and we do need you - you are our hope in restoring pop music! \\"HOW I FEEL\\"-track 10, guitar and vocally driven ear candy with its top notch radio friendly quality rocks along in the playful splendor of its own top of the charts promise. Miss Independent's joyful \\"YEAH\\", moves us to her own dance beat with a fun, loud, hip 'n very soulful light rapping vocals-horns brightened rocker - a \\"remix\\" candidate headed straight to dance clubs everywhere to shift the crowds out to the floor. Great production here finds Kelly bumping, grinding and playfully flirting and sexually teasing her way across the track convincingly. The much heralded by fans, \\"CAN I HAVE A KISS\\", is a catchy vocals and hooks filled, sheer Top 10 royal slice of American Pie! Another future #1 here, thanks to the fans everywhere! Whoever questioned Kelly Clarkson's ability to write well crafted quality top of the charts radio hit singles is a fool, as she proves throughout MY DECEMBER that she can easily surpass even the best of them! Kelly's instincts and vision perfectly fit with the vocal talents she is blessed with. The  focal center of the album and most gorgeous track is the hauntingly beautiful, atmospheric and brilliant \\"IRVINE\\", track 13. Various shades of Kelly seem to flash across her most mysterious and astounding song. \\"IRVINE\\" is an eerily, compelling and profoundly moving track which at 4:11 seems to be over, all too soon, and beckons for repeated listenings. Many questions arise and probe the listener's mind about \\"IRVINE\\". Is Clarkson looking in the mirror and addressing her former self on the opposite side during a moment of darkness when she finds herself completely drained from the commitments of her fast moving, exhaustive busy global career? Or is she conjuring up and addressing the ghost of another blue-eyed soul/pop-rock goddess, the late Dusty Springfield from beyond the grave to compare notes? Is it possible this is Clarkson's tribute to Dusty Springfield, as this track is a direct stylistic influence from the great Dusty Springfield, and begs examination. Who is this mysterious \\"IRVINE\\" we ponder, as we are drawn like moths to a flame? The precious \\"IRVINE\\" will remain a mystery for years to come. Finally, \\"CHIVAS\\", the \\"hidden\\" # 14 track, which begins at approximately 5:17 after 1:06 of silence. \\"CHIVAS\\" is an bluesy, acoustic guitar vocal ode which finds Kelly dismissing a former lover and choosing momentary comfort from the contents within the bottle instead. Our girl is quite the cleancut role model, and she giggles in fun at the close of the track. \\"CHIVAS\\" is Kelly at her finest and reveals yet another dimension of her musical diversity, which hopefully, she will explore to greater degree on a future release. That final giggle closes MY DECEMBER, and almost says, \\"Hey, I showed you!\\" - WOW!!! This is a stunner of a winning album!***Pat Benatar she's NOT, and I wouldn't want her to be, as Ms. Benatar is stuck in 80's mainstream rock and wasted her trained operatic vocal abilities on that confining turf, she never broke out of. Don't get me wrong, I like Pat, but, her brand of music runs between very narrow lines and becomes monotonous after more than a listen or two. Clarkson is in a class of her own and of a higher quality and diversity than the Pat Benatars of the music world, so Radio Jockeys, STOP making comparisons! Despite the darkness of the lyrics of MY DECEMBER, its smoldering, combustive rock and enticing catchy TOP 40 hooks savvy and skillful songwriting reveal a brilliant, steadily maturing, determined artist flashing the previously unseen and hidden talents of her artistic abilities. Clarkson was only flirting with songwriting on her previous album, she comes full circle with a foot forward right here and one can only imagine the highly rated wonders she will expose to us next time around. KELLY CLARKSON's ethereal musical statement cuts deep and maintains the promise her exceptional vocal abilities demonstrated at the outset of her career. She doesn't need to sing happy-go-lucky sunny tween ditties, because Miss Clarkson's sunrises will light up the dreary musical landscape for years and years of grand horizons such as MY DECEMBER to come. Plus, this album ROCKS! She won my skeptical indifference over and I'm a fan for the long run. CLARKSON has made history and landmark events on many counts already within the music industry, but, her most historic accomplishment as a farily new/young artist is taking full responsibility and control of her product, integrety and career by proving she can execute and produce intelligent, timeless and superior commercial music on her own terms successfully, which this album fully demonstrates. If her record company fails to HEAR the greatness of the music within MY DECEMBER, it is their loss and stupidity, because this album is packed full of hit singles. As for Clive Davis, he is the destroyer of our youth's American Dream. He has lived his 'dreams' for decades and it's time he allowed others in the business to live theirs. GO KELLY, GO!!!

1594489505|4.0|I loved The Kite Runner and looked forward to reading A Thousand Splendid Suns. I was not disappointed. Hosseini gives us another view of Afghan society which explains so much about their history and culture. The book has a positive view of the future for Afghan women because of when it was written. I am less optomistic. Worth the time.

B000056OBA|5.0|To my mind, of the fifty or so versions of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony I've enjoyed over 40 years listening, this is one of the very best. The other eight symphonies in this set rate just as highly. It is a fun set to hear, a young star (\\"Wunderkind\\") conductor with the first important recording cycle for the re-emerging Berlin Philharmonic - soon to be, and ever since generally recognized as the world's finest ensemble. This particular, long lived marriage of star conductor and brilliant orchestra produced many of arguably the best performances ever recorded. Not among those who insist on winners always, I would say this set is unsurpassed, if equalled. Its main attractions are the quick and agile, often fiery tempi, perhaps outdone only slightly at times by Karajan's even more youthful Philharmonia Orchestra set from the fifties on EMI which is technically inferior, and by the rather italianate renderings by Toscannini and the NBC Symphony, less satisfying technically and interpretively. Karajan's interpretations are sometimes judged to be somewhat cool or aloof - as opposed to warm and impassioned, I suppose. I don't agree, and can only suspect that often people hear what they want to hear for reasons unrelated to the music before them. For instance, many of these same critics contend incredibly that Toscannini was superior for these reasons. As the years go by, Toscannini's style sounds more like a pop band in comparison with many of the versions since. To contend that Karajan's versions are not as \\"deeply felt\\" as Toscannini's is, I'd say, disingenuous. Karajan certainly brought as much clarity and musicality, and the BPO as much passion and finesse, as could be desired, with remarkably even results throughout the entire cycle. The enthusiasm of the newly betrothed brings us a set Beethoven would surely have loved to hear.    The later two cycles of Beethoven's symphonies by Karajan and the BPO were technically superior, and in my view musically as well for themost part, but only marginally. A given soloist in the Ninth is slightly better than another, or not, but these would be quibbles in the bigger picture. Absent later would be the sense of anticipation as the musicians embarked on their noble project, replaced by the assured sophistication of a conductor and BPO which had \\"arrived.\\" By the third set, indeed, these same had nothing in particular left to prove, but DGG wanted a new cycle to market with ever newer technology, and Karajan another chance to perfect his renderings, already thought deridedly by some to be \\"too perfect\\" the last time. One simply cannot go wrong with any of these Karajan/BPO sets (the Philharmonia set is rendered redundant).    As alternatives, there are truly few comparable performances let alone complete cycles, but each example brings its own definitive contribution to the repertoire. The best of them technically is by Bruno Walter in his later years with the Columbia Symphony, the orchestra handpicked by Walter mostly from the LA Philharmonic and west coast freelancers (except for the last movement of the Ninth recorded in New York City - it is not certain if those were players picked, as during the years when Walter lived there, from the NY Phil, the Met, etc., or perhaps less likely the same LA players). Some argue the CSO players were not as good as found elsewhere, but I believe they are as good as any and gave us some of the most beautiful music we could ever wish to hear. Doubters should really try to explain how an inferior group could have achieved Walter's astounding CSO recording of Mahler's Ninth Symphony. These Walter/CSO recordings of Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Mozart, Bruckner, and others are some of the most gorgeous sounds recorded (especially the remastered releases by Sony), led by one of the most gifted interpreters of all time. Walter's magic was to seemingly effortlessly achieve performances which leave us wondering if there could be any other way to play the music that would be as \\"right.\\" Granted the Ninth heard in the Walter CSO set is not as fiery as his brilliant live recording with the London Philharmonic (1947), but most studio recordings, regardless of the conductor, suffer exactly that fate, including the earlier NYPO version (1949, with 1953 version of the last movement). Both this CSO and the earlier NYPO performances include their fair share of marvelous musicmaking notwithstanding. Another remarkable case in point would be the magnificent live performances of the Beethoven Ninth by Otto Klemperer with the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1957 and 1961, both on BBC Testament. These were rivetting, electric performances, far outshining the familiar EMI studio version eventhough the latter was better sounding technically.  The EMI studio versions of the Third, Fifth and Seventh fare better, and are deservedly classics. They are representative of the \\"dignified,\\" unadorned musicmaking for which Klemperer is well known.  Unfortunately, a complete set by Klemperer fitting this standard is not available. Nor is there a complete set by Wilhelm Furtwaengler. We do have available older (and even less satisfying technically) but perhaps the most frenzied versions of the Ninth: by the wartime Berlin Philharmonic in a version often called \\"daemonic,\\" and by the 1951 Bayreuth Festival Orchestra at the inaugural (reopening) of that institution after the war. Like Walter, Furtwaengler came from a German tradition that was hardly restricted by the metronome, as was, say, Toscannini (to his detriment, in my view). For them both, the conductor made magic with their wands. Tempo management was their main contribution to the experience, and during live performances they took ever greater risks, in later years wider latitude. The results for these particular artists were particularly captivating, and I'm sure will live on into perpetuity. Rather than pick one, serious collectors should consider having them all, but at least one of the Karajan,and the Walter sets (the London Philharmonic performance of the Ninth is available, too, from Music & Arts), the Third, Fifth and Seventh studio versions, and both live versions of the Ninth by Klemperer, and the live Furtwaengler Sevenths and Ninths.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|If you read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, you will agree with me on the fact that this movie sucked. I watched it even though it was painful, and when I got to the end I was completely disappointed with their interpretation of the classic. Keira Knightly failed in portraying Elizabeth as well as many other actors. However, this movie was shorter than the 6 hour A&E version, but I felt as though this movie ruined the true story for those who haven't read the book yet. Huge disappointment.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|\\"Constantine\\" is a movie with one cool premise, and some serious potential. Sadly, I thought much of it was wasted and lost in the final product. While this does not make the movie bad, it certainly left me feeling that it could have offered more.<br /><br />Basically, the story follows Constantine, a coughing, hacking and wheezing demon hunter, (he smokes too much), who is caught up in the cosmic battle between God and Satan when the delicate balance of power is upset. The shadowy agreement, which included no direct influence on humans, gets shattered and Constantine gets caught up in the whole thing.<br /><br />The acting is pretty much the same as anything you would expect from Keannu Reeves, and most of the acting was of the same or similar quality. Peter Stormare's portrayal of Satan was particularly laughable.<br /><br />The somewhat corny ending really did not suit the overall darkness of the movie and seemed to try and salvage something of a feel-good, \\"good triumphs over evil\\" message. I will not mention that ending for those who have not seen it.<br /><br />\\"Constantine\\" was an average movie, but as I said, it could have been so much better. The special effects were excellent and the visual feast was awesome. Beyond that, it barely poked above average. Not something I would consider adding to the collection, but sure worth a few bucks in hiring it.
B000006TRV|5.0|What is there that I could possibly write that hasn't been written before about perhaps one of the greatest concept albums ever? (Genesis' \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" being the other....yes, Genesis actually existed before Phil Collins took over vocals when the genius behind the band, Peter Gabriel, departed...but I digress) The only bon mot I could add is the fact that after all these years, \\"The Wall\\" still succeeds in captivating listeners. I introduced my 6 year old daughter to the cd first, then the movie...she is now a huge fan of not only \\"The Wall\\" but earlier Floyd stuff as well.
6304602944|3.0|\\"Tango and Cash\\" is a predictable, not-to-heavy-on-the-brain actioner that is nothing special, but actually entertains. Kurt Russel and Sylvester Stallone have a good level of on-screen chemistry that works well and provides a lot of the movie's appeal.<br /><br />The plot is your predictable cop actioner: super cops become victims of their own success and their number one crime-boss fan has had enough. Rather than just kill them, he decides on framing them and getting them sent to prison. The rest is fairly predictable.<br /><br />The action is quite good, though again, nothing special. Some of the characters are played pretty much like cardboard cutouts, but that is ok with an action film. As mentioned, the banter that happens between Tango and Cash is one of the main appeals of the movie.<br /><br />At times corny, (Stallone's attempt to act like a caring brother was a bit of a laugh), this film is a good bit of entertainment, though it looks a bit dated. Unsurprisingly, it has not become a classic, but it is still a good movie to watch and enjoy.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|I've been a huge White Stripes fan for the last 5 years and this album didn't dissapoint.  They break some new ground for the band and the ventures into synthesizers and bag-pipes are done well.  Although there are some gems on this album (icky thump, conquest) there are some forgettable songs and it is not as solidly good from top to bottom as some of there recent albums.

0596007124|5.0|This is quite a long book (638 pages) considering that it only covers about 13 design patterns in detail. The original Design Patterns by the 'gang of four' covered about 23 patterns. However the Head First book has some advantages. 1st: It's not nearly as abstract and computer science orientated as the 'gang of 4' book. 2nd: It's written to take account of the fact that these design patterns are not common sense - they are not intuitive. So the authors use quite a lot of diagrams, various cute 'Head First' learning strategies, reinforced examples and practical exercises.  3rd: The Head First books also explains some of the principles of OOD (and they do this as they explain why the patterns are that way) which is something I didn't find in the other C# 'Design Patterns' book I got which covered all the origninal 'gang of 4' patterns [the other book is 'Design Patterns', publ. 2007, ISBN: 1598220314 by C. Lasater]. So the Head First book is recommended. The Head First examples are in java but java is very close to C# and someone has converted all the code to C# anyway which you can get by following the link at the book code download page [...] A note on this Head First C# code. It's written for dot net 1.1 and assumes you will use NUnit to run it. NUnit is a free download but although I could install NUnit 2.41 and convert the C# code to dot net 2.0 I couldn't figure out how to get it to work with NUnit. This is probably because I've not used NUnit previously!. I'm having to convert each pattern to to a console application and write a main() to test it. That is only a small amount of work.
0316067598|5.0|A great account of what it takes to become Navy Seal and what Heroes are made of.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I have liked Kelly Clarkson since I voted for her on the first season of American Idol. Kelly has a voice with a wonderful raspy tone, unbelievable range, and excellent control. Those skills were evident on American Idol when she sang the show-stopping high note during \\"Natural Woman\\", along with the jazzy rendition of the 1940's song, \\"Stuff like that there.\\"     After the competition finished, I thought Kelly's strength was going to be Celine Dion type ballads, inter-spearsed with Mariah Carey style emotion. I was wrong. Kelly's first disc, Thankful (which I liked) had a distinct R&B flavor to it. Some of the songs had a bit of a rock edge, but nothing that would blow out the windows of the car. The next disc, \\"Breakaway\\" (which I loved) was definitely that, a breakaway from anything before it, and dispelled any confusion as to where Kelly's heart was, and the type music that she preferred. I would classify the music on Breakaway as being in the soft-rock caliber, because I do not think Kelly would be on the same level with and perform along side The Rolling Stones. She is more in the genre of Avril Levine and Annie Lennox.    So, here we are to the latest disk, \\"My December.\\" The primary issue I have with this cd is, I AM CONFUSED. The material, the genres of music on the disc, the production values, everything has left me scratching my head with wonder. One of the songs, Irvine, which starts out as a cry for help, was wonderful, then 3 minutes into the song, there was an unexplainable silence for 30-60 seconds, and then a completely different song started. I have absolutely no idea of what that was about. The song started out great, and the latter part of Irvine completely ruined it. Instead of Kelly being angry, I was actually angry and disappointed by that song. What a shame! But maybe if Kelly was angry while writing, producing and performing on this cd, then maybe she actually accomplished what she was trying to do, which was to make us the fans \\"feel her pain.\\" The problem with that, however, is I have enough of my own pain in my life. I do not want to and need to experience the pain of someone else.    Anyway, some of the other songs on My December (Sober, Be Still and Maybe) were very good. In fact, my favorite song on the disk is Be Still. After I heard those 3 songs, I thought Kelly was going to make a retrospective album, because the songs were internal-reflective and thought provoking. If Kelly would have made an entire album of material like that, I would have enjoyed the concept emmensely. Unfortunately, Kelly interspursed other ANGRY songs into the album that I am sure put the look of pure shock and disapointment onto my face.     I would like to make an additional point... I am not bashing Kelly's writing skills like so many other people have done. Actually, I think Kelly did a pretty good job in the composition aspect. My issue has to do with mixing the genres of music.    Look, I have purchased all of Kelly's albums, and I will continue to do so. I just wish she would have given more thought to how her fans were going to perceive this album. If Kelly wanted to write some songs to cleanse herself of some recent demons, then that is fine, but it should not have been presented in such a confusing manner to the fans. It is almost un-nerving to be listening to this ambum with a beautiful ballad like Be Still, and all of sudden you are blasted out with such anger like Never Again, Hole and Don't Waste Your Time.     I think Kelly is sooo talented, and some of the material that she records is so beneath her. In other words, her voice gets buried in the guitars and drums, and you cannot even enjoy the quality of her sound anymore. I wish she would return to ballads where her voice could shine, and she could take her place among the great voices of our time, Celine, Whitney, Mariah, Christina and Kelly. I also believe that Kelly could be the hard-to-find Triple Threat. Which means she could perform in movies, on Broadway, and continue to record cd's. Look, a previous rock star like Rod Stewart starting performing classics, because he came to realize how wonderful the classics are. I hope Kelly gets to a place where she accepts her beautiful voice, and stops trying to be something different than what she is. She does not need to screach and scream, because she is the real deal. Most rock stars do not have the pipes that Kelly has.     Maybe Kelly will soften with time. I sure hope so.
B00005JPHT|5.0|Sicko makes Michael Moore's first four films seem trival.  Those films all dealt with atrocities in America by Big Business, Guns, and the War in Iraq.  Sicko takes on the poorly run American Health Care System but the message here is much more than just about health care.  This film really is about how the government treats its people and how citizens treat each other.<br /><br />This is a non partisan film and should be seen as such.  There is no Bush bashing here except a cameo that seemed out of place.  Hillary Clinton is praised then scorned and many members of congress are singled out briefly as having been paid by insurance and/or pharmaceautical companys. But it never comes across biased as in Fahrenheit 9/11 so even the right wingers should see this movie.<br /><br />Sicko explores four very different countries approach on health care and in a broader sense life in general and how they treat each other.  I was amazed at the degree of caring in the doctors in Cuba and England.  I had never seen doctors in the US genuinly care as much as they did in Cuba where underinsured Americans were treated for free and sold medecine at five cents a pop.  In London an American was treated for an injury while fooling around at the famous Abbey Road street crossing.  He was sold medecine for about ten dollars.  In Canada people are buying insurance to go into the US to visit relatives across the river.  And in France everyone is living like kings.  Go See This Movie!

B000ETDVZI|5.0|\\"Kill Bill\\" was either a disaster-in-the-making or a one of a kind hit -- a sprawling revenge flick that had to be cut in two and released separately. But director Quentin Tarantino serves up entertainingly mindless gore and twisted thrills in \\"Kill Bill Volume 1,\\" a salute to homages.<br /><br />Tragedy strikes the Bride (Uma Thurman) on her wedding day: The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS) attacks and slaughters the guests, the groom, and wounds the very pregnant Bride herself. Her former boss/lover Bill (David Carradine) finishes the bloodbath by shooting the Bride in the head. But despite his efforts, she isn't dead.<br /><br />A few years later, the Bride wakes to find that she has been in a coma for a few years, and has been being used as a sex toy for rent. After recovering enough to move, the Bride gets a sword sharp enough to \\"cut God,\\" and goes on a revenge spree against the people who wrecked her life and killed her baby, including Cottonmouth (Vivica A. Fox) and the deadly O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).<br /><br />Don't expect cinematic art in \\"Kill Bill Volume 1.\\" If anything, this is cinematic pop art, a loving tribute to cheesy martial-arts flicks and westerns. Tarantino even inserts a stretch of anime detailing O-Ren's background. It's pure Tarantino, untainted by typical directing methods and immensely entertaining if you switch off your critical faculties, refrain from asking \\"How the heck could that happen?\\"<br /><br />\\"Kill Bill\\" isn't for the weak of stomach; over 450 gallons of fake blood are used in both movies. But the blood usage is more \\"Monty Python\\" than \\"Braveheart\\"; it's so over-the-top that it's silly and sick rather than disturbing. So is the violence -- hacking dozens of people down without getting so much as a scrape is impossible, but it's sure fun to watch.<br /><br />Tarantino throws out more one-liners than just about any other filmmaker around. The absurd \\"Trix is for kids\\" line aside, there are a number of great lines like \\"Those of you lucky enough to have your lives take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now.\\" The script teems with impossibilities, but they seem plausible enough in this alternate reality that Tarantino has cooked up. Call it Tarantinoland.<br /><br />Uma Thurman, with her yellow tracksuit and katana, rules the screen as the Bride. Despite the Bride cutting down people by the dozen, it's impossible not to appreciate her. And the best supporting performances come from Liu as the ruthless O-Ren, Carradine in a brief but intense appearance, and the wonderful, underrated Chiaki Kuriyama as evil schoolgirl Go-Go Yubari.<br /><br />It's silly, it's creepy, it's gaudy, and somehow it's vastly entertaining. Tarantino's special triumph in \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" is to somehow rope his vast store of movie homages into a gory, action-packed storyline, and one that is, at the very least, hard to forget.hose of you lucky enough to have your lives take them with you.

0385486804|5.0|Jon Krakauer depicts this twenty-something adventurer with keen understanding and compassion. Chris McCandless is a stubborn and idealistic youth who gets in over his head when he spends a summer in the wilds of Alaska without a boy scout manual or a map. Many have judged him harshly, stating that he showed no respect for the land. Indeed, his reckless actions certainly warrant questioning. In the end, I think this \\"kid\\" (he was 24 at the time of his death), probably needed treatment for bi-polar disorder or a similar mental health problem. He engaged in high risk behavior to the point of death, all the while contemplating on the writings of Thoreau. Kudos to Krakauer for not getting caught up in the judgment that the reader feels; for staying objective in his presentation of this odd young man. As always, the author's descriptions of the wild and his own adventures in the wild are a true pleasure to read. Hurry up and write another book, Jon!
B000B19BCG|5.0|Another solid album from the most consistant band of the last ten years.  Supergrass doesn't disappoint on this departure from earlier work.  This is the darker Supergrass a more adult band.  They're not the teenagers that got caught by the fuzz anymore but they can still rock as much as any other band still together.  You know its them and you know they're evolving and moving in a new direction but hey aren't we all?  I'm just glad to be along for the ride and listen to some awesome music.
1594489505|5.0|Having read The Kite Runner, I didn't know what to expect from this second book; sometimes the second is not as good as expected.  I was not dismayed.  a Thousand Splendid Suns was a much greater book than the first, more riveting, more dynamic, truer to the present time.  It is a MUST READ!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This CD was such a great purchase. I'd heard \\"Everything\\" on the radio but didn't know who sang it and was asking everyone I knew if they knew the song. Luckily, I heard it on the radio again a few days later and I'd ordered it before the song had finished as I loved it so much. Even though I bought the CD for just one song, the rest of it is so great also. \\"Lost\\" has such moving lyrics and such a beautiful tune and then there's some great big band numbers.     If you like this genre of music, you'll love this CD.
B00028HBKC|2.0|This is a profoundly disturbing film. It is beautifully set and filmed, and very well acted. The  Aramaic dialogue lent authenticity and beauty to the scenes. I, personally, did not find the film to convey a message of anti-Semitism.     So, why only two stars? Partly because I'm a stickler for a well-written script, and this film not only didn't have one, it hardly required one. But mostly because, though I am not a believer, I have respect for the story, and a desire to see it told well. Gibson's peculiar obsession with violence overwhelms it. Pelikan's Jesus Through the Centuries points out that, while we think of Jesus as being a challenge to dominant cultures, the portrayals of him are often a reflection and an endorsement of the dominant culture. So, in our extravagantly, pornographically violent times, Gibson produces a movie that extracts the most violent 24 hours of Jesus' life and makes it stand in place of the whole story. In an age of religiously-inspired violence, it is a tragic decision for a director to make.    Gibson presumes that everyone knows Jesus and is sympathetic toward him. While that may be mostly true, it also lets Gibson off easy, absolving him of the director's difficult role in a tragedy: make the audience care for the characters, tell the audience why these characters are worthy. Instead, he involves us in an orgy of gore, reveling in the blood spilled, and raising the awkward question: If this is the whole purpose of Jesus' life, then what are we to think of the \\"villains\\", Judas and Pilate, et al, who brought about that which must be done?     But Gibson as storyteller/evangelist is not interested in conundrums. I think he wants to make us feel good about feeling so bad. And he fails, at least in my case. I want to be ennobled by this story, as by stories of other selfless teachers who fell to the authorities of their times. I was appalled by the parents who had taken their children to see it. It is, hands down, one of the most graphically violent movies you will ever see, and parents should exercise the same caution with this film as they would with any other portrayal of a death by torture.     I knew that it was violent, and graphic, when I went to see it. What I hoped for was that Gibson would try to convey a sense of solidarity between Jesus and others who have been murdered, tortured, or persecuted. That sense was entirely missing. If he had run the quotation - \\"Whatsoever you do to the least of these, you do unto me\\" - toward the end, all of the violence might have been somewhat redeemed by urging us to treat others with the same pathos Gibson wants to evoke in us for Christ. Instead, he gives the resurrection a bare moment at the end, accompanied by military marching music, as if Jesus came back to kick some serious [...] in retribution. I found the film, and its violence, utterly lacking in redemptive value. There is no grace here. I am not surprised that Gibson followed it up with yet another portrayal of human sacrifice, since that is what he reduced this grand story to: a mere barbaric bloodletting.
B000QFCD5O|5.0|I was a bit more than pleasantly surprised upon my first listen of this fantastic album. Meticulous in every respect, you'd be hard pressed to find four musicians that top these gentlemen. I love their rendition of \\"video killed the radio star\\". And truly the finest rendition of \\"the smile has left your eyes\\" they've done to date. I too consider John Wetton one of the finest vocalists on earth. And Steve Howe's guitar and mandolin playing never sounded better.<br /><br /> The press and public did them \\"dirty\\" a few decades ago, but Asia has staying power and excellent material to see them through. I'm ecstatic that they're back again. I met John Wetton in May 1996. You won't find a finer gent anywhere. And his guitar and bass playing coupled with Downes and Palmer move like a well-oiled music machine. Great album (er`oops CD). Buy it and ride easy.
B00005JPHT|5.0|Michael Moore tells us right away that this movie is not about the almost fifty million Americans who have no health coverage (18,000 of whom will die this year because they have no coverage) but the rest of us who have some type of health insurance. The stories he selects to tell will break your heart and depress you beyond measure. One patient has to select which tip of two fingers he will have re-attached after an accident. Another is turned down coverage for an ambulance bill to the hospital after a car accident because she did not get prior approval from the insurance company. (Never mind that she was unconscious because of the accident) Another couple had to move into a room in the basement of their child's house beause they could not afford co-pays from two serious illnesses, cancer and several heart attacks. A mother got to see her young child die because the hospital she took the gravely ill child to did not accept her health insurance. Another patient died from cancer because his health provider assessed a necessary bone marrow transplant as experimental. The disgusting list continues.<br /><br />Moore visits Canada, Great Britain and France to see the health plans in these countries that provide treatment at no cost to the patient as well as a controversial visit to Cuba. There is a touching scene where rescue workers from 9/11 visit Cuban firefighters and get much better treatment than they received in their own country.<br /><br />Is Moore always objective? Probably not. After all, he has a point to make. On the other hand, to my knowledge, no critic has yet come forward to accuse any of the people who tell their sad stories of lying on camera.<br /><br />There is enough blame to go around: the AMA, members of congress and the man now occupying the White House-- he makes only three brief appearances and at one time congratulates an American worker for holding down three jobs, telling her, \\"only in America.\\" Of course her counterpart in France would have free health insurance, a 35-hour-a-week job and a month off a year for vacation. Let us not forget the drug companies, and finally, we the American taxpayers, who put up with such an unfair system.<br /><br />Most of us have our own bad experience with insurance companies, but we hope not as bad as the stories that these partipants in \\"Sicko\\" relate. It seems obvious that universal free health insurance is something that most of us will never live to see, a sad commentary on this the greatest nation on earth.a 35-hour-a-week job and a month off a year for vacation.

B00006LLLN|5.0|I'm late to the game and just discovered Alision and Union Station when my husband dragged me to a concert.  I LOVE them !  This CD is great, it's now my new favorite.  You'll enjoy it
0143038419|2.0|I can't imagine what this woman would do if she ever had something  truly bad happen to her.  A divorce?   A failed affair?  Oh, please.   I concur with the reviewers who object to her whiny self-absorption.   This was recommended to me by a person who is REALLY in a horrible divorce and she loved it, but I find it tedious.    There are so many people who are brave in the face of real tragedy, I just want to say to this person, \\"Suck it up.\\"      She is a pretty good writer, nice imagery, when she is not busy looking in the existential mirror that is her life.
B000P0J024|5.0|This is a one of a kind CD.  These incredible musicians got together and had a very good time.  The result is a beautiful collection of the kind of music that brought all of them fame.  I will treasure this CD.
079284131X|5.0|I really love this movie! It gives me a chill every time I watch it, even after all these years. Chucky is a vicious killer, without the sense of humor he displays in the sequals. I feel terrible for the mother and can't imagine what I'd do in her prediciment. This movie is excellent, and if you've watched the comedy/horror sequals first, do yourself a favor and forget them as you turn off the lights and watch Child's Play.
B000OPOANE|5.0|Haven't played the music tracks through my 5.1 surround yet as I mainly bought it for the studio documentary. This was great and well worth it for the Rush Fan although I wouldn't have minded if it was an hour or so longer - maybe next time! A definite buy for any Rush fan.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I have to take a bit of exception to all the negative reviews that has been given to this album.    It seems that the purpose and context of this Album has been lost on more than a couple of people, mainly those calling for a \\"remix\\" or complaining about the \\"sound quality\\".    Historically, Rush live albums have been highly polished affairs, known for their musical perfection, thanks to the magic of post production cleanup.  In fact, Exit Stage Left does not have much of a live feel as the entire album feels like a studio album with applause scotch taped to the beginning and end of each song to give it a \\"live vibe\\"    And as a result, this is what we've come to expect from \\"The Three Stooges\\".  Studio and Live albums that are mixed and played with perfection, but lacking, sometimes in soul.      Talking Heads, Stop Making Sense, is arguably one of the best live concert movies ever produced precisely because if feels less like a movie and more like a concert.  When I first saw it in a Movie Theatre, the entire auditorium treated it as a live event, with dancing in the aisles, and lighting of bic lighters (much to the dismay of the theatre manager).  However it's resulting CD suffered because of the perfect nature of its recording and mix.  The \\"I was there\\" aspect did not translate well from \\"movie\\" to \\"CD\\"    The same, thankfully, does not hold true for Rush In Rio.  Due partly to weather conditions beyond the band's control, and partly due to a conscious decision made on the part of the band, Rush In Rio, feels more like being at a live concert than any album I have heard to date.    The energy and enthusiasm of 40000 rabid Rush fans is truly captured, and it is evident that the \\"Boys\\" fed off the energy of the evening.  What you hear, is something that Rush has not been noted for:  Emotion.     Emotion, in the fact that this may have been farewell show for the band (thankfully not).  Emotion, in the fact that Neil Peart, having overcome great tragedy, reunites with the band and plays his heart out.  Emotion, that the band is overwhelmed by the love of the fans that they received on their first ever trip to Brazil.    Rush In Rio, therefore, is not just an album, but a gift back.  A gift back to all those rabid fans that experienced a once in a lifetime concert in the torrential tropical rain.  A gift to all Rush fans who have stayed true to this band throughout it's 30+ years of performing.   And a gift to themselves: a souvenir of a truly special night, never again to be repeated.  A slice of life, to cherish and hold on to.    Those who prefer the more glossy live stuff can find nearly the entire setlist on Rush's other albums (All The Worlds A Stage, Exit Stage Left, A Show Of Hands, Different Stages, and the R30 album).      However, for those who wish to have an experience of a single night, with all it's emotion, humanity, and yes even the occasional drowning out by the enormous crowd, this album is for you.     Rush has given us, in Rush In Rio, what few bands have the guts to do.  They give us a complete document of one special night, a true concert \\"on the go\\" for us to enjoy time and time again, anywhere we please.    For those who wish to have their live music sanitized for their protection, I offer you this advice (My apologies to \\"The Stooges\\")    \\"You can choose to berry pick your live tracks from I-Tunes...I will choose the path that's clear, I will choose RIO\\".
0761944524|5.0|This is one of the best statistics and SPSS guidebooks that I have seen. I believe that it can be very useful for novice to expert. It is both technical and conceptual and can function as a textbook for statistics as well as an operational handbook for navigating through SPSS. Although it is based on SPSS 13.0, I have found it to be quite applicable to the SPSS version 15.0 that I am using. This book is an invaluable source for the completion of my doctoral dissertation and I would highly recommend it for the student or advanced statistician! B.

093183841X|5.0|Anyone who is seriously interested in collecting antique cameras must have a copy of this Guide. It is indispensible to the auction arena, and particularly to EBay auction participation. The EBay camera world is frought with dangers and pitfalls when it comes to bidding and purchasing. It is important to know at least some fundamental levels of worth, and this book can provide you with this information. However, this \\"new\\" edition contains information that is at least 3-4 years old. So it is important to use judgement when bidding. Some camera prices have increased, but others have fallen over ranges given by the current Guide.  Another value of this book resides in the short histories it provides of the most important photographic manufacturers, such as Zeiss Ikon, Ihagee, Leica, and Kodak. Byond this, it is simply a great pleasure to leaf through at leisure all of the pictures of the multiplicity of cameras that have been produced over the last 150 years.
B000M3452Y|4.0|James Murphy, the one-man band behind LCD Soundsystem, toiled for most of the 90's in obscure underground rock bands before sliding into his role as a producer/remixer. I have to admit I passed up LCD's debut album a few years back, in spite of considerable buzz. I loved the title of the single \\"Daft Punk is Playing at My House,\\" but found the actual song to be a repetitive one-joke dance track. I had been hoping for something more creative, similar to, well, Daft Punk's best work. After hearing Sound of Silver, I'm thinking there may be something more to Murphy's sprawling 2-disc first album than I gave him credit for at the time.    Sound of Silver is one of the bounciest, most exciting albums I've heard this year. LCD Soundsystem often gets labeled as dance-punk, but there isn't a lot of punk rock in their sound. It's more accurate to say that Murphy brings an aggressive, punk rock attitude and a certain griminess to his rock-tinged dance music. The album has an impressive variety of sound, from the opening electronics of \\"Get Innocuous\\" to the drum-fueled shouting of \\"Watch the Tapes\\" to the lounge ballad closer \\"New York I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down.\\" Lead single \\"North American Scum\\" is crazy catchy, with a pulsing electronic bass and jagged guitar line accompanying Murphy's very funny lyrics about the European and American club scenes.    The album does drag in places, mostly due to the fact that it's still dance music at heart. So there are a couple of songs that go over the 7-minute mark without doing anything interesting. \\"Get Innocuous\\" suffers from this, as does the title track. \\"Sound of Silver\\" actually has pretty funny lyrics, but there's only 4 lines in the song, and they're repeated ad nauseum. On the other hand, \\"Us vs. Them\\" nudges into this territory without bogging down, due to its high-energy vocals. \\"All My Friends\\" is the longest song on the album, but it's also the best. It has another one of Murphy's irresistible hooks; a great series of piano riffs that propel the song for nearly 8 minutes. \\"All My Friends\\" also benefits from Murphy actually singing- he tends to sort of shout his way through most of the songs, but he makes the right call by opening up and using his singing voice here. \\"New York I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down\\" also is clearly better for Murphy's singing. It's basically a torch song, and the broken-hearted croon he affects makes the song work as he sings about New York City's tourist-friendly 90's whitewash tearing out the heart and soul from the city.    At a lean 9 songs, Sound of Silver doesn't overstay its welcome, and even the longer dance tracks don't slow the proceedings down too much. This album is unique and fun, and musically very clever, and it's one of my favorites of the year so far
6304467540|5.0|All these reviews refer to the DVD. The product details say VHS. The reviews are not dealing with the correct product line. I don't know if this is the fault of Amazon putting them in the wrong place, or reviewers just not paying attention. I wanted to read what people said about the VHS version, but alas no luck!!Viewers should know there is the Godfather DVD Collection (the 3 movies plus extras), The Godfather Trilogy(the 3 movies in chronological order including deleted scenes from the movies), and the Godfather Epic(the first 2 Godfather films in chronological order including deleted scenes from the films). Unfortunately, the latter 2 are only available on VHS. Let's hope they're released on DVD soon because they are fantastic!
B000P0J024|5.0|Don't listen to the hype or to the critics. When you look at Rock's recorded history (sorry 'bout that) the  names behind the Wilburys didn't produce a lot of bad music. What they produced was frequently the best of the moment and every once in a while, they gave us nearly timeless music. And both of the albums in this 3 disk set give us that gift: a place and images in time and something timeless. Watch the train riding video and imagine Roy in that rocking chair. Whatever other deficiencies there are on the DVD, and there are some: spotty sound, jumpy shots and cuts, and no few almost corny 80's touches, it is worth the journey to get on that train.<br /><br />Yea, everyone says album 1 is the best with Roy Orbison and that may be true but number three (two) is so close I think it is a wash. I grew with three of these guys. They grew up with me. Two came along later and belonged to the group regardless of age. It was and is the music that binds them together. It is the music that was the heart of a friendship. It was never about fame or their names or what could have been and were in other places and times, colossal ego clashes. When the Wilburys gathered, it was all about the music. Thank God.<br /><br />Listen. Watch. Enjoy. It's not perfect but that's a tough label to get. The Traveling Wilburys set is close enough for me.
1594489505|5.0|What an incredible story.  The writing is so descriptive, you can actually experience what the characters are experiencing at the same time.  I absolutely loved Kite Runner, so I was very excited to jump in to another of Khaled Hussein's books.  His books have opened my eyes to the horrors in Afghanistan, especially the way females are viewed as \\"disposable\\".
B000E41MS6|5.0|My husband is an ardent fan of the Dr. Who series and has been since he was a child.  So when the new series came to DVD I bought it for his birthday.  The newest version of Dr. Who is fast-paced, rock-licking fun, and full of the old enemies to keep the flavor of the old series in tact and brings forth new ones that titillate the palate to come back week after week to watch it.  The DVD may be a bit costly, but it is worth the price of admission, to soar back and forth in time and space.  Bring along your sonic screwdrivers, my fellow fans, it's going to be one hell of a great ride!
B000000OXH|3.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Asia marked an era of melodical new style of arena rock with their debut self-titled album, being the first supergroup of the 80's, but after the success of the debut, they tryed to keep up with the fame but just couldn't get along with this album.<br /><br />Alpha is a very nice album to hear, having great mellodies and beautiful escapist sounds that should be enjoyable for any fan or casual listeners, showing their habilities and experience of past bands, but the album retains a great lack of originality and complexity, they seemed to be blinded by their mainstream success and got lazy on this album; not a total failure, still. The music composition and the lyrics are a lot inferior, some lyrics even seem to be incoherent or ridiculous such as The Smile Has Left Your Eyes and I'll Do What I Want. Certainly the best tracks among the album are Don't Cry, which keeps a lot of originality, and The Last To Know, which is the tracks that has the most beautiful mellodies in the whole album. The two most famous songs in the album are Don't Cry and The Smile Has Left Your Eyes.<br /><br />Among the artists its to notice that Downes' keyboards dominate the whole record to the point of leaving behind all the other instruments. Wetton's voice is always nice to hear but he didn't make any vocal effort or stunning choruses. Howe's guitar is nice to hear but it appear only eventually in certain parts of the songs to add a little touch of power ballad and not leaving the music in simple synthpop. Palmer's battery is played in a very delicate but rythmical way. Downes and Palmer are the ones who dominate the album.<br /><br />In conclussion Asia gave a nice try within mellodies and electronical but sweet sounds but within that they got lazy; still I recomend it to any fan or casual listeners, the album leaves a good impression of the band.

Being that I'm from that \\"era\\", it's just wonderful to hear Roy & George again, along with the others -- Petty, Dylan, & Lynne.  The music is so fun to listen to & timeless!!!  You'll not be sorry buying this amazing CD set!
B000OCXMAE|2.0|You have to give it to Linkin Park. As easy as it can be to make fun of their dramaticism and over-emphasized angst, they made two albums that I can still have fun listening to even today as the twenty-something that they allegedly wrote Minutes To Midnight for.    However, I'm just not sure what my problem is as their 2007 listener. Yes, it's more mature, less breakdowns, more themes that deal with life today and not life back when I was 15 (maybe with the exception of \\"tell me what the f*** is wrong with me!\\" - the clean-mouthed cds were much more creative in their self-expression). The songs were catchy in places but did not pack the energy of the old stuff. They seem to be paying tribute to all the bands that the twenty-somethings listen to and respect, but they can't really hold a candle to these bands in their musicianship nor in their songwriting. You may come to see that all the distortion may have covered some weaknesses on their part.    \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" was a pleasant listen the first time through, as was \\"Valentine's Day.\\" The two \\"heavy\\" songs on the album (yes, just two) I mildly enjoy but they just seem like a different band. Though not overly impressed with \\"the radio song\\" at first, \\"What I've Done\\" has been one that I actually cling to now because it feels like a natural song for them to write.    It could be my fault...maybe I'm realizing too late that they were always a little cheesier than the rest, and it's just nostalgia that keeps the first two records spinning. It's a noble thought, but other bands have been much more successful in developing their sound and not losing the elements of that sound that made them great in the first place. I don't see this record making any lasting impact. MtM feels like a former great going through an identity crisis.
B000000OMB|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Four men; John Wetton (King Crimson, Family, Uriah Heep, etc) Steve Howe (Yes), Carl Palmer (Emerson, Lake and Palmer) and Geoffrey Downes (The Buggles) made an historical supergroup that enjoyed years of fame and credit, but this album is frozen in time as the greatest example of experience, originality and explosive material.<br />I am a huge fan of Wetton wich I listened first with Asia and eventually with King Crimson, he became one of my favorite vocalists, Howe was a little unknown to me since I didn't like Yes at first and Downes and Palmer were unknown to me. Later I heard a lot of their past collaborations and I was convinced; this is a band to admire.<br /><br />This debut album was a stunning hit back in the 80's, making famous classics like Heat Of The Moment and Sole Survivor, but not only fame is on their side, also a lot of musical credit; The sound is completely original, juvenile, soft, potent and with a certain level of complexity. This is obviously their best album ever made, at least in the Wetton's era, and is simply beautiful for anyone who has heard Asia in other moments and perfect for casual listeners because is so comprehensible and accessible to their later moods. It contains original classics like Heat Of The Moment and Sole Survivor, beautifuly written and synthesized songs like Time Again, Here Comes The Feeling, Only Time Will Tell, One Step Closer and Cutting It Fine, and fearfully potent tracks like Wildest Dreams and Without You.<br /><br />Wetton's voice is incredibly potent and firm, applying stunning vocal ranges among certain songs and excellent choruses among the tracks, Howe's guitar can be heard perfectly and is in their best performance, Downes' keyboards are applyed moderated and with intelligence, not leaving behind other instruments, and Palmer's battery is also performed very touchy and delicate but very firm. Asia made their best effort with this album having each member equal control, one thing lost in later albums.<br /><br />Well, in conclussion the album is amazing and should be amazing for anyone, well structured, incredibly performed and each track is unique and well thought, my strong recomendations.Well, in conclussion the album is amazing and should be amazing for anyone, well structured, incredibly performed and each track is unique and well thought, my strong recomendations.
1897299214|4.0|This is an excellent book that I recommend along with Delisle's similar work, \\"Shenzhen\\", which covers his experiences working in the Chinese city. \\"Pyongyang\\" is marginally the more intriguing book because he is writing about (and drawing) a stranger place, but the two are fascinating to read together. I do wonder, though, why these are referred to as graphic novels. Novels are by definition works of fiction while these are quite clearly intended as factual accounts of his real life experiences. Pepys's diary is not a novel, for example, and the myriad of political and sports memoirs littering the shelves are not considered novels, I don't understand why books like Delisle's are any different. As the cover of \\"Shenzhen\\" says it's a \\"travelogue\\", or a graphic journal if you like, it ain't a novel. But whatever you call it, I recommend it.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Of course,if you want to get technical,it is the re-union of Billy and Jimmy.<br />Nonetheless,it is a good rock album from beginning to end,but nothing ground-breaking .With the patented Corgan tracks.Slower and faster tunes.Starting off with Doomsday Clock,a real good rocker.Than the slower,but real good,That's The way(My Love Is).Also the great Tarantula,fast paced and furious.Neverlost,(Come On )Let's Go!! and For God & Country round out the standouts on the album.It is a rich rock record and surely marks the return of Corgans Smashing Pumpkins.Go out and buy it,if you haven't.You will like,as it takes the sounds of older Pumpkins and incorporates it into Zeitgeist...A sweet return,,A solid 4.5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1594489505|5.0|This book was so breath-taking and wonderful. I couldn't put it down. It moved me like hardly any other book ever has. I cried, I laughed and sometimes I just had to hold the book close to myself and just breath because he writes so beautifully. I suggest that anyone who knows how to read should read this.
0316067598|5.0|I've been reading most books about Afghanistan and the hunt for Al Quieda and the Taliban as they come out.  This by far was the best read.  A remarkable account of bravery, professionalism, training, and the will to never quit, even when shot several times.  This nation needs to never forget these Seal's courage.  Spielberg and Hanks need to do an epic movie about this...  And I'm Army not Navy.
B000KQGX1Y|4.0|This is a great album if you like CW.  You will not find typically[traditional] Irish music; but it can be compared to a Las Vegas show.  There are some great easy-listening songs, with an upbeat twist. These  ladies do a great job harmonizing.
