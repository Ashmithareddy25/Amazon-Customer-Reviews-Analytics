0316168815|4.0|What a fascinating story.  This book is both heartbreaking and heartwarming.  It is incredible to hear a story from what a dead girl is thinking of while she watches her family from above.<br /><br />The family goes through many struggles after their daughters death and this book beautifully and eloquently takes you through all the trials and tribulations that this family ends up facing.<br /><br />Another fascinating part of the book is that Susie follows her killer and watches over him as well.  The girl is totally at peace with what has happened to her little body and what has become of her.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|The 2005 release of the woman who has already conquered the world is a good example of re-invention and although this is not her finest album she recovered the popularity that seemed lost with her previous album \\"American Life\\". With catchy tunes Madonna makes you wanna sing & dance since the first time you listen the beginning of the opening track: \\"Hung Up\\". A must-have album for those ones who think music should be simply enjoyable... <br />The bonus track \\"Fighting Spirit\\" shouldn't have been left out of the regular edition, it sounds like the lost track of the \\"American Life\\", re-worked to fit the album, another great track for the b-side fans! Photos on the book are just awesome!

B000F6IOC0|5.0|For those who liked the first Underworld movie, this follow-up is a must and sure to please. I can't over-emphasize enough the need to see the first movie in order to understand and enjoy the second. If you have never seen the first Underworld or it has been a while, then watch it before viewing Evolution. I believe that the negative reviews, by and large, are due to not viewing or not understanding the original Underworld. Also, keep in mind that the Underworld series is not for the lazy-minded. Amidst all the action (and there is plenty) is a well-thought and fairly complex narrative. Your attention, however, will be greatly rewarded.
B000GI3KHQ|2.0|This is a fine movie, but greatly overpriced for a final product on DVD.  To be honest, when I looked at the playing side of the disc, I thought I had purchased a bootleg, a pirated copy of the original DVD release.  Judging from the comments of other purchasers, however, I see that that isn't the case.  If you must have this DVD, I recommend purchasing it from one of the dealers on Amazon who will sell it to you for less.  Considering the poor picture quality and lack of extras, the disc is really worth around $10 or less, as far as I'm concerned.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Silent Hill is a movie based on a video game.<br /><br />Still reading? Good, because you will be pleasantly surprised to learn that, unlike every other video game-based movie ever made, this is a great film!  And it's a great film that fans of the game can enjoy as well as moviegoers who never heard of the game (or who have been offended by the drek that usually comes to the theaters in the guise of video game movies).<br /><br />Silent Hill is a ghost town that was abandoned in the seventies because of an underground coal fire and now haunts the nightmares of a little girl. In an attempt to help her adoptive daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), Rose (Radha Mitchell) takes her to Silent Hill and enters a nightmare-like alternate reality. Going any further into the plot would spoil the surprises in this film and the surprises are part of the fun.<br /><br />The creatures that inhabit this alternate Silent Hill are very disturbing and nightmarish and they move in a very fluid way that is both familiar and strange at the same time. Seeing them in action (and, unlike most horror films, in full lighting) causes an almost immediate flight or fight reaction until the rational side of your brain remembers that it's only a movie.<br /><br />Also on the plus side is the music of Silent Hill. Very creepy, very fitting, and, very good; at least half of the reason this film works so well is because the music and sound effects do so well in conveying the sense that something is moving just beyond your vision.<br /><br />There is a downside to the film and it occurs almost dead center in the film. The beginning and ending of the movie is rife with psychological-based horror, and creatures dredged up from the depths of nightmares. But the middle is where we get an explanation for what's going on and it's a jarring change of pace that, thankfully, doesn't last too long.<br /><br />But the rest of the film makes up for that one pacing stutter and the entire film comes together in a great conclusion that may or may not hint at a sequel.<br /><br />Silent Hill also accomplished two very important things; it proves that a video game can be successfully translated into a great film, and it restored my faith in the horror genre' by giving me real chills without resorting to cheap tricks.<br /><br />A must see!together in a great conclusion that may or may not hint at a sequel. <br /> <br />Silent Hill also accomplished two very important things; it proves that a video game can be successfully translated into a great film, and it restored my faith in the horror genre' by giving me real chills without resorting to cheap tricks. <br /> <br />A must see!

B000DN6ZGC|4.0|Very refreshing, if for not reason other than it passes my new conditional criteria - not rap! Hey, I started listening to rap with Grand Master Mel and the Furious Five - Sugar Hill Gang stuff and LOVED it but that was maybe 18 years ago. Since then, music lovers have been robbed and raped by a bunch of shXt.  She kinda reminds me of Jazzyfatnasty (with a touch of Erica Badu).  Soulful gal.
B0001AP158|5.0|The subtitle for this DVD should be \\"Leave your preconceptions at the door\\", because if you`re prone to putting Bon Jovi into the box of \\"metal/scream-yourself-silly/stadium rock ONLY\\" bands of \\"when I was a kid in the 80s\\" time, you`re sure to be disappointed with this DVD, as they have slowed down their anthemic hits to jazzy/bluesy rhythms, turning some of them (e.g., Livin` on a Prayer and It`s My Life) into ballads. I never cared too much about their big hits (though, I sure did like them when they played on MTV or radio) with screeching guitars and near-falsetto singing, so This Left Feels Right was something I approached with somewhat skeptical curiosity - will there be anything left to the songs once you take the noise off? Well, since getting that CD and truly being able to LISTEN and HEAR the song lyrics Bon Jovi music has turned out for me a pleasant surprise. So, I just had to have this DVD and I haven`t been disappointed by it since. In fact, it has turned me into a real fan of the band, which has meant going halfway accross Europe to their \\"Have a Nice Day Tour\\" (and, yes, singing myself silly to their \\"traditional\\" hit arrangements), laying my hands on most of their albums and rediscovering their music all over again. This DVD as well as the TLFR CD comes as close to having the band play an intimate show in your living room as possible. The band`s versatility and ability to change yet retain their distinction is what allows them to survive in this day and age when music is more a PR job than talent. A must-have for an intelligent fan!

Pick it up and see for yourself.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|\\"Time out of Mind\\" and \\"Love and Theft\\" are definitely two of Dylan's best albums in a long, long time.  <br /> <br />As far as I am concerned, you can skip almost everything Dylan did between \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Time out of Mind\\" (1975-1998) except a few tracks and not miss anything worthwhile. For that matter skip most of what he did between \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" (1967-1975). But 1998 was truly the year Dylan reinvented himself again and by 2001 he was taking it to another level. It will be nice to see how well \\"Modern Times\\" stands up to the last 2 albums.

B000GRUMPU|1.0|It's a herculean task to tell this story in only 98 minutes, and the filmakers didn't even come close. It starts out exactly like a cheesy Love Boat episode. I was expecting to see Julie, the cruise director, with clipboard in hand chatting with the lame passengers while Gopher, Dr. Bricker and Isaac chase the bikini clad babes. <br /> <br />The acting was so God awful as were the hokey CGI effects. I was surprised that Wolfgang Petersen would have his hand in this bag of crap after doing a great job with The Perfect Storm. The characters were all losers I couldn't really relate to nor care about. The story jumped around too much to keep my attention.... making me keep checking the clock to see when this cruise will finally end. <br /> <br />The whole plot was completely predictable and un-imaginative. I am so happy I rented this sloppy mess instead of buying it!

B00063EMJ6|5.0|THE BAND: Neil Young (vocals, acoustic & electric guitar, piano) and an assortment of musicians (too many to mention here) over the past 4 decades.<br /><br />THE DISC: (2004) 16 tracks clocking in at just under 77 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page foldout containing song titles/credits, musicians on each track, which songs came from what albums, and the year released. Digitally remastered sound. Label - Reprise Records.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" (3 songs), \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu (1), \\"After The Gold Rush\\" (3), CSNY \\"Atlantic Records Single\\" (1), \\"Harvest\\" (3), \\"American Stars & Bars\\" (1), \\"Comes A Time\\" (1), \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" (1), \\"Freedom\\" (1), \\"Harvest Moon\\" (1).<br /><br />COMMENTS: First let me state that I've never been a hardcore Neil Young fan. I was a casual fan in the 70's and 80's... and still consider myself just that. I had very few of his vinyl albums back in the day (okay... I only had 2 of them - \\"After The Gold Rush\\" and \\"Harvest\\"). But listening to the radio fixed on classic rock, you can't help but get an earful of Young's songs from time to time. Sure, I think he tries to make a few too many political statements, and sure, he's no ladies man... but the man can write a song. I put him on the same lofty perch as the master story-teller Bob Dylan in that respect. Young has certainly stood the test of time... and he's still kicking albums out into his 60's. With that being said, a 2nd Neil Young compilation has been a long time coming since \\"Decade\\" in 1977. While \\"Decade\\" was a 35 track 2-disc set, it only spanned the years from 1969-77. This (2004) \\"Greatest Hits\\" package follows his music from 1969-91. It covers his solo career, days with CSNY, and Crazy Horse. However, it's one disc and only 16 tracks. The standards are here - \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", \\"After The Gold Rush\\", \\"Ohio\\", \\"Old Man\\", \\"Heart Of Gold\\", \\"Hey Hey My My (Into The Black)\\", \\"Southern Man\\", \\"Rockin' In The Free World\\", \\"Down By The River\\", etc. The songs are absolutely first rate. But, you simply can't contain Neil Young's best work on ONE disc. A more current 2-disc, or even 3-disc set is deserving at this point in Neil Young's career. This is a \\"HITS\\" only compilation... no deep album gems or artist favorites. As it states on the back of the jewel case, \\"Greatest Hits inclusion based on original record sales, airplay, and known download history\\". So if a favorite song of yours was never on the radio, and on a weaker album of his... there's no chance the song would be found here. You know what you're getting - the hits and only the hits. If you're a big Neil Young fan with a vast knowledge of his tunes from decades past, you might be disappointed with this disc. You'll find NO songs from many of his albums (i.e. - \\"On The Beach\\", \\"Zuma\\", \\"Unplugged\\", \\"Ragged Glory\\", \\"Neil Young\\" (1969), \\"Live Rust\\", \\"Weld\\", \\"Mirrorball\\", \\"Long May You Run\\", \\"Silver & Gold\\", \\"Trans\\", \\"Broken Arrow\\", \\"Everybody's Rockin'\\", \\"Old Ways\\", etc. However, if you're a casual fan like me, this \\"Greatest Hits\\" package is pretty much perfect (4.5 stars).etc. The songs are absolutely first rate.

B0002XL35G|2.0|This was arguably the longest 2 hours I have spent in my entire life ... it felt like much more ... I found myself more than a little angry with the overkill leadup to what could have been a compelling story.  The punch line took way too long to get to ... and when it came, it just wasn't enough to convince me it was worth the wait.  With each pregnant pause between dialogue (and guitar strings), I was sure I'd be getting up to leave ... I suspect the invested time (hours and hours it seemed) precluded me from doing so.  I wanted that punch line ... then, finally, it came ... and it went.<br /><br />This one had a ton of potential but it just didn't work for me.

0156528207|5.0|Some would say that I'm crazy and would probably disagree with me.  The Little Prince is a love-life story to me.  The first time I read it (Polish translation), was probably, when I was only 10, and immediately I felt in love with the story.  The characters and their struggles captivate me.  The metamorphoses used within the book to indicate life's issues are so perfectly aligned, that everyone should feel at ease to relate to it.  I also read the Woods translation, several times as a teenager and adult, and each time I would enjoy the book more and more.  I was able to find the new representation of the same idea.  The love story.  \\"One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.\\" How much truth is in this sentence?  I feel like there is no justification in my explanations and adornment of this true virtue.  One must read it to fully understand the meaning of this book.  Perhaps, they would see it differently than I do.  And I think that is the true beauty of this book, it fits everyone from child to adult, and can satisfy everyone's desire. <br />I would recommend this book to everybody.  I adore it and will definitely pass my copy on to someone I love... <br />
B00005JNTX|5.0|Not much on words, just a short review, Great movie, trillride from start to end, recommend to all action movie fan's
B000GFLKF8|5.0|The cast including Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, and Christopher Plummer is outstanding. Spike Lee directing has always impressed me but his movies are not usually for the whole family. In fact it is rare that the whole family can sit down and watch an adult movie these days that will be only slightly offensive to some. Here is such a movie. At first you will think you know what is happening, then you will figure it out. That is until the next scene. This is one of those, so you think you know what is going to happen next movies. The ending will make you satisified and on many levels, including lack of real violence. After all it is the perfect bank robbery.<br /><br />We are led to believe this movie is about bank robbers and hostages with a tense stand off with police. Okay there is some of that, but it goes much further. Do the robbers intend to take the money? No, but perhaps not what you think to substitute for it. The story unfolds so that we now think an outside negotiator will settle the deal and that's the end of it. But no we have an honest detective that wants the whole story and that is where it will all end when he lays all the cards on the table. I recommend this to the whole family. It is slick enough that it has replayability and I suggest those that like movies like \\"The Italian Job\\" buy it since it has the suspense and con stuff less the violence.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|At last. This is the DVD edition I have been waiting for all these years, if it is what the producers actually claim it to be. I don't care if it is not mixed in 5.1 surround, that didn't exist in 1977. THIS is the version I fell in love with back then, and this is the version I want to see again. No alterations, no 'improvements', no extras. Just the original cinematic release as I first experienced it. I don't even want to see that clumsy banner 'Episode IV - A New Hope'. Just Star Wars, as it was in 1977. <br /> <br />A naive young metaphor intercepts a secret message from a space terrorist and sets off on a mission to free his galaxy from the Republican Party, gaining help along the way from every Hollywood cliche in the books. Produced for the absurdly-astronomical sum of 11 million dollars Star Wars changed the course of cinematic history and doomed us all to twenty years of science fiction that is not really science fiction. Thirty years later the pond still ripples, and a new generation of filmmakers exists that are not only influenced by the film, they grew up with it. <br /> <br />One of the things I remember most vividly about the first screenings of the film was the incredibly subtle colour, something Lucas and his minions seem to have forgotten in recent digital restorations. Hopefully the masters used this time around (allegedly the Laserdisc releases) produce better results.

B0001906O0|5.0|An exhaustive overview of pretty much all b-sides and rarities by the Cure during their tenure on Fiction Records (1978-2001), \\"Join the Dots\\" is a critical collection for fans.  Around five hours of rare Cure music is contained within the four CDs of the set, and while some of the material left out can be annoying (more on that in a minute), this is a superb resource for any of us who try and gather the entire output of a band.<br /><br />The set runs chronologically, providing a fine overview of the band's career as much as anything else.  The Cure always seemed to fill their b-sides with interesting material, from the early days (jaunty, clean tone punky \\"Plastic Passion\\") to much later (the absolutely superb \\"Sugar Girl\\").  Like many bands, in teh '90s the Cure became involved with tribute albums (\\"Purple Haze\\") and soundtracks (\\"Burn\\", \\"Dredd Song\\").  Some great performances ended up on these, \\"Burn\\" in particular from the Crow is highly regarded, and while there are bound to be some things you won't care for (for me it's the occasional 12\\" remix and some of the b-sides that just sound incomplete and unmemorable like \\"Halo\\"), it'll be someone else's goldmine.<br /><br />The only really noticably missing stuff on here are the a-sides-- \\"Killing An Arab\\", \\"Charlotte Sometimes\\", et.al.  While these have all been released in one fashion or another, it'd be nice to see all of them collected in a convenient (and remastered!) package as some of them never ended up on albums.<br /><br />Per usual good boxed set standards, the entire set has been rematered-- it sounds great, crisp and clear with an opportunity to really appreciate the subtleties of the pieces, and includes extensive liner notes about each disc and a detailed discography.<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone but a real diehard of the band would want this, but for those of us who fall in that category, \\"Join the Dots\\" is a great set.  Recommended.
B0002858YS|3.0|I can definitely see why people hate this, there is so much style and so little substance it can make some queasy. I dont see how this gets five stars because there are so many bad songs on this album but I can see how people get caught up in their flashy rock.  The songs are so catchy and simple that they get stuck in your head but get old so fast you can hardly remember why you liked the song.  Mr. Brightside, the best song on the album, is the only song that I like that I can stand extensive listening to. <br /> <br />Now to a little problem with the Killers, Flowers' voice is very one dimensional, and is only suited for bombastic songs, severly limiting the the band. Whenever they try to alter their style a little the band often sputters. <br /> <br />I do like the opening 4 songs, they are all fairly respectably songs, but after that the album collapses.  They managed to produce songs that I pray I never hear again because they are so bad (thats not easy to do): 'Everything Will Be Alright' and 'All These Things That I Have Done.' <br /> <br />I do think that if the Killers lost Flowers (not necessary but it would be good) and slightly modified their style they could be great. Unfortunately, I do not think the Killers will ever be more than a glamour band with no substance; but I will check out their new album simply because the Killers do have potential. <br /> <br />P.S. You might want to get the bonus edition that has the song 'Under The Gun' which is a truely great song.
1579124585|5.0|This book was my introduction to Tom Wolfe - and what an introduction it was.<br /><br />The country was mired in a black hole.  President Nixon had resigned the Office of the President in disgrace.  There was the continuing debacle in Iran.  The anti-hero was king.<br /><br />Who would have guessed a book about old-fashioned heroism could capture the public's attention?<br /><br />Yet that is exactly was Wolfe penned.  Beginning with the early test pilots and then proceeding to NASA's Mercury program's assault on the final frontier - space.  A tale of good, old-fashioned American heroism; a thought, which to many in 1979 that was foreign, or at best, long-forgotten.<br /><br />The book was controversial.  As a New Journalist, Wolfe inserted himself into the lives of his \\"characters\\" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program.  It was a true story that tintillated the reader's imagination.  No novel could have done it better.<br /><br />Beginning with an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier.  Anyone who has ever read it will never forget its Blue Uniform litany.  Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines on the edge.  I recall having to punch myself to be reminded that I was not reading a book about the stock brokerage business.<br /><br />Although Wolfe's command of the English language is unparalleled,  this edition is enhanced by the inclusion of images culled from Life and Look magazines, NASA and the Library of Congress.  The photos chronicle the lives of the people and the social and political climate that created our country's nascent space program.<br /><br />The Right Stuff is my favorite book.  Tom Wolfe is my favorite author.  This edition is a tribute to both.  Yet more than that, it is a tribute to the people and the spirit that made this story possible.
B000FIMG68|5.0|True, the first season was a little weak in terms of development, but Season Two is still outstanding. LOST is one of the best shows on television hands down. The writers managed to answer a few questions from Season One but raise plenty more mysteries to hold your attention.

B00013RC8O|4.0|A good movie for its time.  I knew the end before I watched it, so that took something away from it, but if you like classic car chase films that require a bit of intellect, you will enjoy this.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|I'll give the film 2 stars for the special effects. When comparing to the original, the characters were selfish, unlikable, and extremely shallow (too bad the water wasn't and we wouldn't have had this film). One of the heroes was a thief, who fell for a single mom who easily lost her child in this disaster (he had the tendency to just wander off -- ARE YOU KIDDING ME!??!! considering the circumstances). Other characters were disposable. And how about the fact that of the only survivors one was Kurt Russell and conveniently his daughter and fiancée (who by the way were in another deck on the ship), yet they are the only ones to survive? There would have been straggling survivors. When the ship went over, even a few tossed overboard might have survived by clinging onto debris in the open sea. OH, and the confidently placed inflated life raft with flare at movies' end was just TOO MUCH!!! Considering the ship was blindsided and turned upside down, there is little chance a raft could be deployed, let alone be inflated with all items intact placed directly at the bow where the few survivors would exit and be able to be saved moments before the ship sinks! The whole film SUNK long before that, at least the original made a bit of sense as rescue crews torched their way through the thinnest part of the hull. Yes, the film had action but little else. You could get the same experience of action and gore by watching the news!!!
076531178X|5.0|Much like Elantris, Mistborn provides a refreshing outlook and a new feel to the fantasy genre.  I have long been a fan of fantasy however, I had become tired of the same themes and the same stories being re-written time and time again.  Mistborn provides an incredibly interesting world, a fabulous magic system, and characters that demand the reader's interest.  I find this book refreshing and hope to read more in the near future.  For the first time since Elantris I find myself finishing a book I wish wasn't going to end.
B000EXZKQM|5.0|It was lovely to finally have a music DVD that presented great performances, the smooth transition from one great sound to the next sound was seamless.  This was one of the best DVD that I have purchased in a long time.  This was so good that it was a shame that it is only 55 minutes in length, I would have gladly spent hours with this release.  More music DVDs need to be made like this and in so doing it would stop that disappointed feeling that far to many music DVDs leave you with. It is like some meals the presentation is great but after the meal you still have an appetite for more and this DVD did that for me it left me wanting more! <br /> <br />Very Pleased!
6305014140|5.0|If you have never seen anime movies before, do yourself a favor and watch this one. It is the \\"Star Wars\\" of anime.
B000002J1O|5.0|Enough said. This is a 5 star. I first listened to this when I was in high school. The first couple times I just listened to it with an open mind. It is not a music that hooks you immediately. This warms up slow, but never gets cold. Like the music of Bach. It flows so smooth, but at the same time the lyrics are classy and fun and the melodies are beautiful. <br /> <br />Gabriel is the man.
B000268QB2|4.0|I hate comparing bands, but when I first heard Keane on the radio I considered them Coldplay's \\"little brothers.\\"  Now that I've listened to this disc a few times I have to admit their music has a softer, gentler quality, which is a nice change.  That's the best I can do to describe it.
B000002J1M|5.0|After getting hooked into the Selling England by the Pound, I purchased Nursury Cryme and Foxtrot. Both are excellent pieces of the golden age Genesis. <br /> <br />Selling England is a little more polished and Trespass is slightly less polished, but all 4 albums are a must if you like classy and beautiful music.  <br /> <br />Gabriel makes you realized the importance of lyrics in music as I can't imagine those songs with any other lyrics. You feel like you are reading a fairy tale.
055380457X|3.0|Curious how Google became a global brand faster than anyone else in history? The Google Story gives some insight on that and many more questions about founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the technology, the organization, and its opportunities. This book follows Google's evolution from the very start and, to some extent, provides a sense of the atmosphere in which its legendary breakthroughs were able to occur. It offers a good basic introduction to the history and economics of the search engine business.<br /><br />From a human resources management point of view, the book offers two points of interest. First, it describes the evolution of Google's famed workplace policies, such as 20% free time for pursuit of ideas and inventions. It also provides a fairly good insight into recruiting practices. It includes a copy of the GLAT (Google Labs Aptitude Test), the unusual standardized test the company uses to identify what, in its own blog, it calls \\"uber-geeks.\\" If you are an employer in high tech, check it out.<br /><br />The book is flawed by a sort of wide-eyed, gee-whiz tone. In more than a few places, the authors seem to have pasted company press releases into the text. The reporting does include some of Google's missteps (for instance, the gmail fiasco several years ago) but hardly takes a exhaustive look at the potentially negative implications of Google's technological ascendancy.<br /><br />This is a quick, informative read but don't expect to feel you've been treated to an exhaustive work on the Google juggernaut or the global impact of search engines.
0446577383|3.0|As many Baldacci's books the end of it lacks in  inspiration and when you finish a book and the end just bores you it doesn't matter how the rest of the book was.

B00001ZULV|5.0|\\"Turn It On Again: The Hits\\" is a one disc, 18 track compilation of Genesis' chart toppers. Though mostly from Phil Collins' Genesis, there is a track from Peter Gabriel's era, a track from the Ray Wilson \\"era\\", and even a bonus track where all the classic lineup members reunite for one last song. It's pop music and love songs for the most part, yeah, but they're very catchy, unique and fairly well crafted ones. I was born in the 1980s, and many of these tracks remind me of my early years at school, so it's got sentimental value for me as well. <br /> <br />Though often with rather icy 1980s production, Phil Collins has a way with his love songs lyrics and his vocals which is very warm, and you can feel the care he has for the relationship he is describing. That's not to say he can't tell a story, like when he tells us about the lonely TV addict in \\"Turn it On Again\\", or when he describes the broken down paternal relationship of \\"No Son of Mine\\", or even the slightly disturbing character of \\"Mama\\" with his sleazy, rhythmic laugh. They're not exactly stories like the ones Peter Gabriel used to tell to Genesis' music, but they're still pretty interesting. <br /> <br />Genesis have done a whole stack of albums, and on a one CD compilation that only covers hits there's a lot left out. Many of the 1970s albums don't get a track in at all. <br /> <br />Here's a rundown of how many tracks came from which albums: <br /> <br />1 track from \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" (1973) <br />1 track from \\"And Then There Were Three\\" (1978) <br />2 tracks from \\"Duke\\" (1980) <br />1 track from \\"ABACAB\\" (1981) <br />2 tracks from \\"Genesis\\" (1983) <br />5 tracks from \\"Invisible Touch\\" (1986) <br />4 tracks from \\"We Can't Dance\\" (1991) <br />1 track from \\"Calling All Stations\\" (1997) <br /> <br />The bonus track \\"Carpet Crawlers 1999\\" sees all the Peter Gabriel era members come back together (Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins) to sing the classic, cryptic song \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" from the 1974 \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" record. Influential audio engineer (and singer of \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\") Trevor Horn produces this new recording, and if you're a fan of his (like I am), you can tell. There's electronic sound effects and a more modern treatment of the vocals and synthesizers. The beat that Phil Collins lays down for this track was a bit unexpected, rather than the driving hand percussion of the 1974 version, he plays some rather laid back rhythms on his drum kit. It all makes the song feel a lot lighter than the original, like it was on a desert island rather than an etheral cathedral (which is what the original always reminded me of, if that makes sense).  <br /> <br />There is a newer, 3 disc compilation out called \\"Plantinum Collection\\" but I prefer the remastering job on this compilation disc to that one, which has way too much audio compression for my liking. Just because it's \\"louder\\" doesn't mean it's clearer, in some cases it's just the opposite. It's mainly the older tracks that get that treatment. Anyway, with \\"Turn it On Again\\" you don't have to worry about anything like that. <br /> <br />Together with Phil Collins' \\"Hits\\", this will be all the pop Genesis that a casual listener will probably need. If you are looking for more of Peter Gabriel's Genesis, get the old 1970s albums one by one (\\"Trespass\\", \\"Nursery Cryme\\", \\"Foxtrot\\", \\"Selling England By the Pound\\" & \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\"). All those albums together make a \\"Best of Genesis\\" of a very different kind...
B000A59PMO|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  Since i live in Australia we haven't even seen the end of season 1 yet!!  Amazon are really fast in their shipment and delivery.  I always get my products before the estimated arrival date.  It's fantastic and safe. <br /> <br />Veronica Mars is a great show and i am currently awaiting for season 2 to arrive here so i can watch it.
B00005JKQ6|4.0|...\\"and the American Dream is indicted.\\" Huh? Many of the reviewers here seem to have projected their own feelings into this movie. It seems very popular to state that because the characters are wealthy, and it is a tragedy, then, why of course, the American Dream must be indicted. The theme of this movie is not, \\"the American Dream indicted,\\" but \\"You can't go home again.\\"  This is certainly one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen and definitely in my Top 20. The film maker slowly reveals the Ned Merrill's denial of reality as he tries to convince everyone and himself that he still has his job, family, and home. The scene with the empty pool is the most revealing of all the pools. The empty pool is a metaphor for his mental condition. He tells the boy, Kevin Gilmartin, that if you believe in something hard enough it's true for you -- in this case that there is water in the pool. As he leaves he hears the kid on the diving board and thinks the kid is going to dive into the empty pool. So he's worried that he's convinced the kid that by believing in the water that it'll really be there. This reveals that he isn't entirely off his rocker but desperately trying to create his own reality.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is definitely a very good album . I bought my copy in July because the record store dropped its price to a mere 10 bucks while promoting her new release Back To Basics, and because I'd heard one or two songs by Christina Aguilera and I'd liked her strong vocal style. I really only shelled out my 10 dollars to get the track Beautiful - a lovely ballad I'd heard perhaps twice before.  <br /> <br />So imagine how delighted I was when I heard about 10 or 11 ripper songs out of the 20 on this full-length CD !!! This lady is honest and feisty, she is really talented, she is not afraid to deal with hard issues from her own life in her lyrics, and best of all she is a strong advocate of self-expression and freedom. Check out the inspiring and uplifting track Soar, which makes your spirits Soar too! Or the excellent ballad Cruz, which is about taking off and finding yourself a new life somewhere else up the coast . Or even the funky and disinhibited romp of Dirrty , which is about shaking it on the dance floor and doing whatever the hell you feel like doing ! The R&B styled track Underappreciated is really good too. A smooth and sensuous slow groove on Loving Me 4 Me is a nice take on youthful romance, while The Voice Within was a power ballad about trusting yourself and pushing ahead with your life even when you feel weary or sad. Alicia Keys drops in for a bit of piano and a co-write on the impressive track Impossible, while Christina faces her apparently-abusive family background in the painfully emotional and raw ballad I'm OK. The Spanishy guitar sounds on the pleasant tune Infatuation make this into a good song, while the album closes with anther shot of inspiration in Keep On Singin' My Song. The other singles Fighter and Can't Hold Us Down both showcase Christina Aguilera's bold and unrestrained singing style and lyrical concerns, and both work well.  <br /> <br />I don't like every song on here, and sometimes there are a few confronting images in the lyrics, but overall this is a very strong album that was MUCH, MUCH BETTER than I was expecting it to be .Since her rather underwhelming debut with the pop ditty Genie In A Bottle in 1999 I always used to think Christina was a fairly run-of-the-mill pop music starlet. Now that she has Stripped away all those misconceptions with this fine album, I can recognise that she is a truly talented vocalist and a strong contributor to the popular music scene. <br /> <br />Highly Recommended <br />4.5 stars  <br />  <br />Jeremy  <br />
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|I actually got suckered into seeing this movie in the theatre, but that only lasted about a half an hour. Are you kidding me??? This movie flat out sucked. I don't care what anybody says, when that one kid started to slap the other guy back and forth, I actually felt stupid for believing the hype and actually buying a ticket to this garbage. The acting I guess was suppose to be like an old murder mystery film, where everybody acts non chalant and so cool. What's the point especially if the movies time-line is set for the present. And where the hell are all of these kids parents in the film? It's like every character had everything figured out and they were soooo cool. I simply couldn't handle how stupid this film really was. And I still can't believe people are still saying that it's good. That is the real mystery in this movie. IT SUCKS IT SUCKS IT SUCKS!!!!!!! If you honestly like this movie, I guess your also defending all of the newer Star Wars movies also. Seriously, what is going through your heads?
B000G759LW|4.0|I bought my copy of Back To Basics last week on the strength of Christina Aguilera's formidable vocal abilities. Her last album Stripped had been released in 2002 but I've only really known about Christina's music since 2004-05 when she had a great hit with a cover of the old song Car Wash off the Shark's Tale CD. I was really impressed by her vocal talent on this new 22-song extravaganza !!   <br />The most notable features that this 2CD set has to recommend it are:  <br />1. Christina Aguilera is a terrific singer - easily one of the best female pop stars ever - and she is still young and improving ! <br />2. She is also very honest and forthright and she obviously writes lyrics that are meaningful to her. I am impressed by this. A lot of her lyrics are about self-expression, being strong and determined, and about love and other positive emotions. These sorts of emotions in songs make you feel good! <br />3. Her usual vocal style is that of an old-style soul or R&B belter, but she can also sing softly , and she has a terrific high vocal register too.  <br />4. This album features a lot of retro stylings , but all the songs are new compositions rather than cover versions, and there are modern production values on display.  <br />5. The current single Ain't No Other Man is pretty hot! <br />6. Christina has some good producers to work with . <br />7. The whole package is very entertaining , and there's a lot of diverse music here to enjoy. Because of this, you will not grow bored with this album.  <br /> <br />I am listening to this album on my home stereo this week and my favourite songs from it are Makes Me Wanna Pray, Mercy On Me , Ain't No Other Man , Without You and Back In The Day.  <br /> <br />This is going to get 4 stars for now from me, but may advance in time to a 4.5  <br /> <br />Recommended for all fans of good pop music. <br /> <br />Jeremy <br /> <br />
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is a great movie that depicts the spirit of the courageous priests, religious and lay people during a terrible time.  It is definitely a must see!
B0001906O0|5.0|From the saturnine appearance of Robert Smith it looks like he's spent the better part of his career wallowing in self pity with very little time to put out a prodigious library of music.  Maybe he is depressed but he isn't lazy.  His work ethic is clearly shown in this dazzling collection.<br /><br />Made up of b-sides covering over 20 years Follow the Dots never disappoints.  The material is strongest at the beginning but song quality never falls off precipitously.  It's amazing that this is all B-side material!<br /><br />I give it the highest possible rating!
B00004YW6I|5.0|This album rocks. All over, it's great. PJ Harvey is one of the most influential artists, at least I think so. There isn't a \\"bad\\" track on here, they're either great, good, or not your favorite. There's a good mix of fast and slow songs, and it pretty much goes from fast, mid-tempo, slow, fast, slow. The single, \\"This is Love\\" is the most single-worthy song on the album. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that lyrics like \\"I want a pistol/ I want a gun/ I'm scared, baby/ I wanna run/ This was crazy/ Give me the gun\\" are family friendly. Instead, \\"This is love/ This is love/ That I'm feeling/\\" was chosen. <br /> <br />1. Big Exit: 10/10 <br />2. Good Fortune: 9/10 <br />3. A Place Called Home: 9/10 <br />4. One Line: 8.5/10 <br />5. Beautiful Feeling: 8/10 <br />6. The Whores Hustle and The Hustlers Whore: 9.5/10 a bit heavier than the previous ones. Be prepared to sing along to the lyrics. <br />7. This Mess We're In: 10/10 Thom Yorke is amazing. <br />8. You Said Something: 8/10 <br />9. Kamikaze: 11/10 The best song is also the heaviest. <br />10. This Is Love: 9/10 <br />11. Horses In My Dreams: 8.5/10 Where the album slows down. <br />12. We Float: 9/10 Good song, but a great way to end the album. <br /> <br />Overall: 109.5/120=91%  A- <br />
B000AADYRQ|4.0|After a couple of indy releases it is nice to see DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE finally hit it big with PLANS.<br /><br />SOUL MEETS BODY & CROOKED TEETH have become major radio hits. The album is filled with potential radio friendly hits.<br /><br />The guitar acoustic ballad I WILL FOLLOW YOU INTO THE DARK is a nice change of pace from the first two singles.<br /><br />SUMMER SKIN is a perfect back to school/fall song. Like I WILL FOLLOW YOU INTO THE DARK, SUMMER SKIN is a slow ballad but unlike I WILL FOLLOW YOU INTO THE DARK, SUMMER SKIN features a marching drum beat and a piano to keep the song moving along.<br /><br />YOUR HEART IS AN EMPTY ROOM is another upbeat mid tempo pop/ rock song that would be a good candidate as a future single.<br /><br />The big question will be can DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE follow up this album with another big smash now that people will be anticipating their next release ?
B000G759LW|5.0|When I first heard that she was making a CD that was inspired by genres that have been long forgotten I'll admit that I was a little nervous, but I must say I was proved wrong. From the first intro on Disc 1 to the last song on Disc 2 I wasn't disappointed. If anything I was suprised by how much I liked the CD and before I bought it I downloaded every track and let me tell you as soon as I got some money I bought the real thing. It's in my car right now. If you purchase this CD you will not be sorry, even for all those people that don't like her, I'm sure if they give her a chance they'll love the CD as much as I do. <br /> <br />My favorite songs: <br />All of them!!! But Understand and Save me From Myself are the two standouts in my opinion.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|How many times we can buy a movie? I plain buying it one more time, but not now. I'll wait when George Lucas releases them in a high defention format. I'll set back a wait until one format kills the other. That is what George Lucas is most likely do. So in 2008 or 2009 I'll buy the next box set with all 6 movies in HD. If you want to waste your money, then get it.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I have been waiting for several years for this movie to come out on DVD.I spent 100 dollars on a never opened collector VHS set recently,in despair of ever seeing this movie converted into a digital format. <br /> <br />I am 100% happy with my DVD set. Saw the movie in Cinerama when it first came out in the 60's and have been a devoted fan ever since! <br /> <br />Hands down the best racing movie ever made! <br /> <br />=====Bill
0452270073|3.0|From the very beginning I was interested by this book, but for some reason it took me a ridiculously long time to read.   <br /> <br />I thought it was very interesting how non-fictional characters such as Siegfriend Sassoon, a poet who really existed, as well as Wilfred Owen, were incorporated into this fictional story.  I appreciated the fact that Sassoon was against the war although he was a decorated war hero.  It is rare to find a story about war in which the protagonist is against the war.  Although I have not read any other books on WWI other than \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", this is the first time I have seen the war looked at from the psychological post-war effects.  I thought that was interesting despite the fact that not many psychological cases are examined in detail in this book.  I enjoyed the fact though, that the time in which Rivers spends with Sassoon ends up forcing Rivers to question himself and everything he previously stood for- a kind of role reversal of doctor and patient.  The title of the book refers to the medical studies attempting to reattach nerve endings and restore senses to wounded men.  I think this is slightly ironic though.  This is because the men who loose feeling in their body become so do to horrific wounds which are painful and violent enough to tear apart nerves which leave them unable to feel, but when these nerves are reattached, the men are only able to feel their pain, restoring also sense-memory images of the horrific war as well as the physical and mental pain they did, are, and will feel.
B000G759LW|3.0|Well.Until I got to track 16 to 23 I thought this a real Dud certainly not up to Christina's Amazing Vocal Ability and to think I waited so long for this release.I'm very disappointed Candyman I thought really cute one of the best tracks.Even Stripped was better than this and had a lot more real singing.16 to 23 was more to the hype she put on this album.
B00005NTJM|5.0|I saw JT live when \\"This Was\\" was thier only Album I thought it was great then I still think it's great and from a personal point I thought after this album or LP as we called them JT lost the plot and thier way.
B000002TQV|2.0|I tried, I really tried. Played it while I'm cooking, while I'm driving, just about any chance that I can have. I just don't get it. It does not grow on you. It just remains so boring. Makes me feel like my day has been so long. Nothing amazing here. Amazzzzzzzzzzing if you can stand 3-4 songs in a row. I salute anybody who can do that.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Beautiful story, great acting... You laugh, you cry, but most of all, is a chance to travel in time and to a country and be touched by their beauty, simplicity and experiences .
B0000025P9|5.0|This CD is worth the money. I used to have this on Vinyl and I played it until you couldn't understand the words. I am very glad I found it on CD. Rosanna is a classic from Toto. Make Believe is a very good song about people making believe they are in love again. I Won't Hold You Back is a good love song. Good For You sounds like a song from Motown with a very good groove to it. Africa is another classic from Toto with a catchy tune.  My favorite song on this CD is Afraid Of Love. This CD has every imaginable music instruments played on it. It sounds like a symphony. I gave it 5 Stars because of the different backgrounds of music played on it. It is very different from any other Toto CD there is.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|This movie is off the hook and Its one of the best of the fast and the furious.
B000002UB6|5.0|The Beatles were definitely always at the top and their music is still there. Long live Rock 'n Roll.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this cd because my friends had been raving about it so much. When I put it on, at first I didn't know what to think. To help, I looked up the storyline of the musical, and then I got the songs. By knowing the story, I could actually hear the charcters joys, triumphs, and pains. And I feel in love with the music. This soundtrack is one of my favorites, thanks to the amazing score and the talent of these singers. I was lucky enough to see Wicked a few weeks ago, and I was even more memorized. I recommend the show immensely, but if you don't get to the show, buy the soundtrack! Here are the songs reviewed: <br /> <br />1. No One Mourns the Wicked 6/10: A great opening number, but      unless you see the show it may seem a little random. It does show of Kristin Chenowith's amazing vocal range. <br /> <br />2. Dear Old Shiz 3/10: An ok song, but I like how they say Shizzzz in it- funny! <br /> <br />3. The Wizard and I 10/10: An amazing song! Our first glimpse into Elphaba, and Idina Menzel just sings her heart out! <br /> <br />4. What is This Feeling 9/10: I love how they have two choruses singing as one in this song. It's hilarious in the play, with Galinda and Elphaba venting about their feelings.  <br /> <br />5. Something Bad 5/10: listen to this song once in a while, just to remember what's happening. I also love the dangerous undertones in the music.  <br /> <br />6. Dancing Through Life 8/10: Such a fun one to sing to! Fiyero's voice just soothes the soul.  <br /> <br />7.  Popular 8/10: Galinda's ballid. And by that, I mean a wonderfully shallow, bubblegum pop anthem.  <br /> <br />8. I'm Not That Girl 7/10: You can literally hear Elphaba's heart breaking in this one. It's a beatiful, simple song that shows off Menzel's mid-level range.  <br /> <br />9. One Short Day 6/10: Much better to see visually. But it's fun to listen to on the soundtrack.  <br /> <br />10. Sentimental Man 5/10: Very short, with nothing really great to make it worth listening to.<br /> <br />11. Defying Gravity 15/10: I know that's not possible, but it's just that good! The best song on the soundtrack, and the best scene in the play.  <br /> <br />12. Thank Goodness 8/10: A song that I listened to over and over again. You can also hear Glinda finally growing as a person.  <br /> <br />13. Wonderful 6/10: The best of the Wizard's songs. Fun tempo to it.  <br /> <br />14. I'm not That Girl (reprise): Good, but more of a prelude to the next song.  <br /> <br />15. As long as you're Mine 10/10: A great love song. Fiyero and Elphaba sing great together.  <br /> <br />16. No Good Deed 10/10: So sad, because you know that Elphaba has decided to be Wicked. But I just love how Menzel sings this.  <br /> <br />17. March of the Witch Hunters 7/10: Not a stand out, but the intensity of the chorus is great.  <br /> <br />18. For Good 9/10: A tearjerker. Glinda and Elphaba saying goodbye to each other  <br /> <br />19. Finale 9/10: A great way to sum up the musical. When you see it live, it gives you chills.  <br /> <br />Well, there you have it. Now go buy Wicked!
B0007PALSE|5.0|Will Smith at his best! And on top of that, absolutly wonderful graphics and excellent storyline. I wanna see it over and over again!!!!
B00005AQE8|5.0|A C-L-A-S-S-I-C! 1 Of the best rap albums from ever! If u don't like this album there must be something really really wrong with u! <br />Almost all tracks deserve 10 from 1 to 10 stars. The appearances r great, the beats r great, the lyrics r great. There r only 1-2 banal songs, like: Whats ur phone number. This is my favorite album.
B0001WANCM|5.0|Very happy with the dvd it came just in time for when I needed it
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this DVD set for my husband for his birthday because he had heard such great reviews about it and really wanted to see it.  Being veterans ourselves (he served 6 years; I did 20), I was interested in seeing the series as well, but sadly, not as much as my husband was.  I have always enjoyed war movies, but at times I have had to give myself a rest from them because I get very emotional when viewing them.   <br /> <br />Once I finally sat down and started watching this, I was hooked.  It was hard for me to turn off the TV because I always wanted to know what was going to happen next.  Now that I have watched the series, I will most likely read the book then watch the series again.   <br /> <br />Because I am a military retiree, ALL veterans are very special to me, as they should be to all fellow military members, regardless of their status, and I am thankful every single day of the sacrifices these men and women made for me and all others living in the U.S., citizens and otherwise.  It is because of these sacrifices that I had the freedom to join the military and serve my country for 20 years.  It is because of these sacrifices that foreigners are able to live and work in a free country.   <br /> <br />I was told a story of a senior female Army officer who complained about having to shake the \\"old, wrinkled hands\\" of our veterans on Veteran's Day.  How dare her!  How dare her cast such unspeakable shame on the Army uniform, her fellow service members, and on our veterans!  Had I heard this, I would have chewed her up one side and down the other.  As far as I am concerned, she should have been down on her hands and knees and kissing the feet of our veteran's for what they did for us.         <br /> <br />Obviously, this woman has not seen this series; perhaps if she did, she could understand the unbelievable sacrifices these young men and their families made for us.  Unfortunately, because she is so self-serving, she never will. <br /> <br />
B0000542D2|5.0|I first saw this movie in a Theater/Film class i took at SDSU last semester. I loved it so much i had to get it. I don't understand a lot of the humor possibly because it's British and filmed in the 60's and i am only 20 years old. Anyhow, my father actually remembers seeing the film in the theaters and he liked it. Also because i saw this in a class, i got to find out some interesting things about the film and its art.
B000002TQV|5.0|Don't you just love the rare albums that come along every few years where you can play the CD end to end and love every minute of it?  Without a doubt, this is one of those CDs. <br /> <br />What I love about the songs here is that each one of them is unique.  They all sound different and great, which is much more than I can say about the band's other efforts.  Kid A and Theif seem to mesh together into one musical sound and aren't nearly as good as Bends. <br /> <br />OK Computer is a good album but my heart will always lye with The Bends. <br /> <br />One of the best albums ever made.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I don't know... Warner Brothers has released Supernatural in the UK. Which is fantastic! I love Supernatural! BUT, why don't we get any special features!!!!!!!! <br />I would be happy with just getting the Gag reel, But no. Damn WB!!!!!! <br />Damn You!!!!!! <br />x
0743454537|4.0|If you read other reviews of this book here, many agree that the ending to this book is absolutely terrible. Unlike other books, where you know early on if you're going to like it or not, the same is not true in the case of this book. I felt cheated because the book was SO good in the first two-thirds, and then the ending was horrible. I don't remember the last time I hated the ending to a book nearly so much! And given the subject matter of the book, one doesn't really expect a happy ending, so that wasn't why I was disappointed. The ending certainly isn't happy, but as you're reading, you're likely to come up with a few possible ways that the story could end. Picoult throws a wrench into the story and ends it completely differently than any of the possibilities you had imagined, and it's just the most miserable ending ever. The letdown was especially intense for me because the book until the end was so riveting and interesting that it was the kind of book that had me stealing extra minutes away from the kids to read another chapter, and that's high praise! And this was the first book I read by Jodi Picoult, so I was thinking I might have found a new favorite author. But the ending really was that bad. <br /> <br />A friend had recommended Jodi Picoult's books to me and I started with this one. I didn't think I would read any more of her books, but decided to try once more with Plain Truth. Plain Truth is MUCH better. If you do read both, you'll see that there are certain similarities between both stories. Plain Truth is riveting just like My Sister's Keeper was in the beginning, but without the horrible ending. Also, I believe it's fair to warn readers who might not already know: Picoult's books all involve complex social and moral issues, surprise endings are her forte, and if you're very sensitive you might have a hard time reading them. But if you're looking for well-written books along these themes, I would recommend starting with Plain Truth before this one.
B000002H97|3.0|Not bad for what it is but this album is not metal. This signified a change in sound where Metallica once were leaders of the big four, but then went on to chase album sales. There are some catchy songs, but if you are into their earlier stuff then the chances are you won't like this album as its very different to when Cliff had control of the band.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Phantom Menace makes no sense if one looks at the surface.  The film has virtually nothing to do at all with the Trade Federation or the invasion of Naboo.  But when one realizes that the conniving and evil Senator Palpatine is orchestrating the whole thing (including a full-scale invasion of his own planet) in order to become Chancellor, destroy the Jedi, and form the first Galactic Empire, then the film becomes a somewhat horrifying and very interesting introduction to the Star Wars saga.  If one looks at the surface, disappointment and confusion ensues.  If one reads between the lines, the story becomes clear (and quite entertaining).  It is no accident that this least-understood of all Star Wars films is entitled \\"The PHANTOM Menace.\\"
B00006D295|5.0|A classic! A Must See! Although not really intended for kids my daughter at 4 used to love the music and dance along...now at 14 she still loves the songs but she thinks the movie is kinda corny. Us adults however, love the movie and of course the soundtrack too. Can't help but catch yourself singing along.
B000GRUMPU|5.0|Everyone can recall the earlier \\"Poseidon Adventure\\", released in the early 1970s and starring Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Shelley Winters, etc.  While the earlier version was exciting and thrilling, this new version is just as exciting and thrilling in its own right.  The special effects have improved dramatically over the past 30+ years since the original film was made, and these are the highlight of the new film. <br /> <br />As for the story, the plot remains basically the same.  The SS Poseidon is on a New Year's Eve cruise when a gigantic tidal wave strikes the ship, causing it to capsize.  Instead of immediately sinking, the ship has \\"turned turtle\\", and now the hull is facing upright.  After the ship has turned over, the captain urges the surviving passengers to remain in the ballroom, because he believed an automatic distress signal has been sent and the ship should be able to remain afloat for several hours; long enough for help to arrive.  Tragically, he was wrong. <br /> <br />One person not waiting around to be rescued is Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a professional poker player.  He immediately begins to formulate a plan to somehow make his way \\"up\\" which is really down, into the bowels of the uptuurned vessel to find a way out.  Along the way, Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a retired firefighter and former mayor of New York City, Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett), her young son Conor (Jimmy Bennett), stowaway Elena (Mia Maestro), and Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) decide to join Dylan and search for a way out.  Robert informs the group that his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and her fiance Christian (Mike Vogel) were in the ship's disco when the wave hit.  The group struggles their way up to the disco to rescue them.  After recovering Jennifer and Christian, the group begins a perilous climb through the bowels of the ship, all the while racing against time.  The watertight compartments have begun to fail and soon the ship is beginning to settle furtherin the water. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the determined group of survivors has continued to make their way through the ship, swimming through narrow passages and into vent tubes, all the while trying to avoid the onrushing flow of the sea.  Will the group make it to the bow and be able to escape through the propeller tubes, as Dylan has discovered to be a safe way out, or will they all suffer the same fate as the other passengers aboard? <br /> <br />This is an exciting and thrilling movie that is topped off with eye-popping special effects and superior acting performances. Some reviewers have commented that the characters were not as developed in this movie as they were in the original film, but I would disagree.  I felt that the strong performances, especially by Kurt Russell (Robert), Josh Lucas (Dylan), and Richard Dreyfuss (Nelson) were one of the high points of the film.  I found myself easily relating to all of the characters, and I was genuinely wondering who would play the part of hero next?  Would it be Robert, who vainly tried to save the life of Elena, or would it be Dylan, who risked his own life several times to save the rest of the group?  On the contrary, I found the character development to be excellent.  The aforementioned special effects, especially the scenes with the wave striking the ship, is what really made this movie stand out from the original.   <br /> <br />Having viewed both movies, I feel that each deserves a high recommendation.  The original contains many famous actors, and the original storyline was developed, but this great re-make deserves its own place as one of the great \\"disaster\\" movies.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  If you're a fan of great special effects and believeable characters, then you won't want to miss this thrilling and exciting movie.
B000062XM7|3.0|This will be my last Michael Mann movie. I know lots of folks like his directing style; he's great visually, puts in plenty of tight action, and some steamy romance besides. But he's too over the top for my taste, and he's not one for authenticity or plausibility. The same holds true for two of his other movies, Miami Vice and Collateral.<br /><br />Hawkeye, a white man brought up by the Mohicans, is a superhero in this version of the story. His hair and clothes are always impeccable, not to mention his manners and integrity. I lost count of how many times he rescued people, and of course he never so much as received a scratch or mussed his hair in any of his hand-to-hand battles. I don't think he ever missed a shot with his rifle, either, and he could reload it on the run. He runs everywhere but never tires - I think Mann's got him running so much so we can see his long hair flowing behind him and his bare chest heaving. Then there are the anachronisms in the dialogue. In one scene, after an argument with a British officer, Hawkeye says, \\"I think we're going to have a serious disagreement someday.\\" That's a funny way to express a veiled threat in 1760. The romance consists more of repeatedly rescuing his girlfriend than of wooing her. But inbetween rescues they manage to enjoy some passionate kisses. And finally, the music track is an endlessly repeating cycle of the same twelve bars, sometimes louder, sometimes softer, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, depending on the scene. And the end song is the same, going on for a good ten minutes while the credits are rolling.
B000004286|2.0|Very dramatic music - felt like a battle.  Not an easy listening type of music by any stretch of the imagination.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Let's start with the good: Christopher Reeve is cool as Superman. He was handsome, stoic, manly, but also charming and romantic. He made Clark funny and Superman respectable. <br /> <br />I like Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. He's campy, but not creepy. He's dangerous, but still likeable. <br /> <br />Now to the bad... <br />There have always been some things that nagged me about the Superman movie. <br />1. They spend too much time focusing on Krypton and Marlon Brando's Jor-El. After appearing in Last Tango in Paris, Brando should have been forbidden from stepping witin 5,000 miles of anything having to do with the wholesomeness of Superman. It's almost an hour into the film before we see Kal-El as Superman because of all the time given to Brando. Set up is necessary. An homage to Marlon Brando wasn't. <br /> <br />2. I never could buy that Superman would forsake the whole world for Margot Kidder. Not only is she plain in the looks department, but Kidder's interpretation of Lois Lane is as a chain smoking, hamburger in the morning eating, freshly squeezed orange juice drinking, cynical, harn-nosed reporter who is more reckless and nosey than she is charming. Her only redeeming qualities are that she's good at her job and loyal. But I will certainly not deny that Margot Kidder is a good actress, and that beats out looks in my book when it comes to the art of moviemaking. Her good acting is also why she made the Lois Lane thing work. However, I still don't buy a mini-god like Superman going bananas over her. <br /> <br />3. The \\"turn back time\\" thing. I have a problem with Superman turning back time for two reasons. One, he is warned not to interfere with human history, yet he does and nothing bad happens for him breaking the rule. Why have it as a rule if nothing bad happens when it's broken? Secondly, if he could fly that fast around the earth to make its time go back, then why didn't he fly that fast to begin with to keep the initial disaster from happening? <br /><br />4. I thought the boy who played Clark Kent was the wrong choice. <br /> <br />Other than these detractions, Superman is a satisfying film. I think Superman II was the best of the series, but second place isn't always bad.
B00012FXAE|5.0|They say that sequels are always worse than the original, but this one is arguable.  \\"Aliens\\" is the sequel to the incredible masterpiece, \\"Alien,\\" and what a sequel it is.  In terms of quality, these two can't realistically be compared, because the original film falls under the category of suspense/horror/sci-fi, whereas this film falls more under the category of action/sci-fi.  This sequel doesn't have the same feeling as the first one, but it is, without doubt, a superb action film.    Although it is expensive, this set contains both the original and the special editions, the latter of which is considered to be the definitive one, and a large number of special features to browse through.  The story line stays very true to the original, displaying excellently the frail and tormented mind of Ripley, who, upon being picked up 57 years after the events of \\"Alien,\\" tells her story to \\"The Company\\" and, seeing as the ship, and the alien, have been destroyed, is regarded with disbelief and is stripped of her pilot's license.  However, Ripley learns from the executives that a human colony has been established on the planet with the alien ship (the planet now being called \\"LV-426\\"), and attempts to warn the executives, but her warnings fall on deaf ears.    Later on she is contacted by a member of the company who assisted her after she woke from deep sleep, and is told that contact was lost with the colony on LV-426, and that they are willing to reinstate her pilot's license if she accompanies them to investigate.  She refuses at first, but after having a recurring nightmare about the creature, she decides to go, on the promise that they will kill the alien(s), and not investigate and research it(them).    Upon arriving, the platoon accompanying Ripley and the man from the company investigate the colony and find the colony living sections ripped up, as if a huge battle had occured.  They find a girl in the air ducts who Ripley takes under her wing, and they set out for the colony generators where a life form was picked up on the sensors.  The macho macho marines go in and explore, only to have their ammo taken away from them due to the atomic sized explosion awaiting them if a bullet were to puncture the cooling ducts above them.  They find a colonist wrapped in some kind of gunk, whose chest explodes seconds after being discovered.  The marines fry the colonist up along with the newly born alien, and then, one marine detects movement all around him on his sensors, and it isn't his fellow marines...Then the action begins.    Along with firmly installing Ripley into the role of the first sci-fi heroine, it was also the first sci-fi film to garner a \\"best actress/actor\\" nomination at the oscars.  Although not as suspenseful as the original, \\"Aliens\\" loyaly continues the \\"Alien\\" story with commendations all around.
6305784116|3.0|I love cats. Well, most cats at least. I'm not too fond of scary looking cats that come in my yard. Anyway, I have one named Abner that looks just like the dark gray kitten in the movie. This film is about cats and there are several adorable scenes. I especially love the scenes at the beginning when the cats are at home painting and singing and playing the piano. They're so adorable! It doesn't matter that they're animated. <br /> <br />Their owner is making out her will and her butler Edgar overhears that he will be her beneficiary only AFTER her cats are dead. After some math, he realizes he'll be dead before he gets a cent, so he decides to dispose of the kitties by dropping them off someplace far from home. If he had been smart, he would have waited for the Missus to die then just spend the cats' money considering he would likely be the one responsible for the cats anyway. But why should I let something like logic get in the way of movie storytelling? Anyway, I refuse to see Edgar as the bad guy. I would be ticked too if I had to defer to animals. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the scenes after this development are not as good. Don't tell me that because it's a cartoon I should see no flaws in it. We get treated to scenes of two annoying dogs and two annoying geese (I can't believe I can't tell a goose from a swan). The story is thin, and O'Malley the alley cat is not interesting in the least. The best thing about the movie are the three kittens. And of course, the song: \\"Ev'rybody, ev'rybody, ev'rybody wants to be a cat!\\"
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|this movie has alot of qualities that i liked from the start. the way the students tried to find a way around the game, the social interactions of the students, and the question of could you kill your best friend. the movie goes smoothly from the start, with everyone on the bus, and then comes to on the island. i even have a soft spot for kitano, the cookie eating teacher. the cast did a superb job giving the book characters life and keeping to the plot. and the fact that it didnt save characters that you get to like made it sad, yet, gave the sense that the students really were trying to survive. the one thing i like to point out is the way the students' clicks fell apart after one or two days. some worked better as a team, while others got ripped apart at the seams.
0060005696|5.0|I read about 4 books per month and this is hands down one of the best ones I've read in the past year. Packed with information, yet enjoyable to read, I had a hard time putting this one down.  <br /> <br /> I use the ideas I learned in this book almost every day, in my own life and in my work with helping clients. <br /> <br />Schwartz skillfully illustrates how the sheer abundances of choices we have in life these days leads to stress and paralysis of action. He describes looking at 40 types of jeans and going home with none, overwhelmed by the choices and time it would take to go through all of them. We can all relate to this, right? <br /> <br />As a business psychologist and organizational consultant I use Schwartz's concepts all the time. Whenever a client tells me that their goal is to improve sales, one of my first questions is, \\"How many choices do customers have in this particular category?\\"  <br /> <br />Psychological research tells us that the perception of choice and control is important, and Schwartz highlights the need to limit the number of choices for maximum effectiveness. <br /> <br />I'm happy to think of how many individuals and businesses have and will benefit from Schwartz's book.

B00000K3CR|4.0|The 1988 movie Big was about a 13 year old boy named Josh Baskin who changed to 30 over night. After being humiliated at a carnival by the fact that his crush is allowed onto a roller coaster and he's still to little he decides to go to a wishing game where he wish's that he was big. In the morning Josh wake's up as a 30 year old man, terrified his mother make's him leave the house. With no where to go he rents an apartment in New York and  gets a job at FAO Schwartz toy company where he quickly progress's up the ladder in the company. After being 30 for a while he begins to have feeling for his co-worker Susan Lawrence. He's then face with a huge decision to change back into a 13 year old boy or to stay as a 30 year old man. Susan persuades him to live out his childhood. So Josh and his best friend Billy Kopecki went to find another wishing machine to wish Josh little again. Once he returns to school there is a new girl who look's exactly like Susan but younger. <br /> <br /> Big was filled with comedy and made me laugh. I think it was one of the best movie's Tom Cruise played in and I'm not really a big fan of his. However it does give of the hint to kid's not to wish they were older because it might just happened. Overall I'd give the movie two thumb's up.

B000F39MAG|3.0|It's a joy to see and hear Edita Gruberova, approaching 60, playing Queen Elizabeth I with almost the same agility and control as she exhibited 25 years earlier in such roles as Constanze in Mozart's \\"Abduction from the Seraglio\\" (1980) and Gilda in Verdi's \\"Rigoletto\\" (1981) - also available on DVD. She is still a master of coloratura technique; I especially love her delicate trills. Yes, some of her high notes sound strained (just as Sutherland's did toward the end of her performing career) but it doesn't detract from the excitement of her performance. The supporting cast is very good, especially Roberto Aronica (as Devereux) who has an expressive, full-bodied tenor voice. However, this opera belongs to Elizabeth. Donizetti gave her all the coloratura pieces and Gruberova doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />But now I have to start subtracting stars from Gruberova's five-star effort. The setting of the opera is updated, a bold move in a opera based on historical figures. I'm game though (it's not as if Donizetti and his librettist stuck to the historical record), but the director's vision must make sense. This staging does not. The opera takes place in a big room that is unidentifiable and bears no relation to the action. It looks like it could be the waiting room at a train station or a hotel lobby or perhaps the reception area of some multinational corporation. The soloists and chorus, when not singing, alternate between reading tabloid newspapers and filling their cups from a water cooler. Almost everyone is in a suit, most of them as grey/brown as the dreary chairs and the walls around them. But most puzzling is: who is this Elizabeth supposed to be? The words are there in the subtitles - Queen, crown, kingdom - but no one treats her like royalty. (She just joins everyone in the cavernous room - no one bows or treats her with deference.) She looks like a corporate executive at a conference, even clutching a handbag as she moves around and sings. It's hard to believe this Elizabeth has the power to order Devereux's execution. During her big last act scene, she is at least in a gown and they do wheel in a crown at some point, but other than this, I'm clueless as to the concept behind this production.<br /><br />Aside from Gruberova's performance, the highlight of the DVD is a 20 minute \\"Behind the Scenes\\" bonus feature with interviews of cast and crew, including Gruberova. It's a highlight because the interviews shed light on Donizetti's original work (but not, unfortunately, on the concept behind this production).<br /><br />Those who are familiar enough with the opera to be able to just appreciate the music and the quality of the singing may well enjoy this production despite the unfortunate staging.lizabeth has the power to order Devereux's execution.

B00006CY8L|1.0|I used to be a David Lynch fan -having enjoyed \\"Twin Peaks\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\" - but unfortunately, \\"Mulholland Dr\\" is a worthless, waste of time.  Lynch makes a tedious 2 1/2 hour film where over half the film is a \\"dream sequence.\\" He not only misleads and cheats his audience..but in this case bores us as well with unnecessary scenes and inane dialogue.  Even the \\"hot\\" lesbian scenes can't revive this stinker.  Avoid this film like the plaque.

B000E6UWE4|5.0|I may be in the minority here but for me the `The Gunslinger' was a hard read.  It was slightly confusing and you just didn't really know where the plot was heading.  If it wasn't for the prompting of some of my friends I probably would have finished it but I wouldn't have picked up the `The Drawing of the Three'.  But I am so glad I did because I would have missed out on the world that King brought forth.  `Gardens of the Moon' would come to be a lot like this.   <br /> <br />`Gardens of the Moon' is definitely a hard read but like 'The Gunslinger' it is well worth reading.  Personally I look at it this way, Erikson has woven a tapestry so huge, so detailed, so friggen incredible that it cannot be looked at as a whole right off the bat.  Instead Erikson just gives you a glimpse here and there that allows you to slowly come to terms with the world he has created.  This can be very frustrating and if my friend who told me to read this book hadn't been around to answer some of my questions I might have quit too.  But this friend was the person responsible for me reading Martin, Donaldson, Farland, Bakker and so on, so I took his opinion seriously.  When he said this series was the best he had ever read I believed him and now I share the same opinion.       <br /> <br />Here are some tips for reading this book.   <br /> <br />1st: Do not try to guess what's going to happen.  Just read it with an open mind.  I say this because you're going to meet characters and races that are hundreds of thousands of years old.  They introduce their own stories into the mix so trying to guess anything while reading the first book is pointless. <br /> <br />2nd: Try to pay attention.  I know it's hard at first but honestly I have read this book (the entire series in fact) twice and each time I realize how detailed Erikson has been.  I have full confidence that the entire series is already done in his head.   <br /> <br />3rd:  Do not underestimate anyone.  Something might seem insignificant now but in these stories they can be the pebble that started the landslide. <br /> <br />All in all just get to page 350 and you'll probably start to feel things click.  Then you can finish it and start the next books which are breathtaking.  If you didn't know the next 2 books are on the same timeline but they occur on different continents.  It is in these that you truly bond with the characters and see a new world unfold in front of your eyes. <br /> <br />Oh one last thing to the people who said the magic was lame; you ain't seen nothing yet.   <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This is an awesome album. Pearl Jam's past couple of albums have been pretty good but not special, this one is a phenomenal piece of work. I've been listening to it over and over again and it gets better every time I hear it. Highly reccomended for any Pearl Jam enthusiast.
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater has long been one of my favorite bands, and of all their albums this is the one I come back to the most. Petrucci, Rudess, Myung, Labrie, and Portnoy astound me. The fantastic music on this album is topped off by an intriguing story line and petruccis head-ripping solos. The quieter songs on the album are just as powerful, with great lyrics and superb arrangement. This is probably my favorite album of all time, and a must for any metal/prog fans collection. Can't wait for the Radio City dvd!!

B00004Z400|5.0|This was my first deftones album. And what a album it is. Its easily their best and most refined work to date, and its truly a breathtaking album. Your appreciation for this album will increase if you see them perform any of these songs live. They put on a fantastic live show. Back to the album, this a new more mature deftones that wasn't found on Around the Fur or Adrenaline. While great albums, White Pony raises the bar and might be the greatest record they ever record. Its going to be hard to top this one.<br /><br />In comparision to Deftones first two albums, White Pony is quite a departure from the Nu-Metal sound they had produced. While White Pony still hits you hard at certain parts, its not the same Deftones. A softer more mellow side of Deftones is expressed here, as the single, Change (in the house of flys) shows. Thats whats great about this album, it gives you alot of different stuff. You have hard, fast paced songs like Back To School, Elite and Korea, then you have songs that are a really much more mellow like Knife Party , Change, and Digital Bath. The rest of the album pretty much falls inbetween on the hard factor. The real highlight for me is Passenger, which includes Maynard (from Tool/APC) on it. Its a tremendous song. They both sing and harmonize so well, sometimes i have a hard time distinguishing who it is actualy singing. Fantastic song.<br /><br />This album does take awhile to digest, at least for me. But most great albums do, and it has never really got old for me. This album should really be the standard for all Nu-Metal to be judged by. I can't think of anything else that surpasses White Pony in terms of genius. If you don't have this, just go buy it. No questions asked. An album this great doesnt come along very often, its one of the best albums I've heard in the last 6 years. Masterpiece on all accounts.
1592401791|5.0|Geoff Emerick has written an incredibly fascinating story of his career, which was very closely linked to the Beatles.  I couldn't put the book down until I finished, even asking my wife to drive to the grocery store just so I could sit in the passenger seat and continue reading for an extra 15 minutes. <br /> <br />This book shows a side to the Beatles that few people know about.  It tells of their habits and behaviors in good times and bad, and although it never tells too much about the world outside the studio you can infer so much from what went on inside. <br /> <br />Essential reading for any fan of the group.  Essential for any musician wanting to know about the first band to use a studio as a creative tool.  Essential for anyone who wants a deeper character study of four ordinary boys who deserved every ounce of their success but weren't sure how to handle it. <br /> <br />Best book I've read in at least a decade.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I have to say, I can't stop watching this show. I started watching season one when i rented it from the library in july.  After 3 episodes i was hooked and i watched the entire season in 3 days.  Since finishing season 1 i couldnt wait for the release of season 2.  It just arrived yesterday and im halfway through the season.  This season is full of surprises.   <br /> <br />This season deals with the aftermath of the lilly kane murder- the trial and the characters dealing with lost family, and significant others.  the season starts off with a bus crash that veronica is convinced was aimed at her.  this season deals with solving the bus crash along with other things such as -did aaron echolls really kill lilly?? and just when you thought it was over- Also there are the traditional episode mysteries, a new one each episode.   <br /> <br />This season is just as good as the first season and after the season finale of season 2 im counting down the days unti the season 3 premeir October 3rd Tuesday 9 pm...Tune in, you wont' be disappointed.
B000GRUMPU|4.0|Proving that God can crank out a sheet of water that's way more powerful than any man-made ship, \\"Poseidon\\" gives her viewers a brief look into high society, then wipes it all off of the table with a wave that'd make any surfer wig out.  A few survivors are left to make it to the hull of the ship and eventual safety, but this film has plenty of dangers lying ahead for them all.<br /><br />I'm sure there are plenty of comparisons to \\"Titanic\\" and the original \\"Poseidon Adventure,\\" but this remake holds its own against many other modern adventure flicks.  Director Wolfgang Petersen (\\"Das Boot,\\" \\"The Perfect Storm\\"), strips away character development and relies on CGI and live-action sequences to move this ship along.  It's an above-average study in modern, bloated action yarns that cuts to the chase and ties all of the loose ends nicely in just under an hour and forty minutes.<br /><br />The visuals are rather stunning for the most part, and show just how far CGI has come since James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" first set sail.  The bulk of the scenes were shot on blue screen sets, but you can hardly tell while you're watching the flick.  Also, the main actors in this film did almost all of their own stunts.  Kudos to Josh Lucas for swimming under a lake of fire.  That was pretty impressive.<br /><br />Speaking of acting, Lucas headlines a cast of faces both new and familiar.  Most of the characters are cardboard stereotypes, but the whole point of this flick is the visual appeal of it all.  Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss (both of the original \\"Poseidon Adventure\\") do wonderful jobs in their respective roles.  Russell's the over-protective father of his daughter (Emmy Rossum of \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" and \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\") and Dreyfuss plays a jilted lover who's on the boat to drown his sorrows in wine, lots of wine.  Jacinda Barrett plays a single mother who's son (Jimmy Bennett) is tagging along on her journey.  There's a also a stowaway (Mia Maestro) and a future son-in-law (Mike Vogel).  Andre Braugher has a brief but solid role as the captain, and Stacy Ferguson (Fergie of the Black-Eyed Peas) plays the ship's local siren.  I'm really glad that she used her actual name in the credits and not \\"Fergie.\\"  It would have been hard to take her seriously as an actress had she stooped to using her hip-hop name like many of today's performers do in flicks (The Game, anyone?).<br /><br />Heavy on action, heavy on explosions, \\"Poseidon\\" is a decent action yarn that wanes sometimes between action sequences, but the eventual payoff is a wonder for the eyes.  It's pure popcorn pleasure packed into a solid three-and-one-half stars flick.<br /><br />Recommended.and a future son-in-law (Mike Vogel).

B00005JP5J|5.0|Friends of mine are already telling me they were disappointed in \\"Little Miss Sunshine;\\" the reviews have been so unanimously glowing, they complained, that it set their expectations unreasonably high. This really is a shame, because Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' debut feature is second only to Rian Johnson's \\"Brick\\" as the best American film so far this year, and a more surefire crowd-pleaser than Johnson's more stylized film. But \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is not a movie that wows you; it sidles up to you, tickling your ribs gently at first, then gradually turning up the laugh meter as it progresses until, before you realize it, you're covered in popcorn and spilled Coke from rolling in the aisles. Like other recent quirky comedies--\\"Sideways,\\" \\"Garden State,\\" and \\"The Squid and the Whale\\"--\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" mines unforgettable humor from the lives of desperate characters who are lovable despite their glaring character flaws. The plot is simple: The six members of the Hoover family pile into a decrepit VW bus for an 800-mile trek to California so that daughter Olive can compete in the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" beauty pageant finals. All of them are smarting from separate, painful insults to their egos and their hopes, and along the way each one suffers a final, crushing blow--in one case, with extreme prejudice. The beauty of \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is that it overcomes all this sorrow to become a joyous experience. No other recent film has demonstrated how thin a line there is between tragedy and comedy, or the crucial difference between embracing life and despairing of it. The buoyancy of the screenplay is matched by the absolute perfection of the ensemble cast. It's virtually impossible to single any of them out, they are all so good. I have to admit a predilection for Alan Arkin and Steve Carell, but I don't want to shortchange the shining, sparkling contributions of Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano and little Abigail Breslin, an almost frighteningly gifted child actress. All I can say is, at the next Screen Actors Guild award show, when the \\"Best Comedy Ensemble\\" award is announced, they had better read these names, in alphabetical order: Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, and Greg Kinnear. If they do not, rioting in the streets will be completely warranted.ifted child actress.

0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins groundbreaking leadership book, Good to Great, Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don't attempts to answer the question of how an organization can be led to resounding success and to the achievement of all its goals. The author's premise is that being simply good enough is acceptable to most individuals and that organizations need determined and focused leadership to grow into a great organization that maximizes all the potential that its members can muster. Good to Great was the result of a five year study into what makes effective leadership and organizations.<br /><br />Within this book, Collins attempts to profile exactly what type of leaders lead the transformation from a merely good to a great organization. In the process, he dismisses some common fallacies and assumptions about what is needed to advance an organization to a great organization. While Collins mostly uses case studies of large American businesses, he proposes that the principles he has studied can be used by any organization; government, school or church.<br /><br />Collins strongly advocates that the central element to move an organization forward is not delineating goals or policies, but discovering individuals with talent who can lead an organization from all levels. The common assumption that an inspiring leader who takes an organization further is charismatic and is able to make sudden changes to push an organization are shown by his research to not be consistent with the profile of great leaders. Most great leaders, showing what he calls Level 5 Leadership, are humble, quiet, disciplined, placing the organization above their own personal egos, and have a relentless search for outstanding subordinate leaders.<br /><br />Great leadership requires passion and discipline that are constantly looking to improve today and to slowly move towards the future. No one charged in an organization's turnaround can look for a quick fix, or some other event that lacks real substance. Tools, like technology, are never solutions; but are simply products that aid the discipline process.<br /><br />Collins found that all great leaders make a habit of properly ascertaining intelligence about their present situation and are able to make calm decisions based on the brutal truth. He case that great leaders operate on the \\"hedgehog concept\\", or that concepts must constantly be refined to their simplest, nominalist objective is consistent with his concepts of disciplined, humble leadership.<br /><br />Collins' concepts encourage a constant push towards quality discipleship and initiative. Humility and kindness at the top of the leadership will go a long way towards encouraging subordinate leaders to show the same traits to others. While rigor and exacting details in leadership are always required, ruthlessness and throwing the weight of leadership around to assert authority never are.re never solutions; but are simply products that aid the discipline process.

B00005JOML|5.0|...of a wonderful phenomenon. This film is one of the greatest undercover movies of all time and offers almost unparalleled realism. It is exactly what Miami Vice would and should look like today and is again another masterpiece from Michael Mann. If you expect a no-brainer action flick, please go see something else, if you like it light, please go see something else, and if you have a problem with intelligent stories, please also go see something else. Anyone who likes crime drama should love this movie, and it is certainly one of Mann's best works to date. Why so many people criticize him for it is beyond me, since I totally disagree with them. This deserves at least five stars as well as a sequel anytime!
0393324818|5.0|Lewis has written a fascinating study of the bean counter approach ,used by Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics to construct a team of moderately priced players chosen on the basis of ,primarily, on base percentage for everyday players and the number of groundball outs and strikeouts for selecting pitchers.               This approach generated a number of divisional championships for Oakland in the weakest American League division,but no pennants and world championships.There are omitted variables and misspecification  problems in the sabermetrics(statistics) approach of Bill James used by Beane.First,James's system totally ignores the number of batter strikeouts.All outs are not equal.Hitting flyouts and groundball outs will many times advance the baserunner if any previous batters got on base.Hitting the ball also allows the baserunner to get on on an error.Strikeouts are thus the worst type of out.This omitted variables problem can be dealt with by simply deducting 1  to 1.25 points from the on base percentage for every strikeout over,say,100 for a regular,everyday player who gets 600 official at bats over the course of the season.The second problem is that the James system does not differentiate between walks due to the hitting skill of the batter and walks used by the pitcher to set up forceplays and double plays,especially if he is a pitcher who gets a lot of ground ball outs.Another category is needed-walks that are not followed by forceouts or double play groundouts and/or walks where the runner is able to steal second base.These walks are different from the walks given to a 40 homer player who strikes out 150+ times a year and hits .250 but has a .375 OBP.          James's system needs to be adjusted to take into account these two factors.

B00005221M|5.0|This is an outstanding movie. Well acted by an excellent cast. The scenery is just fantastic, filmed where it fictionally happened. The history is accurate and the over all film really gives you a flavor of those times. It doesn't pull any punches with the actions of any side. Wes Studi does a particularly good job as does Daniel Day-Lewis.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Plain and simple `Silent Hill' is a beautiful horror film, beautiful in sense that the effects are top notch, the imagery is effective and the set pieces are out of this world.  That aside, `Silent Hill' tries a little to hard to make a drama out of a horror film.  I'm not against the idea of a horror film being a dramatic staple, but `Silent Hill' could never be that movie.  I saw an interview with Radha Mitchell before the film was released (Mitchell by the way does a wonderful acting job here even if it was unnecessary) and she was going on about how this is more than a horror movie, how it's about the maternal instincts of love and devotion to child and how the woman will do anything to save her child.  What really shocked me was that she looked sincere.   <br /> <br />I just want to make this very clear, this movie is about demons and satanic rituals and sacrifice and revenge...not about mother daughter time.  Yes, Rose (Mitchell) is struggling to find her lost daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) but that's not our main concern while watching.  The story, as you may not be privy to, is about a young girl Sharon, adopted by her loving parents Rose and Christian (Sean Bean).  This young girl suffers from sleep walking, and in her dreams she utters the words \\"Silent Hill\\" so in an attempt to cure her daughter Rose drives her to the ghost town to confront the nightmare. <br /> <br />Big mistake.  What happens next is a montage of disturbing scenes and the unraveling of a horrifying back story that explains (somewhat) what's going on.  A friend of mine whose played all of the games said they need to make a few sequels to really make more sense of it...I have only played the games sporadically and didn't really know much about it at all so I was left a little confused, yet not enough to where I was dumbfounded, I mean, you can figure it all out if you try hard enough. <br /> <br />So anyone who's played the game will enjoy he masterpiece brought to life, and it's wonderfully done.  The demons are all scary and realistic, and there are plenty of jump sequences and eerie, creepy moments to salivate over, but it's not what it tries to be.
B000F7CMRW|4.0|Director Stephen Gaghan using a similar semi documentary format that he used so successfully in \\"Traffic\\", chronicles the underhanded behind the scenes machinations that define the oil business.<br /><br />Using the merger of two major oil companies as a backdrop, a fine cast headed by Matt Damon and George Clooney takes sides as power brokers sift through the details of the deal.  Corporate lawyer Bennett Holliday played by Jeffrey Wright while putting<br /><br />the deal together gets exposed to the dirty, secretive dealings of corporate bigwigs Chris Cooper and Christpher Plummer.  Plummer was magnificent in his role as the guileful Dean Whiting and probably more deserving of the supporting actor Oscar than CIA Middle East expert Bob Barnes played by Clooney.<br /><br />Meanwhile in the Middle East opposing factions within the ruling Arab oil producing families are scrambling for power positions.  Damon, playing American energy analyst Bryan Woodman, allies himself with a progressive Arab prince Alex Siddig, the first born son of the head oil honcho. However the prince's younger brother has other ideas in this deadly game.<br /><br />The drama plays out in murderous fashion as the merger becomes cemented on both sides of the globe.  The terrific desert based cinematography courtesy of Robert Elswit and filmed in Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates greatly enhanced the overall viewing experience.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a blast.  It's opening I think is the one of the best I've seen, sets the mood perfectly for the show to follow.  I find myself chuckling often, and thoroughly enjoying most episodes. <br /> <br />That said, Firefly is over-rated.  Obviously, that I cared enough to write a 5 star review for this show should be testament to fact that I am actually a fan of the show, and do think it is great.  But after reading all the reviews others have wrote, I almost expected the second coming of Jesus. <br /> <br />The truth is, Firefly's best qualities are also a weakness.  Firefly isn't a show like Lost or Prison Break, where the plot is carried on through many episodes... sure there is the issue of River, but it isn't the most epic of storylines.  This makes Firefly light-hearted, and a joy to watch.  At the same time, however, it lacks the compelling nature of other tv hits like the aforementioned Lost and Prison Break... the desire to just plow through episode after episode without a break. <br /> <br />At times the show is overly cheesy and predictable, and while the characters and their development are fantastic, the show is rather shallow.  But I still love it, and in fact that is part of the reason that I love it - it makes Firefly kind of refreshing.  Just don't get misled by these other reviews.  Firefly is one of the best shows that graced a television screen, of that there is no doubt.  But it is not the be-all end-all that many of its cult following make it out to be.  Honestly, it isn't even the best sci-fi show - that honor would have to go to Battlestar Galatica.  Then again, there really isn't much that is sci-fi about Firefly, it is much more western than sci-fi at heart.  So for anyone looking for a unique and refreshing experience, Firefly is definitely most highly recommended.
B0002W18MU|5.0|So many artists fade away in their later years.  Mr. Cash did not.  The fire and intensity of his art only grew greater with the passage of time.

B000FGGE68|2.0|i never expected much from this film to begin with.  i knew from the get go, it was going to be a cheazy over the top movie.<br /><br />But I'd probably watch anythin with Milla in it.  :drool:<br /><br />Anyone who had high hopes for this movie, is going to hate it.<br /><br />i neither liked it nor totaly hated it.  It's one of those \\"meh\\" movies.<br /><br />The movie has a clech'e plot of race vs race war, that gets totaly lost in a very terible script, and bad acting from everyone but Milla, and low end CGI (CGI was done in china).  Fight sceens are ok, it would have been better if the enemies were not completely helpless.<br /><br />the Entire world of UV consists of bold colors, realtime weapon change, and realtime costume change, (It's a stupid consept, but hey you get to see Milla cosplay very Anime-ish get-ups.)<br /><br />Along with infinite ammo, god code, and lame enimes (Last boss is Metal Buger), UV is the longes video game trailer in exsistence.  Or at least it seems like one.<br /><br />The only reason why i gave it 2 stars is, one Milla, and two, you gotta give them credit for some of the artistic flavor of the video, tobad they did not have a better screen writer and action director.<br /><br />Easter Egg:  Notice a lot of the women extras look like they have come from Mortal Kombat.  I wonder why is that?
B000001FG5|5.0|This album in my opinion is not Saturday Night Fever Part 2 . The Gibbs proved their abilities for outstanding production, without emphasis on the 4/4 beat (which makes out the Disco dance floor fillers). <br /> <br />Looking from a Music Industry standards perspective for \\"how to make a top-selling album\\" today: \\"Spirits\\" would probably fail the approval from the A&R, many of the reasons already described by other reviewers. It lacks the simplicity of nowadays productions for the mass market. <br /> <br />But this Album brought the Gibb Brothers respect by the other artists and musicians around the world. Consequently they have received many requests to produce world stars like Barbra Streisand, Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross, Kenny Rogers and others...Being a musician myself, I can't help but bow in front of this masterpiece. <br /> <br />The creativity here lies within the layers of instrumentation and the finesse of the vocal arrangements. This is how close you can get with combination of different music styles, rhythms, jazz chords and sumptuous orchestration without losing the Pop Audience. For example <br /> <br />Stop (Think Again): is 6/8 bars bluesy Jazz with soul overtones. I wouldn't mind if this was 15 minutes long and had an even more extended instrumental soli, but then again: I love Jazz. Just watch for the part where Barry's vocals (sounding like a screaming saxophone) are taken over by the saxophone player itself. phenomenal! And the drummer's extensive breaks at the end! You won't find these musical gimmicks on a nowadays Pop Album. <br /> <br />Living Together: did you ever tried to count 1,2,3,4 on this tune without losing the timing of the song? ;-) There's a slight turn of the rhythm every now and then. I think the Gibbs had fun writing a song which would give Travolta a hard time on the dance floor. <br /> <br />Until: Never heard such impressive End of Album ever since. Very soulful. Barry could compete with any jazz trumpet, hitting the notes at the end of the song even higher than most trumpet players can. ;-) This explains the protracting of the words singing style. <br /> <br />As for the falsetto overdose on the Album, this is what makes the whole album so distinctive in its style. Can't think of another album on the planet that had such almost aggressive high falsettos arranged in multiple vocal layers. But I have to admit, you have to love it or hate it, this is what probably makes it difficult for new Bee Gees Fans to appreciate the music itself or even prevents to make the songs to be timeless Bee Gees classics. The complex arrangements and extremely high harmonies are some of the reasons why the Gibbs avoided to perform the songs live in concert even though they had 3 Number ones here.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, as an other reviewer said, this is their and their Band's best studio production/performance ever! And for all those who disagree, I can only quote: Stop, Think again...Search (within the music) and (you'll) Find ! ;-)
0887307280|4.0|First let me start off by saying that I'm not a business owner.  I picked the book up because I'm in a transitional period in my life and trying to decide which way I should go professionally.   <br /> <br />Gerber makes a couple of main points in the book.  The first is that most small businesses fail because the \\"technician\\" in all of us exert too much influence over the business without allowing the \\"entrepreneur\\" portion of our personality to exert enough influence on the business.  I think the point he makes here is valid.  Too often the pie maker, mechanic, plumber, etc. in all of us is the driving influence of our businesses and not enough attention is paid to the overall business side of things.   <br /> <br />That, in a nutshell, is the point I took from Gerber's book.  Gerber makes another point of instructing the small business owner to run his business as if it were a franchise.  Noting the success of McDonald's and other franchises, he recommends that business owners plan that their operations could be easily replicated and simply repeated, with processes written on paper, etc.   <br /> <br />He goes on to mention several times the statistics of failures of small businesses.  They fail at alarming rates in the first year, again in the first five years and even in the five years after that.  Meanwhile, franchise failure rates are microscopic in comparison.  Ergo...run your small business in the same manner that the franchises run theirs.   <br /> <br />Now again, this is all well and good, but from the standpoint of someone who is NOT a small business owner, the main point that I derived from the book is this:  If I want to start my own small business, look into FRANCHISING.  That may not be the intended point that the author was trying to make to me, but I'll give the book four stars as it may have led me in a direction I was not previously strongly considering.
B00000AFDW|1.0|Sorry, but this album failed simply because it sucks. <br /> <br />I've been a Kiss fan since 1977. In 1998, however, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley tried so hard to bring back memory lane that they ended up writing the stupidiest lyrics ever and some of the worst melodies in their repertoire. Songs like \\"You Wanted the Best\\" and \\"We Are One\\" are simply embarrasing. <br /> <br />\\"...and I see my face looking back at me...\\" <br />\\"...you wanted the best, ahhhhh, yeah...\\" <br /> <br />(Well deserved \\"One Star\\" for Ace Frehley's cool guitar solos).
0670033375|5.0|Another great book by Jared Diamond. He discusses the rise and fall of civilizations including: Mayans, Aztecs, Easter Islanders, Anasazi, etc. The environmental, social and cultural factors responsible for the demise of mass civilizations are discussed and integrated. This is a fascinating book that will change your view of history and ancient civilizations. Actually, it's pretty scary when JD compares the parallels between ancient civilizations that crumbled and our own contemporary civilizations. Very enlightening and stimulating material!!!

Sure, the dossier isn't \\"complete\\" actually, but it seems everybody forgets that Apocalypse Now hasn't ever looked better on any other media!

B000FS9FCQ|3.0|This movie is a futuristic political thriller set within a morality action play.  It is rich in dialog, ideas and genre.  Based on a graphic novel, its hero is a political terrorist who was a past victim of state terrorism.  V exacts revenge against his individual state torturers, but he aspires to more.  He wants to inspire society, from the bottom up.  This movie envisions the state of society in a post 9-11 world where citizens give up too much freedom to be safe and no longer recognize the difference between a leader and a tyrant.  It darkly affirms the difference an individual can make in extreme circumstances, resting responsibility on each of us to take up our duty.  The rhyme to November 5th references a real event - the Gunpowder plot (1606), a failed act of regicide against James I and his family. V mocks the modern day celebration of Bonfire or Fireworks Night in commemoration of monarchical survival.  Three particular tickles:  The parody of British political satire smack in the middle of the film, the predicted demise of American society and the love story.  Delightful.
1400049628|5.0|I read this book some time back but since I have gotten into reviewing, especially quite a few zombie stories, I had to jump back to this.<br /><br />Lets just say that this book is everything you want to know about zombies but were afraid to ask and then some.  If you want to better understand what to do in a zombie induced crisis, here is your tome.  If you want to read \\"authentic\\" stories of zombie experiences throughout history, this is your book.<br /><br />I cannot wait for World War Z to come out.  That will be another must for any true zombie fan to have alongside this work.  I would be very surprised if it does not pack as much as a wallop as this.<br /><br />I know that Max Brooks is Mel Brooks's son and a comedy writer, which makes this volume that much better.  Not so much as a smirk as he wrote this and I have to believe he is probably one of the more devoted fans of George A. Romero's works to be able to assemble this.<br /><br />Every time I surf the web for zombie stories, there is always boards with people talking about what they would do to survive a zombie attack.  Everyone has their own ideas and many translate them into novels and short stories, some of which are pretty dang good.  But I don't think anything tops Mr. Brooks efforts here.<br /><br />If you like zombies, or even if you are curious about them, THIS is the book to read before diving into any others.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Brick is a picture-perfect hardboiled detective story straight out of the tradition of Dashiell Hammett.  The characters, the double-crosses, the shifting allegiances, all were pulled off spectacularly.  The setting of the story around a high school student played nicely into the form by having the protagonist play fast and loose with the administration, local toughs, and a band of dealers who just completed a major sale while he tries to understand who killed an ex-girlfriend.  The ONLY issue I have is that while the detective noir aspect of Brick is flawless, the characters were all too confident and played too well to type to really be convincing as high school students.<br /><br />It also didn't hurt that there were little insider jokes referencing The Maltese Falcon, Miller's Crossing, and other great hardboiled movies.<br /><br />And for the reviewer wondering what a \\"yegg\\" is: a tough guy, often an ex-boxer, slumming for a crime boss.<br /><br />Very highly recomended.

B000006045|5.0|This album seemed to have been designed with the urban night in mind. Its dark synthetic pulse is reminiscent of the rubber ring around a bottle of Bulgari black. It's about as far from soul as you can get. In fact, with Frazer's heart rending appearance on teardrop aside, I`d put this whole disc in the `soulless' category; wonderfully soulless.    The attention to detail is remarkable. Each song is a seamless mould of modern styles & sounds to produce what the future in music may come to sound like. Using technology in a bleeding edge way & embedding the human element into it, Massive attack have developed their best album to date. It is stylish, dark, brooding. It never bows to cheap emotionalism. It is cool and at the same time paranoid. It offers up no hope, though it escapes being depressing. It is a perfectly designed album.    I'd say this work is the place Massive attack has always been heading to. They are now here, but are they smiling about this? I doubt it.
B000GRUMPU|1.0|Whew!  Where to begin.  The perfectly even, precision like blade of a slow-moving rogue wave, the large square rapidly-filling-with-water rooms, the intense human drama?  Man!  This is bad ...really bad.<br /><br />I appreciate the attempt at updating the action, but too much CGI and it looks like an overblown video game to me.  We get, like 4 or 5 minutes of exposition to get to know the charicatures, oops characters, before the big perfectly even ...<br /><br />Anywho - who cares about these people?  All the girls look alike - especially under water.  All the guys have that tortured fart-smell face.  Really  this is a stinker.<br /><br />The orginal may be no state of the art production - but compared to this it's The Godfather.
B000E6ESL2|1.0|Sometimes even truly bad movies redeem themselves by providing enough entertainment value in spite of themselves that they still manage to hold your attention for two hours.  Then there are the ones that commit the unforgivable sin of being bad *and* boring.  \\"Stay\\" falls, nay, plummets irretrievably into the latter category.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever been less interested to find out what happens to a set of characters than I was while watching this film.  The tone of the film is dreary and bleak; everyone has suicide on the mind in one form or another; and a disjointed series of scenes follow one another without much coherent narrative thread to connect them.<br /><br />The lack of a coherent narrative really kills this film.  I'm all for a convoluted, confusing plot that keeps the audience in the dark until the very end, but if you're going to go that route you've got to throw the audience just enough to keep them interested and compelled to keep viewing.  A sympathetic character, a good action sequence, people with clear goals to achieve -- hell, Naomi Watts doing a pole-dance just to keep us entertained would have gone a long way toward saving this movie.  As it is, we just get a morose Ewan McGregor running around a dark cityscape, being confused about his identity, the identities of the other characters, and generally not doing anything remotely interesting.  The main plot thread of trying to prevent his patient's impending suicide gets tangled up and loses momentum almost immediately, leaving the movie aimless and meandering.  I assume it ends at some point and provides some resolution to whatever it is Ewan McGregor is trying to accomplish, but I turned off the DVD long before that happens and derived much greater entertainment value by watering my girlfriend's plants.  Wow, that African Violet is really starting to bloom!
B0002IQHY8|4.0|The simple fact of the matter is nothing Alan Parsons has done since the split from the \\"project\\" has been as amazingly good as the project albums.  That's not to say that his \\"solo\\" albums are bad.  Just don't think \\"A Valid Path\\" is going to compare with the earlier works.    That being said, it IS a good album, and I've found it very enjoyable, probably because I really like electronica.  If you aren't into instrumentals, you will probably be disappointed that there are only 3 \\"real\\" (vocal) songs on the album (\\"a recurring dream within a dream\\" is just a remake, lyrically).      The 3 vocal songs on the album are very good, like many of the other Parsons' 1990's era songs, but just lack the lyrical magic of \\"the project\\".    Bottom line...  Let this album stand on its own - no comparisons to the early days - and if you like electronica and instrumentals you will like this album a lot.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|by Vanessa Stylianos <br /> <br />The Lovely Bones, by Alice Sebold, is the story of Susie Salmon who is raped and killed at the age of fourteen by the hands of a neighbor, Mr. Harvey. After being lured into a strange underground fort, Susie becomes just another one of Mr. Harvey's victims in a chain of female serial murders. While coping with her death, Susie watches her family live through the investigation of her murder, and the devastation that follows the realization that Susie is gone. Each member of her family is affected in very specific and individual ways, from her younger brother, Buckley, who was too young to understand what death was when the murder occurred, to Susie's mother, Abbie, who falls into a state of immense doubt and insecurity about her marriage and life as a whole. Living in her personal heaven, Susie experiences the emotional rises and falls of each member of her family, as her own absence from Earth becomes more and more bearable. Susie's death and afterlife also make a huge impression on the lives of childhood classmates Ruth and Ray, who continually feel her presence. <br /> I chose to read this novel based on a recommendation by my peers, and expected a sad story about a young girl's murder. Instead, The Lovely Bones shattered my predeterminations, and turned out to be something completely different than I had expected. While there were obvious moments of sadness, every other emotion is experienced when reading this novel, from happiness, to frustration, to hope. The unique point of view, as the story is told as Susie's view of Earth from heaven, gave me a whole new perspective of heaven and the idea of an afterlife. I could not put the book down simply because the story was so compelling and grasped my attention from first page to last. The way Sebold explores how Susie's death had such an impact on not only her family, but certain people who hardly even knew her, is fascinating. Sebold's style of turning a topic that is often exploited by the news into a tragic, yet hopeful tale illustrates her ability to portray the grief that results from a horrific murder, while instilling hope in all that read the novel.  I also enjoyed The Lovely Bones because it showed the emotional effects of a loss on a level that I had never realized before; members of Susie's family are ultimately affected by her death in almost every aspect of their life, in both obvious and extremely subtle ways. <br /> I would recommend The Lovely Bones because it was one of the most powerful novels I have ever read. Anyone who has experienced a loss, and even those who are fortunate to have not, should read this novel because it gives such a wonderful perspective of heaven and how the dead continue to stay with the living. I feel that Sebold's original take on heaven is refreshing and sheds a hopeful light on tragedy and death. The Lovely Bones is a unique, heartbreaking novel that shows the true effects of loss and life changing events.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|In a nutshell, this is a brilliant collaboration between Cee-Lo Green and Danger Mouse. Jazzy with the power of classic Motown, this album will be well received by a wide audience. The single hit, \\"Crazy\\" blew me away. I also love \\"Online\\", \\"Just a Thought\\", \\"Go-Go Gadget Gospel\\" and \\"The Last Time\\" . . . I love the entire CD. The CD has the drive and power of Outkast plus the classic style and poetic lyrics of Isaac Hayes. Grab this one whether you're into rap, jazz or classic R&B.
0930289234|5.0|This trade paperback from Alan Moore's epic saga is a must-own. A mere plot summary can't do it justice; there is just so much going on in this story. In the broadest sense, it's about a mysterious killer who is taking out old crime-fighters and the attempts to uncover who is doing the killing. But it is so much more than that. The Dark Knight Returns is frequently called the best the genre has to offer, but I disagree. Watchmen is a deeply layered, thought-provoking and powerful book.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|I had high expectations of this game, being a fan of the game series.  At the beginning of the movie, I was impressed by the use of atmosphere and camera angles that were taken directly from the first game.  The soundtrack seems to be a mix of the second and third games. <br /> <br />However, those are the only good points I can say about this movie.  The plot borrows from the games' but doesn't follow it.  Do NOT buy this movie if you are expecting any answers for the game - it will not provide any.  Dahlia and Alessa's storylines do not follow the games' at all.  About the only thing these characters (and Cybil) have in common with their game counterparts are the names.  Pyramid Head makes one or two appearances in the movie, but his presence is not really explained.  It felt to me that the director must have seen a shot of PH somewhere and said \\"Wow, that thing's creepy; let's put him in the movie\\" without really understanding the character. <br /> <br />I came away from this movie very disappointed.  It's based on the Silent Hill games, and that's all.  Yes, it's one of the better game-based movies, but it is a true disappointment to Silent Hill's avid fans.

1846576520|3.0|This YA (\\"young adult\\") book is packaged with an air of mystery -- its cover art is almost completely neutral and there's no story synopsis anywhere on it. The author (and/or publisher) clearly believes that the reader will be best served not knowing much beyond the fact that the protagonist is a 9-year-old boy named Bruno. However (semi-spoiler alert), most adult readers will very quickly realize that Bruno is the son of a high-ranking Nazi official in wartime Berlin, and that the setting will doubtless be shifting to a concentration camp (both the title and subtle cover art strongly hint at this). And so here is another book to add to the every-expanding Holocaust reading list.<br /><br />The important thing to know is that this very clearly labeled \\"A Fable\\". Some readers may be distracted or put off by some of the story's technical impossibilities (one of which is utterly crucial to the plot) and psychological improbabilities. However, to do so, is to ultimately miss the point. Yes, it is wholly unlikely that the son of a high-ranking Nazi would be oblivious to or unconcerned about the war, or wholly unaffected by the state's propaganda machine. But to mimic reality would also be to rob the narrative of the sense of discovery that makes it rather more compelling than the average Holocaust book. Even knowing everything that's to come, there's a certain grim fascination to be had watching the naive Bruno. Yes he's clueless and selfish and self-absorbed, but he's a 9-year-old boy -- that's to be expected.<br /><br />As the sparse story unfolds, Bruno makes friends with a Jewish boy from Krakow who lives on the other side of a concentration camp fence. This has tragic consequences that are telegraphed very early on and consequently a shock only to those who haven't been paying attention. Its certainly true that plenty of logistical and technical truths have been distorted in the service of the story (most notably the existence of Bruno's Jewish friend, who, due to his age, would have been immediately murdered upon arrival in Auschwitz), but quibbling over the real location of buildings and security arrangements along the fence line doesn't really help anyone trying to grapple with the Holocaust. It is a work of fiction, clearly labeled as such, and so one must allow for such dramatic license.<br /><br />What is somewhat confusing and interesting to contemplate is who exactly this book is intended for. Young readers who aren't familiar with the Holocaust may well enjoy the book as a kind of strange Poe-like horror tale, but aren't going to grasp the larger significance. Nor are they likely to understand how the book works on an allegorical level, where Bruno represents both the average German citizen who was ignorant and then \\"looked the other way\\" when it suited them, as well as the\\"lost generation\\" whose youth was consumed by the war. Similarly Bruno's father represents the true believer who realizes all too late the true cost of his actions. However, I suspect that ending will resonate deeply with younger readers and greatly divide adult readers. It's such a calculated affair that it's either likely to push your buttons perfectly and leave you in tears, or strike you as a mawkish misfire along the lines of drivel such as the film \\"Life in Beautiful.\\" My own take is that while the simple prose and novel narrator make the story compellingly readable, too much of the story is predictable, and ultimately it's probably best left for classroom use.to his age, would have been immediately murdered upon arrival in Auschwitz), but quibbling over the real location of buildings and security arrangements along the fence line doesn't really help anyone trying to grapple with the Holocaust.

0671024256|5.0|Until I read this book, my impression of Stephen King was not very favorable.  I pictured the Sultan of Shock as aloof, moody, self-absorbed, and cocky.  Couldn't have been further from the truth:  Stephen King is one heck of a nice guy, and the book ON WRITING is his personal fireside chat with his readers.<br /><br />King is friendly, funny, honest, and amiable; he gives the impression he'd much rather hang out having coffee with the guys at the local diner than rubbing elbows with literary bluebloods at some black tie affair.  More than that, King displays his passion for writing--a passion that burned deep inside him as a small boy, and a passion that still consumes him.  In the pages of this book the author talks about his life--about what molded and shaped him, what influenced him--and he talks about his love affair with the written word.  Writing's been good to King, so he freely and eagerly shares with his readers several tools of his trade:  from grammar and composition to writing and rewriting manuscripts.  There is no condescension, no brow-beating or lecturing--there is plenty of \\"this worked for me, and here's why.\\"<br /><br />Oh, and Stephen King hates adverbs.  Thought I'd rather handily throw that in.<br /><br />About the only thing I could take issue with is King's rather lackadaisical advice about landing a literary agent (you should be able, he advises, to get one with only \\"moderate\\" trouble, which sure goes against the grain of any experience I've ever had in my writing \\"career\\").  But I'm splitting hairs; ON WRITING is a fun and engaging read, and highly (pardon the adverb) recommended to you aspiring novelists out there.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON

B000059Z8J|5.0|The impact of a film like Superman: The Movie on its genre is immeasurable. Director Richard Donner, an admitted Superman fan, chose to treat the story of the Man of Steel seriously (well, for the most part), and in doing so created a three-act epic. The film is flawless in the first two acts on the planet Krypton with Marlon Brando as Jor-El and in Smallville with Glenn Ford as Pa Kent. In many ways this film is about adoption, about father figures and how they guide and shape us through our lives. While the film gets a little dated when things move to Metropolis, it's still good fun and Hackman's Luthor, while not a fan-favorite portrayal among many comic fans, is comedic gold. Few superhero films have come close to this films epic scope, grandeur, and most of all, its heart.
0425173739|4.0|Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie <br /> <br /> This is one of Agatha Christie's most recognized works. Like most of her mystery works, the plot is built around detective Hercule Poirot. An uncanny sequence of events leaves Poirot on a train on route to London from Istanbul called the Orient Express. The train is forced to make an overnight stop in the middle of its tracks because a snow storm had left a pile up of snow in the upcoming tracks that disallowed the train to continue on its path. That morning, wakes up to find that Ratchett, a man to whom he had refused protection services earlier in the trip because of his reputation of being an evil man, had been stabbed to death. Poirot takes the case and is determined to solve it. As clues, he uses the many peculiar noises that had disturbed his sleep that night and things marked with names and initials that seem to have been left behind by the murderer. But Poirot later finds out that these things are only proof that Ratchett was living with a double identity, a scheme that would have be motivation enough for someone aboard the Orient Express to kill this two-faced man. Who really was this man? And what atrocity could he have committed that required him to change his name and hide his real identity? Before Detective Poirot identifies any suspects, he has to answer those questions. <br />   <br />  The setting, the lead up to the murder, and the never-ending twists make this the great murder mystery that it is. Christie sets up the murder to take place pretty much in the middle of nowhere but at the same time in a civil society. This gives the novel a thrilling and suspenseful ambience of being amongst a murderer in the train in the middle of a snow storm. Christie also makes this novel a page turner by giving each of the characters in the train detailed and consistent characteristics but making it possible for the characters to perform twisting unexpected behavior without losing the reliability of theauthor's character descriptions. Without telling the reader directly, Christie is able to instill the idea that no one on the train may be trusted. Christie makes vivid images of each scene and does not state much directly. She only narrates the character's actions and allows the reader to imply that character's characteristics. By doing this she does not throw off any suggestions at who the guilty or the innocent may be.  <br /> <br /> Of the three Agatha Christie novels I have read, I find Murder on the Orient Express to be the best one. When reading this I felt that I was another detective Poirot on the scene. Because all the facts and details of the plot are not stated and can only be assumed by the reader, I felt that as a reader I was to judge each event as I thought was more logical. It is really the kind of book that grabs you and will not let you go. <br />

1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone is fifteen years, three months, and two days old when he finds his neighbor's dog dead, stabbed with a gardening fork.  Who killed poor Wellington?  And why?  Christopher (against his father's wishes) aims to find out, by playing detective, just like Sherlock Holmes, his hero.  But it is not easy for a young man who abhors change, who can't stand seeing four yellow cars drive by in a row, who can't imagine life outside of Swindon--it's not easy for a young man like Christopher to solve a heinous crime.  But try he will, setting out on a terrifying journey that will lead to revelations about his family, his neighbors, and a poor poodle named Wellington...<br /><br />Mark Haddon's \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is such a uniquely touching novel, it's hard to write up a good summary.  The novel is written in a style seldom seen today, a style that stays true to the narrator (since Christopher doesn't like metaphors--they are lies, and he cannot lie--he uses none, although he will gladly make use of similies, for they are not lies).  \\"Incident\\" is moving, funny, ironic, touching...everything a good novel should be.  Hell, it's even quite a good mystery novel, when you get right down to it.  Haddon has created a wonderful little novel, featuring a truly interesting and realistic narrative voice, and a style that will live on long after you put the book down.  I highly reccommend this one to fans of all literature.
0307276902|5.0|I was introduced to this book by a friend; she told me that the book talked about real issues and problems that many individuals faced throughout their life. As I began to read I realized that she was right and was immediately enthralled by this person, James Frey. Frey is the narrator and protagonist of this novel, he writes in a first person narrative, which makes it feel as if you were there experiencing his pain and journey. The book starts off with James waking up on a plane to find that he has no idea where he is or what he is doing there. All he knows is that he is bloody, smells like urine, and can barely stand up. It ends up that he is being sent, by his family, to a rehabilitation center to help his drug and alcohol addiction. When he enters the clinic they tell him that he has to either become sober right away or die before he reached the age of 24. This was a true test of James will power. In the beginning James suffered with unbearable cravings and sickness, and in need of much physical work. His four front teeth had fallen out, he had a whole in his mouth and it looked like he hadn't eaten in months. He was probably in the worst possible condition a person could be in. After being examined by many psychologists and doctors it was seen that James needed a root canal. The only problem was that if you where a member of the clinic it was prohibited for the doctors to use any sedation to help numb the pain. On the positive side James met many different people, and even falls in love. This book tells about a person's life while being in rehab for six weeks. The author does not butter coat any of the experiences that he had, telling even the most gruesome things. He writes using the exact words that he wanted to, not reframing from using words that may not be appropriate. Throughout reading this book I realized that all of the themes that he used were universal. Everyone at one point has problems in there life that they have to deal with or take control of. From the beginning James takes full responsibility for all of his actions, fighting to resist \\"the fury\\" which was what he called his urges. He claims that not having his addiction makes him have other ones. For example, when James first enters the clinic he tries to satisfy his cravings with food, taking in massive amounts until he would eventually throw up. He soon learns that this problem did not solely pertain to him, but was the answer to satisfying addiction for all of the men at the clinic. The novel also shows that even when everything is bad something good can come out of it. While in the clinic James meets a girl that becomes his girlfriend, with her help he believes that he can become sober and use her love to conquer his addictions.
B00004Z400|5.0|...and you have to admit, they are an amazing band! <br />They started out during the whole NU-Metal days. Don't forget, their debut \\"Adrenaline\\" was infused with some rap/metal sounds, yet very aggressive and hard. But nevertheless, they started out as NU-Metal even though their sound was all together different than their NU-Metal bretheren(Korn, Coal Chamber, Sevendust, Limp Bizkit). From their earlier albums, it was easy to tell that they would go far. <br />Throughout each of their albums, you can hear them progress further and further out from NU-Metal and into a style all their own, a more perfected style. A raw, aggressive voyage that spills onto \\"The White Pony\\", which happens to be their last album where they feature any resemblence to their NU-Metal roots. On this album you can hear that resemblence washing away in a literal digital bath. With their DJ/sampler getting more playtime on their album, and forging a sound that borders on POST-Metal, the Deftones were able to pull themselves out of the NU-Metal rut and evolve their sound and perfect it. Most of \\"The White Pony\\" is sheer beauty, with a few tracks being sheer heavy monsters. A masterpiece I believe, and a cut above their previous two(Around the fur is still amazing though, Adrenaline is okay-its too under-developed and NU-Metalish). Tracks like \\"Digital Bath\\", \\"Teenager\\", \\"Knife-Party\\", \\"Elite\\", \\"Change(in the house of flies)\\" \\"Korea\\", Rx Queen\\" and even \\"Pink Maggot(later called by another name). Even \\"Passenger\\" featuring Maynard James Keenan from Tool is a very good song. The other tunes \\"Feiticeira\\", \\"Street Carp\\" are the only two songs that are only okay. <br />You can really notice the style change on this album. I highly recommend this album.

B0000399WI|4.0|Some friends urged me to watch \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" with them. I did. They think it's the greatest movie ever made. I think it's a fine movie in many ways. But as a writer and former reporter, I notice small details. Too bad the writers of the screen play and the director didn't notice these: <br />1. The movie takes place in Maine, but \\"down east\\" accents are as scarce in it as hen's teeth. The \\"bad guys,\\" that is, all the prison staff from warden on down, plus a few of the prisoners, sound vaguely Southern. The warden sounds especially like a Son of the South when he makes his little speech to the arriving prisoners about the Bible. The movie seems to ridicule both religious beliefs and white Southerners by making the warden a smug, tyrannical hypocrite. <br />2. The lead character was supposedly in the prison for 19 years. How likely is it that the same warden, and the same guards commander, would have been there that whole time (never mind with their appearance hardly changing at all)? I sure don't look like I looked 19 years ago! <br />3. There seem to be a fair number of black men incarcerated in the prison, besides the Morgan Freeman character. I bet in 1947 there weren't as many black people in the whole of Maine as are shown in Shawshank. <br />4. None of the prisoners seem to have any family whatsoever, nor any contact, ever, with an attorney. No visitors, period. I realize things have changed in prisons since the 1940s, but does it seem likely that they were totally at the mercy of the prison administration 24-7? <br />5. Why did the parole boards routinely deny all petitions for parole? That is never even hinted at; I suppose all the members were just no-good so-and-sos who liked to see people suffer. <br />6. When the wrongly convicted banker climbs out of the hole he has chiseled in his cell wall, he has to remove the poster of Raquel Welch to do so. He doesn't go back to replace the poster. But the next day, when the guards find him gone, and the warden in a rage throws the man's rocks against the poster, it's back in place. Did the elves sneak into his cell and paste it back up? <br />Just a few thoughts that occurred to me. Over all, it was an entertaining movie, though. <br /> <br />
0812550706|4.0|The plot, in broad terms is very simple, the Earth has been attacked and must defend itself so, the best young minds are selected and trained to command space fleets in battle.  Orson Scott Card has said that the story started with the idea of the Battle Room, a sphere where three-dimensional, zero gravity warfare is relentlessly practiced.  That room remains the heart of the story.<br /><br />The character of Ender seemed real to me, along with his sister, Valentine, and their close relationship.  Perhaps I have been fortunate with my family and friends but I found the character of Peter, their brother, too evil and vicious for me to accept.<br /><br />Computers have evolved so quickly that they have been a problem for Science Fiction writers.  How do you describe what a computer will be like in 100 years?  Orson Scott Card, writing in 1985, has done well with his description of \\"desks\\" and the network at the battle school.  However, his descriptions of other places in the book were often sketchy.  Also, if you are not a fan of Science Fiction or you have never tried to understand how things work in outer space the descriptions of war games at the battle school might be hard to visualize.<br /><br />While Card is a Mormon, this is not a religious or Christian story.  There is some profanity and a few religious references that some might find offensive.  But, as a lifetime reader of Science Fiction, I recommend Ender's Game to fans of the genre.  It is a thought provoking and enjoyable read--and remember, \\"the enemy's gate is down.\\"<br /><br />Kyle Pratt
B00005UKKF|4.0|I have to admit to being a new Britney fan. I never got into her work until recently when I was listening to a trance remix of one of her songs and all of a sudden I got her music! Don't say she can't sing...the emotional nuances, the tone, and the true sensuality are all rich. You don't sell fifty million records by just being cute to look at, and you don't have to posses the vocal range of an opera singer to be a good singer.You have to mean what you are doing. That said, this dvd shows off the result of what must be ten years of hard work by someone who seems to be a born performer. It's not all my cup of tea but it's one concert dvd that should be in a lot of peoples collections. All performers in it did a top job.

Whether you are gay, straight, or undecided, this is a story about love, the emotion, removing all sexual connotations from its definition. It is the form of love that could happen between two men, as it is represented in the movie, but in its broader sense it is the form of love that can happen between any two people. It is easy to empathize with the loveless wife who sits in the shadows, but maybe one should look at the suffering of all three leads. After all it is not one, but three people who remain unfulfilled, because of the restraints put upon them by a society that tries to define love in what might be a too-limited fashion. To it all add beautiful cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack. If you are watching it with the one you love, or wishing for a love so pure, then watch it...it is very inspirational on many levels. It is hard to imagine a short 65-page story coming together into such a wonderful two hours of sheer entertainment.
B00005NWLO|5.0|I have owned this since it came out on vinyl and still think it was the best live LP ever made. You could not ask for better sound and better \\"punch\\" then this! It really makes the studio recordings of some of the songs sound LAME! Only \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" (Peter Frampton) is even a close second in great live recordings. I love it!
B00005JOYM|4.0|Oliver Stone plays it safe in his sincere and uplifting \\"World Trade Center,\\" the true story of a pair of Port Authority policemen who were trapped with seemingly no hope of rescue after the Twin Towers collapsed on 9/11. Stone, who has a reputation for courting controversy, uncharacteristically avoids making overt political statements in this film. This is a movie about heroes and their families, not about government failures or conspiracies.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is stalwart as Sergeant John McLoughlin who, along with fellow cop William J. Jimeno, was one of the last survivors to be rescued. Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal are appropriately tearful and anxious as McLoughlin and Jimeno's wives.<br /><br />Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey does a brilliant job of visually capturing the horrifying images of that sunny and beautiful day almost five years ago, when terrorists steered two airliners into the World Trade Center's North and South Towers with catastrophic results. The script by Andrea Berloff is less successful; it is filled with stilted dialogue and cliches that weaken the story's impact.  Stone shifts back and forth between the worried families and the two severely injured cops who desperately keep up a running conversation in order to stay awake and boost their shattered spirits.<br /><br />Is \\"World Trade Center\\" worth seeing? For the most part, Stone goes over ground that is familiar to anyone who lived through that fateful day. There is little suspense generated, since most viewers know the outcome in advance. In addition, watching this movie may bring back painful memories that some individuals would rather not relive. Still, this film is a welcome reminder that, even in a world gone mad with hatred and unremitting violence, there are unselfish and courageous people who are willing to risk their lives to help others in need.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|IF you're looking for a farcical, slapstick Will Farrell type comedy, I'll guarantee you WON'T like SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  BUT, if you like wry, subtle humor this movie is worth a look!  I didn't expect much the first time I watched, but SHAUN OF THE DEAD delivered laughs, adventure, romance and realistic characters.  WELL ACTED, WELL SCRIPTED and WELL DONE!  Does require an attention span of more than video game proportions to appreciate the subtle, recuring humor themes throughout the movie.  Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Kate Ashfield are excellent throughout, as are the supporting cast.  Zombies are well done, too--not overblown or overly silly.  Some gore, but nothing gratuitous.  Well edited.  Overall, 2 hours of well acted, quality entertainment!  DVD extras are OK--not great, but the commentary is worth a listen.  Also, the OUTTAKES are rather good.  As a package, this DVD rates FIVE STARS in my book.  The humor doesn't get old or lose it's punch after multiple viewings and the story keeps you entertained through the whole length of the film. <br /> <br />Again, NOT FOR ALL TASTES--if you LIKED the AIRPLANE movies, ANCHORMAN, ELF or similar films, you'll probably NOT \\"get\\" the humor in this movie.  But, if you're like me and you found the aforementioned films to be dull and senseless, then you'll probably find SHAUN OF THE DEAD to be a barrel of laughs (and who doesn't like ZOMBIES????).  Transcends the British/American humor gap as well.  Usually British humor doesn't register with me, but SHAUN OF THE DEAD seemed to hit the mark with a more universal type \\"real world\\" humor.  Overcomes the old \\"two peoples separated by a common language\\" problem as well--no need for a translator!!  Writers made a conscious effort to avoid slang with differing American/British meanings, so everything makes sense no matter which variety of English you speak!   <br /> <br />TO RECAP:  Wry, subtle humor that requires you to pay attention throughout the film--NOT a slapstick, silly comedy.  Lots of zombie action with traditional zombies--nothing overly silly.  Well acted, realistic, real world characters you can relate to.  Well scripted, well edited and entertaining!  Even has a HAPPY ENDING!  FIVE STARS! <br /> <br />

0312330537|5.0|When was the last time you read an epic? More pertinently, when was the last time you read a contemporary book that you would label an epic? It's been a while for me for sure, a fact that tremendously highlighted the pleasure I derived from this book. <br /> <br />[The focus of this review is going to be only the quality of writing, and the wave of feelings precipitated by this book. There's enough been said about the story, and I really want to share how this book made me feel instead.] <br /> <br />So let's start at the very beginning - the opening sentence of the book: \\"It took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured\\". And the last line of the first page: \\"So it begins, this story, like everything else - with a woman, a city, and a little bit of luck.\\" How can one not get hooked to a book which promises to be so artless and almost adolescent in its outlook, combining naiveté with world-weary wisdom as only a few people can at any point in their entire life? <br /> <br />Don't jump to conclusions though - the book is far from being \\"soft\\". On the same page, Roberts writes about being \\"chained on three continents, beaten, stabbed, and starved.\\" And this is where the power of the book lies - it can be simple, and startlingly explosive, all at the same time. In part that's attributable to the roller-coaster life the author lead, but it would be unfair to take credit away from Roberts' writing capabilities. In the hands of a lesser writer, this could easily have been over-the-top trash. <br /> <br />My favourite attribute of the book though, is its vivid delineation of Bombay. The book brought to light aspects of Bombay that most people don't hear about ever, and very few see, but which I had caught glimpses of constantly from the corner of my eyes, and was sure were there. Many a time when I had sat at Leopold's, I had noticed the incongruity of the place and suspected that there was more to it than met the eye. It was impossible to escape the subtle undercurrent of misdemeanors, and this book throws the curtains back and shows explicitly how deep the rabbit hole really went. From Colaba to Dharavi, from high-rises to rat-infested gullies, Roberts' portrait of the city's attitude, its mood, its character, is impeccable. And the smell, the smell - I used to think it I was imagining it, but I'm glad to learn that I'm not the only one.  <br /> <br />The greatest achievement of this book, for me, was actually not its vivid description of Bombay, but the fact that it actually made me nostalgic for a city I can't bear to be in. When was the last time a book made you feel like that? <br /> <br />Get this book.

0803730470|5.0|We read lots and lots of books to our 2 year old daughter and I've never written a review before but this book really knocked our socks off.  We LOVE this book in our house. It is not only fun for my daughter, who loves it when we use different voices for each of the characters, but is fun for us... So many books for this age group, particularly board books, are really boring after several reads.  Even one of my all-time-favorite books from my childhood, \\"The Monster at the End of this Book\\" gets a bit wearing after the umpteenth read.  But this one always stays fresh.  This and \\"Is Your Mama A Lama\\" are at the top of our list, fun for a two year old and fun for the parents too.  Get this book.  You won't be disappointed.
B000244FDW|3.0|What can I say? I got through it, but certain moments creeped me out when they would have the goofy music and Mr. Darcy would freeze pose. He was not engaging at any point, which I suppose may have been intended...perhaps we are to see this version as Elizabeth changing her perception of him without him ever having changed. One point of view, I guess. But I recommend other adaptations out there above this one.

0790737345|3.0|This 1998 romantic drama is as fanciful as fantasy movies come, and John Seale's beautiful cinematography goes a long way toward creating the dream-like quality essential to pull this type of movie off. Director Brad Silberling and screenwriter Dana Stevens have decided to amplify the romantic elements of Win Wenders' wondrous 1987 classic, \\"Wings of Desire\\", but stick to the basic plot elements. The transatlantic adaptation is not altogether successful because the greater themes of immortality and human fallibility in the original film have been submerged in favor of more individualized needs like sensuality and love. The thematic change trivializes the film into little more than a piece of romantic whimsy.<br /><br />Now set in Los Angeles, the plot focuses on an angel named Seth who walks freely among the living and remains unseen unless he so desires. He gets drawn to Maggie Rice, an exacting surgeon who loses her first patient on the operating table. In the middle of her personal crisis, Seth comes into her life filling an emotional void, setting the stage for the pivotal decision he needs to make - remaining immortal as an angel or becoming human to experience the passion he feels for Maggie. Luckily, in probably her best dramatic performance, Meg Ryan is especially resonant as Maggie as she mutes her natural sprite-like manner into a palpable sadness that fits the character.<br /><br />With a part that risks skirting parody during the first half, a steadily unblinking Nicolas Cage plays Seth in a plaintive, child-like manner until the story moves toward its inevitable climax. I still find it difficult to believe that Seth's discomforting, Norman Bates-like manner would provide such a powerful attraction to Maggie at the outset. I also think the ending plot manipulations are a botch, a contemptible attempt to twist the viewer into thinking a greater point has been made when in fact, the viewer has been sucker-punched. Andre Braugher's becalming manner is used to good effect as fellow angel Cassiel, and Dennis Franz is appropriately ostentatious as a junk-food-addicted hospital patient who is not what he appears to be. By the way, the interiors of the San Francisco Main Library (opened two years before) never looked better than under the guise of LA's in this movie.<br /><br />There are a surprising number of extras for such an early release DVD (1998) with three separate commentary tracks, the first by Silberling, the second by Stevens and co-producer Charles Roven, and the third by composer Gabriel Yared. Seale and production designer Lilly Kilvert contribute select-scene commentaries on the other side of the disc. There are two featurettes - a half-hour making-of documentary called \\"Making Angels\\" and a ten-minute short focused strictly on the visual effects. Seven deleted scenes, two music videos (including the Goo Goo Dolls' then-omnipresent MTV hit, \\"Iris\\"), and the theatrical trailer round out the major DVD extras.sed to good effect as fellow angel Cassiel, and Dennis Franz is appropriately ostentatious as a junk-food-addicted hospital patient who is not what he appears to be.

B0007PAMR4|5.0|This movie is so amazing.  The special effects are so advanced for its time and the premise is spectacular.  A young man finding out that he may or may not be the messiah for a certain people.  The story line and the characters are well-written and well-acted.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good intellectually stimulating film.
B00005MP58|4.0|This version succeeds despite a few problems, such as Mrs. Bennet's shrill voice which I don't recommend when you have a headache or are stressed. She is a little over the top for me, though if there were less of her voice, it would be okay. I always either turn down or mute those parts or fast forward through them now. Other versions have a far more pleasing interpretation of Mrs. Bennet while still conveying her character as Austen wrote it. The dramatic change from one Darcy to another is a little hard to believe. One wonders how his change, which seems so sincere, could have been so dramatic. However, the changed Darcy here is utterly charming and I am always willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy it. This should be in your collection.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Its been 5 years (2001) when I played Silent Hill the game on PlayStation 1. Its THE game of horror. Nothing else comes close. NOTHING. When I heard they were making a movie, I was psyche to see it. The makers of the movie truly captured the specific details from the game and put it on the movie. I enjoyed watching this movie. Its sick. Its true Horror. Well done movie. Also, an excellent game from Konami.<br /><br />True fans love it but non fans don't like it. Tell you what guys(non fans), play Silent Hill on PS1 by yourself during the night when its all dark and and try to finish the whole game. From beginning to end. It will be quite a frighting experience you will ever have, seriously. At least play halfway of the game then watch the movie for its appreciation.<br /><br />It is meant for the fans that actually played the game, you know.
B000002GB9|5.0|This is my second favorite Styx album (Pieces Of Eight being my favorite) This album released July 7, 1977 (7/7/77) finally gave Styx the breakthough they deserved. With hits like \\"Come Sail Away\\" and Fooling Yourself\\". You can help but just sit back and enjoy this album because there isn't really a bad song on it.    Here are my ratings:    1. Grand Illusion (16/10) The two guitar solos in this song a awesome. The little featurette of John Panozzo's drums in the middle is a nice touch. Helped Out by some beautiful lyrics and singing by Dennis DeYoung. In a song of a warning to the strength of the media.    2. Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man) (22/10) Some beatiful keyboard and singing work by Dennis DeYoung and an acoustic guitar touch from Tommy Shaw adds a nice touch. A great song    3. Superstars (12/10) A nice song overall but nothing truly featured just the lyrics which is just fine by me. Still a very good song. Sung by Dennis DeYoung.    4. Come Sail Away (30/10) Enough Said.    5. Miss America (14/10) A nice growling rocker written and sung by James Young with some more nice keyboard work by Dennis DeYoung. John Panozzo's drums are excellent addition in this song.    6. Man In The Wilderness (13/10) Extremely great vocals by Dennis DeYoung especially at the end. The dual guitar solo is absolutely breathtaking.    7. Catsle Walls (9/10) A little concept song but still pretty good.    8. Grand Finale (8/10) Basically a slower version/remix of Grand Illusion but still a very good way to finish the album.    So there you have it a spectacular album by a spectacular band. Buy it today.
0385338082|5.0|Can You Keep a Secret? is a charming novel written by Sophie Kinsella that tells an excellent story and was thoroughly enjoyable to read.  Emma Corrigan is a typical, young woman in the working environment whose life drastically changes after an encounter on an airplane.  Emma spills all of her personal information to her neighbor on the airplane due to the fear of losing her life, but fortunately it was only turbulence.  After the terrifying experience, Emma later finds out that all of the personal and secretive information she let out to was her boss, Jack Harper.  You must read the novel to find out what unfolds after her life altering experience and the problems Emma must face and the relationships that end up prospering.  Emma Corrigan is a character that allows you to laugh at her easygoing personality, yet the reader can learn from her mistakes that she has made in both the business and social environments.  At times you must feel some sympathy for the experiences that Emma has been put into, but overall she is a dynamic character with great personality traits.  Jack Harper, Emma's boss, is a millionaire, yet he does not flash his wealth to the general public.  He can be perceived as deceitful at times, but he is usually a caring or compassionate person, and an ideal boyfriend.  I chose to read this novel because I have loved reading previous books by Sophie Kinsella including The True Confessions of a Shopaholic, Shopaholic takes Manhattan, and Shopaholic Ties the Knot.  Can You Keep a Secret? was extremely entertaining, fun and pleasurable to read, but I can only recommend this book to the female teenagers, because this book is considered a romance novel and there is no fighting, police chases or other adventure scenes that would entice the male audience.  The book is easy and straightforward in following the plot development.  It is virtually impossible for a teenager's mind to wonder while reading this book.  I was so enthralled and I could not wait for the events to unfold.  Every young girl should be captivated with Sophie Kinsella's great storyline and immense attention to detail.  The style that Sophie Kinsella uses is clear, but she is a British author so at times you have to make the connection that Mum is equivalent to Mom, or pounds is equivalent to our dollar.   This novel completely satisfied my desire, and I am content with my decision in choosing to read it.  I am usually counting the pages of each chapter to see if I am near the end, but with this book I actually did not want to put it down or for it to come to a close.  After completing the novel, I have already recommended this book to several of my friends encouraging them to read it as well.  Can You Keep a Secret? is considered one of New York Times Bestsellers and I look forward to reading The Undomestic Goddess and Shopaholic and Sister by Sophie Kinsella in the future.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I found this adaptation to race along from beginning to end, and in the process I believe it sacraficed some much-needed build-up that we find in the BBC/A&E version. We don't get a sense of the time that has passed during which characters are ruminating on what is happening and their feelings about it. We just get scene by scene thrown at us and we are expected to be carried along and believe it. The cinematography is excellent in many parts. The acting is good, but Keira Knightly always has that smirk on her face and after awhile I wonder why it is there so much. Although she holds her own, I was not always drawn in to her performance...or I was drawn in but wasn't sure what I found there. This definitely had a more romantic and sensual feel that other versions have not. I do wish there had been more build-up of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy that would make their falling in love more believable. I always feel that on Darcy's part there is not enough conveyance of what he is attracted to when he is attracted to justify the passion in the end. I did find Mrs. Bennet to be far less shrill and irritating than in other adaptations which was a big plus. I also liked the character of Charlotte here very well. All of the laughing and giggling at the Bennet house was a bit over the top.

B00005JKGK|5.0|This film reveals the complex mother-daughter relationships of four Chinese families whose roots from the past intertwine within the present causing conflicts and misunderstandings in their lives. Once the stories from the past are told and understood within the context of ancient Chinese culture and values, the mother-daughter bonds of love become even stronger and indestructable.<br /><br />The stories of the four mothers are told from the cultural viewpoint of the past as flashbacks throughout the film. The viewer learns boys are more revered than girls, a daughter is given in an arranged marriage to a boy from a wealthy family and she is expected to be obedient to her husband and servile to her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law expects a grandchild and blames the daughter-in-law for failing to produce offspring, not recognizing or accepting her son's part in the problem. This particular story was cleverly resolved and had a happy ending due to the creative efforts of the daughter-in-law who used superstition, religion, and cultural values to get out of this unhappy marriage. In another life story, a young attractive daughter is raped by a wealthy businessman, her parents disown her not believing this story. They thought she allowed herself to be seduced due to his wealth. To sustain herself, she became his fourth wife, a concubine but also produced a son, an heir ...whom the first wife took ownership of, as if he were her son. The real mother was not allowed near her own child. Eventually, she proved herself a worthy daughter by a sacrificial ceremony done for her dying mother. Later she reunitd with her first child, a daughter, whom she raised within the businessman's household where the mother enacted an even more heartbreaking sacrifice ...<br /><br />All the stories from the past are connected in some way with the problems the Chinese daughter's are experiencing in their adult lives. Through flashbacks in time, each daughter recalls her own past and how she felt pushed to do things for her mother, trying to please her, yet feeling unworthy. The film blends the stories of all the characters in a very creative and unique manner helping the viewer understand how the context of Chinese culture became the foundation of love on which all their lives are based.<br /><br />June one of the American-raised Chinese daughters begins telling her story and the relationhship and conflicts with her mother who had recently passed away. The roots of the misunderstandings become more clear as the viewer learns about June's mother's life in China ...

B00006FDCD|3.0|Recent remakes of old Stephen King movies (i.e. Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Shinning) have been relatively well done and entertaining, but if any others should be made ... IT should defineately be at the top of the list. I saw this movie back in the early 90s and thought it was good. I have since read the novel and recently rewatched IT again, and found a lot of the scenes to be incredibly cheesy and poorly made. There was an incredible amount of important material in the novel which was missing in the film and the changes that were made between the novel and the movie were NOT for the better. Yes, I give lots of props to Tim Curry and a few of the performances by the kid actors stood out, but overall, looking back, this movie could of been so much better.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|This is an amazing work of art. A must buy for anyone who loves westerns. (Anyone who loves Sergio Leone already has it.) The documentary is interesting also. It is all testosterone, however, so if you do not like that sort of thing (not necessarily that your are a \\"chick\\"), you will hate this movie and not appreciate the art. If you liked the Clint Eastwood westerns (especially Good, Bad, Ugly, done by Leone), this is your next step. Big Characters and Big Themes, done Big, but beautifully well. <br /> <br />Note: the sound synch was off on my disk and the words did not match the lips. That may be part of the original, however, as they did not record the sound on the set. Do not watch the lips or you will be driven to distraction.
B00005K9LK|5.0|This is a great cd, what do you expect it's Judas Priest isnt it? I love this cd and it really is awesome. My favorites are 'you've got another thing comin' and 'Take these chains' but I really like the entire cd, I know it's hard to find a cd without out any fillers and this cd doesnt have very many if any. I greatly recommend this cd, you wont be sorry.
044100590X|4.0|I am not going to rehash what others have said about Dune.  But,  I will construct some pros and cons (from what I remember reading it only once, so far).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1)  Complex political world that spawned many other writers of today (Robert Jordan, for one)<br /><br />2)  Imagination before his time : the CHOAM institute, the self-sustaining spacesuits etc.<br /><br />3)  As someone referred to: the JEdi-like powers of the Mentats and Bene Gesserits.  However, people forget, that Herbert wrote this book BEFORE Lucas' Star Wars world erupted.<br /><br />4) the in-depth cultures, I wanted to know more about them.<br /><br />5) the beautifully written sceneries, albiet sometimes too short.<br /><br />6)  the usages of his characters' powers are nicely done.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1)  The characters are not as fleshed out as they can be, but this is NOT a character world.  It's a plot/political and scenery novel.<br /><br />2)  the battle action scenes were not as well described as I liked.<br /><br />3)  the powers of the characters were too quickly developed.  One day, Paul was a normal guy, and then he became a Prophet? Without background to this? Hello? No description of his dreams? His actual events that took him to become the Prophet?<br /><br />Overall though, Dune's prose is excellent, story telling is superb and it's a highly creative piece of work. Not a masterpiece, but close to it.

B000068FUS|5.0|Everything by DBT is worth listening to. It's about time a tribute record came out that wasn't all lousy covers of timeless songs. DBT wrote their own and play it their way. All 3 of the singers are great in their own way but Patterson is king. <br />
0060837020|5.0|The hot steam rising off the streets of New York City and the buzz of the Rosenberg case emitting from the radios and televisions laid the foundations for the fragile construct of what became known as Ester Greenwood's Bell Jar. It serves as a euphemism for the period in Ester's life that captures within its confines her gradual breakdown. Ester Greenwood was an aspiring, appraised writer who was sent to New York for a month long internship at an esteemed women's magazine, an opportunity which ensured her job security in the future, fine clothing, food, and accommodations, and the opportunity to work with a renowned editor by the name of Jay Cee. In a situation devised to launch Ester's burgeoning career and future, Ester breaks down to the point she can no longer read, write, or function. What brought about such a decline in what appeared to be such a firm, confident woman?  <br />  <br /> Sylvia Plath eloquently paints the decline of Ester Greenwood in the novel because it is a self-portrait of her life and her past. The revolutionary work depicts a witty, insightful caricature of Sylvia Plath and her deep, dark struggle with accepting the role of a mother and wife, fulfilling society's expectations. Ester's rebellion against the confines of the female spirit entraps her in the Bell Jar, a world that restrains her from attaining her intellectual and career goals. This invisible barrier leads Ester to thoughts of suicide and self-deprecation. Her relations with her family, friends, and lovers are caught in the web of her confusion, and as the web become more complex, Ester's thoughts become darker and she plummets further into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Plath so expressively elaborates the decline of Ester and constructs the perfect conditions for her downfall. From the setting of the hot, steamy, bustling New York City streets to the calmly eerie street her mother lives on, Ester's surroundings depict her own feelings and state of mind. She begins in a state of confusion but relative bliss in her plush New York City hotel, to isolation and dreary thoughts of various deaths she could incur while staring out the window alone in her mother's quiet house. Ester's talk about alcoholic beverages additionally gives insight into her state of mind, when she goes from craving soothing, cooling drinks that appeal to her like vodka, to craving a wet and depressing drink that \\"tasted more and more like dead water\\".  <br /> <br /> The honesty with which Plath portrays Ester, stripping her down to flesh and bone, exposing every daring, suicidal, morbid thought that dashed through her mind, to her random revelations, allows for anyone to find some channel to connect with Ester. The confidence of the reader is won over by her modesty and frank nature, making them vulnerable to her spell. Under the pseudonym of Ester in The Bell Jar, Plath paints the inspiring and intriguing story of a renaissance woman.  In every sense of the word she is a woman; she resisted male domination and spun a raw, uncensored and unsweetened depiction of the effects of society on a young, defenseless woman.  <br />

B000002GVO|3.0|I love The Eagles as much as anyone, but this album marked the end of what I loved about the Eagles.  As a huge fan of Country-Rock and especially Southern California Country Rock, this album was a step in the direction of commercialism, and a \\"step in the face\\" of pre-Hotel California Eagles fans.  Before this album The Eagles were the ideal Country-Rock band.  Bernie Leadon(Ex-Flying Burrito Bro.) helped in defining some of those early sounds.  Of course the record company wanted The Eagles to take their music in a more mainstream direction. So they dropped Leadon, and they also dropped their country sound.  Hotel California is no doubt a great album in many respects, but true Country_Rockers should turn their ears in the direction of Poco, The Pure Prairie League, Firefall, The Flying Burrito Bros, The Byrds, Gram Parsons, Ian Matthews, and Buffalo Springfield.... and the first four Eagles albums

0743455967|5.0|This is such a wonderful book on a variety of levels.  What is most appealing about King's teachings and musings is that it has something for everyone.  I don't consider myself much of a King fan, but this book led me in the direction to take more of an interest in his other works.  King's book offers readers a variety of life lessons interspersed with personal anecdotes that make the book informative and thoroughly entertaining.  Furthermore, it doesn't disappoint when it comes to giving insight to the physical writing process.<br /><br />Bottom line:  It is a wonderfully written, entertaining and compelling work for a vast number of not only writers interested in better understanding the craft, but casual readers alike.  This book is well worthy of a five star review.
1881273156|5.0|The five love languages is one of those books that helps you really  understand the people you love in your life. Gary Chapman shows you how to understand and speak the language of love. Not in the way you understand it, but in the way the other person understands it. This way, you are speaking their lanquage and communication becomes clear. Why clean the house for your wife, if her love language is NOT acts of service. But if her love language is touch and you sit by her on the couch and hold her hand, you will be reaching her in a way that is meaningful to her. Like wise, touching your husband all day long may turn him off if his love language is words of affirmation. A wonderful tool for enhancing any relationship.
B000FVBLEI|4.0|All That Remains has been flying under the radar for a couple of years now...And the Fall of Ideals just may be the release that pushes them closer to the spotlight in the metal genre.  Although the sound of this album is much much much different than that of the previous release (The Darkened Heart), it's a good change, and one that I think, with a little improvement, will take the group to amazing things in the next few years.  There are some stand-out tracks on this album, most specifically; This Calling, Dwells in me, The Weak Willed, and Become the Catalyst.  And a few sub-par songs such as; Whispers, and Six.   <br /> <br />Altogether the cd sounds very well put together...the lyrics are motivational and powerful.  The melodies are catchy and unforgettable.  Granted, the songs kind of follow a set pattern (at least, most of them do) hence why I only gave this album 4 stars instead of 5. It's pretty predictable: Hardcore opening, about 45-70 seconds in then the chorus, another hardcore verse, the chorus again, a guitar solo around 2 1/2 minutes. Etc, etc, etc. <br /> <br />Overall, the cd sound good, and really deserves more credit than it's being given. Can't wait to see what this band can come up with down the road.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|I love this movie, It is an action pacted rollercoaster ride.
0156030306|4.0|When I was in fifth grade I found an excerpt from Flowers for Algernon in our textbook. I found the piece quite interesting but I knew that it was a more advanced book so I waited to read it. I finally bought and read it a few years later.  <br /> Flowers for Algernon is about Charlie Gordon, a mentally challenged individual in his thirties. As a child his mother treated him harshly because he was not a normal kid. He wishes to be smart so he can impress his family that sent him away and understand the jokes his friends make. Charlie learns of an experiment that will make him smarter, he eagerly accepts. The experiment has never been done before on a human making Charlie the first. At the lab there is a mouse named Algernon, who can beat Charlie at solving puzzles. Charlie becomes angry that he can be beat by a mouse , but he later finds out that Algernon also has had his intelligence increased. Charlie's intelligence increases beyond the expectations of the scientists. He becomes a genius, smarter than the scientists that experimented on him. He experiences love, learning, and a life he could never imagine, until Algernon's intelligence and temper quickly disintegrate. Charlie wonders what will happen to him and if he will be able to hold on to his intelligence.  <br /> Charlie, the main character, is faced with many difficulties in his life, being mentally retarded and then becoming too smart to have conversations with others. He experiences both sides of the intellectual field. When he is dumb he looks up to those smarter than him and idolizes them. He knows he is different and wants to become like those around him. The simple people around him make jokes about him, but he feels they are his friends because they laugh with him. When Charlie becomes smarter he realizes they were making fun of him. As he surpasses the scientists in intelligence he feels disappointed because he once believed them to be great minds, capable of doing anything.  Daniel Keyes illustrates that mentally challenged people know they are different and wish to be normal. They may not be able to become smarter but they can see their weaknesses.  <br /> This book is an easy read because it is written in as a journal. In the beginning the entries are poorly spelled and have terrible grammar. As he progressively gets smarter the entries become more intelligent and better worded. I liked the style because it was realistically written. Daniel Keyes writes it so you can see the progression of Charlie's mind as he becomes smarter. The style is colloquial because it is as if Charlie is writing in his journal.  <br /> I enjoyed this book because it was written from Charlie's standpoint. He did not beg for pity or lament over his condition. He simply wished to be smarter and took a chance at fulfilling his wish. I would recommend this book because it illustrates difficulties of the two extremes of human intelligence.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|first off, let me say that i'm quite upset with all the comparisons that are being made with 30STM. personally, i think that 30STM has one of the most unique sounds out there today. i couldn't possibly have asked for anything better. also, who cares if jared leto is an actor gone musician, obviously he didn't pick up the guitar over night because these are instruments being played, not some techno will smith/jennifer lopez bull****. bottom line is, get this album. i highly recommend adding it to your collection.

B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|I thought this was a reasonably good show.  Selleck's performance was great and I thought this was a great character for him.  I'm not sure why this is packaged with an R rating.  The content is pure made for TV content.  TV 14 would be more appropriate.
0743454537|4.0|I was impressed with Picoult's writing and treatment of this very delicate subject.  The two main protagonists, Kate and Anna, are sisters.  Kate has leukemia. Anna was genetically selected from a myriad of embryos and then conceived by her parents to be an exact donor match to Kate. What started out as an original intent to donate to Kate Anna's umbilical cord blood after Anna was born snowballs out of control.  Anna becomes a perpetual donor of bone marrow, granulocytes and other blood-related components that help keep Kate alive.  The family is pitted against one another after Anna files suit for medical emancipation to keep her parents from deciding for her whether she should be a donor of one of her kidneys.<br /><br />There are several subplots that make the story interesting and it moves along quickly.  First, there is a long-standing (albeit somewhat contrived and a bit unrealistic) love story going on between Anna's attorney (who himself has an undisclosed but serious illness) and another person who ends up being very important to Anna as her lawsuit unfolds. Another major subplot is the significance of Jesse's juvenile delinquency (Jesse is the brother of Anna and Kate).  His rebelliousness is borne of the fact that everyone in the home is \\"invisible\\" except Kate.  (In Jesse's world, his parents focus every day, every hour, and every moment on what Kate needs and how Kate feels)<br /><br />Picoult does a good job of shedding light on the dysfunction within a family that comes from such an unfair and debilitating illness of a dearly loved child.<br /><br />What makes the story most shocking, however, is the ending. You never see the ending coming, and it is such a significant twist that you will never look at life the same again.
B000E33VWW|3.0|Fortunately, I bought it cheap - and it remains on my \\"mediocre\\" DVD shelf. I guess I should have taken more hints from the title. It's mostly about CAPOTE, not the murderers. Hoffman deserved that oscar, but I was just a little bored with the story.<br /><br />After reading \\"In Cold Blood,\\" I was really intrigued with the Clutter family, the setting, the method of the murders, and the murderers themselves. We got to see a little of Perry in the movie, but not much of Dick.  And it seemed as if the filmmakers wanted us to sympathize with the murderers and not look as closely to their victims.<br /><br />I must admit I sympathized with Perry a little, not for getting caught and imprisoned, but because Capote was using him and lying to him for his book. The lie about not knowing what the title was called especially irritated me. If he's going to make an effort to write about a crime truthfully, he could at least be honest with the subjects of his writing.<br /><br />I did appreciate the violent flashbacks, but I wished those scenes had been extended. Crime scenes fascinate me, as I'm sure they do others, and I bet I wasn't the only disappointed viewer.<br /><br />It's nice to know that Capote was as self-centered, whiny, and elitist as I thought he was. I wanted to smack him when he barely gave any attention to his best friend's (Harper Lee) book and movie. Like he didn't consider \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" good literature, \\"real\\" art, intellectual, or whatever.<br /><br />And yes, I think the criminals deserved the death penalty. Oh wait, hanging is so cruel and unusual, some might say. Well, what about the brutal slayings? Propping up the son's head with a pillow \\"for his comfort\\" didn't make the crimes any less cruel. If you're truly concerned with someone's comfort, then don't harm them at all.<br /><br />In general - interesting, but not nearly as creepy and haunting as the book.
0451457994|5.0|2001: A Space Odyssey is a captivating novel by Arthur C. Clarke that combines fictitious past and futuristic events in a mind-boggling novel. The book, which is a more enriched account than the movie, also co-written by Clarke, explores the unknown possibilities of both space and technology. Although perhaps farfetched, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a fantastically illustrious novel which should be read by all.  <br /> <br />After buying 2001 I was skeptical that I would enjoy the novel but had heard Arthur C. Clarke's name repeatedly and of the infamous, antagonistic computer named Hal and decided to give it a shot. My expectations were low despite the novel's fame. My thoughts were that it would be an obsolete piece of science fiction because of its 1968 publication. I was pleasantly surprised to read a story which would most likely never become old-fashioned because of its realistic depictions of space and exciting near extinction of prehistoric man. I found that 2001: A Space Odyssey was an enjoyable, quick read, and one of few science fiction books that I would recommend others to read. <br /> <br />The novel starts out telling the story of Moon-Watcher, a man-ape, of a dwindling race that is endangered by most of the prehistoric animals and restricted to collecting berries and vegetation. The race is soon encountered by a large metallic monolith which prods their minds and seeing their potential, teaches them the use of tools which help the survival and eventual evolution into the present day human. The novel then continues with the discovery of a powerful magnetic anomaly on the moon which discharges a loud noise and wave signal when dug up. The signal was traced to Saturn and the earth dispatched a crew with the extremely advanced computer named Hal. While three of the crew slept in hibernation for the arrival, David Bowman and Frank Poole are in charge of the day-to-day operation overview while Hal takes care of most of the major procedures. Everything occurs without failure until a device needs replacement outside the ship and Poole is killed by a straying pod, a bizarre accident that has Bowman worried about Hal. After sending word home that the device was in fact working and the second was said to be failing as well, Bowman decides to shut down Hal. Hal, not wanting to be shut down, decides to deal with matters as he wishes. Bowman struggles for his life and the journey to discover of what lies on the moon of Saturn. <br /> <br />The development of characters in 2001: A Space Odyssey is especially important in Moon-Watcher and Bowman. Both are found experiencing completely new scenarios of momentous magnitude and pass their trials to help advance the human race. Humans are developed throughout the novel from the first fully-standing man-ape, to the present inquisitive race, to something far beyond.  <br /> <br />Clarke's style is extremely descriptive and imaginative. His insight to the many characters gets the reader interested promptly and his fast pace keeps the novel moving quickly. 2001: A Space Odyssey is certainly a science fiction classic which has and will capture the interest of many for years to come.  <br />
6305428425|5.0|Love that quote. I actually had mono in college and lost about 10 pounds, but I wouldn't recommend it as a diet. Anyway, my college roommate and I would watch this movie when fighting stress, trying to hide from stupid people at college, and for relaxation (which means that we watched it about every other week).  A most necessary escapism!<br /><br />The opening scene, in which R & M are making fun of \\"Pretty Woman\\" (\\"As if the salesgirls there aren't bigger whores than she is\\"....\\"i get so happy when they let her shop!\\") is pretty much evocative of the whole movie - comparing themselves with other women, shopping for jobs and men.<br /><br />Another great scene is when they're at the club, looking for suitable men, and Romy gets away from one guy with the excuse, \\"I cut my foot before, and my shoe is filling up with blood.\\"<br /><br />A wonderful movie in general, especially for individualists who were never part of cliques, who despise people that still grade others with shallow high school hierarchy systems.<br /><br />Laugh outloud funny, and Janeane Garafalo's character is a perfectly independent blend of bitterness, sarcasm, and bitchiness. \\"This dress exacerbates the genetic betrayal that is my legacy.\\"<br /><br />Especially enjoyed the 80s high school flashbacks. Dressing like Madonna for the prom, happily basking in their fashion skills and originality (but of course Billy had to ruin it). When one of the A-list crowd put the magnets on Romy's back, it was so tragic. As Michele said later, \\"You couldn't help that you had scoliosis!\\" Duh! Bullies who pick on people for traits that they cannot change should be dragged out into the street and shot (Garfield used to say that, I believe).<br /><br />The reunion itself is both sad and a relief. The post-it notes lie was taken advantage of by the knocked-up Chrissy, who should be a laughingstock herself just for being pregnant and having a husband who's an alcoholic and manwhore (and who was never cute, in my opinion). Well, she does end up a laughingstock by the end of the movie, when the wind from the helicopter blows up her dress. Ha!<br /><br />Also, Chrissy never satisfied her dreams of becoming a news anchorwoman/weatherwoman because of marrying early (which is rarely a smart idea), effectively forcing herself into a little hole - unlike Romy and Michele, who have lived as they wanted to live, have had fun even though they aren't \\"successful\\" in the eyes of the world.<br />[...]y the end of the movie, when the wind from the helicopter blows up her dress.

B000E6ESL2|5.0|Stay is the story of Sam Foster, a psychiatrist played by Ewan McGregor, who is introduced to a suicidal patient by the name of Henry Letham (played by Ryan Gosling). As Sam and Henry get to know one another, the line between what is real and what isn't becomes blurred. By the end of the film, the viewer feels as Sam and Henry do; confused, cloudy and like they are living in a dream.<br /><br />Stay is one of the most visually stunning, dreamlike, hypnotic, and brilliant pieces of film you will ever have the pleasure of viewing. The story moves along with such grace and surreality that the viewer begins to feel a part of the film. Every aspect of the movie is crafted with perfection. There is not a second of film or note of music that does not, in some way, stimulate the mind and enhance the story. The attention to detail in Stay is shocking compared to what generally passes as movie making.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Ryan Gosling deliver acting brilliance, and are joined by the exceptional performances of Naomi Watts and Bob Hoskins. There isn't a misplaced line, or unbelievable moment in the film.<br /><br />Where Stay excels is at creating an intense experience; an immersion in the story that lacks in most modern films. I felt completely lost to myself while watching the movie. Few films deliver such immersion.<br /><br />Some will say that the film is \\"complicated\\" or \\"artsy.\\" There are many pretentious films that exist to call attention to the director/writer/producer, etc. Stay is not one of them. Every second of film in Stay is crafted to enhance the story, and enhance the story it does.<br /><br />This is not a film for everyone, and I can see where some may not like it. Stay is non-linear, like great poetry, music, art and life. It does not go where you want it to go, or where so many films have conditioned our mind that it should go. Stay stays on its own course, and in doing so treats you to a haunting movie experience that you will not soon forgot, and a movie you will watch over and over again.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 100<br /><br />50 (out of 50).

B00003CXAT|5.0|I read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards.  A few of the characters were switched around, but I was so impressed with the adaptation. A thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy - the kids in the kitchen scene and when Mr. Arnold's arm drops on Ellie's shoulder as she's trying to turn the generator back on, for example. There have been countless lines I've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times, due to my obsession.<br /><br />And after watching it more than 25 times, I've come to appreciate it more. Great cast - Sam Neil is my favorite. Richard Attenborough is a little too cute and nice, but I liked his white clothing, the hat, and the amber cane. Wayne Knight was incredible as Nedry, the slob. He's as likeable as ever, though somewhat the villain. I always hate it when he dies. Jeff Goldblum fit the description of Ian Malcom from Crichton's novel well. Crichton sparked my interest in Chaos Theory, sometimes called The Butterfly Effect. I am a firm believer in it. And of course, in the novel and film, Malcolm was right. \\"Life finds a way...\\"<br /><br />(In Chaos Theory, the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions, and \\"random\\" --unpredictable-- events result from the \\"normal\\" equation/setup, because there is never a fixed set of outcomes; the system is unpredictable because of its complexity. Hammond thought his system was without error, that he was in complete control. He believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female, but he was wrong - the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian DNA that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA. This DNA gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce, \\"survive,\\" in a single-sex environment. And it turned out that Hammond was wrong about many other equations - things are not as black and white as he thought, and it is problematic to predict long-term behavior of his animals.)<br /><br />Love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet.<br /><br />We watched the Mr. DNA segment in a high school biology class. I've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated (though I found Mr. Hammond's live speaking lines to be unrealistic...was he really planning to be there for each tour?).<br /><br />The kids were kind of annoying. I didn't notice this until I was a little older, but Lex (\\"I prefer to be called a hacker\\") uses Silicon Graphics' 3D file system navigator to turn power back on in the park.

B000FUF6QS|5.0|It is very important that you purchase the version of this film that runs about one hundred minutes. The 88-minute version ruins the full film's atmosphere, pacing and, to be honest, plot. Watching that shortened version first may well put you off of a film that is excellent in its intended form. It did with one of my friends; he watched the disjointed 88-minute cut and then wasn't willing to give the full film his time.

B00003CWN3|3.0|Hillary Swank gives a great performance as the doomed victim, Brandon Teena.  She deserved the Oscar!  However, there are problems with this film.  As a drama, it works well.  But as a docudrama, the facts don't measure up.  For starters, there were three people who were murdered that night, not two, as portrayed in the film.  The third victim was Philip DeVine, a black disabled man who was staying at the house.  Second, the story also doesn't explain about the two men's affilliation with a white supremacist organization.  They may have been targeting both Teena or DeVine or both.  The movie purpose seems like it has an ajenda towards the advancement of gay rights.  If that's the case, it should have been explained in the credits at the beginning or end of the film.  For those who study the case history, you'll be either disappointed in the story like myself or enthraled by it's purpose.  Despite that, it's a good drama.

B000AL730O|3.0|When I bought the CD I was already familiar with (and only) `English Tea'. I confess (sorry!) that I had to play the CD several times to become familiar with the other songs and really appreciate them because I found many lyrics too plain and easy (i.e. `This never happened before', `Anyway', `Fine line'). It seems to me that many lyrics in this CD did not undergo a final thorough revision and a careful selection of the words as McCartney usually does since an early Beatle. However, the melody somewhat compensates it, because you end up singing the songs along because the beautiful melodies, which is, at the end of the day, what makes a song.     So, regarding the melody and the music I have nothing to say but that are fantastic. As for the lyrics I would have expected a little bit more McCartney's style and work, i.e. like in `Jenny Wren' (Paul likes to \\"talk\\" about a third person and to tell stories in his songs, so Jenny Wren is much his style) or in `English Tea' (another pearl with the McCartney seal: a song with carefully chosen words, very \\"British\\", full of images so you can easily imagine the scenery of the song without any sacrifice to the melody).     It caught my attention a little of \\"bitterness\\" (?) in a couple of songs of this CD. `Friends to go' and `Riding to Vanity Fair' are very good songs (I liked more `Riding...') but also very strong reproaches addressed to a friend or lover, which I didn't find in, lets say, Flaming Pie or Driving Rain. I do not know (and I do not care) those refer to a preamble to his difficult divorce, or it was just the inspiration he got, that is just a fact. It is another bright side of the artist.    But this is an optimistic album anyway. Actually, the first song (`Fine line') refers so someone (a \\"brother\\") that was \\"driven away\\" but is now back on track with friends. `Too much rain' is a song of compassion, and Paul does always include this kind of songs in his albums. There is also friendship (`Follow me'), thankfulness (`How kind of you'), enthusiastic optimism (`Promise to you girl') and poetic optimism (`Jenny Wren'). There is also love in `This never happened before' and `A certain softness'. Actually, the last reminded me `And I love her' because its nice \\"bolero\\" melody.     However, Flaming Pie has more ambitious metaphors... just to compare this album with a close predecessor.
B0000009SI|5.0|Being a middle child in life, my parents ignored me.  It's a strange way of starting a review, but bear with me.  One of the benefits of being a middle child is that since your parents completely ignore you, you are left free to do pretty much anything that you want, including listening to music that your parents normally wouldn't allow you to.  Hence, Mr. Zappa.  It was almost a badge of honor to have a Zappa album, as people felt your intelligence was superior to theirs.  This was my 2nd Zappa album, and I still dig it.  It may not be as avant garde as Weasels Ripped My Flesh or as musically complex as Hot Rats, but so what?  It's still Zappa, and it's pretty damn good.  Father O'Blivion, St. Alphonso's Pancake Breakfast, and Stink Foot are fantastic songs, ones that Zappa did in concert quite often.  Zappa rules, but you already knew that.
0465092756|1.0|Peter Woit is the owner of a well-known blog that provides high-energy theoretical physics with the same service as William Dembski's ID blog offers to evolutionary biology: it is designed to misinterpret and obscure virtually every event in physics and transform it into poison - and to invent his own fantasies to hurt science. This makes Woit's blog highly popular among the crackpots, for example some of the reviewers of this book. The book is not identical to the author's blog but it is not too different either.<br /><br />Parts of this book are fun to read, although they will be too difficult for outsiders. But the text is definitely not a trustworthy source of knowledge about physics. The book can basically be divided into two parts. The first part of the book describes physics from the early 20th century to the 1970s or so. This part covers some standard material as well as some points that have not yet appeared in the popular literature. The early chapters also honestly explain that the author has not done any important work in high-energy physics himself and that he has been isolated from research (and researchers) for the last 20 years. Because of these reasons, I originally rated the book by two stars.<br /><br />As the focus of the presentation shifts to modern physics since the 1970s or so, an expert recognizes that the author misunderstands some very elementary questions.<br /><br />The book contains a lot of very embarrassing errors. Let me mention a few examples. Woit originally wrote that the center-of-mass energy of the LHC beams would be 14 GeV, instead of 14 TeV: this error has been corrected after long debates in which he didn't want to admit any flaws. He incorrectly argues that the neutrinos with electroweak energies interact very weakly. He thinks that higher-dimensional rotations are associated with one-dimensional \\"axes\\". He misunderstands how SU(2) can be embedded to SO(4). In his description of the history of supersymmetry, he forgets Pierre Ramond. He writes that the supersymmetric vacua predict a higher vacuum energy than the non-supersymmetric ones.<br /><br />Also, Woit seems to misunderstand that all of our knowledge of theories such as QED comes from perturbative expansions when he attacks the perturbative method as such. He also misunderstands what \\"background independence\\" means. At one point, the author also claims that the primary evidence supporting scientific theories is an authority (Edward Witten in his case). Even more seriously, he builds his case upon e-mail messages from undetermined sources that supported Woit's viewpoint. Most of these e-mails were obviously written by cranks.<br /><br />Authorities play an important role and the author quotes many outsiders in high-energy physics who have criticized string theory. But he never mentions names like Weinberg, Gell-Mann, Hawking, Randall, Arkani-Hamed - famous and active physicists who are not string theorists but who believe that it is the right direction. Books by Brian Greene, Lisa Randall, and others were much more balanced in this respect. The book is a gigantic spin zone.<br /><br />Woit conjectures the existence of singularities in some integrals that appear in string theory and that are known to be non-singular. Woit does not distinguish a family of theories from one theory with a massless scalar field (a modulus). He does not mention Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa when the black hole entropy is discussed. Woit incorrectly believes that the \\"beauty\\" of a theory is the same thing as an experimental verification.<br /><br />The author repeats poisoned remarks about string theory too many times. The second part of the book could be reduced by 60 percent or so. Moreover, most of the statements in the second part of the book are supported by no technical arguments, neither in the book nor in scientific literature. The problematic statement that string theory makes no prediction is repeated hundreds of times, and in many particular contexts, such a statement becomes not only boring but also patently false. The author is not aware (or denies) the actual mechanisms that are considered to be solutions of various puzzles - for example the doublet-triplet splitting problem.<br /><br />The book is also full of inconsistencies. In one chapter, he argues that the alternatives to string theory in the field of quantum gravity should be supported. In the following chapter, he argues that they should be suppressed - the work of the Bogdanoff brothers is one of his examples. Woit's knowledge of the history of the subjects he discusses is extremely superficial, too. For example, Leonard Susskind is painted as the discoverer of the large number of vacua in string theory. Quite obviously, Peter Woit has no idea about the \\"discretuum\\" described by Bousso and Polchinski and many other concepts that have been discussed for years.<br /><br />Peter Woit also offers a highly obsolete view on many concepts in theoretical physics such as the gauge symmetry; he is obsessed with the old-fashioned idea that all of physics follows from a gauge symmetry principle. He thinks that the gauge symmetry is uniquely determined by physics because he is apparently unaware of dualities and all other phenomena discovered in the last 20 years that show that his preconceptions are wrong and that gauge symmetries are only associated with a particular description of physics that does not have to be unique.<br /><br />The book is called \\"Not Even Wrong\\" but the readers should know that most of the book is wrong after all. I can only recommend the book to the people who dislike theoretical physics - or at least theoretical physics of the last 20 years - and who want their opinion to be confirmed by a semi-serious source. The readers who want to learn what physics is all about may want to avoid the book because it could make them very confused. As far as modern physics goes, the author is a layman. The topics he raises have nothing to do with the actual discussions that take place among the scientists.many particular contexts, such a statement becomes not only boring but also patently false.

B00005JP7M|4.0|I am by no means a Woody Allen buff.  The only movies of his, besides this one, that I've seen are Small Time Crooks and Match Point, so I don't know what he was like when he was at the top of his game.  Small Time Crooks was awful, but Match Point was amazing, and many critics hailed it as Allen's return to form.  When I learned that he was doing another movie with Scarlett Johanson (who I will see in almost anything), I was very excited.  Despite mediocre reviews, my interest didn't wane too much.  In brief, I enjoyed the movie a lot and found it fun and entertaining.  It is not going to win any Oscars, nor is it as good as the brilliant Match Point, but it's a good way to spend and hour and a half. <br />Sondra Pransky (Johanson) is a geeky journalism student vacationing in London.  Coming from a family of dentists and dental hygenists, she is trying to break out of the life she was born into by pursuing a more adventurous career.  She is awkward, speaks quickly, and has a tendancy to speak too close to people.  While attending a magic show performed by another American living in London, Sid \\"Splendini\\" Waterman (Allen), she is confronted by the ghost of a recently deceased reporter named Joe Strombel (Ian McShane).  While being escorted by Death across the River Styx (yes, they actually show this scene, which was subtly funny), he received a tip that a prominent English citizen may in fact be a serial killer known for leaving tarot cards beside his victims.  Sondra asks Sid to help her out in order to find what could be the biggest scoop of the decade. <br />Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) is the object of Sondra and Sid's investigation.  He is the wealthy son of an English lord, and will no doubt enter politics within a few years.  Upon meeting Sondra, who introduces herself as Jade Spence (and refers to Sid as her father), he is immediately smitten with the beautiful young woman.  He begins inviting her and Sid to attend parties in the countryside as well begins putting the moves on her.  The pair use the opportunities to further investigate Lyman.  Though as the events of the story unfold, Sondra finds herself falling for Peter, while Sid, who begins the film as the skeptic, becomes convinced that despite only circumstantial evidence, Peter is the killer. <br />Jackman definitely does the best in the film.  He perfectly plays Lyman as a charming man who may or may not be hiding a few secrets.  Johansson is always good, but she seems a little unsure of how to play such an awkward character.  At the beginning of the film, she is a little over the top, but as the movie goes on, she begins to get a better feel for her character (side note: she looks so awesome in her glasses!).  McShane basically has only a cameo role, but he does a good job with it.  As for Allen, half the time he is hilarious, the other half the time he is just annoying.  His quirks are funny the first couple times, but each of his gags are done to death.  His constant recitation of how much he loves people when he meets them is really only funny the first two times and the last time (due to the circumstances).  It's amazing that Sondra stuck around with him so long or even invited him to join her in the first place, seeing as how she often talked about how much he annoyed her.  These four parts were really the only four roles with any substance, though I must mention that I was very happy to see Anthony Stewart Head (Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) show up in a cameo role as a cop. <br />This film is definitely for people who are fans of the performers involved.  Allen fans will probably like it (though some may complain about a few similarities to Match Point).  People smitten with Johansson need no excuse to go see this, and Jackman and McShane are also worthy of attention.  However, if you don't have any interest in the main actors, you might want to wait for home video/cable release.  The characters are definitely stronger than the story.  The storyisn't bad, but the actors bring their characters to life convincingly and are able to turn what would have been a mediocre film into a fun story.

B000H30B2C|2.0|Why are they extending a movie that was WAY too long to begin with?  IO LOVE Peter Jackson's LOTR's trilogy,(and some would say those movies were long, too.)  But, the difference between King Kon & LOTR's is there were characters who you CARED about there fate.  Plus, even though I hated the cuts between Treebeard & Helm's Deep,(which would have been a long battle sequence if not for the cuts,)what happens here is that Jackson OVERDOES it.  You have dinosaurs who try to bite Ann, you have what I can only think are mutated, gigantic bugs, a stampede, that you can clearly tell is CGI,(I thought I even noticed the dinosaurs legs going through the people like they were ghosts, or something.  Now, these things would have been ok at maybe 3 or 4 minutes, but, just when you think it's over, it just goes on & on.  I just wanted to scream at the screen, ENOUGH!  Just get on with it.  They could have taken out the whole bug attack & made at least a somewhat better movie.  I mean, they have these Tommy Guns & the audience is uppose to belieev they are gonna shoot bullets at this guys back with a bug on it, kill the bug, but NOT him.  I don't mind SOME suspension of disbelief, but DON'T insult my intelligents.  That guy would have been RIDDLED with bullets.  It wasn't a Walter PPK, it was a Tommy Gun, for cryin' out loud.  They coul dhave cut some of this & used it for something the movie REALLY lacked, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!!!  It's bad when you only feel for a giant monkey. I mean, I know you are suppose to feel bad for him at the end, but what about the humans?  Anyhow, maybe the extended version will incorperate this, but I'm not buying it.  Oh, & one more thing, that tribe when they gget to Skull Island.  Is it just me or when that one triberperson was chanting something about King, did anyone else think about taht witch, or whoever it was from Princess Bride?  I almsot said, \\"Bow down to teh Princess of Mud, the Queen od Slim.  BOO!  BOO!  BOOOOO!\\"

I cracked it open and was hooked.   <br /> <br />I read the entire thing in two days and finished in tears.  I really enjoyed the characters and felt really involved in their story.  I was cheering for Anna.  She became a strong woman and did the right thing.   <br /> <br />I went through the postings and saw that many people diliked the ending.  I wouldn't say \\"I liked it\\" because it was really sad.  I found myself in tears over poor anna.  I thought this was an excellent story and i was in the perfect mood to read it.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|You know it's going to be a rough ride when the actors and director keep saying \\"it's not a remake....\\"  Er, guys, yes it is.  And a poor one at that.  The ship is like the original Terminator - every time you defeat the guy, he comes back with even more.  Unlike the Terminator, this is not entertaining - it's painful to watch.  There's so much that just does not make sense.<br /><br />1) What keeps blowing up?!?  Man, if cruise ships are *that* explosive, I'm never setting foot on one again. It's like a '70 car chase - or a Monty Python skit - where everything explodes. Radar towers, swimming pools - you name it.  It done blowed up.<br /><br />2) The bow thrusters, a critical part at the end.  They don't work like that. They could NOT work like that.<br /><br />3) The fire and water lobby scene.  How about just WALKING around?  The balconies clearly encircle the lobby.  Why dive into the fire covered water?  Same scene, the hose slide, two people, supported by a piece of brass, held on to by a couple of sweaty hands?  PLEASE!<br /><br />4) The designers never heard of GFCI's, Coast Guard regs, or standard shipbuilding practices dealing with electrical systems. This ship would never get a certification to carry passengers!<br /><br />There is just so much that's wrong with this film that it's beyond imagination.  Every scene - literally - anyone with an IQ over 80 will be thinking \\"What the?!?! Why do that?!? How in the hell could that happen?!? Give me a break!!!\\"  The director can't even decide how BIG the wave actually is.<br /><br />Promotions and CD covers show it towering over the ship.  When the captain sees it, the algle of the binocs and the proportional size would make it over 200 feet tall.  Look at our Gay Architect when he's about to jump and spots the wave. His eyes are looking at almost a 45 degree angle - and the wave is still a LONG way out.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the BEST version of Pride and Prejudice I've ever seen (and I've a lot)!  Colin Firth is awesome as Darcy!  The movie follows the book as closely as a movie can.  I'd recommend this to everyone!  (Even my husband likes it!)
B0000DEPRI|5.0|Regarding lawyeraau's review of Magical Mystery Tour, I disagree with some of the information.<br /><br />When the band was making Sgt. Pepper, the record company came to them and asked for a single. Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane were the songs they received, and it was released as a double A-side single. McCartney wanted the new album, Sgt. Pepper, to only have new songs on it, so the decision was made to leave off those two songs. In fact, they really are essential to telling the story of the town and a day in the life of the people there.<br /><br />This information came from a George Martin TV special on \\"the Making of Sgt. Pepper.\\" I wish he would have said where he'd put them in the sequence of the album--I've always wanted to know that. Martin said that may have been the single decision he regretted most -- leaving those 2 songs off the album.<br /><br />I also saw the band interviewed, and Ringo was asked which songs on the album told the story, and he mentioned Good Morning. I felt a little bad, since he couldn't mention the 2 songs that told the most about the town.

0060837020|4.0|Identifiable darkness is what best describes the tone of The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath.  Opening this book there is an expectation of simplicity but knowing Sylvia Plath's history one knows it can't only be that.  The book follows a seemingly average girl through the twists and turns of her life through good and luck filled times and on to scary and dark times.   <br />As one delves into the story line expectations are quickly contradicted as the main character, Esther, begins to wallow in deep depression and her life begins to change dramatically once she visits a psychiatrist.  Plath hooks the reader by making Esther so easy to identify with, almost making the reader feel as if there is something wrong with them like there is with Esther.  Her thoughts are not abnormal, they are thoughts that everyone thinks about but the extent to which Esther dramatizes these thoughts sends her deeper and deeper into her own world of confusion and the unknown.   <br />Different characters enter and leave Esther's life throughout the novel and they each affect her in different ways but they all are instigators in her loss of touch with reality.  Buddy Willard, a boy who Esther has dated and who likes her very much, seems to be a key player in her initial downfall.  She had always looked up to him but her sudden thoughts of no longer being attracted to him confuse her and anger her and he eventually fades out of her life, as all the others have before him and will after him.  There is not one character who stays constant in Esther's life, not even her mother and Plath uses this situational device to further exemplify Esther's aloneness in the world and her ongoing journey down the road of depression.   <br />Plath uses symbolism, and the power of narration by the main character to bring out the complexities going on in Esther's life and mind.  An example of the symbolism is the fig tree that Esther talks about as representing her unknown future.  \\"One fig was a husband and a happyhome and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor,...and beyond these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out\\"(Plath 77).  The symbolism amplifies Esther's fear of the unknown and her confusion in what path to take out of the endless possibilities that lay ahead of her.  \\"I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose\\" (Plath 77).  This shows Esther's fear of her future leading to her dark depression.  The reader feels like they know Esther better than anyone else in the world because they are living through her, through her dark, cynical, tone and uneasy state.  This quality makes the book more intriguing and much harder to put down.  Though its not a suspense novel, one still wants to keep going from chapter to chapter to better understand what Esther is going through and in hopes of seeing her lifted up from the hole she has dug herself. <br />
B00005JP4U|4.0|I think it was Michael Moore (\\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\") who inspired me to start watching long-form documentaries.  Now they've become something of a hobby.   From \\"Supersize Me\\", \\"Outfoxed\\" and \\"The Big One\\" to \\"How's Your News\\", \\"The Aristocrats\\" and \\"Bowling For Columbine\\".   Aside from the obvious educational benefits of watching docos, they've become more contemporary and adventurous and are therefore more entertaining.   The other thing I love about documentary feature films is that, unlike an \\"Out of Africa\\", you don't have to see them on the big screen!   You can watch them at home on DVD, over two or three sittings if you want.     Al Gore's \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is a 100 minute \\"slideshow\\" - his description - on  carbon emmissions and the greenhouse effect.     The former American Vice President has been lecturing about global warming since losing office six years ago.  He's spoken in over a thousand locations around the world, passing on a warning given to him thirty or more years ago.        The facts are compelling and disturbing.   As Al Gore puts it, in the 50-odd years that he (and other \\"baby boomers\\") has been on the planet, the rate of carbon dioxide emissions and global warming have shot through the roof, our ice-caps and glaciers have started melting, our forests are burning, our rainfall patterns changing, our sea levels warming, severe weather becoming far too common.   And, in a worse-case scenario, Al Gore predicts Planet Earth could descend into another ice age within ten years!    Guess whose fault it is.     Ultimately, Al Gore shows we can reverse the trend as long as we (and politicians) start to acknowledge the \\"Inconvenient Truth\\".   As I left the cinema, I wanted to get started straight away.  I felt like phoning someone - anyone - to warn them and to get them to change their ways.        So, it is a powerful documentary.   It does have an effect on you.   But, to be completely honest, it is just a slideshow presentation, in what appearsto be a university lecture theatre, albeit with additional commentary by Al Gore.   You won't hear anyone saying \\"You must see it on the big screen\\"!    My recommendation:  wait till it comes out on DVD, buy or rent it, get some mates together for a \\"slideshow\\" at your place, then pass it on.
0743424425|4.0|The Shining, by Stephen King, is a riveting novel set in the beautiful state of Colorado. The book's main focus is the Overlook Hotel, a grand estate that is more or less in solitude, just shy of the nearby town of Sidewinder. During season it is a lively place that entertains the most prestigious of guests and echoes the ancient memories of a time long forgotten. During the cold winter months however, the hotel becomes a lonely, isolated mass that must be looked after and attended to by a single caretaker. This position falls into the hands of the capable Jack Torrance, who must care for the Overlook all winter long and ultimately chooses to bring his wife Wendy and small son Danny along with him. Little do they know that their son has a special power otherwise known as the Shine. It is a gift as well as a curse, allowing Danny to see things and know things that no one else could ever imagine. That winter as the great oak doors of the Overlook are closed, Danny acquires a strong sense of foreboding towards the hotel. As the falling snow begins to shut the Torrance family in, Danny's adventures throughout the hotel begin to unveil the real demons that lurk behind every corner of the haunted Overlook. It is then that countless visions and nightmares start to plague the young boy as the winter presses on and the hotel itself becomes alive, its demons slowly beginning to possess Danny's father. As the days pass by, Danny's nightmares begin to come true, and Jack and Wendy both begin to see the things that Danny could never have even begun to explain. The hotel however has chosen Jack to be its colleague in the murder of his wife and son. Will Danny's visions be enough to get both him and his mother out of the hotel alive? Or will the spirit of the hotel eventually swallow them up into the vast memories of its mysterious past?  <br />This book was a fast-paced and invigorating read that went by quickly despite its length of 683 pages. I chose this book because I saw themovie The Shining and really enjoyed it. The novel did live up to my expectations and left the reader in awe and wonder at the mysterious occurrences of the Overlook but not with returning nightmares from certain scenes. The character of Jack Torrance was very well developed but I had trouble believing that five year old Danny could go through any of the book's never-ending trauma and still live a normal life to tell the tale. My favorite part though was Stephen King's writing style throughout the book. It was very interesting because he would constantly take the reader aside and into the mind of various characters and the spirits within the Overlook. All in all The Shining was just what I expected it to be and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who liked the movie or is a fan of King's work. <br /> <br />

038533348X|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is the story of a man, Jonah, who is writing about the \\"end of the world,\\" or the day when the atom bomb was dropped.  His work on the book encourages him to go on many journeys which ultimately leave him in a somewhat ironic yet very comedic position.  The story features an imaginative religion, a scientific potion, and a far off society as part of Vonnegut's many bizarre episodes.  Jonah, researches the \\"father of the atom bomb\\" and his children in order to determine what they were doing on the day the atom bomb was dropped.  Seemingly against his will, Jonah gets pulled into a plethora of discoveries about the children and their father which he never could have imagined to be true.  His journeys ultimately land him, along with the children, on a secluded island with a radically different society from their own. <br /> <br />I did in fact enjoy reading this book because of the absurdity and the unbelievable voyages which the main character undergoes.  However, it is in fact Vonnegut's style that makes the book so enjoyable.  He is able to bring the reader into this world where virtually anything can happen which then leaves the reader totally unaware and clueless as to what comes next.  The world allows him to describe such things as the discovery of the island of San Lorenzo in a two page account where six different countries claim and forget about the nation before escaping African slaves finally claims the land for good.  It is through Vonnegut's voice and style that the reader may not stop to consider such oddities as this one. <br /> <br />Originally, I chose to read this book after finishing Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" and was absolutely taken away by the combination of absurdity and hilariousness through which he expresses himself in this book.  Though I did not expect this book to be as far out as the alien adventure in \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" it did seem like a pleasant offbeat satire about modern man.  In the end I enjoyed this book more than \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" because of the comedic voice that I found more visible in \\"Cat's Cradle.\\"  Though the first was rather ridiculous and interesting, for me it did nothing more than provoke thoughts about where such an idea would come from, rather than make me laugh. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking an imaginative and far off satirical story that is sure to create a smile.  While many may think the story to be boring and pointless, it is partly this hollowness that makes it so enjoyable.  The reader is baffled and unable to understand why things happen the way they do creating a randomness that I have found to be attractive.  For those readers that were bored by part of the book and decided to put it down forever, I would encourage you to fight through the beginning.  After all, I did in fact at first believe that this would be a serious account of the day the atom bomb was dropped, until the Bokonon religion was further explained and glorified.

This book explores just that question--with Abraham Loncoln as the leader who seated some of his top opponents for the Republican nomination for President in 1860 in his Cabinet.  This is a multiple biography, demanding a well organized volume to keep the five key characters' lives and actions in focus. The key players who served on Lincoln's Cabinet whom Goodwin examines include Edwin Stanton, Salmon Chase, William Seward, and Edward Bates--as well as Lincoln himself.<br /><br />The chemistry among these players was sometimes problematic.  Chase's ambitions sometimes drove him to near mutiny against Lincoln.  Seward began by thinking that Lincoln should, in essence, defer to him.  Bates was an elder statesman who had some presidential ambitions in 1860.  And, of course, the workaholic Edwin Stanton.<br /><br />The book revolves around the interaction of these characters in what is akin to a fine drama.  It also displays Lincoln's ability to get the most out of this set of powerful political actors, to keep them moving forward as a team (even when there were clear differences and tensions).  It made good political sense for Lincoln to reach out to this disparate group of people--but it also brought some of the most capable leaders into his Cabinet.<br /><br />In short, an illuminating volume that informs the reader in some detail about the unique set of characters who had to work together to maintain the Union.

0767821769|1.0|I bought this DVD for my collection.  I do not buy full screen format DVDs.  Amazon described the DVD as \\"Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, Widescreen, NTSC\\" with an aspect ration of 2.35:1.  However, when it arrived, it was Full Screen only with an aspect ratio of 1:33.1.  Consequently, I returned it.  My recommendation, if you only want Widescreen, don't believe the description that this DVD is dual-layered and don't buy it.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|If time travel bothers you, think twice about this movie. If Back to the Future II made your head spin, perhaps you'd ought to skip this.<br /><br />However, if you're a person who loves a good romance and the time shift doesn't irk you, go for it!  You won't be sorry. I loved this film, and can't wait for the DVD to arrive.
B000G759LW|5.0|This CD is amazing!! Best one yet. Christina's voice is getting better with time.  This was so worth the wait.  Fans will definitely be pleased!!
B00006JKON|4.0|Before I call upon the wrath of music critics, as well as Beatle fans - no, Warchild obviously had nowhere near the cultural impact that Sgt. Pepper had. But there are certain similarities.<br /><br />Like Sgt Pepper, Warchild is a bright-sounding, whimsical album. The most well-known songs on both albums (When I'm 64 & Bungle In The Jungle), are rather poor and supremely overrated. And finally, both albums are prone to using sound-effects and orchestral artifices, in order to mask a definite dip in songwriting quality.<br /><br />But Warchild ain't bad, by any means. And it has some things really going for it.<br /><br />First of all, the quality of songs like Warchild, Ladies, Skating Away, Only Solitaire, The Third Hoorah & Two Fingers is quite high, and while only Skating Away would rank among Anderson's best songs, second-tier Anderson is still better than the majority of rock music out there.<br /><br />Secondly, the music is extremely well-played, and the arrangements quite inventive. Personally, I'm a huge Barrie Barlow fan, and his drumming adds a lot to even some relatively pedestrian material. John Evan's accordion and piano add color to weak songs like Queen & Country, and he sounds great on Skating Away.<br /><br />Thirdly, Ian Anderson's vocals are very good!<br /><br />Still, there are some weaknesses. As mentioned before, the songwriting quality isn't quite as strong as before (this would change drastically the next year with the awesome Minstrel album). David Palmer's orchestrations can be a bit intrusive on some of the songs, and Martin Barre's guitar solo on Back-Door Angels is uncharacteristically dull.<br /><br />Curiously, the bonus tracks are better than some of the original album tracks. I always loved Glory Row, Quartet & Rainbow Blues, and adding them to this album increases it stock dramatically.<br /><br />A 3.5 star album, in my opinion, but with the inclusion of the bonus tracks, a solid four.
0894803123|4.0|I tried several ice cream recipes that came with the recipe book with my ice cream maker as well as several I found online, they were all terrible, didn't freeze well, some didn't even make ice cream. Ben and Jerry's were the best recipes. The only problem I had was using the raw eggs. I e-mailed them and they told me they don't recommend using raw eggs. They told me how to pasturize the eggs or better yet use egg beaters. I have been using egg beaters in all their recipes and the ice cream comes out the same. They need to revise this book. I also asked them for some light recipes or frozen yougurt recipes which they told me they were not willing to share at this time. It would be great if they did another book with some new flavors. I recommend this book but do not use raw eggs use egg beaters instead.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|How can you hate a movie that has a line like,\\"OK Montana, how'd you get that scar on your face?\\" \\"Oh this ...eating pineapple\\"It doesn't get any better than that when the dub in a line that makes you fall off your chair, roll around and almost choke.I love this movie and would rate it 5 pineapples.
B000784WMW|5.0|This amazing rendition follows the book perfectly. The characters are so well developed and enchanting that even Charlotte Bronte would be mesmerized! Every minute of the film is engrossing and well worth the time to watch.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|WOW this show is AMAZING!!! Sam and Dean are awesome together and play so well off each other. The storys are not over the top...just right! Seriously i bite my nails from beginning to end! And to top it all off, the end of season 1 shows SOOOO much potential! I hope its around for seasons to come!!! <br /> <br />SUPERNATURAL ROCKS!!!
B000056H24|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best movie portrayal of the life of Jesus Christ.  The actor who plays Jesus exudes such peace & knowledge and his eyes are piercing.  I favor this movie because it details Jesus' teachings and miracles and doesn't just focus on his horrific death.  It is a very uplifting movie.
B000E1155E|5.0|Okay. So we've heard Brits say you have to be a Brit to like it. I don't think this is true. I'm from Tennessee in the USA. I'm from a line of Irish/Brit/Welsh immigrants and I think generally most working class families in either the US or UK can understand the feelings behind the songs. Sure, some may not know what Mardy means or what trackie bottoms are... but there's always room to learn, right? Is it fair to say Brits won't like the Kings of Leon or The Strokes because they can't relate to the southern rollicking or New York nights, respectively? I don't think so. Minute cultural details definitely don't take away from the human spirit of songs.
B000001Y9I|5.0|Wow.  This album gives me something new to appreciate it everytime I listen to it, which I think is what great albums can do.  Not many \\"heavy\\" rockers come to mind when I think of this album, but there is just so much excellent music on here that it deserves a 5 star review.   <br />The biggest surprise to me was how great the guitar work on here is.  Blackmore left for good (it seems) before this album was made, but his replacement Steve Morse does a great job even compared to Blackmore's impressive legacy.  Fantastic music all the way through.
1401200923|5.0|Hush is the reason why I began to read Jeph Loeb's work on the Dark Knight. This Volume 2 is the conclussion of one of the best (if not THE one) contemporary stories of the Knight Crusader.<br /><br />Jim Lee's art is impressive and the plot written by Jeph makes the perfect match. This is a MUST READ for all the followers of the Batman.<br /><br />This story is taken from the regular Batman comic and twistes every character in Batman's world. Nobody escapes the grasp of Hush; not only villains but also heroes; everyone can be (or will be) corrupted by his stench.<br /><br />After this awesome story you'll be only able to whisper: \\"Hush, Batman, hush\\".
B00000J2SO|5.0|Since the 'Long Live' album, Rainbow is practically a different band now.  Some members have been replaced (most noticably Dio, who went on to Black Sabbath) and the music and lyrics have changed rather radically.  This album is much more mainstream and written to appeal to a much broader audience than the previous dungeons/dragons type themes.   <br />Now, I loved the Dio-era Rainbow, but this one is great as well.  Just in a different way.  Basically, I'll keep this short. This album is much more of a pop album and was written for hits/mainstream acceptance.  Nonetheless, it was done well. The songs are catchy, the new vocalist (Graham Bonnet) is good and Ritchie Blackmore sounds great.  An excellent album as far as guitar playing goes and an excellent album is most other aspects as well. Enjoy.
0784011176|5.0|This one is a huge exception.  Haunting, intelligent, breathtaking scenery.  All of the actors were so sincere, and yes, the story was familiar, but, it was told and shown in a very unique way.  My hat is off to Harvey Kietel, one of our most underrated actors in the business today,  he was at his best. Holly, always good, Anna played her bratty daughter well. Sam Neil was ok, but I always thought he was overrated.  No CGI, no big explosions, no over the top killings, just a very good story that is sorely lacking in movies today.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|I thought Fall Out Boy was bad, but I have found something worse.  I would also like to say that emo is dead and has been replaced by the worst kind of pop-rock. <br /> <br />This is the perfect recipe for bad music and is basically a joke.  This band is basically trying to use Fall Out Boy's strategy mainly to attract teenage girls without an attempt at good music. <br /> <br />First of all, what is up with the song titles? I see no reason for a song to have a title more than 5 words, just another reason this band is a joke. Then, there are the extremely immature and gimmicky lyrics only having the point of being catchy and have no artistic value.  Then these \\"musicians\\" dont even play their instruments that well and have no originality at all. <br /> <br />These guy do know the perfect strategy for getting girls and making money (its obviously working), but they are a disgrace to music, as they shamelessly do not even make an attempt at good music.

0670034711|5.0|this is the first review i've ever written. i came to amazon to purchase yet another copy of this book for yet another friend and was floored to read the few negative responses so i felt complelled to give you my 2 cents as well. maybe because it takes place in 3 of my 4 all time favorite countries, maybe because she looks at the topic of enlightenment from the perspective of a contemporary woman my age, or maybe because the girl just knows how to write, few other books have ever touched me so deeply. as a yoga teacher, i am tired of the commonly held view point in my community that a spiritual journey should be a certain (generally austere) way and so if her quest for truth involves being in the world (not the mountaintop) and eating a slice of pizza, then i'm right there with her. buy 10 copies of this book immediately - you'll be giving it away to every friend you know, so save yourself the extra shipping!
B000GG4ZEA|4.0|_A Suitable Boy_ starts with a wedding and concludes with a wedding.  Mrs. Rupa Mehra wants to choose a suitable marriage partner for her younger daughter, Lata.  He would have to be acceptable to Lata's mother, to the family, and most of all he would have to be a man whom Mrs. Rupa Mehra's late husband would have been proud.  Lata rebels, but must eventually navigate through a Muslim student, a poet, and a shoe manufacturer. <br /> <br />The theme of Hindu versus Muslim not only figures prominently in finding Lata a suitable boy, but also is salient in relation to friendships, jealous love affairs, politics, and even a section of the novel concerning a Muslim man saving the life of a Hindu boy during a horrific stampede that occurs in the midst of an Indian religious festival.   <br /> <br />Seth has done a wonderful job in developing his characters.  They are by turns flawed, tender, selfish, neurotic and always very human.  One of the major male characters in the book, even when he is facing possible attempted murder charges, still evokes my sympathy. <br /> <br />The author makes many forays into the minutia of Indian politics during the early 1950s.  I must admit that my eyes would often start to close at these points in the novel.  This made reading this 1500 page book all the more difficult.  The recurring story element related to confiscating land from wealthy landlords, though, is especially interesting, considering that India, at that time, was a newly independent, emerging democracy, having to ponder such important issues as the fair distribution of wealth.  All in all, Seth has written a warm hearted, sensitive book, in which the past 6 months of my life has been enrichened.

B00007G1ZC|4.0|I'm writing because I recently watched Akira Kurosawa's \\"Dreams\\" for the first time last night.  My father, about fifteen years ago, showed this film as part of a seminar series on film appreciation.  I had not attended it, but knew of its reputation.  It had just released when he showed it.  Although I didn't view the movie, I do remember one of the people who, after the movie ended, called it \\"propaganda.\\"  I write this review because I, now, have seen the film and, having spent a lifetime paying attention to the cinema as an art form, feel more equipped to discuss that comment with some wisdom.<br /><br />I understand more now about where he was going.  Personally, I think he's full of trash.  I get so sick of these idiots who are always trying to utilize self-interest in their opinions to stop others from making artistic expressions, or to foul-mouth an artwork to circumvent its internal message because it doesn't fit with the trend of business relations.  Just because Kurosawa's movie depicts a regiment of dead soldiers doesn't mean it's propaganda.  For someone to proclaim \\"Dreams\\" as merely propaganda is no more than just a way for that person to insert his own comment to pay no attention to the artistic value of the film.  It talks about what the writer (or auteur) feels about the confrontation with nuclear holocaust, about being unable to affect the social state through megalomania, but instead only through a personalized human angle.  That means Kurosawa is not a propagandist just because he mentions the deadly effects of nuclear holocaust like radiation and other diseases with which all of humanity should concern themselves as knowledge because he treats the subject from the human perspective without partisanship.  There is no partisanship in this movie.  It is simply a human angle discussing the thoughts of being confronted with something that would turn society upside down; in Kurosawa's case, it is nuclear holocaust and war.  It doesn't side with any politics or even talk about any politics.  It is simply a story with a human angle.  If that is a way to pass a message to people about nuclear war, then it's the viewers who invent that connection as a healthy relationship to their community or society.  In other words, it's a necessary story, like a fairy tale, and not merely propaganda.<br /><br />The Nazis were good at labeling things, and so are the American neo-conservatives.  Can't such stupidity cease?  Perhaps it doesn't matter, since the movie exists whether any fool dismisses it publicly as propaganda even when it is not.  After watching this film, I believe most people won't be thinking \\"propaganda\\" when they leave the theater (or entertainment center).  They'll be thinking about Kurosawa, as a man, and about his thoughts.  Kurosawa has a right and a reason to make \\"Dreams.\\"  The film is very interesting.<br /><br />First, he was about 80 years old when he released this film.  If he talks about nuclear holocaust, or any other humanistic view, it's because he cares about teaching people about his personal mistakes and teaching people about his life lessons.  Eighty is very old, and it is much nearer the end of his life than it is to the beginning.  This was his last artistic film.  He died at 89.  If he were going to make any statement to the rest of humanity in retrospect of his life, it would look exactly like \\"Dreams.\\"  Let's not mince up his meaning.<br /><br />Second, he was Japan's greatest film maker.  Japan endured a nuclear holocaust which the United States brought upon it.  If an American says something like \\"propaganda,\\" he clearly doesn't understand and \\"can't see the forest through [his] trees.\\"  Japan was a country of war in the forties.  Japan has had to live with its conscience ever since that war partly because the U.S. used nuclear war against it.  Wasn't Kurosawa a pilot in WWII who shot down several American planes?  He is thinking about how his life was affected by so many deaths in war!  After Japan's surrender in that war, their country has mostly become a country of what some would call nuclear conscientious objectors, a kind of conscientious objector most governments don't define as conscientious objectors.  The country is self-consciously against the use of nuclear war because they have had to learn a lesson about it the hard way.  That nation's largest director making a movie expressing his regrets in life through the depiction of nuclear war, or just war, makes sense as the feelings of an 80-year-old Kurosawa who expresses a retrospect on main landmarks of his own life.<br /><br />Third, he titled his work \\"Dreams.\\"  One must understand that this title is a designation to people who have not seen it.  It is an appropriate title because it summarizes the content.  If someone goes to watch this movie, it makes no sense to run out screaming a label like \\"propaganda.\\"  If it had any effect upon its viewers, it's because of the human angle and it will be doing its job.  It is a faithful representation to only no more than precisely what it claims.  It is a good film, and therefore there is an audience for it.<br /><br />I am so sick of certain irresponsible people who recklessly label a movie as \\"propaganda\\" any time there's a serious discussion mentioning war.  In a ten or fifteen minute segment of this film, viewers can completely relate to Kurosawa's intention and understand what is happening on the screen, partly because of its visuals and partly because of its dialogue.  However, this film is a little minimalistic, and this agrees with me.  This movie would not be any good if it were just a suspense film that treated nuclear holocaust like a casino crap out.  There's nothing to make fun in a statement like this and no reason for that, so why dramatize it?  I understand the feelings and expressions and correctly interpret them as Kurosawa's thoughts and concerns over major parts of his life, a.k.a. dreams.  I appreciate it.  It's just too bad more people can't stand to see when someone else can make such a keen and insightful work of art!hat war, their country has mostly become a country of what some would call nuclear conscientious objectors, a kind of conscientious objector most governments don't define as conscientious objectors.

0553213105|5.0|I can't believe it took me until my mid-thirties to read this book. What is equally astonishing is the elequence Miss Austin was able to write this book at the young age of 21. Let me first speak to the well-done character development. The author does a great job of creating likeable, interesting characters. You have to love Elizabeth Bennet and her boldness. You must also love: Mr. Bennet's wonderful sense of humor, Mr. Collins' silly behavoir and what a haughty b*tch Mrs. de Bourgh is. Secondly, the author is very crafty in unfolding a plot in which the reader fully understands how their could have been lots of misunderstandings between Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Very well-written and entertaining. Don't wait as long as I did. Read this book!
B00000HZH7|1.0|I love death metal because of how ridiculously-extreme it is, and how none of the bands take themselves seriously.  All DM bands know it's a big joke, and they just try to one-up one another in the brutality/gore department.  And the end result is ALWAYS big laughs! <br /> <br />So I was expecting a lot when I bought this.  I really expected to laugh a lot.  But in the end, it just wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. <br /> <br />This band seems to actually be taking DM seriously!  Big mistake there, fellas.  Nobody else does, so why should you? <br /> <br />Anyways, I'm highly disappointed with this garbage. <br />
B000G759LW|5.0|I have never listened to any Christina Aguilera music until my 25 year old daughter played this cd for me. I was totally blown away by voice and then by her adapting to the multiple genres she exquisitely handled. The musical arrangement is just truly phenomenal, and what a fantastic job in the blending music and story lines together. <br /> <br />Just awesome . . .  an award winning production!!!! <br />
B00001NFCY|1.0|I came on here to read reviews on Creed for a laugh, and I was surprised how many people are actually this naive when it comes to music. <br /> <br />People have written enough about how un-original and pathetic this band is so let me be more helpful :) <br /> <br />Listen to the following and you'll never pick up a creed cd again, Start with the first ones becasue they're easy to get into: <br /> <br />1. Pearl Jam (Vitalogy or VS) these two cd's are easy to like and awesome.  Eddy Vedder can actually write and sing (unline Stapp), and instumentally there's no comparison. <br /> <br />2. Radiohead (The Bends). Radiohead is another sweet 90's band.  This cd is also easy to like, and these guys are very original. <br />... If you want other modern stuff buy some Chili Peppers, The Strokes, Rage Against the Machine, or The Smashing Pumpkins.  <br /> <br />3. Now go back before 1990, and buy anything from Neil Young, The Beatles, The Who, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Elvis Costello, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and The Cure.  They're all Great.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I am tempted to recommend that you stick with the original version because it doesn't have the strange grid effect over the time reversal sequence. This grid makes no sense at all, especially when you hear the Director's weak rationale for the artifice. The other additions are more effective and the sound is vastly improved over the original. The marvelously choreographed intro into the High School environment is a piece of virtuoso filmmaking.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|This adapted version of the well known towering classic, a pyramidal cult movie of 1933 directed by Merian Cooper, received a distinguished and honest homage by Peter Jackson.<br /><br />Jackson not only produced mesmerizing special effects along the road, but most important still, focuses about the myth and explores through a very zealous dissection, in several levels. The greed, embodied in Carl Dehman - who really beliefs he may exorcize his inner demons under the service of the great audiences by just only $ 0.25 - the force of love, so many times represented in previous stories such as The beauty and the beast, or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the telluric presence of a wasteland where the triviality and the unlimited hunger of fame will make Kong - The Eighth wonder of the world - and bring it back to our civilized world in order to be admired for the excited crowd, in search of new and challenging emotions.<br /><br />Anne Darrow , the beauty per excellence, knows better than anyone, what's going on behind the apparent aggressiveness of this huge beast, that committed the unforgettable mistake to fall in love with a being of other genre.<br /><br />Two little details tinged this movie: Anne at the moment she gets out, after Kong has escaped from the Hall is the only person in NYC who did not need any coat in the middle of a cold night (the love is hot but not enough to have forgotten this detail), on the other hand when Kong and Anne dance on the lake of ice in Central Park, the edition process was visibly rough, cutting abruptly the most original sequence of the movie.<br /><br />Recommendable entertainment.
B000007VCO|5.0|Released in Australia on vinyl, but never on CD, this has to be one of the best Santana Albums ever. I think that this album was a special project for Calos and he put his heart and soul into the performance. A collection of eclectic tracks culminating in the Oneness track itsself. The way the guitar work ebs and flows is a special delight, especially when listening through high quality headphones. A must for any Santana fan!
B000005J56|5.0|I love the music. Great for dinner and it makes you want to go out dancing. So fun, creative and lively. I wish there were more out there like this one! I love \\"El Cuarto de Tulo\\" and \\"Candela\\". Even if you aren't a dancer, I dare you- try and sit still with this playing! It'll make you feel like you're on vacation.
B000000Y2F|5.0|The CD is wonderful it sound as if you are there. A great buy.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I can listen to this cd for hours! These guys have really become a solid band and the music showcases everyone's talent. My favorite songs (because I can't pick just one) are Dani California, Snow, Charlie, Torture Me, Slow Cheetah, Wet Sand, Hey, Desecration Smile, Tell Me Baby, Hard to Concentrate, Turn It Again, Make You Feel Better, Stadium Arcadium, C'mon Girl and She Looks to Me. Of course, that's about half the album. The entire cd (set) is one of the best cds I've heard in a long time (like since The Stills'  \\"Logic Will Break Your Heart\\" came out). I can't think of anything else in recent years that I've had playing as much, or enjoyed as much.  I'm glad the Peppers are still around and making music that kicks a**.
1400032717|5.0|A clever and engaging story that catches the reader up from the very first page. At first it is a bit jarring that the narrator seems to be digressing in all sorts of directions, but one quickly adapts as this is the personality on is dealing with. Once the reader learns to flow with the narrator, the frustration eases off, and the ride is very enjoyable.  <br /> <br />This book is one to open the eyes and look at the world as a segment of society does that most of us don't normally pay much attention to. We don't interact as Christopher does. We don't worry about the same things he does. We are not fascinated about the same things. But we soon learn to live and see things his way, and it's pretty amazing. <br /> <br />This book made me laugh and almost brought me to tears. I could feel the frustration of Christopher's parents and their love for him. I wanted to love him as well. For a book just over 200 pages long, it packs quite a wallop! Mark Haddon does a wonderful job opening up a very different world to those of not normally exposed to it! <br />
B00006LWSF|5.0|Back when I was still determining what music genre to call my own I developed an interest in rap.  After a while I got my first real rap album, 8 Mile. It still remains one of my favourite albums. Every song (excluding 2, you'll know which ones I'm talking about) has been burnt in my memory. I'll break it down for you... <br /> <br />1. LOSE YOURSELF-Eminem: (5/5)- What better way to start an album than with the first rap song to win the Academy Award for Best Song. This is, without a doubt, one of Eminem's best ever, and don't forget that he produced it too. This will always be a rap classic, need I say more? <br /> <br />2. LOVE ME-Eminem ft. Obie Trice & 50 Cent: (4.5/5)- Maybe it doesn't sport the best content, but I can't get enough of this one. Em's production is excellent, the light vocal chorus contrasts very well with the hard rap. All three artists are hungry and they deliver well. <br /> <br />3. 8 MILE-Eminem: (4/5)- Another good production by Eminem, at 6:00 minutes it's a little long, but recreates that dirty Detroit street feeling from the movie. <br /> <br />4. ADRENALINE RUSH-Obie Trice: (4/5)- Obie definitely captures your attention with this one, nowhere else will you here muthaf***** spit so many times in one chorus. Perhaps the most over-the-top on this album, but I love it. <br /> <br />5. PLACES TO GO-50 Cent: (4/5)- Now that we're well acquainted with Trice, it's 50's turn to introduce himself. This is a good one, especially considering it's 50 Cent. He doesn't sound bored in this one, and it's yet another great production from Eminem. <br /> <br /> <br />6. RAP GAME-D12: (4.5/5)- This one sports all six members of D12, with a dope chorus from 50 Cent and chilling joint-production between Eminem and Denaun Porter (Kon Artis). This is D12's hip-hop 101, and the raps compliment the music well. <br /> <br />7. 8 MILES AND RUNNIN'-Jay-Z ft. Freeway: (3.5/5)- Good production by Eminem. Less then spectacular performance by Jay-Z and Freeway but notbad by no means. Jay-Z reflects on his career and Freeway's getting his started, which was what 8 Mile was about. <br /> <br />8. SPIT SHINE-Xzibit: (4/5)- Solid performance by X to the Z with solid production from Porter. Xzibit takes a chance to reflect on his rap career as well and provide some advice for others. <br /> <br />9. TIME OF MY LIFE-Macy Gray: (0.5/5)- I have no idea why this is here, other than it adds to the theme of the album as a whole. Basically, you'll listen to is once, ask \\"why's that on there?\\" and never listen to it again. <br /> <br />10. U WANNA BE ME-Nas: (3.5/5)- I'm impressed that Nas is on here, but this diss track is definitely not his best work. However, still a good song produced by Nas. <br /> <br />11. WANKSTA-50 Cent: (3.5/5)- Nice one mixed by Dr. Dre. 50 Cent is already picking fights with Ja Rule, I agree with 50, Ja is a wanksta. <br /> <br />12. WASTING MY TIME-Boomkat: (0.5/5)- Well...it lives up to its name. I just pretend this was never here, when you copy the CD on your computer you can just leave this and Gray's out and you'll forget it was even there. This album still holds very strong with 14 tracks. <br /> <br />13. R.A.K.I.M.-Rakim: (4.5/5)- It's an honour to have Rakim on this album since he influenced rap so greatly. Ra takes this chance to put down what he stands for, and certainly takes advantage of the rock hard beat produced by Denaun Porter and mixed by Dr. Dre. <br /> <br />14. THAT'S MY N**** FO' REAL-Young Zee: (3/5)- Probably the weakest track on here (pretending that it's a 14 track CD), it uses a nice collaboration of guitars, but Young Zee isn't trying hard enough. It's still not bad, but had Zee done better, he might at least have an album by now. <br /> <br />15. BATTLE-Gang Starr: (4/5)- Another one of the hip-hop icon appearances that make this album a classic. Battles were also a big part of 8 Mile. This track uses heavy base coupled with record scratching and in-your-face raps that make this another solid track. <br /> <br />16. RABBIT RUN-Eminem: (5/5)- A 3:12 minute song with no chorus, so what makes this a five star track? Eminem is simply UNLEASHED on this one! It's as if he's focusing all his frustration and pent up rage and vents it all in these precious 3 minutes. Aided by an ominous Eminem production with a slight clock ticking in the background, you can feel all of the raw emotion in this song that is hard to find anywhere else. <br /> <br />So there you have it. If you want a tight collaboration of new and old school artists, this is the album for you. The only thing that could improve this album would be to get rid of the 2 degenerate songs and get a couple tracks by Dr. Dre, 2Pac, Notorious Big or DMX. But lets not get greedy, for $13.88 I find it impressive enough that Em assembled Xzibit, Nas, Gang Starr, Rakim and introduced us to Obie Trice & 50 Cent. <br /> <br />I hope you found this review helpful.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I was raised on this movie, much to my mothers chagrin. Every single weekend I had to rent it. I loved Night of the Living dead so much, that when saw this one at my local video store I went nuts. George Romero is a genius; even my 9 year old mind could see that. The whole plotline where the dead suddenly rise and want to eat the living and a group of survivor's hole up in a mall couldn't have made me happier, a whole entire mall as your house? what? YES! The makeup and special effects were sub par, blue tint and Hare Krishna's, but I still wouldn't have wanted them near me. I understand now as an adult the social commentary Romero was making, but beyond all of that his movies are just plain fun. No one has ever been able to touch his writing ability, his characters, his locations, and his zombies. No One. I even picked up the soundtrack featuring The Goblins, I still hum the music when I go to the mall. My favorite Zombie in this movie has to be the Nurse, she actually was spoken to by Romero for being \\"too over the top\\" with her flailing and facial expressions, just watching her Zomb-out cracks me up. My favorite character is \\"Fly Boy\\" the pilot, in his suave jacket, slick hair. Throughout the movie he is just a wimp, he cannot shoot, he isnt reliable to his pregnant girlfriend, he does the wrong thing at every turn BUT when he finally is eaten in the elevator he turns into the biggest badest nastiest zombie who has retained important knowledge and who is given the best makeup treatment to boost the importance of his change. Fly-zombie twitches, and bends his neck, and lurches around gathering the other clueless corpses upward and onwards to the secret hiding place of his hopeful buffet, the ending is classic romero and everyone who loves him will know what i mean. I only watch this maybe once a month now, I will pop it in when I am cleaning , or when I am home sick and need comforting. I realize that my warped mind has now equalized zombies to chicken soup but I give no apologies for it. SO buy this movie, relish it, eat it up, forgive it for being outdated a bit and cheesy at times, see it for what it is, THE single greatest zombie movie of all time.give no apologies for it. SO buy this movie, relish it, eat it up, forgive it for being outdated a bit and cheesy at times, see it for what it is, THE single greatest zombie movie of all time.
0446677450|4.0|This should be a required course in every college.  The phrase \\"stop working for your money and start making money work for you\\" gets thrown around a lot, but this book shows how to do it, and more importantly, how to get the right perspective about money in the first place.  A downside to this book is his writing style is not always polished, and I noticed spelling errors, but the content is rich and valuable.  Please read this book and start finding those \\"income producing assets!!!\\"
B0002N4ZEW|4.0|Voyage 34 was actually a collection of two extended singles released in 1992 and 1993, the first two parts from 1992 and the last two from '93. OK, so material here was supposed to be slated for Up the Downstair, but didn't. At this early point in Porcupine Tree's career, it was still a Steve Wilson project, he had yet to have a band (but that would quickly change), although on \\"Phase IV\\", Richard Barbieri provided synth work.    Many people regard this as one of the worst albums in the Porcupine Tree catalog, but it's not that bad. For one thing this is an instrumental album, you won't find Wilson's voice anywhere, but you do hear spoken dialog, about some guy by the name of Brian and his experience of LSD. Porcupine Tree was hardly the first to do an album about the experience of LSD, way back in 1967, none other than well-known Bay Area psychedelic rockers Jefferson Airplane recorded an album called After Bathing at Baxter's which was supposed to document the LSD trip. But of course you'll never mistake Porcupine Tree for Jefferson Airplane. For one thing, the production and the sound is quite modern, and you do hear plenty of '90s influences to go with '70s influences. The music has a darker, much more sinister tone, not the hippie type flower power stuff like you expect from the Airplane. The Pink Floyd comparisons are valid, the first two parts, especially features the same David Gilmour-type delayed guitar you hear on The Wall (like \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part 1\\"), with lots of ambient sounds to go with it as you expect from Porcupine Tree. The third part is much more techno-influenced, but I can understand why many might turn away from this cut, as the rhythm does stay the same throughout. The final part is mainly all ambient with yet more spoken dialog, I suspect the female narrator is the same person who also did \\"Not Beautiful Anymore\\" off Up the Downstair. People expecting some regular songs to go with the band's techno and ambient experiments mighthave been put off by Voyage 34, because it doesn't have regular songs.     I happen to own the most recent CD reissue, in digipak, and a new cover.    People wanting to explore the earlier PT catalog would obviously be advised to start with Up the Downstair, The Sky Moves Sideways, or Signify, but this is also worth having if you're a fan.
0440241588|3.0|It's an interesting premise. Power broker gets his hands on a program which hacks into an ultra-secret satelite system. After spending 6 years in prison, he's suddenly pardoned by an outgoing president. The CIA then dump him in Italy and wait to see who kills him.<br /><br />In truth, I'm used to gripping legal thrillers from Grisham, not attempts at cloak-and-dagger stories. A lot of the story is spent learning Italian or sightseeing various towns...however, having travelled extensively throughout Europe and having an interest in languages, I enjoyed it. Others, however, may not.<br /><br />If you're new to Grisham, try the stunning \\"A Time To Kill\\". This isn't the worst he's ever written, but it's definitely not his best.
B000G759LW|3.0|I downloaded this album and I feel it was a gutsy effort from a young WHITE singer. I found myself skipping through most of the songs but it does have some stellar moments. The first disc is filled with sampling and slow songs but I felt it failed to really capture the era of the 20's 30's and 40's. Most of the songs on both discs sound more modern than from the decades its was supposed to be from. The standouts are, Makes Me Wanna Pray, Ain't No Other Man, Oh Mother, Still Dirty, Here to Stay on Disc 1. But I didn't get why she went into a \\"Circus\\" direction for the beginning of Disc 2 but Candyman is spectacular. That song is how the rest of the CD should have sounded like. Hurt is also a standout that I think is the best ballard she's ever done. I cried when I heard it! But other than that I think she's was overreaching a bit here. Though Christina has a great voice, I doubt that a white singer will ever be mentioned in the same breath as Etta James and Aretha Franklin. But I have to give her credit for trying something new. I would definitely recommend the album to those who have an \\"old soul\\" when it comes to music, as I do. I like the risks she takes although I think she is lacking in the personality department. Take the song F.U.S.S. on disc 1. Its a song dissing Scott Storch who produced her last album (she's also feuded with Mandy Moore, Mariah Carey, Madonna, Britney Spears, Kelly Osbourne, etc.) I think if Christina concentrated more on her voice and being a more controlled singer without all the screaming and less on being a drama queen and feuding with everyone then she would be a much bigger singer (which she isn't). I didn't respect the fact that she had to take shots at another singer to promote this album. Christina Aguilera lacks class. Singers back in the day didn't take \\"cheap shots\\" at each other in the press and I think her \\"bad attitude\\" and the fact the she's always burning bridges with people is what will ultimately be her downfall. As she gets older, hopefully she will be more confident with her own talent and won't feel the need to \\"oversing\\" so much and take \\"jealous\\" swipes at more popular singers in the press. Grow up Christina! I think it just shows her insecurities as an artist. I mean, she was on the Mickey Mouse Club after all so she feels she has a lot to prove. Calm down Christina and behave more respectfully to the people you so obviously emulate and you should have longevity in this business.ets older, hopefully she will be more confident with her own talent and won't feel the need to \\"oversing\\" so much and take \\"jealous\\" swipes at more popular singers in the press.

0312995423|4.0|Dan Brown's newest psychological thriller chronicles the tribulations of the government agency known as the National Security Agency, or the NSA, over the course of a 24-hour period. Digital Fortress follows several characters, but mainly lead cryptologist Susan Fletcher of the NSA's Crypto Facility. The novel details an ingenious plot by a Japanese super genius with a personal vendetta to cripple the NSA once and for all. Susan Fletcher is called in by the head of the Cryptology Department, Commander Strathmore, one Saturday afternoon to help deter the biggest threat ever posed against the NSA.  <br />        The man orchestrating the technological assault upon the NSA is Ensei Tankado. Years ago, Tankado also worked for the Cryptology Department in the NSA. The agency utilized his expertise and technological knowledge to create the greatest decoding machine known to man. The project was a government secret, and only a select few, including Tankado, were allowed to help create the machine that was christened TRANSLTR. The greatest computer known to man, TRANSLTR's sole purpose was to decode encrypted data, data that is rearranged by computers to help maintain privacy and security.  <br />Although Tankado took part in building the machine, he was initially unclear as to the intended purpose of this massive supercomputer. Upon realizing that this machine would be used to secretly decode and read emails sent over the Internet, Tankado became infuriated. Despite being a government employee, Tankado valued the right of all individuals to privacy, and viewed the intended purpose of his supercomputer as immoral and unjust. Following an impassioned debate with the legality of his new creation's directive, Tankado was dismissed from the NSA. <br />Now, after years of determined effort, Tankado has created the perfected encoding system rendering TRANSLTR obsolete. Utilizing permutation strings, this encoding system is designed to constantly manipulate itself, making it impossible to decode.  <br />In short, Tankado has single handedly destroyed the NSA; however, the release of his program comes with one stipulation. If the NSA publicly admits to possessing TRANSLTR and utilizing it to read private emails within the next 12 hours, Tankado will supply the NSA with a numerical code that will allow them to access the software and neutralize it before it goes public. However, shortly after the announcement of his program, the situation goes horribly wrong.  <br /> Dan Brown's newest addition to his compendium of work is just as exemplary, if not more so, as those that preceded it. An enthralling tale following the global quest to find Tankado's secret code will not only please those with a passion for technology, yet anyone who enjoys thrilling novels. In traditional Dan Brown style, the abrupt pauses and multiple related storylines found throughout the novel all culminate to produce an exciting novel that will surprise the reader until the very last chapter. Although the subject matter leans towards those with a passion for technology, this novel also raises a valid argument of the importance and limits to privacy in a world where keeping secrets could result in compromising the safety of millions.
B0000C8AVI|5.0|Great Gospel and inspiration from one of our most original artists.  Great Wexler sound.   Cant believe I found this album so revolting when I first heard it years and years ago.  It is one of his best.   Great backup female singers. This man's great inspiration comes from women as much as anything else.
B000G759LW|1.0|I bought, I listened, I threw away!  Tough times in the music biz.  Hip-Hop has hit another stalemate.  Even in the attempt to advance they have managed to circle around and bump each other on the head.  Let's take Christina out of the equation for a second, the fun boy producers did a pretty good job at creating another common album.  Good attempt at getting your money from the project.  Money Money Money.  Putting Christna back in the equation.  Her cat screach of a voice has gone on for two albums too long.  she should probably give it up at this point.  You've made your money.  It's time to retire into the depths of the mainstream tabloids as another failed marriage and an eating disorder.  I'm not impressed.  there isn't too much I can say.  The rest of the unsold CD's should be ground up and used as insulation on newly constructed homes in Louisiana.  That would a better use of the plastic.  Way to be common!
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Behemoth have undergone some what of a musical evolution since their first album SVENTEVITH, which came out in 1995. They have taken a more technical death metal direction as opposed to their black metal roots. Any doubts u may have had regarding their ability to adapt to such a change should be ripped from your skull. Their latest offering DEMIGOD, is a brutal album which also contains some acoustic guitars. The acoustic guitars breaks up the brutal monotany that is usually associated with death metal. Its also enriches the bands strong eastern influences. The lyrical content deal with occultic and pagan themes. Musically they show maturity, thought and hard work. <br />My review of each track is as follows............ <br /> <br />SCULPTING THE THRONE OF SETH <br /> <br />This almighty opening track begins with acoustic guitars before exploding into a blizzard of channelled noise. The drumming on this song is excellent.  <br /> <br />DEMIGOD <br /> <br />Another fast paced song with good technical riffs and supporting drumming. Opens with a medevil horned instrument and ends with a melodic riff. <br /> <br />CONQUER ALL <br /> <br />This is their first single of this album. The pace of this song is slower than the rest on the album. A more than able track to represent the band. <br /> <br />THE NEPHILIM RISING <br /> <br />Fast, technical riffs met with great drumming. <br />Ends with an acoustic outro. <br /> <br />TOWARDS BABYLON <br /> <br />Fast, Brutal riffs with relentless double-bass drumming. It also has an amazing solo. <br /> <br />BEFORE AEONS CAME <br /> <br />The vocals on this track take a more aggressive feel, combined with very good drumming. The lyrics are a poem written by an English poet named Algernon Charles Swinburne. <br /> <br />MYSTERIUM CONIUNCTIONS <br /> <br />Great riffs, drumming and vocals. A cool outro solo with whinning guitars. <br /> <br />XUL <br /> <br />Great song. Karl Sanders Of NILE contributes with a solo. Great solos in this one  <br /> <br />SLAVES SHALL SERVE <br /> <br />This is the second single of the album. This one is FAST, TECHNICAL and will rip your face right out out of your head. <br /> <br />THE REIGN OV SHEMSU-HOR <br /> <br />This mammoth track starts of with a 2 minute instrumental wich contains acoustic guitars. It's rich with eastern influences. The song is 8 minutes long and contain everything from sheer brutallity to malevolent melody.  <br /> <br />This is an album that is a MUST HAVE for metalheads. It goes to show that metal music around the world is evolving whereas other geners are simply stagnating. Its quiet clear to see that BEHEMOTH have arrived and will be challenging for the DEATH METAL THRONE.
B00005LC4B|4.0|This is a white knuckle ride from beginning to end largely due to the creepy performance of Robert DeNiro as a tatooed bible quoting ex-con who is stalking the family of the attorney who had defended him before he spent 14 years in prison. As Jack Cady DeNiro gives one of his most bizarre performances, as he portrays a man who is both resourceful and obsessed with revenge.<br /><br />The family played by Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis are a bit dysfunctional and Cady zeros in on their weaknesses and vulnerabilities like a bird of prey. All of the cast members are extraordinarily good in their respective roles.<br /><br />The direction of Martin Scorcese creates a building tension from the opening shots through the final scene.<br /><br />I deduct 1 star for the ending which goes a bit over the top and might have benefited from some additional editing but all in all this is a great horror tale of revenge by a psychopathic killer.
B000G759LW|3.0|I think Christina's voice is so beautiful and that is obvious.  The album on the other is just such a hodge podge of all different kinds of music.  I mean when she said it was going to be a throw back to the 20's, 30's and 40's, I didn't know there would only be about 3 or 4 songs in that stlye.  Why did she need to make a double disc CD then? It is not an album that I can just put in the CD and let it play because it is just all over the place.  One minute she has you dancing, then she has you crying, then some songs are really mellow.   <br /> <br />I think her best music is when she does not over sing the songs.   <br /> <br />Two definite stand out songs on the album are Understand and Save Me From Myself.  So simple and emotional.  I love those songs and they really so how talented she is without going over the top.    <br /> <br />Obviously people are responding well to the product with her album selling over 340,000 units in the first week.   <br /> <br />If you are a Christina Aguilera fan you will find something you like on the album.
0452270073|5.0|What interested me the most about this book was how Pat Barker revealed the methods during this time period for treating mental illnesses. Most of the story focuses on Dr. Rivers's Freudian style of treatment, which includes helping the patient understand his repressed feelings by discussing it with a trained doctor. Later on in the book, Dr. Rivers witnesses electroshock therapy, another form of treatment that forces patients to recover mentally by painfully shocking them with electric currents. \\"Regeneration\\" sheds light on the lack of understanding of mental illnesses during WWI and its effects on the patients and doctors. The afflicted soldiers were expected to be mentally \\"fixed\\" and sent back to the war, which must have inhibited a full mental recovery for them. <br /> <br />A few weeks after finishing \\"Regeneration,\\" I read an article about a woman's experience with electroshock therapy during this era, as told by her daughter. The woman's husband sent her to a mental hospital to treat her anxiety, thinking that it was for her own good. The woman not only suffered physical damage from the shock therapy, but she also suffered emotionally from becoming shunned from her own family and society. No one understood mental illnesses at this time, so these patients were looked down upon as lunatics. The author of this article finally reunited with her mother, having been separated for years. She then watched her mother continue her life with forgiveness and optimism, passing away later with a new home and a happy remarriage.  <br /> <br />Having read \\"Regeneration,\\" I felt that I understood this article at a higher level, and it left a very deep impression on me. I would recommend \\"Regeneration\\" by Pat Barker to anyone who is interested in the mental effects of World War 1 on the soldiers and the society in general.
B000AP04FG|3.0|This movie was not quite as good as the previews of it had led me to expect. It was not a bad movie, just not a great movie. It has good special effects, but I thought the story could have moved along better than it did. I found parts of it very good and a few parts kind of boring, if you are big on ridiculous gun battles you will probably like it, can't say Brad or Angelina really shone in this one though.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Trent Reznor has created some amazing masterpieces in the past with \\"The Downward Spiral\\" ,\\"The Fragile\\", and \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". I am not a big fan of works earlier than \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". \\"Downward Spiral\\" is a deeply personal and twisted journey into the mind of an addict, and the dark and morphed world that he lives in. The journey takes you to worlds and realms that are very hard to describe, worlds and realms beyond \\"normal\\" human experience.    \\"The Fragile\\" has to be my all-time favorite NIN album. This album chronicles the world of a recovering addict, still roaming through strange worlds and realms. \\"The Fragile\\" in my opinion has the most coherent and beautiful music with each song being a landcape of mystery and great songwriting. Not even counting the remix albums of these two releases, which are amazing as well and must haves for any NIN fan or experimental music lover.    \\"With Teeth\\" is NIN's latest release, and I have to say that I am very disappointed.  Before I even start with this album, NIN changed their style from Industrial to \\"mainstream\\". Sure, \\"The Fragile\\" was a lot less Industrial than \\"The Downward Spiral\\", but \\"With Teeth\\" is a pop-music album, there's no doubt about that.  First of all, the singles off of this album are okay. They sound like New-Wave and seem like Trent is trying to win over the newer, younger kids that are getting into his music by conforming to what is popular on the radio. The rest of the album lacks the same vision we see on the radio. \\"With Teeth\\" also has a very similar song structure to \\"The Fragile\\", yet at the same time brings a new sound to the NIN discography.  There is a new set of band members as well, which is the usual procedure for NIN. I think that there is a different line up on every album that Trent concieves.   I cannot say that this new sound is great at all, rather it sounds stale and boring. Each song seems mis-guided and there is a lack of direction on this album.  There are some heavy tracks, one being the opening track which features Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters fame on drums, a decent song but somewhat lacking. The softer songs on the album are not really all that great, and they don't envoke much emotion.  Basically, this album lacks soul. If Trent did that on purpose or not is unknown, but to me, I feel that Trent is growing old and now that he has nothing to complain or whine about, his song writing has suffered, as well as him musical direction.      All of the artists that were huge in the 90's seem to lose their vision and musical direction these days. So it's not all that suprising, but I have alway felt that NIN was a remarkable group and never thought they would lose their creativity. But a loss of creativity is apparant on this album for sure.    All bands evolve, that's part of life, and the ones that don't usually kill off their fans with repetition. But this change is not worth it, and seems to be designed to be more \\"friendly\\" to media sources.    I am sure hardcore NIN fans will pick this up or already own it. IF you are the casual NIN fan then.....  Buy at your own risk.

Sir Richard doesn't just tell us about his triumps. He also gives us interesting details about his personal blunders, failures in his relationships and even his jailterm.<br /><br />The fun factor is all over the pages.

Those looking for \\"insights\\" and \\"advice\\" may be disappointed. Sir Richard is just telling us his story and not preaching his philosophy or dispensing business tips. It's up to the individual to discover for himself what to make of this story. It's an insipiring story, but it's an obvious fact that not everyone can achieve the same results even if all the \\"secrets\\" to Sir Richard's success were leaked out.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This PF compilation is very well done and it's got all the important songs on it. The sound is really great, too. This is a good introductory compilation, as well as something that long-time fans can enjoy, as well. I like how the songs run together, at first I thought I wouldn't like it, but I do! The one complaint that I have is that \\"Brain Damage\\" wasn't included, I think it should have been. All I can say is get it, whether you are a new PF or long time PF fan.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|This film is essentially about story-telling. If you keep this in mind as you watch the film, it offers an interesting contrast between the story-telling of an elderly Alabama businessman, Ed Bloom, and the storytelling of the film's director, Tim Burton. <br /> <br />Ed Bloom, played by Ewan McGregor in his youth and by Albert Finney in his old age, is a natural story-teller.  He takes the raw material of everyday life and enhances it, embellishes it, and pulls it together in an entertaining whole. Because his life had several odd twists and turns, he has more raw material for his stories than the average fellow.  His courtship of his wife Sandra, played by Alison Lohman in her youth and by Jessica Lange in her maturity, comprises the most romantic and the longest tale in the story.  <br /> <br />Ed and Sandra have a son, Will, played by Billy Crudup, who has heard one tall tale too many and has become estranged from his father for the last 3 years while Will and his young wife live in Paris. The story moves from the vastly romantic courtship of Ed and Sandra to Will's stuggle with the relationship with his father. Basically Will assumes that if the stories are embellishments of truth that he does not really know his father. As his father is dying of cancer, Will tries to break through and find the real father underlying the tall tales. His father is insulted and hurt by this approach, and through his sick-bed story telling Ed captivates Will's beautiful young French wife. <br /> <br />At the end of the film, the son Will, is left alone with his father as his father is dying and tells his father a tall tale of his father's death, surrounded by all those who have know and loved him, as he becomes a giant black catfish who swims away. At the end we see the son Will finally recognize that the tall tale, the embellished story, contains an essential truth that must be protected and clothed and escorted with the trapings of fantasy so as to be recognized, appreciated, and absorbed. <br /> <br />This is the truth that Burton wishes for us to comprehend about the role of the storyteller and he relays this message in his own tall tale. <br /> <br />As a final note, since I am from Alabama, I personnally enjoyed seeing the scenes that were filmed in old downtown Montgomery and on the Huntingdon College Campus.

He had already read Harry Potter in English but suddenly finding it in German was an exciting adventure for him. I would recommend anyone wishing to encourage or improve someone's language skills to buy this book in whatever language needed. Great fun!
B000GGSM94|5.0|Okay, let's forget about the album, I hardly need to review Kiss Me again, jeesh.  And I'm going to forget the bonus tracks.  Are they interesting?  Yeah.  A steady diet on my playlist?  No way.<br /><br />So, the question is how has the music improved from the \\"standard\\" CD?  Methodology?  Simple, I ripped the new CD using Winamp, and to be fair, re-ripped the old one, using the same settings.  I kept neither one, because some kid on usenet did an even better job than me . . . hey, that's fair, I bought this, so quiet now.  I'm not about to cheat Bob out of steaks and brandy.  In any case, I made a new playlist in Winamp and flipped back and forth between the rips.<br /><br />Results?  More presence and punch in the new versions vs. the old.  Is it startling?  No, and it's possible that I could have tweaked the settings to bring up the old version to sound similar.  Limitations?  Well, good sound card, an X-Fi, but a run of the mill system, HK 3400 into Ascends and a Sony subwoofer.  Also totally wrecked 55 year old ears.<br /><br />Recommendation?  You have to buy it, because Bob needs the money for steaks and brandy.  Kidding, Cure fans have to own all this stuff, but the problem is the bonus songs are for collectors only, and the original was really mastered well enough that this doesn't help much.  Now, even a percentage point of improvement will be worth it for the holy of holies, which presumably comes next, but what's Bob going to do three years from now?  Offer a remastered Bloodflowers?  Where does this end?  I will forgive him the price, because he gave us Trilogy cheap, and we owe.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I was intrigued by the Amazon samples enough to buy this thinking it couldn't be as good as the samples hinted...well, it was beyond my expectations. I've been waiting for a band to put together something like this.  <br /> <br />I wanted to find some heavy music and was not familiar with Opeth at all. I was braced for cookie-monster vocals and growls which I admit turn off an old school metal fan like myself (Metallica,Megadeth,Slayer etc.;I'm not real happy with these bands' recent work, so I look elsewhere and try to be open-minded). I did hear some of this in the other Opeth samples, and yet I noticed in many reviews of other Opeth discs which mentioned \\"Damnation\\" in glowing terms, while noting it was very different. I became intrigued with the idea of a DM band doing acoustic numbers and their fans actually digging on it. From the moment this disc first hit my ears I realized it was very special indeed. Fron the sonic soundscapes, the musicianship, the song structures, and EXCELLENT vocal performances (glad he hasn't hurt his voice with all the growling).  <br /> <br />I can't find any flaws with this, it is perfect. There's even a part near the end of \\"Hope Leave\\" where it sounds like a seaside sound wash, only to be revealed (after it's switched off) as an effect pedal's extranneous noise. It's the kind of thing that just magically happens when conditions are right and the stars align. No doubt that describes this entire masterpiece.
B000GGSM76|5.0|I'm going to handle this the same was as Kiss Me and not say anything about the CD itself, what for?  We all know it by heart anyway.  The bonus stuff?  Interesting, but hardly essential.<br /><br />The question is how has the music improved from the \\"standard\\" CD?  Methodology?

X-Fi driving an HK 3400 into Ascends and a Sony subwoofer . . . and totally wrecked 55 year old ears.<br /><br />Recommendation?  Cure fans must of course have it.  No one else is listening, so I don't suppose it matters much what else I say!  But it's not an earthshaking improvement I'm afraid.  Faith was helped quite a bit, the original was kind of muddy in comparison, but as you go forward the improvements get harder to find.  Ah well, let's move onto the grail.  I'm sure that will bring the audiophiles out of the woodwork!
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|I don't know what I was looking for on this. I saw the vid for \\"Woman\\" & thought it had a 60's feel. I heard a snippet of \\"Love Train\\" and thought it had a cool vibe. I agree with the positive and negative reviews simultaneously,hence my rare middle of the road 3 star rating.I don't love it, I don't hate it. I appreciate it for it's stripped down bare bones appeal (think AC/DC,White Stripes,Ramones). However, it really did wear thin after a few listens. I guess I'm being too hard on it but I have to be honest. I am writing this to tell people to be wary of this; it's neither as good or as bad as people say.
B000000OAH|4.0|This album by Queen was released in 1978.  Despite the album's title, it has no jazz influences on it whatsoever.  It sounds like a typical Queen album.  There are a number of classic Queen songs on it, like \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", \\"Bicycle Race\\" and \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\".  There are some other good songs, and a few that aren't that good.  The CD features a useless remix of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", which sounds virtually identical to the original version, and a remix of \\"Bicyle Race\\", which actually does sound a lot different from the original version.  Most Queen fans will enjoy this album.
B000ESST6U|4.0|The performers and orchestra are superb in this production of Giulio Cesare. Sarah Connolly is the best female Caesar since Janet Baker, Danielle De Niese sings utterly beautifully as Cleopatra, and has matured into a major talent. Angelika Kirchschlager shines as Sesto, and the other roles are delivered with an almost unfaltering quality (Patricia Bardon is especially good as the tormented Cornelia). William Christie leads the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment to its usual superlative standard. <br /> <br />What a pity, then, that the direction undermines the performances. Handel should be performed either in a contemporary 18th Century or a modern (21st Century) setting. Here, it has been moved to the 1880's, the conquerors are the Imperial British, and the stage is peopled by characters more evocative of the Zulu War than Rome in Egypt. <br /> <br />Some of the performers are required to dance - particularly Danielle De Niese, and the fact that she does this so very well is to her immense credit. There is nothing wrong with this per se, just not in Handel. It seems that few lines can be delivered without an attendant gyration of some kind. Too many arms are waved, legs kicked, bottoms (no matter how attractive) waggled - just too many jigs jigged. Cleopatra's final aria (again, wonderfully delivered) is presented as a kind of Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy turn by a World War Two concert party. <br /> <br />I should point out that I am clearly in a minority on this matter. The audience loved every minute of it and it has had rave reviews. Perhaps I and a few others have just had a bit too much of daring innovation in modern opera productions as a whole. The mould has not so much been broken as atomised, and one sometimes longs for a good old-fashioned performance of Giulio Cesare with its quaint mix of 18th Century dress and Roman armour, delivered in the high, straight, grand style. I enjoyed the finale the most - and this was because, if you squinted a bit, you might have been mistaken that you were looking at such a production - mainly due to the fact that Caesar is at last dressed in roughly 18th Century costume. But there was still that Rorke's Drift garrison milling around at the back - as they took their bows I found myself waiting for Michael Caine...
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Just to add this bit of information; the Dune \\"Extended Edition\\" DVD spoken of here is a true widescreen version - after the Introduction at the beginning of the film.  I compared a VHS recording of a Sci-Fi channel broadcast to this DVD.  My hopes wained at the beginning; the Introduction montage does simply have black bars thrown up over top of the 4:3 image to give the impression of widescreen.  Immediately following the Introduction, however, though the bars stay the same proportion of the screen, the viewable area IS extended.  (Yay for a real widescreen version!).  So, whether or not you like this version, the DVD provides something I've never seen before, certainly not on DVD.   <br /> <br />Hope this helps!!
B00004XPPK|5.0|This is a Film Noir starring Rita Hayworth.  She's absolutely gorgeous, breathtakingly beautiful, and she can act.  The tension between her and Glenn Ford is sizzling. The romance of love and hate is summed up by Gilda (perhaps not a diret quote but goes something like this) \\"Johnny I hate you so much I think I'll die from it\\" ..it has a superb cast and directed by Charles Vidor.  It's a wonderful Film Noir!
B000FGGE68|3.0|Get used to it folks, this is the future of action adventure films. Basically a weird mix of \\"Polar Express\\" and \\"Kill Bill 1\\"; with a plot that seems to have randomly selected script elements from every \\"Matrix\\"-like film produced over the past ten years. When \\"Polar Express was first released, many predicted that the substitution of animation for live action would take over the film industry. But they expected this to be driven from the animation side and not from the live action side. But \\"Ultraviolet\\" shows that this takeover is really being driven by the live action production companies. It is a cartoon with occasional cutaways to actors, interactions between actors and animation, and a voice-over narration.<br /><br />Interestingly, not only is this not a new thing, it actually goes back to the days of silent films. In the early 1920's Max and Dave Fleischer introduced a cartoon series called \\"Out of the Inkwell\\" which superimposed animated figures on real film backgrounds (allowing a live actor to interact with a cartoon character). Walt Disney (in his pre-Mickey Mouse days ) borrowed the idea for his series of \\"Alice\\" cartoons (there were 56 cartoons in the series) and even reversed the idea and superimposed a live actress (Virginia Davis) on an animated background. Obviously these early examples are crude by the standards of \\"Ultraviolet's\\" digital effects but the concept itself is identical.<br /><br />\\"Ultraviolent\\" is not much of a story but it is decorated with many stunningly beautiful shots of Milla Jovovich as the title character. The story is weaker than the \\"Underworld\\" series but on a par with most of vampire-Matrix-post apocalyptic-CGI stuff the industry has been cranking out lately; including Milla's \\"Resident Evil\\" movies. The negative criticism of \\"Ultraviolent\\" relative to this other garbage is absurd; its all pretty awful but at least here there is an emphasis on the Milla visuals and her costumes are second only to Beckinsale's. They would be just as good if the costumer had realized that flat black presents major contrast problems.<br /><br />Milla can act (see \\"Dummy\\") but not much is required in that department for \\"Ultraviolet\\".<br /><br />\\"Ultraviolet\\" is based on a comic book and the film features loads of lame hyper-edited martial arts scenes that don't require stunt work because they are just microsecond cuts edited together to simulate fighting.<br /><br />\\"Ultraviolet's\\" plot revolves around a young boy that Milla is trying to protect. They are caught between a government run by the medical establishment and a resistance movement of disease-enhanced humans. That might sound like \\"Dark Angel\\" but instead of a \\"Bladerunner\\" production design, think of 1980's \\"Flash Gordon\\".<br /><br />All in all, \\"Ultraviolent\\" is as good as most of these futuristic exercises in excess and better than some.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.if the costumer had realized that flat black presents major contrast problems.

B00006IU73|5.0|... and I do not use that term lightly. \\"In Absentia\\" literally has something for all metalheads out there. It's bursting at the seems with heavy riffs, great vocals, acoustic guitars, keyboards, precise drumming ... I could go on forever. To me, this album is the first great thing from Steve Wilson and his gang, since this is the point where Porcupine Tree stopped being simply a side project and became much more. This CD obviously has far more innovation, creativity, and work, for that matter, put into it than anything Porcupine Tree had ever done before. Another thing that \\"In Absentia\\" has that is REALLY a positive for me is 3, or even 4 ( !!! ) part harmony. These guys seem to fit it in to every song they write. My favorites are highlited below :     1. Blackest Eyes - This track is actually what turned me on to Porcupine Tree. When I first heard the opening riff, I would have guessed what was coming up next was death metal vocals. I was totally wrong. Steve Wilson performs wonderfully on this song.  4. The Sound Of Muzak - I'd say this song would be the best to listen to if you wanted to get a taste of Porcupine Tree. The chorus on this song is absoutely amazing.  6. Wedding Nails - It may be an instrumental, but this is not one of those short, sweet instrumentals. It will kick you in your face. The guitar riff/solid drumming onslaught on this track will leave you in the dust.  8. .3 - Strange title for a song, eh? Right away, you hear the bass kick off, followed by a beautiful orchestra, then finally the drums and guitar join in. At about the middle of the song, there is a break with an acoustic guitar playing, and the vocals begin. A work of art.    What's great about Porcupine Tree is that they continue to be on the rise after two UNTOUCHABLE records. I still remain on the edge of my seat in anticipation of their forthcoming album early 2007. This quartet is very well composed, and if you have any doubts of that, \\"In Absentia\\" will surely make them disappear. Give it a shot, if anything. You can thank me later. Thank you for your time.
B00006L90T|5.0|Some brilliant directors only make a few movies. Herk Harvey made over four hundred -- but sadly, he only brought his astounding talents into one non-educational movie.<br /><br />That one brilliant movie is cult horror flick \\"Carnival of Souls,\\" a nightmarish tale of a young woman who is lingering on in the world of the living -- and is pursued by the dead. Made for a piddling seventeen thousand dollars, this little gem is as eerie now as it was in the 1960s.<br /><br />Three young women decide to drag race a car of young men -- and their car goes off a bridge into the river. Only Mary (Candace Hilligoss) staggers out of the water, seemingly undisturbed by the accident. The next day she travels to Utah for her new job as a church organist, but on the trip she keeps seeing a grinning, corpselike man watching her from the road.<br /><br />Mary tries to distract herself with shopping, dodging her lecherous neighbor, and playing the organ. But she keeps seeing the corpse-man), having strange moments where nobody can see or ear her, and also finds herself drawn to a run-down former carnival pavilion. As the dead close in on her, Mary runs from them. But she can't escape what has already happened.<br /><br />A simple plot, but Herk Harvey handles it with brilliant skill. There's a goofy moment here or there -- at one point Mary turns around to shriek into the camera lens. But most of the time, Harvey keeps the atmosphere piling on, with relatively little dialogue (the most memorable lines are usually shrieked ones like \\"I don't want to be alone!\\").<br /><br />In short, Harvey had the ability to inspire something a lot rarer than fear or shocks -- dread. Mary's confusion, fear and denial are almost palpable as she wanders through the town. By the climax, it has transformed into a sort of nightmarish maze that Mary can just run through, with the dead people just a few steps behind her. And there's that creepy organ music all the time.<br /><br />The ending is not so much a twist as the inevitable answer to all the bizarre events that came before it -- and it's a brilliant, bittersweet ending. Suddenly the \\"invisibility\\" moments and the dead faces make perfect sense, and we understand that Mary was not meant to be where she was -- having never lived, she could not bear to accept the inevitable.<br /><br />Mary is also not your typical early-sixties heroine -- she's sharp-tongued (\\"Thank you, but I'm NEVER coming back here\\") and kind of spinsterish by nature. What's more, she is completely detached from everyone around her, since she is not meant to be in the world of the living. Hilligoss (who only made one other movie) is absolutely amazing here, with her distant attitude and frightened eyes.<br /><br />The Alpha Video version of this is a good cheap version -- the picture is clear, though slightly tinted with purple in some scenes; it seems that Alpha got their hands on a very good print of this movie. Not a snap, crackle or pop to be heard on the soundtrack either.<br /><br />Brilliant and creepy, \\"Carnival of Souls\\" is a deserving cult classic.

Perhaps I am just getting old but all this is are one man's common and petty grumbles about his chosen profession (grumbles being that its hard, at times boring, and there's a hierachy in place, not exactly earth shattering revelations) directed by a man who hates American capitalism (American Beauty) and now, apparently, the American military.
B000BB14YY|5.0|Thank you Criterion! This wonderful DVD presented by Criterion is the one to purchase. Having owned both the horrendous Fox Lorber DVD, and then the Masterworks DVD, I can state without any hesitation that this is the one to have. \\"Ran\\" is one of the GREAT films by director Akira Kurosawa. Many regard it as his last masterpiece, however, I still have a strong affinity for his later film \\"Dreams,\\" as well. But this is a MASTERPIECE. Many have already commented on the film, therefore, I will ONLY give a brief synopsis, and focus mainly on the latest CRITERION edition. If you have not seen the film, I HIGHLY recommend that you do. Moreover, for viewers that like this film, I would also like to recommend that you seek out \\"HARAKIRI\\" which was directed by Masaki Kobayashi, and also stars Tatsuya Nakadai in the main role. It is a classic!<br /><br />In \\"Ran,\\" the films narrative centers on a father of three sons who is aging. Lord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) has fought many battles during his many years, and now with his vast empire without war, he decides that the time has come for him to retire and enjoy his remaining years at peace. He believes that this is the best thing to do so that when the time comes for him to die, there will be no unrest in the land. However, one of his sons objects to this. He tells the father that in doing this he will only weaken the empire. He warns that father that this will lead to tragic consequences. Which it will! For his impudence, his father Lord Hidetora banishes him from the land. What the son envisions, however, comes to fruition as we see the other sons vying for more power and glory. To tell you anything further will ruin this great film for you.<br /><br />As for the CRITERION release, it is great. The transfer of this particular DVD IS THE BEST PERIOD! For those who had the Masterworks DVD, this latest CRITERION release does not have any cropped footage, and the color is absolutely beautiful. I have friends who liked their Masterworks DVD, until I invited them over to watch the CRITERION release--they now have CRITERION editions. Also, there is an excellent behind the scenes documentary by Chris Marker on the second disc. This alone I would have paid for. Also, what I really enjoyed was the latest interview of actor Tatsuya Nakadai (Lord Hidetori) Plus, there is an excellent booklet [as usual] provided in the case with an interview by Kurosawa done in 1985, concerning the film \\"RAN.\\" If there are any of you who were deciding which of the versions to buy--then it is the CRITERION DVD. This is a wonderful film that I would love to watch with my wife in a movie theater some day. Highly, highly recommended. Enjoy this wonderful masterpiece of cinematic beauty!

B000AP04OM|5.0|Beautiful music, exception voice, palpable and liquid color, and an orgy of conservative values - not really a bad thing when carried off by some of the most lush scenery in Austria, very broadly painted heros versus woodenly vile baaaad guys, and sugary but not cloying good people.  I remember seeing this when I was about twelve years old, easily pleased by the story then; I am even more impressed by the ability of this film to be meaningful when I am now nudjing retirement.  Julie is still winsome, the children are still able to come across as real.  The Sound of Music was, is, and hopefully always will be a treat for the eyes, and respite for the soul........
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Directed by the late Kinji Fukasaku, \\"Battle Royale\\" is a truly magnificent film, and is highly recommended. I first saw the film a few years ago at the urging of a friend and was not disappointed in the least. The film itself is based on the novel by Takami Koshun, which I have not yet had the chance to read. The films narrative deals with the escalating violence among the youth in Japan, and in particular, with the violence in schools. Is the violence that bad? Are things really going to hell in the classrooms? The Japanese authorities seem to think so. So how do the authorities set about disciplining the youth? Detention and expulsion? No, that won't work. With high unemployment, the youth will just wander the streets and cause mayhem. Something much more harsh and drastic must occur in order to capture the present youths attention.<br /><br />Moreover, the very fabric of the nation is at stake. How are the Japanese authorities going to set an example which will reverberate within their society? Well, for starters they pass a new law. So what! There are already laws on the books dealing with this kind of behavior---Right?. How will this new law change student behavior? Well, for starters, this is no ordinary law. This new law enacted by the government allows a quasi-military type militia to abduct students from selected schools and send them to an isolated island. But what ever for? Surely not a youth camp? There are enough of those already. No, this is something much more draconian and drastic.<br /><br />Further, things are about to get very extreme in this new youth controlled government. For starters, this militia has complete control over these students lives, and they will force the youth to play out a very twisted and cruel game. One like no other they have ever played. [With the exception of two ringers who volunteer for the game]. As these students are sent to an undisclosed site, they must face a horrifying reality: Schools out--welcome to Battle Royale. Director Fukasaku made the right decision to have actor Takeshi Kitano as the former school teacher who is the one in charge of this latest group of competitors. Who better for the role?. As the former school teacher of this new group chosen to compete in this years game of survival, he makes it a point early in the film to set the tone by letting the students know that this BATTLE ROYALE is no joke.<br /><br />And the point Takeshi Kitano makes with a couple of students in the beginning of the film is not lost on the other students. The students must kill each other in order to survive. Only when ONE of the students is left standing will the game come to an end. It is here where you see loyalties and friendships part ways, or strengthen. I like the way Kinji Fukasaku directed the film. This is not like \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as I read in one of the reviews. \\"Battle Royale\\" is a totally different take on a future 21st-century society of ADULTS, that have come to see unruly students as having to be dealt with severely in order to conform to a Japanese society that THEY feel is being threatened. This is a truly great film. Highly Recommended!asaku made the right decision to have actor Takeshi Kitano as the former school teacher who is the one in charge of this latest group of competitors.

B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is more or less a pop album and should be judged as such, but obviosly there is a ferocious punk aggression that also fuels Nirvana's music. Basically this is album of great, hooky songs from start to finish but theres an abstract intelligence to the lyrics which adds weight to it as well. As  some of the sad Nirvana bashers have pointed out Kurt wasn't a technical musician who played a lot of notes but he was an inspired songwriter who could do great things with just a few chords. In my opinion he stands beside pop geniuses like The Beatles and Brian Wilson as one of the greats of twentieth century music. Smells Like Teen Spirit is a classic single despite being played to death which distilled the mood of the times. In Bloom is more classic pop along with Come As You Are. Breed amps the pace up with a riff of near metal intensity. Lithium is another great song with an intense, hooky chorus. Polly is an enjoyable low key track about a dark subject (rape). Territorial Pissings is a welcome blast of Sex Pistols like punk ferosity. Drain You is an inventive song, being seemingly abstract but based on only 4 power chords more or less. Lounge Act is a great tune with an intense finish and strangely sounds reminiscent of the Police. On A Plain for me is a favourite track with great hooks and to me is an underrated classic with a great hook \\"Love myself, better than you/ I know its wrong but what should I do?\\" Its very easy to look back on this album with the burden of pop history and somewhat recoil against all the acclaim because so many people love Nirvana. I recently returned to this album after not listening to it for 8 years and was impressed by its consistency and well crafted songs. I am a fan of music from all eras from 60s greats like The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and others through to grunge (Soundgarden, Alice In Chains), metal (Pantera, Slayer, Meshuggah, Down etc, hard rock (Clutch, Corrosion of Conformity, Kyuss)and I'd just like to point how laughable and sad it is that people without much real knowledge about music and that lack open minds are bashing things they don't understand like the running debate between people who liked classic rock versus people who like Nirvana whose arguments consist of Nirvana is rubbish The Beatles were better. Or Nirvana rules the Beatles sucked. Hardly reasoned arguments. You can't really compare the two because they came from different eras and mindsets but both were great bands.

Or Nirvana rules the Beatles sucked. Hardly reasoned arguments. You can't really compare the two because they came from different eras and mindsets but both were great bands. The Beatles were more sophisticated, varied and musical than Nirvana but Nirvana had a rawness and aggression and focus than sometimes the Beatles lacked.But both were great bands if someone looks at it with an open mind.

B000AP04NI|1.0|I specifically waited to buy this on DVD hoping to get a Todd-AO version and not just the Cinemascope version.  The freaking Laserdisc looks better than this!  I, for one, will not be buying any more \\"special editions\\" without reading the reviews in Amazon or elsewhere when it comes to 20th Century ripoff.  This release reminds me of all the 20Th Laserdiscs that were first released when laser was just starting out and how poorly the transfers were treated...now it seems we're right back to the good old bad transfer days of yore.  Yuk, I recommend that no one buy ANY of their discs (especially the upcoming crappy versions of STAR WARS non-anamorphic, non-5.1 sound original movies).  These people suck big time!<br /><br />t
B0002W18MU|5.0|For people that like Johnny's Cash energetic and more upbeat work, this is not the CD for them.  Johnny Cash very dignified and honest work shows he's grief and his struggles.  A very powerful album, Mr. Cash walks the walk and does not just talk the talk.
B00005MIZU|5.0|Not too often I hear something on NPR that makes me pull over and listen hard but that happened a short while back with the recording of Symphony #2 in this set. Picked the entire box set up and wowser. These are fast, exciting, absolutely buoyant performances. The orchestra plays miraculously. Couldn't be happier and at this price!! <br /> <br />For those that don't know the earlier Schubert symphonies--well, for the cost of one top-dollar CD you can hear them and you'll be amazed these aren't heard more often. Boy Schubert (many of these were written in his teens) may not have been the world's greatest symphonic crafts-person back then (he was merely very good with rough edges) but his full melodic genius was present when he was probably two years old. Here I am playing, and REALLY enjoying a symphony by a sixteen-year-old. <br /> <br />Beethoven allegedly saw a score of Schubert's before he died (Beethoven, not Schubert)and was quoted as saying, \\"HOLY MACKEREL! This kid's got the chops!\\" Beethoven talked like that sometimes.
0738702994|5.0|I just tore open the box and dove into this new deck and it is everything I had hoped. The artwork is luscious, the book is very, very well done and the organza bag is delightful. Can you tell I am just a little bit smitten with this deck?<br /><br />I have gone through the deck a couple of times and after this initial \\"looking over\\" I did not have any negative feelings about any of the cards. The artwork is totally mouth watering, each card is just spectacular and I am lusting for a big print of quite a few of the majors.<br /><br />The minors are more so in the RWS style and more of a watercolor with pen and ink overlay, but it works! The majors should be more lush and opulent and i can see why the artist created the deck in this way. The minors round out the majors. Any beginner could pick up this deck and learn to read with it very, very quickly. A more seasoned reader will enjoy the new tales of Welsh mythology (many of somewhat familiar) and will quickly see how the myths blend into the tarot symbolism.<br /><br />This deck is destined to capture the hearts of readers, collectors and enthusiasts alike! BIG BIG recommendation!

B000K7VHQE|5.0|The timing of the film's theatrical release with the latest bombshell about the JonBenet case is practically uncanny. However, as a viewing of the DVD will plainly show, the satiric critique of the Little Miss Living Doll beauty pageants is relatively contained, occupying the last 20 minutes, though the point is unmistakable. The ultra polished, talented contestants against whom the film's slightly pudgy and awkward hero, Olive, competes aren't so much little girls as miniature Las Vegas show queens, coached in seductive eye use and sexy posturing. How ironic that the manager of the beauty contest is scandalized by Olive, whose \\"improper\\" strip tease, taught to her by her grandfather, doesn't contain a hint of seduction or sexuality.<br /><br />Olive's quest to be a beauty queen appears to align her with other members of her family. Her obtuse, self-programmed father, who preaches #1 or none, wants to be a published authority on positive thinking and winning. Her suicidal, sensitive, gay uncle wants to be recognized as the world's #1 Proust scholar. Her introverted, tormented and driven brother wants to be a jet pilot in his own private Nietzschean world. Toni Collette as the mom, on the other hand, is the model of tolerance and forebearance, a supportive \\"gamer\\" whose ability to eat ice cream without guilt fortunately has a more profound effect on her daughter than the father's insistence on winning at any cost.<br /><br />By the end of the film, our family of losers ultimately emerge as true winners. Alan Arkin, as the profane patriarchal grandfather, provides the film's enduring wisdom, counseling both his son and granddaughter (Abigail Breslin deserves a supporting actress award for this scene alone) before his death about the importance of simply living life to the fullest. A real winner, he tells the family, is someone \\"who's not so afraid of losing he's afraid to try.\\" It's not the destination that matters; it's the trip. And the film literally offers one hell of a ride. Apart from some raw language, this is a family film recommended for all dysfunctional families who enjoy crying as much as laughing together.<br /><br />At the same time, thanks to inventive scripting and directing, this little gem transcends the \\"family film\\" genre, providing moments of subtlety, nuance, and genuine \\"life.\\" The very different, often ambivalent, responses of various members of the pageant to Olive's performance suggest that not everyone buys into the Little Miss America mentality. And again the mom is the one member of the family who has sufficient confidence in her daughter to sense that the men's concern about Olive's being \\"laughed at\\" speaks less about Olive than their own childish fears and self-consciousness.<br /><br />Finally, by making Grandpa the unlikely voice of wisdom, the film takes on universal, life-affirming resonance. \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" counters our tendency to see living merely as a \\"means\\" to some distant end or goal. Often the means needs no justification: being fully alive in the here and now can be the biggest prize of all.<br /><br />Count this one is an all-around winner--an entertaining, formulaic movie with enough twists, vitality, heart, and thought to almost atone for all of those long, dull \\"Talledega Nights\\" which moviegoers increasingly have to endure as part of their desensitizing training.ne hell of a ride.

B000E41MS6|5.0|I had watched the original series on PBS repeats back when I was in High School.  By the last three or four seasons, the series was so bad it nearly drew blood from my eyes.  I remember being sad because the reruns from the 70s were so much better (the problem was JNT... but that's an argument for elsewhere, I think...). <br />     When I heard the BBC was going to revive the series, I was skeptical (again, visions of Sylvester McCoy prattling around like a moron).  This was exacerbated when news came almost right on the heels saying that the lead had already quit! <br />     However, they got it right.  They kept everything that worked in Doctor Who, and chucked most of the chaff.  The stories for the season are great (particularly Dalek, Father's Day, and the WWII two parter).  The acting is outstanding.  It's a real shame Chris Eccleston left, because he captured the magic of the Doctor.  We still have Billie Piper for another season though!  She does a wonderful job this first season, another great surprise. <br />     So, to sum up, great acting and good stories (not to mention the obvious improvement on special effects).  Well worth your time.
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|So metal is dead?  Someone forgot to mention that to the folks in Blind Guardian.  Why is it that this dvd makes me cry every time I watch it?  Aside from me being sentimental about the good ol days when metal dominated, this dvd is a testament to the past as well as the now.  I find it imperative to mention the crowd participation amongst the Nordic fans who attended this show, and made it the epic journey through metal that it was and still is.  From beginning to end this dvd never ceases to amaze me and remind me of what it was like to grow up in the late 70's and early 80's and experience not only the birth of metal, but also the birth of thrash and power metal.  Blind Guardian is a superb mix of these, and with the tremendous backing of their dedicated fans, the Imaginations DVD is nothing short of epic.  At 36 I still find myself head-banging and singing along with every track, and at times find myself in tears at the sheer magnitude of what once was, is now, and ever shall be AMEN, pure power metal.  Kudos to Blind Guardian for an exceptional show and I kneel at the altar of the fans in Europe for making this dvd nothing less than a spectacular event in the history of true metal.  VALHALLA, DELIVER US!!!
B00003CXHJ|2.0|I just finished watching Das Boot.  To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous.  Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe. <br /> <br />If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick. <br /> <br />If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot.

B000E33VWW|5.0|\\"Truman Capote: On the night of November 14th, two men broke into a quiet farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family. Why did they do that? Two worlds exist in this country: the quiet conservative life, and and the life of those two men - the underbelly, the criminally violent. Those two worlds converged that bloody night. \\"<br /><br />Phillip Seymour Hoffman becomes the man, Capote. A masterful performance that all but takes this film and turns it into a study of a writer and his behavior, and how he comes to write the novel of his life. The director, Bennett Miller, has also taken this chance to fully realize his life's work and has put together the film of his lifetime. Together this is the best film of last year.  Capote has shown the manipulative behavior he assumed to get into the minds of the two murderers who committed an atrocious murder in Kansas in 1959. At the same time, one of the murderers, Perry, also plays Capote. The result is a fascinating read \\"In Cold Blood\\" And, as the film progresses we come to understand that the title of the film not only portrays the horrific killing, but the behavior of the author in obtaining the \\"real story\\". Insight into Capote's mind is a satisfying look, but also a feeling of looking into the mind of a damaged soul. As a CNN reviewer has said \\"Hoffman doesn't impersonate the eccentric author; instead he appears to embody him. He never overly imitates the well-known, and often mocked, speech patterns or mannerisms of the man, but rather nails his essences without turning to parody. (It's saying something that Hoffman, who stands 5-foot-10, effortlessly captures the diminutive Capote without ever calling attention to his height.\\" Well done, Mr. Hoffman.<br /><br />Capote has a childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) -- soon to write her one and only novel, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", assist him in the gathering of facts and writing of the novel. Catherine Keener provides a warm and human side to this film.<br /><br />Chris Cooper plays the, Kansas investigator Alvin Dewey, and his portrayal is brilliant. Clifton Collins Jr., as Perry Smith, plays a cat-and-mouse game with Capote; always realizing deep down that it's the story, Capote wants. This film is dark and somber most of the time, but it shines in the performances.  A vivid portrayal of four horrific murders, the telling of the story, the writing of the book and the selling of Capote's soul to obtain the story of his lifetime.<br /><br /> Highly recommended. prisrob 8-26-06oper plays the, Kansas investigator Alvin Dewey, and his portrayal is brilliant.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|Three college students (played by Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson) decide to backpack across Europe. They have no idea what lies in wait. When they meet an older man on the train, they're told about a village where women will do anything to satisfy a man--especially Americans. Checking into a hostel in Slovakia, the three men discover that their room comes with a few perks. Three gorgeous women. And this of course leads to one thing.<br /><br />Most of the first half of the film is filled with the gratuitous sexual encounters so prevalent in today's horror movies; however, since it's actually a key part of the story line, I guess they had to do it. (No pun intended.) The women are bait. And once the men are lured in, they're drugged and find themselves in a terrifying predicament.<br /><br />As a longtime fan of horror movies, I felt there was extreme shock value in the gross chopping, drilling and slicing of human flesh. It made me cringe and turn away at times, and I have a strong stomach. It isn't a psychological thriller or ghostly horror, so much as a movie that tests your limits on what you can visually handle seeing.<br /><br />The final explanation of what's actually going on is perhaps what sets this film apart from other random slasher films. In fact, it's the `hunt club' aspect that makes the story line more believable and even, dare I say, feasible. Yet instead of hunting down victims, wealthy men can torture, maim or murder in order to satisfy their sadistic needs. And as a subtle humorous dig, it's the Americans who are most prized. For what better way to get back at the US than to torture and kill future generations? The shocking violence of the group of children that appears occasionally also sends a strong message. If you travel to a foreign country, it's a good thing to carry gum and candy!<br /><br />At least the acting in Hostel was a far cry from the poor readings of the actors in the movie Saw--a movie that made me groan and sigh, wishing I could have written their dialogue and had my neighbors act it out.<br /><br />Unlike many of today's horror films, Hostel does leave you with a vaguely fulfilling ending. Of course, you'll just have to see it now to find out what that is. This is the perfect dieter's movie too, by the way. You won't be too hungry or thirsty while you're watching it. This movie is definitely for 18+!!!<br /><br />If you enjoy a movie that makes you gasp, cringe or has your stomach churning, this is it. If you can't handle blood, excessive gore and brutality, I'd recommend you watch a comedy instead. Now...where did I put my saw? :)<br /><br />~ Cheryl Kaye Tardif<br />Author of Divine Interventionritten their dialogue and had my neighbors act it out.

B000G759LW|5.0|No bias. 2 CDs including with the powerful rhythms and vocals combination with catchy mix from DJ premier. Over 79 minutes with 22 songs including interlude (Disc one 13 tracks and Disc two: 9 tracks including enhanced Behind the scene: Back to the Basics). I would like to say I'm not disappointed with this albums.  <br /> <br />The overall musics went to the oldies mama ladies songs, Jazz, Blue, R&B, live bands and acoustic mixed up with the new technologies make its feel like her brings the old times to the present day. <br /> <br />Talk about the albums: <br />There are many good songs in this albums:  <br /> <br />Intro (Back to the Basics) and Makes Me Wanna Pray featuring Steve Winwood: (Track 1 & 2: Disc one) <br />Very good for Overture for this albums.  <br /> <br />The track would remind me everytime I listen to. Disc one: Track 13: Thank you (Dedication to fans...) It's real messages from the fans that she wants to share with you. The mixing very good & touch my heart.  <br /> <br />The most sexy track is Nasty Naughty Boy (Disc two: Track 4) Remind me of Marilyn Monroe or Madonna from Sooner or later. <br /> <br />I Got Trouble (Disc two:Track 5) You heard this one in the music video \\"Ain't no other man\\" the song after the music video done. Sound like my dad cassette tape in old time. (which is good one) <br /> <br />Overall: 4.5 Stars <br />Note: Give more time on this albums, especially the gloss art cover inside the CDs including her great pictures every single page. Worth to keep in household even your mom won't listen to it. <br /> <br />Prediction: Grammy for the Best Female Pop Vocal 2006: Ain't No Other Man - Christina Aguilera.
630460291X|5.0|Yes we all know the Kevin Costner does not have the English accent, but if you do a little research, he was told not to do it because it was bad. Moving on; this movie is a great portrayl of Robin Hood. Starting in the 4th century for King Richard's crusades take us to a captured Locksly who, of course manages to break free from his captures to make his way home to England to carry out revenge for his murdered father.  Alan Rickman hits the spot as the Sheriff of Nottingham. I have loved this movie since I was 4 years old and 15 years later love curling up on the couch with some popcorn to watch it on a weekend in.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I first saw this movie as two part \\"fund raiser\\" special on PBS. Having grown up in NY in the early sixties this wonderful movie by Scorsese really brought back a flood of memories I didn't even know I had of that period.  <br />While this movie is shot in a documentary form it flows effortlessly through Dylan's formative and (I think) most creative years. The mix of performances and following Dylan and his entourage are masterfully done. The interviews with an older weary Dylan and his contemporaries are so insightful: Dave Van Ronk, Allen Ginsberg, Maria Muldaur and of course the incomparable Joan Baez who still seems to have such a soft spot for Bob and his genius. <br />If you're even remotely interested in Dylan and the music of that era this is a must have DVD for your collection. Kudos go to Scorsese for whom this was clearly a labor of love. <br />The times they have changed...we just don't have music with this power any more.
B000000H6D|5.0|The clues are everywhere from cover to lyrics that this band is in it for the fun.  My introduction to them was by a friend who played their irreverent cover of Summer Breeze to get my attention.  After the laughter died down, he played the rest of Bloody Kisses and I was hooked.  I enjoyed them through October Rust and World Coming Down, but Bloody Kisses remains my easy favorite.  I own both issues, each of which holds its integrity all the way through.  The one with the longer track list is more entertaining by far.  The other one has the advantage of a more interesting cover photo.  Either way you go, Type O Negative's sardonic take on dreary goth metal is a keeper.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|I first wanted to watch this film just to see how bad it would be, but to my surprise it actually wasn't terrible. I know Silent Hill from the games- I used to watch my brothers play the games and found them incredibly fascinating as well as chilling and the movie did evoke the same feelings to make it into a must see for any horror movie fan.  <br /> <br />There were problems as well though. This movie lacks in the strength of acting, I also felt the end was kind of lousy. Some people were confused by the ending, but I clearly understood it I just didn't think it was a good one. This movie is one that I feel was just all right, that if it was on late night on cable I might watch it again, but I do not plan on owning it. For a horror movie it was good, but it's not the type I found altogether enjoyable.  <br /> <br />The plot was good, the actors okay, and the monsters were just creepy. I recommend seeing it but I can't promise you'll say 'wow'. The movie lacks but compared to other horror movies out there it was one of the better ones.  <br /> <br />3.5/5

This movie is quite unique in that the two principle characters never actually meet.  Nearly all of the movie takes place in letters being sent back and forth between Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins'characters.  It's a quiet movie that is not for everyone.  But I love this movie - enough that I wanted to have a copy of my own!  If you are a lover of reading and books, I would say you would enjoy this movie immensely.  Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins' acting makes this movie a must.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I was completly entranced by the hauntingly ethereal music of Cliff Martinez and the mysterious plot when I first saw this movie. And something about this movie stayed with me long after it was over. I just had to see it again to experience the journey one more time.  I'm glad I gave it a second look. After watching it again, I have a much greater appreciation for this movie. Yes, it does require a little more effort from the viewer to watch this movie. But, I think it's well worth it. It leaves you with lots of food for thought.  On my second viewing, this line from the movie particularly stayed with me: \\"There are no solutions -- only choices.\\" Well said.

B000002H33|5.0|To all Metal Bands, this is your target. Metallica's Master of Puppets is by far the best album of the 80s. From the Spanish Guitar intro of Battery, to the pounding drums in Damage Inc. this album is a joy to listen to. Cliff Burton's arrangements are flawless, Hetfield's Lyrics as top-notch, and Kirk's solos are perfect. If you want to start a Metallica collection or Just a Bitchen Metal collection start here.<br /><br />Battery: 9/10 This song starts off slow with Spanish guitars, and then kicks into high gear, GREAT Opener.<br /><br />Master of Puppets: 10/10 This song on control and being controlled is such a great song, from the beautiful solos to the memerable chorus this song owns all.<br /><br />The Thing That Should Not Be: 10/10 This Dark, Evil song is based on the writings of Horror master H.P. Lovecraft (recomend checking out his novels!) This is a must to listen to at night with the lights off.<br /><br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium): 10/10 Song about being trapped in a Mental Institution and longing for freedom.<br /><br />Disposable Heroes: 10/10 This beast is about the horrors of fighting in the front lines of a war and not being able to get out of it, from the march-like drums to Cliff's superb bass playing, this song is one of the best on the album.<br /><br />Leper Messiah: 9/10 Song about Corrupt Evangelical Ministers, the weakest song on the album, rumor is that Dave Mustaine helped write this song before he was kicked out. Weakest song on the album<br /><br />Orion: 10/10 Beautiful Instrument, Cliff's Masterpiece<br /><br />Damage, Inc.: 10/10 The Closing song on the album, and my fav. Damage is an awesome song that helps close out a Masterpiece with a bang.
B000A59PMO|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  The writing started out a little uneven, but quickly became one of the best-written shows I've seen.  An absolute must-see for Buffy fans.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|By focusing on courtroom drama and relying on flashbacks, this movie manages to avoid the more lurid tendencies of \\"demonic possession\\" films.    \\"Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is anchored by fine performances from Laura Linney, as the canny lawyer plagued by self-doubt, and Tom Wilkenson as the accused priest.  The original \\"Exorcist\\" movie was ruined for me by its nearly exploitive use of Linda Blair for tawdry shock effects.  This movie avoids that pitfall by distancing itself from the title character and presenting her almost as a 'case study'.  Several subtle philosophical issues run throughout, involving reason and faith, and the effectiveness of psychiatry and psychotropic drugs.      Ultimately Linney and Wilkenson are seen as two people using their wits to solve some issues that have universal bearing.  The movie ends by framing a quotation on \\"Emily Rose's\\" gravestone, \\"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling\\"... a reference not only to the Bible but to the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.  This is a good summation of the movie's synthesis of both religious and humanistic ideas.      Those who watch the movie can not help but ponder the implications the story holds for their own lives.  When a movie provides such food for thought, it certainly must be deemed a success.    Also worth seeking out in this genre:  \\"The Entity\\" with Barbara Hershey, and the Blair-less  \\"Exorcist III\\" with Brad Dourif.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Smarter, edgier, more attitude, but still has the sense of humor and some of the (deliberate) cheesiness of the old show. <br />     A faster pace packs more story into less episodes, Christopher Eccleston's interpretation of The Doctor is entertaining and energetic - and just a little irresponsible - Pillie Piper makes a smart sidekick - and the new, improved Daleks are as nasty as ever. <br />     Darn shame Eccleston chose not to sign on for another season, he's the best Doctor ever.
0385337388|5.0|This is a must read for those who work as healthcare professionals. I read it before my third year in medical school. I laughed out loud repeatedly throughout the book. Many inside jokes are cracked on wards everywhere by students, interns, residents and staff physicians. This book, although containing controversial material, has become a part of medical culture. It definitely intertwines the practice of medicine with human instincts and volitions. If you're a physician or a medical student, and you haven't read this book...don't waste another second...buy it and become part of the culture. <br /> <br />If you don't have experience working in a hospital, you'll probably find the book to be distasteful and unbelievable.
B000059Z8J|4.0|After seeing Superman Returns earlier this summer which I really enjoyed especially in the IMAX 3-D version and seeing how the \\"new\\" Superman performed, I had to see the original with Christopher Reeves again.<br /><br />For the time that it was produced in, it was a very good movie. All the major performers did a good job in terms of the characters that they were playing.<br /><br />I have always liked Christopher Reeves. One of my favorite movies of his is \\"Somewhere in Time\\". It is one thing to have the prespective of him as the actor that he was before his terrible accident and what he was after the accident. Either way he was a wonderful person and became a great person that people really could and should be inspired by.
1932907009|5.0|This book and its author is the real deal.  I looked at Save the Cat several times at Border's before I purchased it.  Flipping through the pages, I thought it was a bit too formulaic, too cute, too simple.  Man, was I wrong. <br /> <br />The beauty of this book is that it is simple enough for the novice to understand and so deep that even the most experienced screenwriter can learn something. <br /> <br />This book belongs on the shelf right next to Syd Field's Screenplay and Robert McKee's Story.  It is hands down the most practical easy to use book I've seen on the subject of screenwriting.  Blake tells you how to come up with killer idea (title and logline), how to \\"beat it out\\" (that section alone cuts several YEARS off the learning curve), how to write it, sell it, edit it, etc.  No stone is left unturned. <br /> <br />And here's the kicker...no only is the book one of the best written on the subject, the guy is just a great guy.  He even gives his own personal email address in the book and invites people to contact him.  In an industry where it's typically \\"every man for himself\\" this guy is a cool drink on a hot summer day, a real class act. <br /> <br />Two thumbs eternally up.

There are a few who come close -- Beyonce, etc. but they just don't have that powerful delivery & the message. <br /> <br />Buy it, rip it, listen to it.   You will not be disappointed.
0060888695|5.0|This classic American novel of the South could not be better performed by none other than Sissy Spacek-star of the movie \\"Coal Miner's Daughter\\" about the life and times of Loretta Lynn.  The novel by Harper Lee, an Alabama native, is truly an American treasure-rivaled by few other American novels in the past century.  This is a spectacular introduction to the book if you have never had the opportunity to read it.  This is a purchase you will truly enjoy for a long time!
B000BBOUU4|1.0|Depp's take on Willie Wonka was totally creepy. They obviously purposefully took Michael Jackson as a main model for the role. But he's even much creepier. The special effects just didn't make it for me. A shame. Aweful movie.
B000GRUMQ4|3.0|Granted, this latest resurrection of the 1970s classic is marvelously filmed with superb special effects and camerawork.  But as a movie on its own, POSEIDON is just another run of the mill disaster flick where the effects are more important than the credibility of the characters.  Of the three POSEIDON films, this one has the least involving or interesting characters.  Kurt Russell is the ex-mayor of New York who is on the ship with his daughter (PHANTOM OF THE OPERA'S Emmy Rossum) and her boyfriend/fiancee (Mike Vogel).  Richard Dreyfuss is a gay architect who is contemplating suicide due to a failed affair; Jacinda Barett is a single mom with the expected precocious child; Mia Maestro is the token stowaway; Andre Braugher is the stoic, stubborn captain; and Josh Lucas is the professional gambler who is also a pretty good action hero.<br /><br />Director Wolfgang Petersen knows his ocean movies, and he helms an action packed movie, but since it's been done twice before, it didn't make that much of an impact on me.  Let's hope this is POSEIDON's final voyage, and honor the first and the best!
0670033375|4.0|I liked this book although I suspect it will get very mixed reviews.  Diamond gives examples from history of different societies' reactions to environmental problems, including societies that have succeeded and those that have failed.  Then he makes comparisons to contemporary society. <br /> <br />Then book is intriguing in how it takes societies we all know something about (the Vikings, the people of Easter Island, the Rwandans) and examines them from a different vantage point. <br /> <br />I suspect many reviewers will criticize this book as having a liberal agenda.  Diamond is certainly communicating a viewpoint, that others may not agree with.  It is his interpretation of cause.  Opinion is fair game.  It doesn't make a book \\"bad\\". <br /> <br />Diamond's writing is well-crafted, although perhaps a bit unimaginative at times.  He certainly had no trouble keeping my attention. <br /> <br />My only qualm with the book is that I think he may, at times, be looking at events through a soda straw.  In particular, although overpopulation and poor resource management in Rwanda was certainly a big factor in its collapse, I find it odd that he actually downplays the roles of tribal tensions and residual effects of colonialism. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I recommend this book.  Most people have never considered the possibility of societal collapse, but it has certainly happened in the past.

B000GRUMPU|3.0|Big fan of the original. So, my anticipation was naturally at a peak when I was finally going to see a hopeful intergration of filmaking. I knew modern effects would be outstanding without even seeing it. I dont know why many of the reviews are putting an enphasis on that as if it wasnt expected. Yes, the old school acting was missing. There was passion in trying to escape, but the interaction of confusion, anger and pure uncertainty was not present. Fortunately, the level of fear was maintained solidly to somewhat compensate. I wasnt expecting a duplicate of the original, but a few more connections would have been nice along with a cameo or trivia point. The charactors where very thin and I believe the movie was way to short. The onset of the wave came too fast and much development was lacking in relation to the captain and his crew. Finding others in another area of the ship would have added to the film, with their eventual peril of course. Richard Dreyfus shaking off a passenger from his leg was a frightening touch, but I feel is a reflection of our current society. When \\"Chris\\" says to his girl , \\"I need you to tell me you love me\\", I thought I was watching acting from Night of the Living Dead, very empty. I thought the film was a bit overly dark at times. On the plus side the film started to get a good feel to as the water rushed in. Looking at the flipped ship was spectacular and realism took hold watching the constant electrical problems. The sound was awesome(if you have a good system). In a big scope way I was pulled in enough to enjoy the excitement . Filmmaker Peterson needed to realize that there was more then the rush to escape from the original. The rush was there and well done, but that extra of feeling the charactor and his bitterness was near nil. Works on some levels, refer to my title.
B000002JPA|5.0|Please DT fans - forgive this humble lost soul. I have always heard a few things by DT and have been \\"tempted\\" to purchase. Lo-and-behold, after watching these fantastic musicians on VH-1 Classic last night (8/25/06), I am hereby SOLD! I am going out and buying a DT cd. Don't really know which one yet, but after listening to the 30 second sound bytes here, I will probably buy Images and Words first (I love \\"\\"Pull me Under\\"). After that, I will go by what you avid DT fans have to recommend to me. Being a die-hard Rush fan, I do appreciate hard-core musicianship and songs that actually have some meaning and melody (apart from hip-hop and rap-crap). Damn, if just a few younger kids would listen to this, they would become hooked! I am definitely hooked on becoming a DT fan. At 45 years old, I  am still a rocker and love harder-edged, melodic stuff like this. Oh, thank you VH-1 Classic for revealing something I have been missing all these years!!
0792844882|5.0|I've always loved over-the-top films, in terms of acting, plot twists & turns, etc.  The only problem?  I don't know that the movie I just watched and adored was campy until someone else tells me as such.  So was the case with \\"Showgirls\\", a movie I had heard so much bashing about that I was to the point where I couldn't believe it would be as bad as so many had previously labeled it.  The surprise: I was right.<br /><br /> Showgirls was one hell of a great movie, and no, I'm not talking about it from a so-bad-it's-good viewpoint.  It holds up on its own as not only a great film with a wonderfully written (and quite intricate) script, but also as a milestone in MPAA history: \\"Showgirls\\" was the first film to be given the NC-17 rating, replacing the of-the-past X.  Unfortunately, the mass of persons whose money is being given to the studios didn't think as I did, calling the film horrendous, replacing \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" as the worst, camp-iest film of all time.<br /><br /> Personally, I love VOTD and didn't think it was bad either, which was a surprise in itself to find that the world hated that film as well.  Same goes for \\"Mommie Dearest.\\"  Therefore, it hurts me when others speak so freely of films I enjoy so with such a bland incompetence to how a movie is supposed to run its course.<br /><br /> I do not know why this film has been ruined by reviewers, not to mention the ruining of the actor's careers (minus Gina Gershon), but at this point I really don't care.  I don't agree and don't understand this other view, but I'll accept . . .<br /><br />I'll just continue loving \\"Showgirls\\" and maybe the world will be a happier place.<br /><br />\\"Showgirls\\" has been rated NC-17 for nudity and erotic sexuality throughout, and for some graphic language and sexual violence.
B000GCFO08|1.0|Not being a fan of the video game that inspired this movie, I must admit I found it visually stunning but ultimately confusing and empty.  From reading other reviews, some of the enormous plot holes make sense, but if a movie isn't honest enough to let all viewers know what's going on, then has it achieved its goal as entertainment?<br /><br />The sets, atmosphere and effects are marvelous, but the performances are lacking, with the exception of Alice Krige as the nutty spiritual leader.  But once again, we have yet another movie in which a demonic little girl wants to possess another innocent little girl.  Been there, done that, and frankly I wish writers would come up with something a little more inventive.
B000GRUMPU|3.0|Summer pickings for movies this year is amazingly slim, explaining why perhaps more people are being drawn to the DVD release of Wolfgang Peterson's clunker POSEIDON that the quality of the product deserves.  Probably the temptation of the state of the art CGI effects positioned Peterson into 'recreating' the 1972 thriller, but sadly the result is a heavy mess of special effects with little attention paid to the characters who should be 'driving the boat' into a story.<br /><br />After a scant few poorly written minutes that introduce the passengers and crew who are to provide the emotional interest in the story (Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez, Andre Braugher, Kevin Dillon, Jacinda Barrett,  Emmy Rossum,  Mike Vogel, M&iacute;a Maestro, etc - stereotypes all), up comes the 'rogue wave' and the ships turns upside down leaving the remainder of the film focused on how to get out of the trapped bubble.  For about fifteen minutes it works then all becomes redundant and the ending matches the desire of the tired audience - the sinking.<br /><br />Why with so many fine stories to tell and new concepts to explore Hollywood continues to exhume old movies to remake is  a puzzle.  Perhaps that is why the film industry is having tough times these days. A movie for those who love special effects without an interfering story. Grady Harp, August 06

B000G75AE8|3.0|In my opinion, the new Slayer CD is nothing more than average. There are a few songs that are just too fast, the guitar soloing VARIES LITTLE from the King/Hanneman of the past decade, and I feel kind of embarrased that these guys are still singing about Satan; it's cool and everything when you're young, but come-on, these guys are in their late forties already. GHUA has a much better sound and better riffs. After five years of waiting, I expected something much better.<br /><br />But...

0780619587|4.0|SHINE is a truly inspiring film about how one musician, David Helfgott, overcomes his domineering father and the unforgiving Rachmaninoff 3 to find joy, love and much deserved recognition.<br /><br />David's first obstacle is his father, Peter Helfgott, who repeatedly bullies his son to 'always win' and then repeatedly denies him the ability to do so by abusing him and preventing him from getting proper teaching abroad.<br /><br />When David escapes his abusive father to study at the Royal College of London, he finds another cruel master, Rachmaninoff 3, perhaps the most difficult of piano pieces.  Practicing night and day allows him to overcome this obstacle- but at a heavy price- it is indelibly etched in his soul.<br /><br />He descends into maddness- in which he continually fingers Rachmaninoff, and even starts speaking in a fast, stuttering fashion (perhaps based on the piece), forgets 'important' things such as putting on his clothes.<br /><br />While David never fully overcomes his illness, it doesn't matter.  As the film moves on, it becomes clear that neither his father nor Rachmaninoff 3 could conquer his ebullient spirit.  Returning to the piano years later (by wandering into a bar) he wins instant recognition for his virtuoso performance.  Later, his charming but humble personality delights a wealthy astrologist, Gillian Murray.  They marry, and with her support he returns to the concert scene, and fame.  More importantly, he lives with joy- not being afraid of jumping up and down on a trampoline or running with abandon on the beach, or putting his shoes on backward.<br /><br />Peter Helfgott wanted his son to win piano competitions.  David ends up winning so much more- he wins by leading a life filled with joy and love, and by inspiring others to do the same.
B0006399FS|5.0|Besides Bono, how many people or fans even know who U2 are?<br /><br />Allow me to explain, I would first like to start this review by asking if all the \\"real\\" U2 fans please make your presence known.  I am not sure what happened over the past six or seven years, but all of a sudden we have \\"tons\\" and \\"tons\\" of U2 fans!  Are these all-new fans?  Or perhaps they are the fickle fans that dropped off the map for nine years! \\"Come on, you don't have to be shy about it\\".  These are the same fans that were upset with U2's creative/experimental phase.  This is the same phase that the band recorded \\"Achtung Baby\\", \\"Zooropa\\", \\"Pop\\", \\"Soundtracks 1\\" (recorded under the name Passengers, but still U2) and \\"The Million Dollar Hotel\\" soundtrack.<br /><br />Many people were upset that this wasn't the \\"real\\" U2, they weren't sticking to their rock `n roll roots.  I tell you what, if you want to hear the same band making the same album over and over again, listen to Aerosmith.  So these \\"fake\\" fans buy all the concert tickets and keep real fans like myself from getting a seat.  Sorry if I sound bitter, I saw U2 on their Pop Mart Tour back in '97, when nobody cared about them.  Then all of a sudden in 2000 \\"Beautiful Day\\" came out, and everyone was a U2 fan again.<br /><br />This now leads me to the album \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\", this album just like \\"All that You Can't Leave Behind\\" built UPON the band's creative/experimental phase, not against it.  Songs like \\"Vertigo\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\",  \\"Man and a Woman\\", \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Original of the Species\\" all have the framework of the creative/experimental phase.  Any U2 fan or person familiar with U2's music cannot deny it.  Because their new work doesn't sound like \\"War\\" or \\"Rattle and Hum\\" or even \\"The Joshua Tree\\".  There is a group of \\"so-called\\" U2 fans that think the band should have called it quits after \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was recorded!!<br /><br />In addition songs featured on ATYCLB, such as \\"Elevation\\", \\"Walk On\\", \\"Beautiful Day\\" and \\"New York\\" all have the backbone of the creative/experimental phase.  So does \\"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\\".<br /><br />HTDAAB is a great album, moving, fast, slow, emotional and fresh.  I have read many reviews stating that U2 is \\"good but no longer great\\", I don't think so.  These guys have a talent most bands do not possess, they can morph.  They can be a rock, pop, techno, mellow, electronic and other adjectives I'm leaving out.  Every Grammy they won for this CD was well earned.  I wish the band much success in the future.  I wish poser fans would re-invest in their musical tastes and look up some U2 lore.tion\\", \\"Walk On\\", \\"Beautiful Day\\" and \\"New York\\" all have the backbone of the creative/experimental phase.

B000059Z8J|5.0|Hello there,<br /><br />This movie is extra-ordinary!  From the beautiful musical score by John Williams to the magnificent performances by Marlon Brandon, Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, and the rest of the cast; they all are top-rate!  I particularly love Gene Hackman's Luthor: on one side, he is goofy, witty, eccentric, and funny but on the other side; he knows exactly what he wants, he is dangerous and very intelligent!<br /><br />The story plays out like a masterfully-crafted novel; the special effects are dynamite! (especially for 1978)<br /><br />This movie is a tribute to Hollywood!<br /><br />A big thank you to Richard Donner and all the people which made this movie possible!  I was six years old when I initially saw this movie and I didn't forget it!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Charles Darakdjian
B0000009SI|5.0|Many years ago this was the first of Zappa that I ever heard.  Over the years since then I have amased quite a Zappa collection but I always come back to Apostrophe as the best of Zappa.  I love every single cut on this album.<br /><br />I have worn out three records and two cassett tapes and finally broke down and purchased this CD.  It was like coming home.  I had not heard several of these songs for a few years but found myself singing along like it was yesterday.<br /><br />If this is the only Zappa that you add to your music collection you will not go wrong and will be totally satisfied.  This is Zappa's best!
B0000C8AVM|5.0|I'm sure this album isn't the best there can be, but my weathered ears have never heard better. Of all the music I've listened to, this collection is my absolute favorite.  To paraphrase/steal from an earlier poster, I have no words to describe how good this album is: I feel like a fool even trying to describe it.  If you breathe and like food, endulge and see how good writing can be when heartbroken conscious flows. Dylan proves that there is a higher power.

After all, many viewers left around seasons 3-4, and just loyalists atayed through season 5. <br /> <br />Basically, the only special feature is the package.  A unique holographic box resembling the Presidential binder where staffers hand documents for Bartlett's signature.  Included are the 7 seasons of the setries, so I will be buying it to own this exclusive package and season Seven which releases the same day.

I still remember when I took my children to see the original and how thrilled they were to see a car that could fly and sail the seas.<br /><br />As a matter of fact I think I was thrilled as well. The characters are great with Dick Van Dyke playing one crazy inventor named Caractacus Potts and our female lead Truly Scrumptious, now how can you not giggle at names like that? And to this day I can start singing one of the songs and my children will join in, proving my point that  after all these years you understand Chitty Chitty Bang Bang left an impression.  a great storyline, great music and  clean-cut family movie that everyone can enjoy.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I am not going to write about the movie as what more can be said, its incredible, emotional, touching, etc.    I think they need to make a definitive 2-disc edition.  On it, should at least be the following:    -All the extras from this version plus new extras  -A documentary about the real Rocky Dennis, including actual pictures, interviews, etc.  -Where is Eric Stoltz in the extras? Should have interviews with Eric about what it was like playing Rocky Dennis, etc.  - I love the Springsteen music in it but also enjoyed the music in the theatrical version so they should include that version on the 2nd disc.  -At the end of the movie after the credits roll Cher comes on and talks about the disease/disfigurement.  This should be longer and could include experts talking about it like doctors, family members, etc.  I also think they should've put the Cher interview on the actual special features listing in the dvd and on the back of the case, why have it buried at the end of the movie where not everyone will see it?    hopefully you found this review helpful, if enough people did, maybe the studio will see the demand and release a definitive 2-disc set.
B000000H6D|1.0|Please note that there are two versions of \\"Bloody Kisses.\\" This review seems to have appeared on both of them. The one star review is intended for the re-released version (as described below). For the original I agree with all of the 5 star reviews: simply a brilliant album.      When I asked for \\"Bloody Kisses\\" as a gift (I had owned it before, but needed a replacement) I was given the new version and was so disgusted that I threw it out and bought the original. The major changes on the new version are:  A.) The replacement of the wonderful \\"Kill all the White People\\" and \\"We Hate Everyone\\" with \\"Suspended in Dusk,\\" one of the few genuinely bad TON tracks in their entire catalogue.  B.) The rearrangement of the track order.    The overall effect is to not only decrease the overall song quality (\\"We Hate Everyone\\" is WAY better than \\"Suspended in Dusk\\"), but to ruin the cool attitude of the album by getting rid of the humor (which was a crucial element in the original). Don't get me wrong, the album is still brilliant (it's TON after all), but not *nearly* as much so as the original. Seeing, then, as how the original is still available here on Amazon, why not get that instead? You'll know it by the presence of \\"Kill All the White People\\" and \\"We Hate Everyone.\\"    ***Update***  I can no longer find the older version on Amazon, which sucks. Still, it's worth looking around to see if you can find it somewhere else (possibly used).
B000G759LW|4.0|A rather good album by Christina. However, i found that Stripped was better. Highlights on the album include : Disc one: Understand and On Our Way, Disc Two: Welcome, Hurt and Mercy on Me. I think it should've been one CD as both discs have the same basic make up. I love her voice - still as powerful as ever. I think this was a fun and exciting project for her and it shows in many of the songs and interludes. Good album but in future i'd like the modern Christina back. I think Stripped is her best work to date.
1401308201|5.0|Being a rather HUGE fan of Wicked, I have been anxious to purchase the grimmerie for some time. I have never seen the musical, however I listen to the CD religiously and have watched the play [...]. Today I finally got the book at 2.30, it is now 8.15, and I have read through it twice. The Grimmerie includes how the writers were able to write the script, the set designers, the wig and costume directors, as well as a chapter about the various cast members on playing their characters (it has the original cast, as well as members from the national tour and the cast that took over on Broadway).    The book does not include the full liberatto, which was dissapointing, as the musical includes songs that are not featured on the soundtrack. However, the short script that is included is sufficient to answer most questions one might have about the plot.     I am more than pleased with this companion to Wicked, which I am absolutley in love with. The pictures in the book include the National Tour Cast.     If you have any doubts about this product please feel free to email my amazon account!    Wicked fans will love this, unless they are looking to reinact the musical, in which case it is illegal, and the full script is not included.
B000BYRCGU|4.0|Into The Blue turned out to be a decent movie. I was not expecting a story or ANYTHING from this movie other than pure eye candy. I was surprised by a decent story with suspense and action and some really beautiful cinematography. The underwater shots are really breathtaking. I also enjoyed the special features on the DVD which demonstrated how these great shots were taken in waters that were both beautiful and shark infested.<br /><br />Of course, aside from the beautiful underwater photography, there are the movies stars who are some of the most beautiful people in the world. Jessica Alba looks incredible. Ashley Scott is also gorgeous. And for the ladies, there's Paul Walker and Tyson Beckford.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not going to win any Academy Awards, but it is entertaining and fun.

B00005JP87|4.0|\\"The Illusionist\\" uses what has become a very common narrative technique in movies: begin at the moment just before the climax, then flash way back and build the story back up to that exact moment. Such an introduction wrenches the audience in and leaves viewers thirsting for more. In this spirit, the movie begins with the arrest of Eisenheim the illusionist. He's summoning something misty and ghostly on the stage when the Police Commissioner suddenly halts the production. Then flash back to Eisenhiem's youth. He impresses an aristocratic girl named Sofie - by, of all things, balancing an egg on a stick - and the classic forbidden love story unfolds. Sofie becomes enraptured by Eisensteins' illusions, but the inevitable separation occurs. The upper class won't hear of their kind mixing with a peasant. But before parting, Eisenstein constructs a special locket for Sophie that morphs into a heart. What girl wouldn't be impressed by that?<br /><br />Fifteen years pass. Eisenstein makes a name for himself as an illusionist. He turns gloves into soaring birds. He makes an orange tree sprout from dirt in front of people's eyes. But one night in Vienna, when the Crown Prince volunteers his bride and princess to be to the stage, Eisenstein instantly recognizes his lost love. And of course she's engaged to the future emperor of Austria. Dang the luck!<br /><br />Sofie and Eisenstein resume their more than friendly tryst, but the Crown Prince gets word of it. He tries to drag Sofie off to Budapest to overthrow his father the Emporer, but Sofie flees. In the process, the movie pulls an Alfred Hitchcock and kills off the female lead. All appearances point to the Crown Prince, but no charges get posted.<br /><br />Stricken with grief, Eisenstien buys a theater and begins summoning the dead. Crowds flock to his shows. One night the Crown Prince appears in disguise and sees Sofie appear on the stage as an apparition. She makes a vague, almost Charlie Chan-esque statement, that the murderer is in the room, then disappears without divulging the name. The people in the crowd have made up their mind, of course.<br /><br />Obviously the Crown Prince can't take this, so he orders the arrest of Eisenstien. But of course the illusionist has a trick up his sleeve, and his final performance leaves everyone mesmerized.<br /><br />The resolution of the film, and the unwrapping of the final illusion, gets revealed very rapidly, like cake swallowed too fast. Viewers that blink may literally miss important plot elements. This pivotal scene unfolds in the fashion of a \\"my life flashed before my eyes\\" scene.<br /><br />One real nagging question remains. The Crown Prince is actually innocent. Though arguably a corrupt man, doesn't he get a little more than he deserves? After all, he didn't really do anything in the space of the movie apart from acting like a louse and being unpleasant. Some rumors waft about the mysterious deaths of his previous lovers, but they remain only speculation.<br /><br />Also, whether or not Eisenstien really summoned the dead remains unresolved. The film highly suggests that he did not. Or did he? In at least one case he clearly did not. Remember not to blink.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" contains beautiful imagery of early twentieth century Vienna. Visually it stuns. Overall, apart from a few vexing questions, it remains a highly entertaining, if somewhat slow-paced, film. But in the end it takes an illusionist to expose the illusions of the powerful and to suggest that eternal love, manifest in the locket, is no illusion., then disappears without divulging the name.

B00005JP7Y|5.0|I always like dancing movie. However, there is seldom a movie that will impress me on both the plot and the dance itself.  This movie caught me by surprise.  I went to see this movie thinking that I will enjoy the dance part at the least.  But as I was watching the movie, I realized that I was living in the movie with the characters immediately.  By the end of the movie, I had already had the urge to buy the dvd of this movie, so that I can watch it again and again.  This movie is perfect.  It has my favorite music, favorite dances (hiphop and ballet), cute guy (Channing Tatum), great dancers (Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan and others), good plot, great messages.
B00005JM4Z|1.0|Saw the previews of the first movie, but I wasn't expecting too much from that. I tried to finish both the first and the second, but that didn't work out too well...I felt these films didn't deserved to be watched all the way to the end. I don't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie, and that includes the first. All I really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it...Y'all should really consider watching Cops and those insane police chases shown on TV. After all this is just another episode of Cops with guest actors in it.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This fantasy-adeventure film from 1986 is courtesy of four wonderful talents: Jennifer Connelley (\\"Once Upon A Time In America,\\" \\"The Rocketeer,\\" \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" Academy Award, 2001; hard to believe that she was just fourteen at the time), Jim Henson (\\"The Dark Crystal,\\" TV's \\"Sesame Street\\"), singer David Bowie (proving that he can act as well as sing; he should do more films) and George Lucas (the \\"STAR WARS\\" movies, \\"THX 1138,\\" \\"American Graffiti,\\" the \\"Indiana Jones\\" films, executive producer and writer). The story is well-crafted; no, I will not rehash it. SPOILER-I would have preferred some more sentimentality at the end of the movie-SPOILER OVER. Other than that, I really enjoyed it. Special features include the original theatrical trailer and a 56 minute, in-depth \\"Making-Of\\" documentary with reflections from the cast and crew. Rated PG for comic violence.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I've always loved this album.  It is a complex, deep, penetrating vision that goes right to your soul.  It's almost on the level of an Ingmar Bergman film or a Dostoyevsky novel.  It is a true work of art.  It is not fun, it is not rocking, but then it wasn't meant to be.  As we well know, Roger Waters's father was killed in WWII, and Roger never knew him.  This has always haunted Roger's work.  Now, many like to discuss whether this is a real Floyd album.  Since it says Pink Floyd on the cover, it should be considered a Floyd album, much in the same way that A Momentary Lapse of Reason is considered one.  Gilmour and Mason were merely sessionmen here (which is a shame), but it doesn't really detract from the profoundity of the album.  I've always thought this should be made into a film or TV special.  It may have been, I don't know.  Such a powerful, bleak statement on the idiotic nature of man and war.
B00005JL78|5.0|This one really makes you think. It's frightening to imagine a world where the gov't monitors so much, has that much control, always knows where you are (the eye scanning, the spiders running around the city checking IDs).  Not surprisingly, Libertarians promote this film.<br /><br />Creepiest scenes - eye transplant, Agatha's lake memory (especially discovering the identity of her mother's killer), the greenhouse with the weird plants, the floating prison cells.<br /><br />And then there are the obvious ethical questions - is it right to arrest someone before they actually commit a crime?  I mean, people are arrested for attempted robbery, rape, and murder, but you don't get locked up for the rest of your life (although plenty or murderers and rapists certainly DESERVE life in prison...and/or castration, in the case of rapists). It's a tempting idea, but how do you know what you're going to do until you do it?<br /><br />If I were one of the potential victims, I would be grateful to the Precrime Unit for killing the criminal before harm came to me. It's a sort of self-defense. If the police didn't kill him, maybe I would have, and that would have been legal. Like I said, it really makes you think.<br /><br />\\"You know I can't see without my glasses...\\"
B00026WUAU|5.0|Everyone who I talked to (and by many reviews here) that has heard this album absolutely adores it.  It is Dylan's most underrated album, and it is one of my top five Dylan albums.<br /><br />This album has some of the best Bob Dylan songs ever.  It's complex, ambitious, and very powerful.  Dylan's voice is weary and passionate at the same time.  6 of the 9 songs are true classics.  Changing of the Guards, the epic No Time to Think, the brutal, bluesy New Pony, the sad Is Your Love in Vain?, the strange Senor (Tales of Yankee Power), and the scorching, unforgettable Where Are You Tonight? (Journey through Dark Heat) make this album a classic.  The other 3 songs aren't terrible, just not as good as the other six.  Glad to see so many people give this record the credit it deserves...
B0001ADAVK|3.0|I'm a little late with my review here - I went to see this one at the theater when it came out, just because I'd heard Tori Amos was going to be in it. Too bad her screen time was less than five minutes, and you have to buy the soundtrack to hear the entire songs (\\"You Belong to Me\\" and the witty \\"Murder He Says\\"). She looked and sounded as gorgeous as always, though it was odd to see her singing away from a piano. I bought the soundtrack and liked some of the other songs on it as well.<br /><br />Julia Roberts' character was kind of annoying. Hmmm, having an affair with a lying womanizer doesn't seem like the feminist thing to do...just a tad hypocritical.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|a little short on time (only about 40 minutes), but that's a good thing since they cut through all the bulls**t (no skits, intros, outros, etc.) and just give you straight music. can't wait to hear more of them in the future.<br /><br />G.
0375831002|4.0|This book came to me with rave reviews and I was hesitant to read it because I didn't want it to be \\"too deep.\\" The book started out strong, but I found myself trying to get through the middle so I could find out the ending of the book.<br /><br />The book is still haunting me hours after I finished it. I won't give it away, but this is a book worth reading in 2006.
B000GTLQXU|3.0|I didn't bother seeing this movie in the theatres since I'd heard so much negative word-of-mouth about it from the few people I knew who saw it.  I've always been a huge fan of the original THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE ('72) and still watch it every New Year's Eve the way some people will watch IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE for Christmas.<br /><br />But I did buy the 2-disc DVD.  Part of the reason for justifying this was that I was buying the extras, especially a documentary from the History Channel about rogue waves.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be...but that's hardly an enthusiastic \\"thumbs up\\" either.  I kept thinking Roger Ebert's word to sum it up: \\"perfunctory.\\"  That works for me.<br /><br />It's as if Hollywood has taken the screenwriting process away from the writers and handed it over to the folks who design amusement park rides.<br /><br />Movies are now calculated to rush your senses and ignore your inner organs...like your brain and your heart.  Just keep those pupils dilating and reflexes jumping.<br /><br />My biggest major beef with POSEIDON was the movie's choice to jettison what I felt was the coolest aspect of the original: it wasn't just a survival story, it was a metaphor for Life itself.<br /><br />The original film said, \\"In an upside-down world, a rebellious religious leader leads a small group of believers UP while everyone else is going DOWN.\\"<br /><br />The remake says, \\"We're just going to whack people every few mintues--but, man, it's gonna look so cool!\\"<br /><br />THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE told its story and its appeal has lasted over thirty-five years (and will live on).<br /><br />POSEIDON hit DVD three months after its release and will probably be piled in a clearance bin by the end of this year.<br /><br />Will Hollywood figure it out?  I doubt it.<br /><br />I don't blame the actors (like a lot of reviews here) because it all comes down to writing, writing, writing.<br /><br />I didn't care about any of these characters.  Not a one.  Think about the way the audience felt when a character died in the original (especially Gene Hackman's powerful scene of losing Mrs. Rosen).  POSEIDON never worked on that level.<br /><br />The music biz made a big deal that Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas has a cameo...but I thought she looked and sounded like Charo--coochie, coochie! (Talk about a bad Love Boat flashback!).<br /><br />The special effects provided some good moments, especially the sequence of the tidal wave capsizing the ship.  As usual, the only good thing Hollywood films these days can be praised for are their special effects...and little else.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original, CHECK IT OUT.  I've talked to a lot of young people who haven't seen it and didn't feel like watching the same movie again.<br /><br />I tell them two things:<br /><br />Even if you saw POSEIDON, then you didn't see THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.<br /><br />And, yes, it's in color.acters.

B000005DQR|5.0|Do you remember what you were doing when Princess Diana died? When the towers were hit?  What is it about this CD that many seem to remember where they were when they first heard it, or first bought it.  <br /> <br />I was walking home from class, along McCaul street in Toronto. I happened to wander into a record shop near Queen street, with a burn in my pocket. Not looking for anything in particular, I just wanted a new sound. Flipping through a variety of CDs, not knowing any of the artists, I flipped to DJ Shadow. At the time, this was the only CD he had released. The cover was bland at best, simply a photo of guys doing exactly what I was doing, flipping through records. I decided to buy it, and took it to the counter. Immediately the guy at the cash register mentioned that it I made a great pick, that DJ Shadow was amazing.  <br /> <br />Since then I have revisted Endtroducing many times, as well as DJ Shadows other releases. Its the type of CD you listen to for a while, put down, but then always return to.
B000G759LW|5.0|When I finally bought my copy of Christina's BACK TO BASICS album, I was quite surprised. Listening to this particular album exposes Christina's love for her husband, family and for her life as well. Not only is she singing, she's sangin!  <br />Disc 1 is totally off the chains.... only two songs I really didn't care for was F.U.S.S. Apparently we all know in what direction that was meant to go in. That song could've been left out. the other one is the THANK YOU-DEDICATION TO THE FANS. I do admire Christina for recognizing all of her fans, but the music was not consistant with the rest of the disk. Other than that, I love this disc. I especially love AINT NO OTHER MAN, UNDERSTAND, and SLOW DOWN BABY. <br />DISC 2 I was completely off the chains as well. I especially loved CANDYMAN, HURT (MY FAVORITE OFF THE WHOLE CD), THE RIGHT MAN. and MERCY ON ME. Even though the project had a 20's , 30's and 40's feel to it, Christina broke new ground by breaking away from the standard pop that she's used to doing. Plus, homegirl can sing her tail off! Keep up the great work Christina. Let's leave XTINA alone... forever!
0805066691|5.0|Dee Brown's book evocatively relates the sad tale of the final displacement of the American Indian from the West. The book covers the period from about 1860 to the Wounded Knee massacre in 1890.<br /><br />By 1860 the die was cast for the native peoples of the Plains. The railroad was coming, the buffalo on its way to extermination, their way of life destroyed. And yet, none of it had quite happened yet. The denouement was startlingly swift. Still there were heroic episodes - Red Cloud's War (which wasn't really Red Cloud's, but that's another story), Little Bighorn, Chief Joseph's rebellion, Geronimo's resistance, and the Cheyenne exodus. With the exception of Red Cloud's War and the forced retreat of the US Army from three forts on the Bozeman Trail, these efforts were of the tragic heroic variety with very short-lived success. For example, Crazy Horse surrendered within a year of Little Bighorn. In just a few decades the reader witnesses the fall of the tribes from a state of nomadic freedom to utter subjugation.<br /><br />Highest recommendation. Very well-written and essential.
B00005JO1R|5.0|It was even better the second time we watched. Good songs on disc 2.
0060512806|3.0|I really wanted to give this book 4 or 5 stars.  But, it's just too plodding.  I like Stephenson, but he goes overboard on his narrative humor.  It really detracts from the story, particularly with such a long book.  The content of the story is very good; the execution bothers.  I found myself laughing out loud at some of his stuff, but it began to wear on me after 500+ pages.  Good story - exhausting execution.
0452270073|3.0|Regeneration depicts the psychological horrors and effects of war on soldiers during WWI. The main character, Dr. William Rivers, is effected as well because he is a psychiatrist who treats soldiers sent to the Craiglockhart War Hospital. His exposure to these scarred men makes him reconsider his own standing in the war. Rivers becomes attached to these men and their traumatizing stories, but his job is to restore the soldiers and send them back to the trenches to die. This novel not only follows the lives and changes of traumatized soldiers, but the effects on the Doctor who treats these soldiers. <br /> <br />-Bianca Louie
0812550706|5.0|The breadth of Card's knowledge in the areas of geopolitics, education, game theory, religion, psychology and story telling is very impressive. This is no mere \\"science fiction\\" work, but a novel that can take its place with any of the best fiction now being written. I'm especially impressed by the ease with which he combines these difficult subtexts with entertaining character, dialogue and plot. He creates a unique and entirely convincing view of the future on an epic scale. In addition, those who enjoy allegories will find much to meditate upon.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I will say this album is very good, but I like Antics better because of several \\"problems\\" with this album. <br /> <br />The main problem was the vocals on certain songs.  I liked the songs where the vocals rang through loud and clear such as Obstacle 1 & 2.  But in songs such as 'Stella Was A Driver ...' the vocals often clash with the instrument playing or are faded into the background and difficult to hear, or both. <br /> <br />Another good thing about Antics was that Interpol didnt try quite so hard to be weird. On TOTBL the lyrics can be downright ridiculous, not that that is such a horrible thing. <br /> <br />Also, this album is very dark and sometimes depressing.  Im not going to say this is a bad thing but I prefer the sound of Antics <br /> <br />Overall - 8/10 A very solid album
B0009VNCPU|3.0|I am a huge U2 fan and found this to be an informative dvd for someone who wants to learn about them. Some parts are kind of slow.
B000268QB2|4.0|I will say that Keane did take Coldplay's sound but there are several differences.  If you like Coldplay you, probably will like Keane.  <br /> <br />I do not like Coldplay, I find it sounds too mopey for me.  Keane has improved upon Coldplay's sound with better vocals and a more upbeat sound to be a very enjoyable (if derivative) sound. It is interesting that Keane used the keyboard/piano instead of guitars to create their emotional feeling. <br /> <br />My favorite song is 'Your Eyes Open,' it is a build up of sound and emotion, a great song. <br /> <br />Overall a great first album.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|... unless your main focus when watching a movie are CGI effects, this one's strictly a Blockbuster special... Kurt Russell isn't exactly Mr. Charisma, and everybody else seems to have won their roles through D-list central casting... I was really looking forward to seeing this one, and I usually buy highly-anticipated DVDs, but I'm glad I only rented it... I gave it an extra star for the great special effects... the capsizing scenes will leave you wondering how many people were injured during the making of this movie.
B000002U8G|5.0|Echoes is an epic worthy of everyone's consideration, yet many people don't even know it!  I can't say much more other than that this is a classic and can be listened to many times over.
B00005JO20|5.0|Unlike James Cameroon who has literally disappeard into some abyss (actually he's been making documentaries of the doomed ship and such) after his 12-Oscar winning Titanic, Peter Jackson went straight to the sets to create his next epic after his 12-oscar winning The Lord of the Rings 3 - Return of the King. And what a creation King Kong has been. <br /> <br />Two things that the 1967 version is popular for and that which weren't carried over to this version are: 1. Scantily clad heroine in revealing shots, 2. King Kong indulging in shady acts with the heroine. Peter Jackson did good by not carrying over such spoilers into his version. <br /> <br />The special effects are amazing. It is going to be a very difficult task of creating a better Kong than this one for sometime. Kong's fight with the T-Rexes is one thing worth watching countless times. Other oscars are also truly deserving for sound editing and sound effects.  <br /> <br />One situation that was too difficult to accept was the run of the Brachiosauruses with the crew dodging the animals while running along with them. Chances are that none of the crew could have survived such a stampede while simultaneously being attacked by other predators. The extended shooting scenes of Kong from the aircraft in the concluding scences of the movie could have also been avoided. <br /> <br />Check out the lovely piano of the beautiful scene of a tearful and angelic Naomi on the deck of the ship as she acts and emotes a scene for the film that she is cast(in the story of the movie).  <br /> <br />Great movie-making and worth your while.
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|I don't know where this film was trying to go or what the director was thinking, but it doesn't hold up as a feature film. Maybe it should've stayed a student short film...seemed like one. I wanted to desperately shut this film off after 40 minutes. The acting, story and direction made me want to vomit.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I was a little scared to buy it at first, being I never heard any of the cuts from it. When I put it in my car's cd player I fell in love. From the first song to the last. The songs sound so pure with love and affections in every verse. At this point I really don't have a favorite but if I had to choose \\"Like a Star\\" would be close. This is something that everyone can enjoy. It feels good to be able to listen to a CD with my 8 yr old daughter and we both are dancing and smiling. This CD is a excellent addition to anyone's musical collection
B000G759LW|5.0|Okay listen I am not a POP music fan as a matter a fact POP (bubble gum) songs are not music but an attempt to become popular enough to sell records. I also am not a Christina fan.  <br /> <br />With that being said this album is good music PERIOD. To those complaining that they can not sing along and \\"this doesn't sound like the Christina I know\\" please recognize that a true artist must evolve. Now to those that say she can not be what she is paying tribute to, you are right. At the same time she is not trying to be like them only pay respects by taking what she loves about them and making it her own. How can she make a song that is 100% like the old songs when that is not her. She can't, but she can take the things she loves from them and use it as inspiration. Yo Real Talk,  this is an album that I always knew she had in her. Her voice is AMAZING and it is meant to sing soul music. This album is good music plan and simple nothing more and nothing less. Please just appreciate things for being different and do not just write it off as whatever because you don't understand. <br /> <br />I hope Christina continues to grow and stay away from that POP stuff a.k.a. the cancer of true music
055357342X|5.0|I've read many series throughout the years and this one is by far one of the best. Some of the subject matter bothered me, but the overall story is well done and draws you in. Read it in a matter of days it was that good.<br /><br />The intricate plot continues to ebb and flow with the various main characters, all of which are expertly done. My favorite was<br /><br />Jon Snow on his mission north of the Great Wall. The plans of the renegade Mance Rayder that he is sent to discover is but the tip of the iceberg. Giants and all manner of fell cretures have been gathered in anticipation of invading the Kingdoms.<br /><br />A must read for any fantasy addict such as myself.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|There's only a few songs worth hearing on this album, the highlight being Wet Sand, but other than that, just wait and hope that the Chili Peppers deliver better next time. <br /> <br />This album is not worth the money; it is a terrible album, and if you're new to Chili Peppers and have heard Dani California on the radio, get Californification instead. That album is what they are all about.
B000002U9P|5.0|This was Tina's follow-up to her smash \\"Private Dancer\\" album and it was released two years after in 1986. This is a solid album, with few weak spots, and it's a surprise listening to it now that it seems forgotten nowadays. Many musical styles are blended here, from rock to pop and even a touch of country. Tina shows a complete range of talent here, with excellant turn of phrase, and perfect pitch throughout. The rocking \\"Back Where You Started\\" is a gem, and earned her a grammy. The pop hit \\"Typical Male\\", is a strong effort, and she really seemed to have fun with it. \\"What You Get Is What You See\\" has more than a touch of rockabilly, and it is such a fun song. \\"Paradise Is Here\\" has an understated feel to it, and it really works well. Overall in review, one cannot help but wonder if the buying public was beginning to tire of Ms. Turner, as the public's attention span is so notoriously short, because this album didn't really set the world on fire in the States. Overseas, it was a huge hit. Although one can tell, listening to it now, that it was done in the mid-eighties, it has really aged well. Falling in between \\"Private Dancer\\" and \\"Foreign Affair\\", it would be easy to overlook this album in search of Tina's best work. Don't overlook this album, though. True, it may not be her best album, but it certainly is very good, and Tina's good work is much better than most everyone else's best efforts. So get this album added to your collection, and enjoy!
0465011047|5.0|An exceptional book.  A first hand account of life in a NK concentration camp.  The account is horrifyingly similar to other diaries of Nazi concentration camps and the Russian Gulag, but fifty years closer to the present.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Every one of the great guitar gods of our rock and roll time became whom they are for a unique style or technique they used or created. Hendrix used feedback and much distortion through his intricate riffs and otherworldly soloing. Eric Clapton held long rock jams that incorporated piercing fretwork and blues inspiration. Yngwie Malmsteen invented the shred technique. Joe Satriani had riffs and licks to build up to stunning, instrumental performances. And the double-handed tapping? The hammer-ons and pull-offs? <br />That's where Eddie Van Halen came in. <br />Of course, that's not to say the rest of Van Halen isn't talented. In fact, Alex Van Halen is a fantastic drummer, Diamond Dave gave birth to a generation of hard-rock frontment with his falsetto screams and clownish, onstage persona, and Michael Anthony gave us a steady bass-guitar rhythm that, when the four of them combined, produced this stunning debut. <br />Among guitar albums, this is certainly one of the finest. If you were a teenager back in '78, loved rock, and thought it was doomed due to the disco-era, you probably embraced this album, playing the LP until it was so worn out, you had to go back to the music store and buy a fresh one for a dollar or so. And if you were like I was, a teenager who never heard Van Halen until he bought this album what seemed like forever ago, you're in for a treat. <br />Beginning with \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\", the opening bassline and catchy guitar riff draw you in, and won't stop until this mammoth of an album is through. Included in this song is some fine, heavy drumming and a roaring, guitar lick repeated once. \\"Eruption\\" revolutized the guitar and changed its history forever. Beginning with some opening rhythm section support (thanks to Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony), Eddie takes you through a 1:42 trip of insane, exciting guitar playing that, when audiences in 1978 must have heard him for the first time, got shocked beyond belief. Just listen to the opening bit of guitar playing...I DARE YOU not to listen to this song more than once. Coming in where the fadeaway of \\"Eruption\\" left us is a pile-driving cover of the classic Kinks song \\"You Really Got Me\\", with a heavy bassline and huge, crunchy guitar riff that would soon typify Van Halen's style. This one is a bit longer than the original and has a closing that's guaranteed to raise a few thousand hands when played lived. <br /> \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\" continues Eddie's unique guitar playing. If you take guitar and your teacher likes VH, as mine does, he might explain about the \\"chirping\\" style of picking Eddie does here, as well as slight muting during the opening A-minor riff. If you're new to VH and you go to a present-day concert, you should definitely expect to hear this one. It'll get both casual fans and older, longtime VH followes to pump their fists in the air. \\"I'm The One\\" has a bit of a swing feel to it, similar to \\"Hot for Teacher\\" on the stunning VH album \\"1984\\". Yet, one major difference here is that this track has a very cool, doo-wop break towards the end before Eddie, Alex and Michael go crazy on their insturments. If you weren't expecting this, know about it now, for this is quite an addicting track. <br />\\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" seems to be fit for late '70s, early '80s radio, as it has a great, sing-a-long chorus and is only three and a half minutes, but is still a classic song. \\"Atomic Punk\\" is a personal favorite of mine, and what makes this song important is the thumping bassline and pounding drumbeat, with an unusual opener: this is one if the first rock songs I know that involves the scratching of a guitar string. Lots of other axemen have done this probably, but Eddie is surely one of the first. <br /> \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\" seems to almost perfectly prefigure '80s pop-metal: happy, guitar-based, sing-a-long songs. The lyrics seem cheesy in a way (which is never a bad thing) and it's easy to see, if you've given the previous tracks a good listen,that DLR can easily pull it off. \\"Little Dreamer\\" is a very beautiful and melodic song. There is no way you can listen to this song, hear Diamond Dave's soaring vocals and not feel at awe in the audio beauty. <br /> \\"Ice Cream Man\\" is a jolly, almost blues-based song, another one with a swing feel. Opens up with DLR singing, and, to state a truth that might surprise some, plays acoustic guitar. The other three in the band wait until this catchy, little anthem explodes and becomes even better. \\"On Fire\\" seems to be a very appropriate closer. David Lee Roth seems to embody a true rock-star persona with the lyrics, and the instrumental work here is excellent, as well. <br /> Sure, this album is only a few minutes over a half-hour and contains just under a dozen songs, but... <br />It's not everyday a revolutionary album comes out, especially a debut. And who would have thought that this band, to emerage out of Pasadena, CA would have this much success after just one album? One album, I might add, that achieved diamond status. The first time I heard this, and not even ALL of it, while coming home from the mall, I rushed downstairs and tried to experiment with my guitar just as Eddie did. Of course, I had only been playing for a short period of time by then...I was (and still am) certainly an eager guitarist. <br />All right, not to fall underneath an avalanche of great memories, I'd just like to sum up my review by saying that if you haven't already heard this album, it's a must-have and one I guarantee you'll love to listen to over and over, as I did. There's just some magic about listening to these songs for the first time. Anyway, thanks for your time and goodnight.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|The original release of Batman Begins had absolutely no special features, but this Special Edition has a ton of interesting and entertaining documentaries. It almost doubles the amount of time you can spend enjoying Christopher Nolan's masterpiece.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Some bands you have to dig for, or Amazon suggests to you and you buy...Either way its a joy to find these gems.  This album is a great listen from beginning to end.  Love the melodies, love the lyrics, love the passion.  If you find great pleasure, as I do, from music that moves your soul you must get this album today.
0671027344|1.0|I had to read this book as required summer reading. It is the WORST book I have ever had to read. The details of some topics were very graphic and inappropriate. The main character Charlie is a 15 year old boy just entering high school. In just a couple of months he's already faced with a plethora of troubles and problems. I know that there are definitely many problems faced throughout high school but his are ridiculous. He faces just about every big problem possible including death/suicide, homosexuality, prenuptial sex, drugs, smoking, etc. His response to every problem is crying hysterically. My \\"favorite\\" part about the book is that the book never reveals any perks, the only thing we find out is that being a wallflower is a bad thing.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium sheds light on human civilization following WWIII with efforts under way to prevent WWIV.  Having (barely) survived yet another world war, humanity has placed its hopes on a strict regime that forces drugs on the citizens in an effort to suppress all feelings (thus doing away with hate and aggression).  To implement law and order, and oversee the administration of the drugs, the state's leadership relies on the services of a special kind of enforcers known as the Clerics.  One such Cleric, however, will discover that what he's been fighting against might just be worth saving...  <br />Christian Bale, Sean Bean (from LOR), Angus Macfadyen (from Braveheart), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! <br />There are strong hints of 1984 and Brave New World as well as the Matrix, Aeon Flux, Ultraviolet, and V for Vendetta so the movie falls into the sci-fi/action/adventure/mystery type of category. <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the special effects are all wonderful! <br />In short, Equilibrium will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!  <br />
B000244FDW|2.0|I have a great deal of respect for anyone who tries to take the huge, seminal work of Pride and Prejudice to the screen. Even given the time of a mini-series, there is so much to accomplish in so little time.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />This screenwriter fell into the trap, I believe, of making this adaptation too bookish.<br /><br />There are scenes where one is subjected to several minutes of Elizabeth's THOUGHTS. Sorry. That doesn't work.<br /><br />Darcy and Elizabeth have ABSOLUTELY NO CHEMISTRY. The casting was horrendous - Darcy was a fop, Elizabeth had something disturbing about her eyes - they certainly were not fine.<br /><br />The entire filming is horridly steeped in the 1970's - every girl had permed hair, the soundtrack was almost anachronistic, with the inclusion of saxophone, even.<br /><br />Mrs. Bennet was the highlight of this, I think, as she managed to balance silly country woman with caring mother with a believable lack of propriety.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad to have watched it. But I wouldn't watch it again. (And I fast forwarded through much of this!)<br /><br />(*)>
B000002U9W|1.0|I'm always amazed when I see a rating of 5 stars for a dismal album like this. What people are saying is this ranks with the likes of Dark Side, Wish You Here, The Wall, heck, even Piper at the Gates of Dawn. I actually took my vinyl copy off the shelf and put it on and realized why I hadn't listened to this album in probably 20 years. The Atom Heart Mother Suite is better done on various live bootleg versions and most people will note that when Floyd did this song live they shortened it considerably. There's a reason behind it-- it's just not very good. Now the song \\"If\\" is nice, and it's a typical Waters tune for the era, but it certainly doesn't hold the entire album together. The second side of the album does nothing to rescue its listenability and frankly, the entire album is really a waste of time. Perhaps there are those who play this album frequently, but I can't guess that I see this one in the cd player of most Floyd fans. If I went strictly by how many times I've played this album compared to other Floyd albums, I'd have to give this one zero stars, but since there is no spot for zero stars, I 'll give it one. This one is for completists only, but don't expect to listen to it much. It's something you can show your kids and have them laugh at the cows on the cover. The cover gets 5 stars.
B00005JP5J|4.0|The cast in this quirky, very dark comedy make it fresh and very appealing.  It is less funny than it is melancholy, and somehow the players - from the always-fantastically real Toni Colette to the surprisingly layered Greg Kinnear, put heart into a screenplay that likes to go out of its way to be wacky and offkilter.  And to top it off, Steve Carell's turn as the suicidal Proust scholar should get him an Academy Award nomination -seriously.  It is one of those wildly great performances that pop out of nowhere - his innate humor informs the soul of a man who is brilliant, haunted and observant. The movie's slapdash ending has a generic, been-there-before silliness, but this is often a very entertaining and moving slice of life.
B0000T70K4|2.0|I'm not sure I completely understood what Delillo was trying to do with this novel. I understood the whole description of what it was like to be a powerful corporate entity who had an infinite amount of money and who everyone hated for what he represented, but beyond that, the story is very problematic. Delillo seems to be saying that certain character traits are an essential part of anyone as materialistic (not in the I need to buy things sense, but rather the I need to own or have dominion over as much as possible sense) as his protagonist Eric. There was an element of Sartre and Camus in that this corporate demigod wanted some sort of consequence to take place for his misdeeds (including killing his own bodyguard and losing millions of dollars betting against the Yen), but something was simply missing. I think it would have been more effective if Delillo would have simply put the fiction aside and simply written some diatribe on the dangers of money because this whole novel seems to fence-sit, trying to be both a philosophical exploration and great novel, unfortunately failing miserably at both. Although I may not love the philosophy that much, Rand is much more successful at providing entertaining stories and a schematic of her own philosophy than anything I've seen Delillo write.
B000GTLQXU|5.0|I honestly don't know what some of the critics are really looking for in a movie.  I hear lots of whining and complaining about this film (and among many others).  I can see that some people take simple good ol' film entertainment way too seriously, and can't resist to analyze every little detail...into how a movie just couldn't cater perfectly to their own personal preferences... <br /> <br />This movie is by far one of the best movies I've seen this year.  I've seen a lot of great films, but this version of Poseidon will actually be one of the very few DVD's I will add to my collection - something I'll be willing to watch over again.  The effects are great, and the movie itself will keep you entertained all throughout.  The capsizing part is pretty dramatic and realistic too.   <br /> <br />I'd say go for it.  An AWESOME film!
B000GYI32M|4.0|The 3rd season of the televions tv show \\"The O.C.\\" was a large improvement over the melodramatic second season. It brings the charecters and situations into a more grounded terroritry but with also adding more sly and witty pop culture references. The acting is all top notch and the season finale is quite tragic. If you are a fan of John Hughes movies or are a fan of the show, please pick up the complete 3rd season of this highly underrated show.  <br /> <br />Season 1 Grade: A- <br />Season 2 Grade: B- <br />Season 3 Grade: B+

0395645662|5.0|I just got done reading this book for the second time. I decided to teach it to a young girl I am privately tutoring in English. I hadn't read it in about five years and was concerned that it might seem dated the second time around. HARDLY!<br /><br />This masterpiece of Lowry's is for the ages. My student, who normally does not enjoy reading, would take every opportunity she got to \\"see what happens next\\" and often read past what I had assigned her.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful look at what happens when we cease to celebrate diversity and difference. Granted, this is a science fiction novel, but it stems from very real problems. \\"Sameness\\" may be convenient, but it is also a tragedy.<br /><br />Furthermore, for any of you who have read and loved Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\" this is the junior version.<br /><br />This is a book for every age group and a book that is guaranteed to have one asking questions not only of society, but of oneself as well.<br /><br />A Fabulous Read, and at 180 pages, there is no good excuse to pass it by.<br /><br />P.S. The ending is something of a controversy and it makes you, as the reader, decide what has happened (much like Atwood's novel). Truly, this is an exercise that will show you whether you see the glass as half full, or half empty.
0525457585|5.0|Bastian Balthazar Bux escapes his dreary life by reading books,and when he stumbles upon an old volume entitled ''The Never Ending Story'' he feels he must have it. In order to read the book,he hides in the school attic in hope that no one will find him. From the very first chapter,he is captivated by the magical world of Fantastica (the setting ot the story).But he discovers he has an important mission to fufill in this unusual world and is physically transported to the land of Fantastica.  When he arrives, he discovers he has the ability to ''wish'' things into Fantastica, but with each wish, he looses part of his true idedntity. For me, this means we must visit out imaginations, and yet stay in tact with reality. The world Ende creates is as strange and wondorous as  ''Wonderland'' or  ''Oz'', and with an equal amount of charms and surprises.     In the begginnig, the world is presented as a dull and dreary place, as Batian sees it. When he comes back from Fantastica, we see the world through Bastian's enlightened eyes.    THE NEVER ENDING STORY leaves the reader with a shimering feeling of wonder, which stays with him long after the cover is closed.

B000002AP1|5.0|Another reviewer on Amazon, discussing a different album, stated that the album he was reviewing would be the one he would use to introduce an alien to Rock & Roll music for the first time. That is an interesting question, and to my own surprise, one I immediately had my own answer to.  <br /> <br />Iggy & the Stooges' 'Raw Power' is not my all-time favorite album. However, I do believe that it is the very essence of everything that makes me love rock music. The bad attitude, the feeling that it will all explode into a violent mess at any second, the distorted, kick-to-the crotch mix, and the menacing lyrics all say, \\"this is rock.\\"  <br /> <br />I would not end an introduction to rock music with Raw Power, but I think the argument can be made that this is one of the best places to start.  <br /> <br />Come to think of it, maybe Raw Power is my all-time favorite album...

B000002G87|5.0|This album is a must-have for all those who are really interested to know about the second stage of this legendary guitarist after Cream' s dissolution. After a brief withdrawal when recorded that fabulous album with Blind Faith, Clapton decided to join forces with the Dominos, and the results are shown here spanning from 1969 to 1970. One of the main highlights of this album was the radiant supporting team, conformed by Duane Allman, Carl Radle in bass and percussion and Jim Gordon in the drums.<br /><br />You may appreciate the gradual evolution and the expansiveness of his musical thinking along every track. He knew to blend the best of his feeling, and craft with commercial taste. Bell bottom blues, for instance was a piece that was completely ignored in commercial circuits. Keep on growing is a solid theme. Filled of vigor and full rhythm, please beware about the fabulous rhythmical section. \\"Nobody knows you when you're down and out\\" is a classical blues composed by Jimmie Cox, played with incisive rapture  \\"Tell the truth\\" is another formidable classic blues, played with flaming passion and filled of expression.<br /><br />Of course you will listen the evanescent version of Wings and the most commercial success of this ensemble: Layla<br /><br />But when you listen Have you ever loved a woman? , you will have come to one the most distinguished and extraordinary blues of anytime. A sidereal blues that still captives and engages every emerging generation of new listeners. This is without discussion, the jewel of the crown.<br /><br />In sum, a wise choice that will help you to know still more the invaluable contribution that Clapton has conferred the rock, country, blues and the music in general.
0790729601|5.0|What can I say? Arnold has done it again with his latest film, \\"Eraser\\".<br /><br />He plays Witness Protection Program employee John Kruger, in charge of \\"erasing\\" people's identities in order to protect them. This time his charge is Lee Cullen (Williams), a woman who knows too much about the dirty dealings at a weapons corporation.<br /><br />There's not really much more you can say about the plot. And I don't think anyone who goes to see Schwarzennegar films really cares. There was a director who once said to Roger Ebert that in order for a movie to be great, it has to have at least three good scenes and no bad scenes. And in Ebert's review, he said, \\"This movie has four good scenes and no bad scenes.\\" And I would have to agree with him on that point.<br /><br />Despite the probably many impossibilities in this film, such as the cannon-guns used by the bad guys, this movie kept my attention throughout. The one-liners (Arnold's trademark) were fast and funny, the action was the best of any Schwarzennegar film in history, and Pastorelli was great as the Mafioso- witness who was helped by Schwarzennegar in the beginning of the film, providing even more comic relief. If I wasn't cheering, I was laughing. And that's what an action movie should be.
6305657947|5.0|Great little film! I originally saw this movie in the movie theaters in 1999 and had to own it on DVD when it was relased to DVD. This movie is fun and wonderful to add to any one's DVD collection! <br /> <br />The screenplay movies along a good pace and is very engaging from the start as a suspense, action, thriller with added benefit of a steamy, smoldering romance between Brosnan & Russo's characters! <br /> <br />Characters are very dynamic and very well cast with very witty dialogue..... I couldn't have imagined the lead roles being played by anyone else other than Pierce Brosnan, who plays successful/rich playboy, Thomas Crowne who has everything that life has to offer & yet is out to push the envelope to get past the boredom of having it all.  <br /> <br />While Rene Russo, plays Catherine Banning, an insurance investigater out to \\"catch the thief\\" that stole a painting insured by the company she works for by any means neccessary. Banning is no shrinking violet, a real ball buster if you will, out to get her man, and one smart cookie to boot. She is beautiful as she is smart and isn't above using both her brains and sex appeal to get what she wants. <br /> <br />Lots of plot twists and turns help make this movie anything but predictable! Love the whole movie including the soundtrack and even costuming. Highly recommend.

B00000JRTX|5.0|Mike Newell's secure directorial abilities  allowed this reflective comedy -seemed to be inspired in the famous stylistic tradition of Oscar Wilde. The occurrences of a irreverent womanly is seen through a warm friendship, but at the time his friends get marry, he feels the social conventions exert the invisible pressure through suggestive comments, until he hits off with another wedding guest. If you are not absolutely involved with the spirit of the British comedy, maybe you experience the sensation of being out of focus with this existential comedy which works out as a healthy life's lesson, respect the in and outs of the singleness.<br /><br />But if you are disposed and accustomed to this genre, come and enjoy one of most original and marvelous comedies of the Nineties which consolidated Grant as one of the maxim exponents of this engaging genre.<br /><br />Totally recommended.
1559409002|5.0|Carnival of Souls is one of my favorite kinds of movie -  the low budget horror film that manages to unnerve, and create a world of mystery and possibilities despite - and sometimes even because of - its lack of funding.  It's the only feature film made by the late Herk Harvey, and despite a lackluster initial release, it has become increasingly popular over the years. It ponders the question - when the emotionally dead actually die, do they even notice?<br /><br />One of the director's best decisions was to take a considerable amount of his meager budget and spend it on a quality yet unknown leading actress in Candace Hilligoss.  She certainly was perfect for the lead role of Mary Henry. She is excellent at portraying someone who is emotionally hollow who has ironically chosen something that generally attracts people of passion - music - as a profession. In the hands of a less able actress, Mary's largely deadpan demeanor would have simply appeared to be the work of an actress who was unclear about her motivation. Harvey knew instinctively that poor acting in a low budget horror film always takes the viewer out of the proper element and instead makes the film campy - which is definitely not a word that describes this movie.<br /><br />The film opens when a car filled with guys challenges a car filled with girls to a drag race.  Drag races in movies rarely yield anything but tragic outcomes, and in this case, the girls' car plunges off the side of a bridge and disappears into the murky river below.  As the local law enforcement attempt to drag the river, complaining because of its current height and low visibility that the car might never be found, one of the victims, Mary Henry, crawls out of the water, covered in muck and obviously in a stupor, but physically unharmed.  She remembers nothing about the accident. In spite of this tragedy, she continues with her plans to move west to Salt Lake City, where she's been offered a job as a church organist.  While on the trip west an eerie ghoulish face and figure, who looks a lot like Uncle Fester of the Addams Family, begins to appear out of nowhere and then disappear just as suddenly, and nobody seems able to see him except for her.<br /><br />She takes a boarding room just down the hall from John (Sidney Berger), who quickly tries to put the moves on her with all of the finesse of a pimply-faced high school sophomore.  Berger was always proud of the fact that film critic Roger Ebert called him \\"the definitive portrait of a nerd in lust\\".  Mary sometimes rejects John, but sometimes welcomes his company just because she's beginning to fear being alone, considering the random appearances of the ghoulish figure. Mary is not the kind of person who needs people for companionship. Instead, unless they fulfill a concrete requirement like a car or a coffeemaker, or in John's case something that wards off the ghoul that stalks her, she is largely indifferent to their presence.<br /><br />An abandoned carnival ground on the outskirts of town catches Mary's attention, and she begins to be drawn toward it, as though that strange setting might offer some sort of answer to her mystery.  What follows is two terrific set pieces, one involving her practicing her music in church only to be overcome by visions and a mysterious power that turns her playing into something `profane' that gets her fired from her job, and the first of two eerie scenarios where Mary seems to have become invisible and inaudible to all around her. The ending might have been considered surprising in 1962, but today it's pretty obvious from the beginning what is probably going on. In this movie, however, the entertainment is in the journey, not the destination.<br /><br />What Harvey lacked in finances for special effects, he more than made up for in atmosphere, which cost him monetarily little or nothing.  His undead creatures are startling to look at, and the way he films their bizarre, macabre dances is both strange and unnerving.  When he claimed his influences were Jean Cocteau and Ingmar Bergman, he wasn't kidding.  Fans of those directors will notice how much homage is paid to them in this film, and how much those were the right two filmmakers to emulate to create the surreal mood of this particular picture.  Also, the unforgettable organ score by Gene Moore is perfect for adding just the right mood to this film.<br /><br />The original version of the picture had five minutes cut out of it by Harvey's distributor, simply to make the movie fit better on a double feature billing.  With this DVD, you can compare that version with the restored director's cut, and I believe that the latter is definitely the better one.  Most of what was cut came from two scenes near the end, the second adventure of invisibility for Mary, and the final confrontation at the carnival grounds.  Harvey's version is decidedly creepier, with a much better flow to it.<br /><br />Carnival of Souls was one of the first truly good low-budget out-of-the-mainstream classic horror films. The next one would be 1968's \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" by George Romero. This movie proves that talent, vision, and imagination can triumph over funding to create something lasting, memorable, and unique. Who would have thought that a film that cost only $30K to make would have people talking philosophically about the dividing line between life and death over 40 years later?  How many of the films made in the last five years that cost $100 million to make will have the same effect on audiences 40 years from now?  I doubt many if any will.strange and unnerving.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|Just plowed through Season 2 in the past 3 days...Awesome.<br />  While not as good as the first year in that, except for Meg on the bus, I didnt care about the victims. In the first season we got to know Lilly Kane through flashbacks and empathized with Veronicas  grief over losing someone she idolized...<br />However being in the Veronica Mars world with its dimly lit sets and snappy dialogue more than makes up for this negative. The last episode blew my mind..just wish they had more episodes like that with the revelations and action.  Season 3 will be doing mini-stories so hopefully that will keep things more interesting.<br />Loved seeing the scene between Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter. It brought out the inner buffy geek in me.<br />All in all this show is better than most shows and my second favorite after LOST.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|The \\"Serenity\\" film is the conclusion to the \\"Firefly\\" science fiction TV series, though you don't need to have seen the series to watch the film.    Now I'd call myself a pretty big fan of science fiction, and pretty easy to please in terms of being entertained, definitely. Yet, unlike a lot of the viewers and reviewers here, I found this film pretty dull. There's an awful lot of dialogue (I was pretty amazed how much dialogue writer/direcotr Joss Whedon could fit in, actually) though it didn't seem to be full of much substance. I didn't find the plot very engaging, and I can't remember enough of it to describe it properly (which hardly ever happens with me). There was action, but I didn't feel it, it just seemed to... happen! There was characters who appeared to be interacting and developing, but I just could get into them at all. I didn't know them at the start, and I didn't know them at the end, just the things they did. There were concepts and sci-fi ideas, but none of them intrigued me really, hardly at all. Meanwhile, my girlfriend fell asleep in the first twenty minutes. That usually says something, I've noticed...    Probably live without this one, I thought.
6305076995|4.0|This is classic Yes, at their most compelling. I guess there's very little film of them from this era - they were hardly ever on TV. I'd forgotten this film existed, but I now remember seeing it at the cinema in 1973 or 74. Obviously it's not great film quality, but neither is it heavily doctored. It's great just to see the guys at close quarters. An absolute 'must' for any real Yes fan.

B000002L9M|5.0|<br />Regarded by critics and fans alike as one of Depeche Mode's best albums, Black Celebration was a turning point in the bands career. <br /> <br />The quartet of Basildon  emerged as one of the biggest bands of the era with the release of this album, and there are many reasons for that. <br /> <br />The period of experimentation that began three years before in \\"Construction Time Again\\" reached the summit here. Depeche Mode mixed  electronica with Goth sounds, though the result was never Goth.  <br /> <br />Martin Gore, in a burst of creativity, offered some of the best vocalic and literally dramatic songs of the eighties, exploring topics from longing to desire, sex to politic and even death. <br />Due to this, Black Celebration is one of the darkest albums of modern times, praised by many but also censored by mainstream critic. Its explicit and sometimes \\"embarrassing\\" lyrics relegate it to a more eclectic, cultish audience. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"A question of Lust\\" and \\"Sometimes\\" are proof of Martin's vocalization at his best. Only few cases in the history of electronic music can be proud of saying that (e.g Alyson Moyet in Yazoo). <br /> <br />In musically terms, Black Celebration was a seminal point in the use of electronic instruments (thanks the gifted musician Alan Wilder). Sampling and the use of most modern keyboards created new and unheard atmospheres, similar in artists like Kraftwerk or Can.  <br />The song Black Celebration might as well be the best example of it, as well as the murky-harmonious \\"But not tonight\\".  <br /> <br />The influence of the album on the forthcoming musical scene is as big as its success. Bands like Rammstein or Red Hot Chili Peppers have made cover versions of songs from it. All dance electronic scene often mentions songs like \\"A question of Time\\" as a definite superb moment in the non-guitars musical movement. <br /> <br />Black Celebration is also the shift of a pop band into a cult major act. Its sound invaded independent and alternative radio stations in the US and Europe during the second half of the Thatcher- Reagan era (and eventually in the entire world) and started a dramatically growth in the population of Depeche Mode fanatics. <br />It was the perfect prelude for the acclaimed and commercially successful \\"Music for the Masses\\". <br /> <br />In all definitions, Black Celebration is one of the most important moments in the history of alternative and electronic music. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I saw the last two tours that Pink Floyd perfomed and the last tour ---the Division Bell was incredible.  After all of these years, that is still the best concert I have ever been too.  I love Pulse.  I have been waiting for years for them to rerelease the DVD of this concert and finally it is here.  The music and the pyrotechnics/laser show is fantastic.  If you never saw this concert in person, this DVD will show you what you had missed!  Enjoy.
0553579908|4.0|A Class of Kings by George R.R. Martin is the second book in the epic fantasy series titled A Song of Ice and Fire. This book takes place right after the events on A Game of Thrones, so I implore you if you have not yet read A Game of Thrones do not read this book, you will be immediately lost.<br /><br />Due to the nature of how Martin is putting these books together, multiple points of view, there are several different plots that are occurring at the same time. There is an all encompassing `major plot' if you will, that of who will be king of Westeros. However, all these little subplots that we are privy to throughout the book are what makes the book, and series, a fantastic read. There are no less than 8 points of view in this book and one may think that with that many you would have trouble following the different plots, and plot twists throughout the chapters. I did not find that to be the case at all. In fact, there were times when I kept reading simply to find out what was happening in a different sub-plot. Martin has a knack for pulling on the reader's heart strings, either making you care deeply for a character or hating a characters. There are so many plot twists in this book that the reader will always be guessing and just when you think you have it figured out something else will happen, it is a journey to read, but very much worth it.<br /><br />These books are largely based on the characters. A book with a great plot can become junk if the characters are not believable. Have no fear about that with this book. The characters are more than believable. Most characters are written in shades of grey. Meaning they are neither all `good' nor are they all `bad'. They are human, and as such, they look out for themselves and their kin. The vast majority of the characters in this book have a great deal of character development. Some of that development is for the better, and some is for the worse. The characters are becoming very well fleshed out, more so than after A Game of Thrones. I would caution people on becoming overly attached to a character. Martin is a master at reminding the reader that no character is safe, and that if the story needs it a character can... and will die. I find that refreshing, in so many books the good guys no matter how bad things get, always survive and win the day. That is not the case with these books.<br /><br />I feel the need to say that I found the first half of this book a grind to get through. Not in the sense that it was bad writing, just that it took a long time for things to shape up. It was a plodding plot and characters for awhile. However, once the actions starts, about the last third of the book, it really picks up and flies past. There are a great deal of fantasy elements in this book, but as of right now most are rather subdued. While they are present they have yet to become in your face type elements that are common in Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance etc. This is not a bad thing, it just depends on what you are looking for in a book.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book a little less than the first book in the series. Mainly due to the slowness of the first half of the book. Yet, I did enjoy it quite a bit. As with the first book I can see most fantasy fans really enjoying this book. This is adult fantasy and as such has sex and violence in it. It does not throw it in the reader's face though, it just happens and fits in with the book. I would highly recommend this series to anyone looking for some epic fantasy.an after A Game of Thrones. I would caution people on becoming overly attached to a character.

0451191153|5.0|A portrait of a man who has a vision and lets nothing interfere with his quest.  Very inspirational. This book uncovers the phallacy of charity.  To give a man something without getting anything in return, disrespects the recipient as well as the giver.  Expect more of yourself and your fellow man.  We are great even if we forgot it.  Don't be a sucker.
B00005JO9J|5.0|As a person in the medical field, I often get \\"off track\\" watching hospital shows (finding errors in the \\"medicine\\") and wind up not enjoying them as much as other shows based on professions I know nothing about.  Grey's Anatomy has it's share of \\"it just doesn't work that way\\" moments re: the medicine, but its characters and storyline are so entertaining that you get drawn in immediately. <br /> <br />A friend gave me the DVD of Season One and told me I'd like it.  I had it several weeks before popping it in to the DVD player late one night when I just needed to veg out.  About 3:00am I made myself turn off the DVD after watching the first five epidsodes in a row!  Of course, I finished it the next night.  Since then, I've been hooked and recording all the summer re-runs of Season Two I can find.  (Can't wait for that DVD to be released!) <br /> <br />I think the thing that sucks you in is the characters.  The interaction between the five very-different interns, the \\"nazi\\" resident (who is a big softy underneath), and the attending surgeons plays well.  The story line is always entertaining and doesn't tend to follow predictable \\"hospital show\\" lines.  Overall, very enjoyable!

B00005JLWN|4.0|The plot of this movie is absurd.  It brought in elements of 1984, Brave New World, etc., using drugs to control the populace.  However, how many truly enjoyable science fictions stories are realistic? <br /> <br />Christian Bale was very good in his role as the Grammaton Cleric, who numbly watched the incineration of his wife and who kills rebels as easily as a normal person would swat flies.  His action scenes are believable and beautifully choreographed.  The precision of his character's moves were pure visual candy.  The fight scenes alone would make a fantastic montage.  One of the movies' weaknesses was Bale's children, who were just too unbelievable. <br /> <br />This movie was a sleeper, and I see why.  The story lacks general appeal and the visuals are not enough to draw in the average movie fan.  The sets are too drab, which unfortunately was one of the points of the story.  Unlike the matrix, which has beautiful visuals, Equilibrium would have lost something if it did what would have made it more visually appealing. <br /> <br />For any science fiction fan, this movie is perfect.  However, my rating of 4 stars is a balance between my enthusiasm as a sci-fi fan and my critical eye as a moviegoer.
B000GFRDN6|5.0|First off, before the \\"review\\", I'd encourage everyone who likes any form of rock, blues, swing, jazz, etc...to listen to this CD and more importantly, check out Steve Miller in the bonus live-in-concert DVD, before you write off Steve Miller--as many music reviewer snobs have--as some dopey guy with sunglasses who wrote \\"that Joker song\\", and calls himself a \\"space cowboy\\" and sings about `smoking and toking'.  If your only knowledge of The Steve Miller Band is `The Joker'--as was the case for me several years ago--do yourself a favor and check this CD/DVD out!!  Judging Steve Miller by only `The Joker' is like judging The Who by `Squeezebox', or Pink Floyd by `Mother'.  (Giving the Grateful Dead their due), \\"jam bands\\" Dave Matthews Band and Phish are original, but they did not invent the \\"Jam Band\\" concept.  After watching `Fly Like an Eagle', `Dance, Dance, Dance'(evoking images of Dave Matthews and Boyd Tinsley's many guitar/violin jams), `Shu Ba Da Du Ma Ma Ma Ma' and `Tore Down', I think you'll agree Steve Miller deserves every bit of his \\"Father of the Jam Band\\" title.   <br /> <br />(1) The CD:  It was a great CD then, and even better now, with the re-mastered tracks.  Masterful rock music only gets better with age.  Miller was way ahead of his time in 1976(much like Pink Floyd were in '73 with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"'s groundbreaking sampling and looping effects), and you can hear it on 'Fly Like an Eagle's `Space Intro', with the echoplex delay effect used with the synthesizer. <br /> <br />(2) The 3 previously un-released demos of 'Take the Money and Run', Fly Like an Eagle' and `Rockin' Me' are a rare glimpse of how a brilliant composition usually starts out bare and unimpressive.  Hearing an early demo of `Take the Money and Run' with the chord progressions of \\"The Joker\\" was interesting, and I'm glad he switched them up, as well as eventually upping the tempo on all three.  The album was recorded and meant to be heard in quadraphonic sound, and as Miller says in the interview, with this release it actually can be heard the way he intended it to heard.   <br />  <br />(3) The Special Guests: George Thorogood seemed a bit nervous and out of sorts on stage with Miller, but he slams the fans with some killer blues, metal-slide guitar riffs.  Joe Satriani was restrained and aloof, but the guy is so ridiculously talented he had no problem \\"answering\\" Miller, adding blistering jams during 'Fly Like an Eagle' and 'Tore Down'.  And who would ever envision, or in a million years picture Steve Miller and Joe Satriani jamming to an old Freddie King blues number?!   <br /> <br />(4)With the live concert DVD, you get to see where this guy came from.  And you also see that this guy can PLAY the GUITAR!!   (I first witnessed this last year when I saw him in New York--only about 2 weeks before this concert was filmed--I knew his voice and the songs were great, but I never knew he was such a great guitarist).  You see his strong blues roots going back to the mid-60's, when he was already leading a blues band at the age of 12!, getting lessons from T-Bone Walker and filling in for Chuck Berry at the Filmore West.  This guy has the best resume I think of any guitarist I've ever seen.  On stage, he takes that blues foundation and works it into his songs so well that they appeal to mainstream rock audiences, and at the same time are subtly supported by his mastery of blues fundamentals.  Just listen to 'Shu Ba Da Du Ma Ma Ma', and you hear his distinctly original sound--his fusion of psychedelic blues with rock n' roll--slowly taking form, and coming to fruition with 'Fly Like an Eagle'.  The only downside about the live in concert DVD, is that all the footage was taken strictly from the close-ups--projection screen images, so there are no far-away shots of the Band, stage, or fans.  That's really the only downside, besides not playing 'Jet Airliner' and 'Living in the USA' - 2 of my favorite songs. <br /> <br />For goodness sake, this guy is in his 60's, and he still rocks!  For a blues/rock guitarist, this DVD & interview(both firsts) in addition to the remastered CD are the best 20 bucks I've ever spent.  Like another reviewer said, a \\"ridiculous\\", amazing value. <br /> <br />Oh yeah...Buy this DVD!!       <br />
630529142X|5.0|Waterboy is the story of a poor man's Forrest Gump who owes his dim-witted persona to the overprotective nature of his mother.  Adam Sandler is at his silly, \\"stupid comedy\\" best playing Bobby Boucher, a Cajun recluse who has been a waterboy for one football team or another his entire life.  After losing his job, he eventually catches on with another team where his life changes dramatically.<br /><br />One day while perorming his waterboy duties, something he takes to ridiculously hilarious extremes, Bobby is abused by his new team.  His precious water gets spit in, he gets tackled, and everyone of the players makes fun of him.  With his old team, he had to endure the pain and ridicule without retaliation, but not with the new team.<br /><br />A star is born.<br /><br />Bobby eventually joins the team where he immediately, albeit inexplicably, becomes the starting linebacker.  Despite his lack of football knowledge, he ends up becoming one of the greatest forces in college football history.  He destroys everyone and everything on the opposing team, with highlight after highlight, using visualizations of all who have wronged him in the past to fuel his aggression.<br /><br />Waterboy is highly enjoyable, with classic Sandler, and tons of either comedy or action to satisfy all needs.  Henry Winkler is great in his role, bringing laughs whenever he's on-screen.  Kathy Bates is great as the near-psychotic mother,  a Col. Sanders lookalike who brings about easy comedy, and the cameos of Rob Schnieder and Clint Howard are subtle comedic genius.<br /><br />I must warn all potential viewers.  You may find yourself quoting several portions of the movie when finished, and quotes are FOR THE DEVIL!
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|I was so looking forward to this film. After all, it's a movie sequel based off a game! Even if I didn't care for FF: The Spirits Within, I figured...hey, if they're using characters and canon from an existing game, surely they'll have more material to build with and will produce a good movie! <br /> <br />I was wrong. <br /> <br />I gave it two stars because the graphics were absolutely stunning. They're beautiful and amazing and THAT alone is what was able to get me through the movie. Everything else? Painful and uninspired. The plot is basically non-existent, and what plot there is serves only as a weak excuse to move the characters from one long, Matrix-style battle scene to the next. There is very little actual interaction between the characters--unless, of course, you count fighting as interaction. <br /> <br />Because that is all the movie is. <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of the games! I loved FFVII--it was a moving game with actual depth and wonderful characterization. I remember actually getting teary playing that game, and pissed off at the villains. There were plot twists and surprises that I never saw coming. This movie? I couldn't care less for the characters because they all acted the same and had absolutely no personality--unless you want to count Reno. There was no sense of danger or suspense, and the film severely lacked the sense of camaraderie that existed between the characters in the game. <br /> <br />And as for suspense? Hah. It was all very easy to predict. <br /> <br />I kind of wished I rented it. <br /> <br />Great graphics, but very poor content. That's pretty much what describes this.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />\\"Serenity\\" is writer/director Joss Whedon's theatrical film follow-up to his defunct TV series, \\"Firefly.\\"  I have never seen the original show so I have no idea how a fan would be likely to react to this film.  As a newbie, however, I can only report that \\"Serenity\\" might have been a bit more fun if it didn't look and feel quite so much like a \\"Star Wars\\" wannabe.  Instead of the \\"Empire,\\" here we have the \\"Alliance\\" as the mega-force against which the rebel forces are fighting.  The twist in this case is that the rebels have been forced to give up their more noble aspirations of overthrowing a repressive regime and have turned to what amounts to inter-galactic bank robbery and payroll heists to put food on the table after suffering a defeat in the war with the Alliance.  Malcolm Reynolds' transport ship, Serenity, is the equivalent of Han Solo's Millennium Falcon, with its rogue passengers doing battle with the evil forces of not only the Alliance but some carnivorous creatures known as Reavers.<br /><br />The story begins with a 17-year old girl named River, who possesses psychic powers, being brainwashed at the hands of ruthless scientists working for the Alliance.  After her brother, Doc, rescues her from the laboratory, the two of them seek refuge on the Serenity, a ship whose crew is unaware of River's troublesome background.  Soon, the captain, Mal, and his cohorts are plunged into a battle with the Alliance forces who are attempting to destroy River at any and all costs.  Again, as in \\"Star Wars,\\" the ship and its crew engage in an intergalactic chase with a force much bigger and more powerful that they somehow must find a way to defeat.  There's even a scene so reminiscent of the Luke-I-Am-Your-Father encounter in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" that I half expected the combatants to whip out their light sabers at any moment.<br /><br />Despite the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu that permeates the work, \\"Serenity\\" has a few fun moments involving the characters' interactions with one another.  The rebels aboard the Serenity are not always prime candidates for heroism, often acting as much out of fear and self-interest as righteousness and courage.  The acting is generally wooden, but the plotting is intriguing enough to sustain our interest through most of the movie.  The special effects are a mite below par for what one would expect to find in a sci-fi film today, but Whedon pushes the action along fast enough to keep us distracted from some of the weaknesses in the visuals.<br /><br />This is definitely a mixed bag when it comes to science fiction entertainment.  The dialogue ranges from the sharp to the cheesy, as does virtually everything else in the movie.  It makes for OK viewing, but, in all honesty, you'd be better off popping \\"Star Wars\\" into the DVD player and watching the real thing instead.he characters' interactions with one another.

B000GCFO0I|4.0|Before I give my opinion of the movie, I just want to say that my wife HATES scary movies and especially horror movies. She sat down with me and watched this and was glued to the television, completely involved. More so than me. (I wanted to watch it at night when it was dark, but she won't... too scary.) About halfway through, I mentioned the cliffs, the streets that have been broken apart as if Silent Hill were cut off from the world and how it was just like the video game... cool. She said, \\"This was a video game?\\"<br /><br />So, before I begin, this is an excellent film and you don't have to know the video game to enjoy it. In fact, it is recommended, because you'll know less about what is coming and what to expect.<br /><br />Silent Hill is hands down the most successful Video game to Movie transfer to date, and I don't say that based on revenue. I say that based on quality of film and quality of entertainment.<br /><br />Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Chris DaSilva (Sean Bean) have adopted a beautiful and charming little girl named Sharon (Jodelle Ferland). Knowing little of her past or where she came from, they are mystified and frustrated by the elaborate sleepwalking incidents and the unconscious mentioning of a mysterious ghost town named SILENT HILL. Getting nowhere with doctors or medication, Rose, in desperation, decides to bring Sharon to SILENT HILL and get to the bottom of her dreams.<br /><br />SILENT HILL is a fantastic mix of movie elements. It's not just a horror movie. It is a mystery. It is a riddle. It's the story of a Mother and Father who'll do anything to save their adopted daughter from her torment. On top of that, it's a wonderful display of graphics, visual effects and creature creation.<br /><br />As Officer Bennett (Laurie Holden) and Rose stare in amazement at the fact that the road they came in on has seemingly destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake, the blob-like armless man lumbers their way with its legs bowed inward. A fantastic build up of what's to come and what they're in for.<br /><br />I won't give away the elements of the story that make this a fantastic viewing experience. Giving away the elements will destroy the fun of the mystery. I will say that the movie managed to stay true to the game, but also took it in a completely different direction. The creators of the film made some great choices with their creative liberties.<br /><br />From the opening moments to the closing moments, SILENT HILL is intriguing and interesting. It never rests. It is solid from top to bottom. I'm not sure why I don't give it 5 stars, because I really liked it.

0895260131|2.0|This book is really quite a cackel.  It proports to be a guide to Islam.  All but the most gullible will be immediately suspicious of this text.  Per Mr. Spencer, Islam is quite a hateful religion.  He seems to be able to find no positive statements to make about a religion followed by something like a billion people.  (The visually inclined will already be suspicious by the cover photo.  Never saw a Muslim that looked like that myself, and I've seen a fair number.) Furthurmore, all but the most intellectually isolated people will suspect, if not know, that it is unlikely that all these Muslims will agree on an single interpretation of the religion or the text (Qu'ran).  A pious Sunni from Egypt will have a very different take on what the Qu'ran means, compared with a Sufi from Afghanistan, or a Shi'a from Iran. Christians will immediately understand this: Christian scripture has been used to support and oppose the war on Iraq, and in the Constitutional Convention (USA) was used to argue both for and against slavery.   <br />    Mr. Spencer basically ignores the problem of different interpretations.  Not to fear: he provides his own.  He casually refutes the opinions of experts with short quotations from the Qu'ran, Hadith, or some radical Imam his has pulled off the internet.  Unfortunately, he has apparently had little exposure to the centuries of interpretation of the Qu'ran by Muslims, and unless I miss my mark, little or no knowlege of classical arabic.  Consequently, his interpretation bares little resemblance to the interpretation used by the vast majority of Muslims.  What you get instead is Mr. Spencer's personal interpretation of the Qu'ran.  Thank God he is no Muslim (he'd be out there with Osama). <br />    This is not to say this book has no utility.  (After all, I did give it two stars!!)  Fanatical hate mongers of all non-Muslim varieties  (White supremicists, Christian Warriors (should be an oxymoron, but it isn't, nowadays), etc.)  will love it.  Plop it right down on the shelf next to Protocals of the Elders of Zion and go prepare for Armageddon.  Radical Muslim hate mongers will love it as well, for different reasons: \\" look at how the Crusader's malign our religion.  Come join us for retribution!\\"  Finally, Absurdists will enjoy bits and pieces of the text: the part where he (Spencer) tries to show how Islam is both anti homosexual and yet somehow promoting homosexuality (in the chapter on Paradise) is quite a trip.  Serious Absurdists will probably find the book to banal to buy however.  Sociologists may find it useful for understanding how propagandists can lead to misunderstanding between religions. For the rest of us, there are many better introductions to Islam out there.  No one book or text is capable of introducing a religion completely.  However, in my opinion this book is misleading and of little utility to anyone seriously interested in Islam.
0895260131|1.0|The problem with this book by Robert Spencer is exploitation of Europe's and American's ignorance of Islam (a community that is already viewed with suspicion and hostility) and propping it up as the \\"new threat\\" like Communism. <br /> <br />In that sense it is a dangerous book where, Mr. Spencer has nothing of substance to offer about Islamic faith yet rants about the existential struggle against a major world religion, similar to Hitler's hateful view against Judaism. <br /> <br />It seems in the book, the author is more content with capitalizing on the terrorism to link it and generalize about the faith of 1/5th of humanity with evil, a dangerous mindset indeed. <br /> <br />Such is the hollow \\"expertise on Islam\\" the reader is being offered.  <br /> <br />I suggest saving your few bucks on this book for the author has already accomplished his goal of being paraded on conservative, right-wing talk show like FoxNews for his shallow, twisted commentary on Islam.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This Soundtrack has alot to offer.  Though the movie was fantastic, I feel the music made it into a true masterpeice.  The songs are all remakes with new arangments which actually fix any flaws the originals had.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor both have very good voices.  Most notable is Ewan McGregor's version of \\"Your Song\\" which is so good that it gave me chills.  Also El Tango De Roxanne is a great song.  Hindi Sad Diamonds mixes pop with Bollywood with great results.  A must have Soundtrack!
0312323859|5.0|My best friend and I decided to start reading again,(neither one of us big readers).  I saw these books on the best seller table, thought the covers were pretty and figured I had as much of a chance of liking these books as any other.  I read the first paragraph of SOMETHING BORROWED and immediately called my friend and told her I had struck gold!!  I read her the 1st couple of paragraphs and she went crazy over the book as I did.  We can't read these books fast enough! Especially if you are in your 30's, the 80's references, and the way the charcters speak makes you identify with them and you will feel like they have been friends you've known for years.  I started telling everyone how much I was enjoying reading again and my sister-in-law said she had a great reccomendation for me and it turned out to be SOMETHING BORROWED!  Now I have friends and family joining in and everyone is loving these books!  Hope you do too!
B000G759LW|4.0|I really want to say this album was one of the best I've ever heard.  I want to say Christina has bested the unbeatable Stripped, and I want to say the album blew me away.  Unfortunately, as much as I would to, I just can't <br /> <br />First with the good.  Her vocals are amazing as always, and are so without sounding like the recording studio played around with the recording.  A lot of the songs are actually pretty good.  \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" is very catchy and fun, \\"Still Dirrty\\"  is a very well-written song, \\"I've Got Trouble\\" has some of the most lush, rich vocals you could hope for from Christina, \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" is a very sexy love song, and \\"Candyman\\" is a fast-paced romp that will be playing on repeat for a while.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the album is highly flawed.  At a little over 70 minutes, the entire collection could have fit onto one CD no problem.  In other words, for a two-disc album, the amount of music is very minimal.  Secondly, some of the influences for old-fashioned jazz and big band music are a little too vague and subtle to really be effective.  I'm sorry, but having a trumpet wail in the background does not make music jazzy.  Thirdly, as a package, a lot of the songs don't complement each other.  It's hard to explain, but a lot of the music does not seem to belong here. <br /> <br />However, I still have to give Back to Basics four stars.  It was an ambitious effort, which partly succeeds, and makes a decent listen occasionally.  I think most of the reasons I was disappointed was because the hype made it seem more than it is.  In truth, some of the songs sound like they were intended for Stripped but didn't belong.  I still recommend you buy it if you are a Christina Aguilera fan or if you like pop music, but you don't need to rush out and buy it.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Whether the song is happy or not, the whole album is very fun. The lyrics are moving and witty. Great for dancing, driving, and singing along. If you like \\"Crazy\\", you haven't heard nothin' yet..
0743454537|5.0|I had never read a Jodi Picoult novel before, but the subject matter was so interesting I just couldn't resist.  It tells the story about a woman who decides to give birth to a child with her clinically ill daughter's genes.  The \\"designer baby\\", Anna, later in life, decides to sue for medical emancipation, and throughout the process, we are treated to a story debating the now-possible process of making the genes in your child. <br /> <br />It is very gripping to read a book like this, because you'll think you feel one way before you even open it, but as you learn about the characters and their motives, it is not as black and white as you think.  First, you'll think Anna is right, and next you'll think she's being a brat.  Same with her mother.  She's a selfish woman one second, and a fighting mother the next.  You go through the family conflicts during the first half of the book, with reactions to the lawsuit, flashbacks to the early nineties when Anna's role as a donor begins, and other issues.  The majority of the second half revolves around the court procedure, with one bombshell that was not expected. <br /> <br />The ending, while not one I would have thought of, was not as bad as some seem to think.  It doesn't tie everything up into a bow, nor does it give you a feeling of satisfaction, but that's life.  The book's ending is very bittersweet and ironic. <br /> <br />For a gripping read, and one that will make you think, this book does the job.
B000G75AE8|3.0|This album should please the type of Slayer fan who wishes for no more than the same thing over and over again. This might distinguish itself enough from \\"God Hates Us All\\", but isn't too much out side of the Slayer fray of the past 16 years. But there are those of us Slayer fans who remember more than just \\"Reign in Blood\\" and liked the musical diversity of \\"South of Heaven\\" and the sometimes technical nature of \\"Hell Awaits\\". With this new album, there are just enough new tricks to keep me from rating this album any lower.   <br /> <br />The main problem I have with Slayer is that they only really diversified/branched out with their sound once (for SOH in '88). Their fans trashed them for it back then, regardless of what they think of SOH today, and Slayer learned what the boundaries were and stayed carefully within them. It might be refreshing if just for once, they tried to craft or broaden their sound even if it meant loosing some fans. And if you talk to the Slayer fan of today all they want is \\"Reign in Blood\\" volumes 1,2,3,4, etc. <br /> <br />Despite all this and the cartoonish title and cover, there are some good tracks my favorites being the opener \\"Flesh Storm\\", the second and fifth songs. The production style is a little dry but thoroughly modern. The guitars are with mostly mediocre riffs, but every so often the Hanneman/King duo comes up with something really great usually as the pre-chorus. Lombardo does the best job of any instrument on the album. The key to Lombardo isn't that he is fast or technical or anything. It's really the fact that he can play to a click and is so damn exact. He's like the Phil Rudd of metal. The most unfortunate performance comes from Araya's vocals. For some reason they're a little bit more pronounced and clearer than in the past few albums. Word has it that they wanted the lyrics to be more up-front on this album. \\"Hail satan\\" and such was funny in 1985, but in 2006 this band is quickly becoming a self-parody if they think they actually have a message. At least Spinal Tap is a funny self-parody. <br /> <br />Maybe the biggest problem for Slayer is that their lesser known peers from the eighties have come back in the past year or two with better records (examples being Kreator, Sadus and Exodus.) CD is worth getting if you can find it for $10.
B000FSME1A|3.0|Just as I said in the title, both versions of the movie are spread over two discs, which is UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.  <br /> <br />It perplexes me to think that two versions of a film in a two disc set splits both movies up over two discs instead of putting one version on disc 1 and the other on disc 2. I want to know what the logic was to do this? I could speculate, but I'd love to know what drugs were actually being smoked when this decision was reached. Do the studios actually think the consumer enjoys having to change discs to see ONE movie?  <br /> <br />This is worse than selling wide and full screen versions of a movie separately.

She also has fun picking out the \\"extra\\" fish that look like strawberry fish, pineapple fish, etc.  The sing-songy rhymes are as fun as the artwork and a definite winner in our house!
0156030322|4.0|Driver is a survivor. A movie stuntman, he makes his way on raw talent, the horrors of his Arizona childhood left behind at sixteen when he walks away from his foster parents, steals their car and heads to LA. Known for his driving skills, Driver is caught up in another, more lucrative trade, driving getaway cars for small time robbers, until the last job, one that leaves him injured, three dead bodies scattered about the room.<br /><br />Trying to make right the robbers' terrible mistake in stealing from this particular mark, Driver runs up against the implacable vengeance of the rightful owner of almost a quarter of a million dollars, a ruthless man who is not satisfied with the return of the money, set on revenge. Driver carefully picks his way through this minefield of killers, outthinking and outsmarting them all, if only by a hair's breadth. In flashes of the past, reliving the few decent friendships he has known, Sallis has written a fascinating character, one of the unseen, navigating a world filled with pitfalls.<br /><br />Drive has the emotional black and white clarity of human behavior, the essential impulse to survive without nuance; as Driver's soul is compromised by his decision to tread a darker path, he is drawn into a morass of moral ambiguity, inextricably linked to the violence of the subculture. But then Driver's life has been defined by violence and he has built his days around a deep understanding of how little the world offers and how much he must take for himself. Drawn to the raw energy and thrill of skillful driving, Driver is seduced by the rush, the danger.<br /><br />As sparse and clean as any noir thriller, Drive is a tale of shadows, those that lurk in the psyche and those that fill the darkened streets with menace. Driver treads where few dare, oblivious in his singleness of purpose, life lessons quickly taken to heart. Yet Sallis fills this world with a stark poetry, slashes of reality and the moral dilemma of those with no prospects and nothing to lose, trapped in the hungry maw of a soulless city: \\"The sun let go its hold and the city's lights, a hundred-thousand impatient understudies, stepped in.\\" This is a world that exists below the sightline, the inhabitants of a decaying society playing out life and death dramas without second chances. Driver is the lost boy, fighting his way through the world he inhabits.

B000000IS2|5.0|This is ostensibly the soundtrack to the documentary [[ASIN:B000QUUD60 Elvis - That's the Way It Is]].  The film offered a look at Elvis' concert series in Las Vegas in August of 1970.  But only 4 of the 12 songs on the album are actual live recordings from that concert series(\\"I Just Can't Help Believin'\\", \\"Patch It Up\\", \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\" and \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\\").  The rest of the songs are studio recordings from June, 1970.  \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" has applause at the end, but it's a studio recording with the applause overdubbed later.  This is a graceful, well-crafted album, weaving together powerful cuts like \\"Just Pretend\\" and \\"Stranger in the Crowd\\", the delicate and contemporary arrangements of \\"The Next Step is Love\\" and \\"Mary in the Morning\\", and a strong version of B.J. Thomas' international hit \\"I Just Can't Help Believin'\\".  Elvis is at his best throughout this outstanding album.  My copy of the CD is 24kt gold plated, which is cool, but I don't know if it actually improves the sound.
B0002KQNZO|4.0|All the elements are here: The undeniable blue note sound, the terrific Art Blakey smashing drums and a fantastic trio like a dream team of a rythim section: Shorter/Hubbard/Fuller.<br /><br />\\"Free for all\\" shows a renewed fresh Messengers album with all the traditional elements of Blakey's hard bop, but forwarding upcoming free jazz tunes like others contemporanies. Ok, the title track is not exactly free when we use ithis term to describe other musicians like Cecil Taylor, Don Cherry, Sum Ra and the pioneer Ornette Coleman, but free for all is going in the same directions as John Coltrane tunes. No wonder this album was released in the same year \\"A Love supreme\\" was.<br /><br />However, we have three different directions on the album, something more free and modal in \\"Free for all\\",  the essential hard bop in \\"the core\\" and \\"hammer head\\" and the last track \\"pensativa\\" a hommage to bossa nova, that differ from the others quit a lot.<br /><br />The major point is really the incredible team Blakey came up with specially the 3 metal genious Shorter, Hubbard and Fuller as I said before.<br /><br />4.5 stars
0060922583|1.0|Amazon reports (8/27/06) that 282 of 288 persons found a review by  \\"Damian Nash, Durango, Colorado\\" to be useful. <br />The reviewer states: \\"I am also a scientist, and know that most of my highly rational, empirical colleages [...]\\" <br />A quick Google shows that reviewer to be a high school teacher. <br />This should give us pause when considering what '5-stars' mean given the current '5-star' glut in the reviews of \\"The Final Theory\\", to give only one of the egregious examples at Amazon. <br />It may be time to put an evaluation ( I suggest a 5-X scale) on reviewers.  That scale should be applied on a peer-review basis and not a popularity/incident/anecdote basis.  Reviewers who only submit '5-star' reviews would rate an automatic '5-X' until peer-evaluated.
B0009H1CKG|5.0|This may not appeal 100% to \\"old school P-Funk fans\\". Maybe the \\"raw\\" part is missing. But it is a very appealing concert, as most Montreux are. Great sound, P-Funk spirit is alive. Great performances, a great mixture of funk, rock, jazz, hip-hop, soul, you name it. <br /> <br />George Clinton's presence gives a special experience and energy to the show.  <br /> <br />I miss Bootsy Collins on this one but you won't be dissapointed. The repertoire is very good and there's a good variety of people and styles. A superb violinist (Lili Haydn) gives a brilliant solo, as well as  Bernie Worrell's keyboard solo. <br /> <br />A memorable version of Maggot Brain with violinist Lili Haydn and Michael Hampton on guitar is also available. <br /> <br />Over 2 hours with Funkadelic/Parliament stuff, with a good picture and great 5.1 sound. Highly recommendable. Now I will try to get the older concert from Mr. Clinton.
1400031524|4.0|Riga did indeed feel like that at that time. The author skillfully takes you back to that time and place. The mystery part is not the greatest, but the discription of the nature of the struggle between the good guys and the bad guys is very good. For the mystery I award three stars. I like the short and common Latvian names that Mr. Mankell choose, but the two dead Russians that drifted to Sweden should have more properly been given Latvianized russian names and not the very Latvian names Leja (valley) and Kalns (hill).  For mood, setting and background I award five stars. The average is four.

But the book doesn't deliver. <br />The stories are interesting in the sense you could use them as material for small talk. Yet, I finished the book with no idea of what was the point. And that's not good. The book goes on and on with examples and explanations but not once gives you an idea on how to improve your snap judgments. If you are looking for that kind of info don't buy this book. Maybe the author is planning to teach that in his next book? I'd never buy it *blink*

B000G8NY4U|5.0|My local PBS station aired the Yanni concert.  Yanni is in concert at the Mandelay Bay in Las Vegas.  The show was spectacular!  From the very first note, it drew me in and didn't let go until almost 90 minutes later.<br /><br />Yanni conducts an orchestra made up of masterful musicians from around the world.  The variety of styles, tastes, and backgrounds adds a spice to the music that just cannot be artificially created.  Take the Armenian violinist for example -- this man is the Monet of violinists.  The notes and melodies he crafted were nothing short of breathtaking.  When he is performing in a duet with a female Japanese violinist, it brought me out of my chair.  And she went toe-to-toe with him playing more notes faster and faster as the duet went on.  I thought they would collapse in exhaustion from playing so hard.  Meanwhile, she is smiling as she is playing!  That woman is amazing.  Seeing two extremely skilled violinists just pushing each other to perform better was exciting.<br /><br />The flutist from Sri Lanka, who makes his own flutes, was utterly amazing.  How he made such harmonious and delicious notes come from that tiny piece of wood, I will never now.  His enthusiasm for his music was expressed in his work.<br /><br />The harpist (right words) does a vocal piece that...wow.  Then later in the concert, he makes the harp practically dance.  The notes that came from that harp...wow.  He does motion where he runs his hands through all the strings on the harp -- it creates a unique and pleasing to the ear sound.<br /><br />The female vocalists had voices like angels that just floated through the arena.  Michele Amato was one of the vocalists and her voice just...it washed over me like a soft wave.<br /><br />Ramon, who played a horn (or trumpet, I don't know) added a Cuban or Carribean/Latin feel.<br /><br />There were two other people, whose names escape me -- One played what looked like a hand-crafted wood instrument with strings.  I had never seen such a thing before and couldn't believe the warm and soothing sounds that came from it.  There was also a violinist who does a little dance while playing.  The audience exploded in applause when he does the dance.<br /><br />The camera work in the concert includes 16 hi-def cameras that are crystal-clear on an HDTV.  The lighting is excellent, as usual, with a Yanni concert.  The director has cameramen stationed throughout the arena and sprinkled within the orchestra.  The shots of the audience as they go through a range of emotions -- excitement, sadness, reflection, warmth -- just add to the experience.  Seeing so many people be moved by Yanni's music...Wow.<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD for any Yanni fan.  As a bonus, after the concert, there was about 15 minutes of behinds the scenes footage.  It showed Yanni and the orchestra practicing as Yanni explains the diverse backgrounds in the orchestra and how they arrived here.ngs.

B0000025ZF|3.0|Having said goodbye to Pink Floyd with \\"The Final Cut,\\" Roger Waters kicked off his solo career with 1984's \\"The Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking,\\" a concept album about a sleeping man's journey through various dreams and nightmares (Roger also did \\"Music From The Body\\" back in 1970, but that was a collaboration with Ron Geesin). Like other reviewers have said before me, \\"Hitchhiking\\" is an album that I feel very two-sided about. On one hand, I appreciate Roger's ambitiousness with this work. It has it's powerful moments, and it also has two really great songs on it: the catchy title track, and the pounding rock of \\"Sexual Revolution.\\" But Waters' overabundance of lyrics---reportedly 370 lines worth---is just too much at times, and much of it is rambled or screamed. With all those words, rambling and screaming, the music is hardly given any room to breathe (even special guest star Eric Clapton isn't allowed any *great* guitar parts to play here). Still, you gotta admire Waters' bravery with \\"The Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking.\\" At the very least, it's an interesting album with an intriguing concept (and a nice cover, too---I gotta be honest!), but I think Roger could've made \\"Hitchhiking\\" a whole lot better with some much-needed musical and lyrical polishing. But being his very first solo album without Pink Floyd, perhaps Roger didn't want any additional help or advice in the composing department. Luckily for Waters, he would get right back on track with his next release, the excellent \\"Radio K.A.O.S.\\" As it stands, \\"The Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking\\" is a decent, acceptable Roger Waters album. You may not play it all that much, but it's still worth having.

B000GTLQXU|1.0|I saw this in the theater, and knew then it was bad, so you may be wondering why I bought the DVD. Good question.  It could be because the original from 1972 is my favorite movie of all time, and even caused me to travel cross country to attend the final fan club reunion in May '06. It could be to add to my collection of bad movies, where I can point it out to friends and say \\"can you believe I own this?\\" It could be because the disks will make great movie-themed coasters for my Oscar party. But, deep down, I think it's because of my love for the original. I tried so hard to like this movie, but everyone involved with the production, starting with the writer, didn't care about what they were doing, so how could we?  There are times when I still cry at Belle Rosen's death from '72. The only time I cried at \\"Poseidon\\" was when I left the theatre, and knew I could not get my money back. I got the SE's of both the original and the \\"reimagining\\" simply so I could say I gave this one a shot. If you love CGI, buy this, if you love good movies (not even great, just good) then save yourself from this waste of talent and time.
B00005Q3TZ|2.0|The post-Don Simpson decline of Jerry Bruckheimer reached what was, at the time, an all-time low with the release of \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  <br /> <br />There are very few movies that are just barely watchable, and one of them all but bankrupted the company that made it. No such luck here. Both Bruckheimer and Michael Bay should have been banished from Hollywood for this mess. Or, better yet, Bruckheimer should have conned Tony Scott into directing it, since he seems to be the only director he can get consistently good results out of. <br /> <br />In its favor, though, the lush Technicolor cinematography and ILM's frighteningly realistic visual effects almost draw attention away from the wooden acting and turgid love story. Too bad you have to sit through nearly an hour of said love story before you get to the movie's showpiece: the destruction of the Arizona. If you want something to show off your home theater setup, just cue this section up, and make sure you're playing back the DTS track. Oh, yes, and make sure you have enough to pay for any broken windows, cracked plaster and/or blown speakers that may result... <br /> <br />Maybe instead of releasing an extended version, they should have considered putting out a much shorter version. Like one that skips over everything before and after the attack.
B00005JO20|2.0|This is another garbage movie from Hollywood. Terribly boring,  violent and way too long.

0790729342|3.0|OK, now first off, I think this is a GREAT FILM! Don't get me wrong, if it wasn't for the audio, I'd probably give it Five Stars!  And if it were a review on the audio alone, I'd have to give it one star, maybe two, Max (Pun Intended?!?) <br /> <br />The audio levels are too high for the music and certain \\"effects\\" (explosions and car revs) as compared to the dialogue.  When you turn it down so the music is at a tolerable level, then you can't hear anyone saying anything!  And once you turn it up enough to hear the dialogue, WHAM! The music, or an expolosion is Exageratingly Loud! <br /> <br />I hate it when they say that this has been \\"Digitally Remastered\\" and yet the remastering sucks!  In this case, it's the sound.  I don't know if there's an older release, or maybe a new one in the future that fixes this. I purchased a brand new copy of the DVD in August of 2006, and the DVD case says Copyright 1997, so I guess in 1997 is when they transferred this, and haven't bothered with it since.  By the way, after a third or half of the movie, the levels seem to be a little more tolerable, but man, having to raise and lower the volume for the first 20 minutes or so is a drag! <br /> <br />Other than that, Vive le Max! <br /> <br />
B000F1IQN2|2.0|I cannot believe Steven Spielberg directed this movie. This time he blew it completely. The worst Spielberg's production yet; confusing, pointless, most of the time boring, except for those scenes where bombs go off or people are murdered. The plot is totally mixed-up and extremely violent. It's a spy vrs. spy kind-of-sickening-intrigue. Did it really happen? Maybe the movie is historically accurate, may be it isn't.  Be that as it may, it is still not worth watching.

This DVD is very bad for the reputation of the band, which has always been the leader in music technology. The cover of the DVD should mention \\"historical document with poor sound quality\\".

Not that this album is great, but at least it sounds like they made an attempt.  The same can not be said for their other albums.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with any Nickleback album other than this one.

B000069HKH|4.0|When I bought this CD, I had to wrestle with my sense that the sorrow of 9/11 ought not to be commercialized.  But then I listened to the songs.  I am not a Springsteen fan, but I wanted to thank him for this record.  This is a decent and appropriate response to the grief and tragedy of 9/11.  And I found a new appreciation for Springsteen as an artist in these songs.<br /><br />I attended a Springsteen concert at Giant Stadium, not far from my home, after this CD was issued.  On 9/11, people parked on the highway outside the stadium and watched the smoke from lower Manhattan as it drifted northward across the skyline.  But as Bruce sang these songs, the mindless mass of indifferent concert-goers tossed beach balls and drank beer.<br /><br />I tell the story because it points to something essential about this CD - that Springsteen here has achieved something fine with his art that most of his fans cannot appreciate.  It is that good.

But luckily for me, I have a strong liking for everything that is English (cinema, literature, theatre and music) and I am always deeply interested in what British TV can produce. I've seen the BBC Pride and Prejudice many times (I've also read the book) I like it -even though my preference goes to the new 2005 movie (sorry, can't help it)- and I am even familiar with Elizabeth Gaskell's work (I've read Mary Barton and I've started reading North&South). So, on reading the positive reviews on Amazon and on the BBC website, I decided to buy it, although I knew little about the whole story. My God, I never imagined that this BBC film could be so good! I can't even describe how I felt when I first watched the first episode except that I became completely hooked and I couldn't stop watching until I knew how it ended. And what an end!!! Now I can only say that it has even eclipsed the BBC P&P film in my heart. Everything is perfect, the cast and the acting, the setting, the photography, the dialogues, the music, the social background. The background definitely adds another interesting layer to the film because you can see both sides, the mill owners' and the workers' and you can see them at their work. All the characters are marvellous and so likeable. They really make a difference because they have a lot of depth and there is always a certain dignity about them.      We can thank Elizabeth Gaskell for creating such wonderful characters, yet they wouldn't make such an impression in the film if the actors weren't so great. They really got into their parts. Sinead Cusack is a magnificent Mrs Thornton, this iron lady who does her best to control her emotions but then you look through her eyes and realize that she is not as cold or hard as she seems, especially when you take full measureof the depth of her love for her son. What a fantastic mother she is! And what about Brandon Coyle/ Higgins, I mean, I've just talked about the dignity of the characters, here is a fine example, you just have to look at the face of this union leader to know that he is at heart a good man, even though he is a bit ruthless sometimes. Jo Joyner as John's sister is a delight, probably the only source of comic relief in the story. But the whole cast is great! And of course, the film wouldn't be so captivating if there wasn't Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage in the parts of Margaret and Mr Thornton. Mr Thornton, oh, God, What a man! I fell in love with this fascinating character. Of course, Richard Armitage is already so charismatic that you can't take your eyes off him. But the man is so dedicated to his work, -contrary to Darcy, he has known poverty and he has had to fight back-that you feel an admiration for him! Out of nothing but using his wits, he has been able to run a fine business and when we first meet him, he is a well-off and powerful mill owner. His position in society makes him arrogant and brutal, yet, he remains fair with his workers and, thanks to Margaret, he becomes more aware of the living conditions of the working class and even becomes a caring master. He has such a strength or resilience; yet, at the same time, his love for Margaret makes him vulnerable. Oh, the way he looks at her! (sigh)  It is incredible what the two actors can produce on screen. In the proposal scene, the interaction between them is so intense. There is so much passion on their faces and in the way they respond to each other that it is breathtaking. I was really shaking inside. -I always feel a bit frustrated by the BBC P&P, although the actors are excellent, because the film sticks too much to the book. And I wish that we could see more touching of hands or more signs of passion between Firth and Ehle.- Thankfully here, the film, North &South, is not completely faithfulto the book especially concerning the dialogues and so they have more impact in the film. The ending scene, in particular is so beautiful that it brings tears to my eyes. Is it due to R. Armitage's magnetism on screen or to the tenderness that is palpable between them when they talk or when they look at each other or to the way they touch each other's hands with the enchanting music behind? I can't tell. I don't think any words can really describe how I feel about this film so I will just stop there and let you enjoy the film for yourself. The DVD is also worth the money because it includes an interview with Armitage and commentaries.
B000B0QJM2|1.0|I was fooled. When I saw this title, I bought immediately. Especially, there is no hint in the outer covers of what to expect. You have to watch it ALL first to discover you ve been fooled. You don't even have the right to get angry on the band, there is a note that the movie is not authorized by Deep Purple.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|First, a recap - after the success of the 1978 Superman film, Warner Brothers was eager to bring another DC Comic book character to the big screen, so naturally, they turned their eyes to the only other DC character who could rival/match Superman for pop culture icon status, Batman (although Wonder Woman is in third place). For ten long, seemingly fruitless years, Warner Brothers and DC struggled to bring Batman to the big screen in hopes that the Dark Knight could have back-to-back success with his big brother the Man of Steel (at the same time, sadly, Superman's film franchise went into a slow, steady decline), with various writers, directors and actors coming, going, jumping on, jumping off, jumping back on, jumping back off again, etc. But then Tim Burton, then a new visionary talent on the rise, came along with just enough familiarity with Batman and just enough strength of will and vision to make it happen, and with the backing of the success of \\"Beetle-Juice\\", Warners Brothers were just crazy enough to let Tim have a go at it, even if it meant hiring the seemingly less than ideal but in the end very effective Michael Keaton to play the title character. Then in the summer of 1989, with Superman's never ending battle for truth, justice and the American way having died on the big screen, Batman stepped in to fill the void, and a phenomenon of epic proportions so rarely seen before or since was born. Then came 1992's \\"Batman Returns\\", which was also a mega-hit but inspired a backlash from parents who found the film to be too dark and mean-spirited for their kids (parents reportedly had to drag crying children out of the theater that summer). In response to this and speculation that Batman couldn't hold the fort, Burton was politely asked to step aside and his friend Joel Schumacher came on board with a new Batman, Val Kilmer, stepping in for an MIA Keaton, with the flashier, more light-hearted \\"Batman Forever\\", which was also a hit despite taking a great deal offlack over stuff like rubber nipples on the bat suit. But then everything came falling down with \\"Batman & Robin\\", which many complained was too campy while the 2nd film had been too dark, and which featured another new Batman, George Clooney, playing the Dark Knight as a light-hearted scamp (Kilmer at least tried to capture the essence of Batman) in a film that proved to be too much of everything - too garishly bright, too over the top in spectacle, too overly produced and over-exposed it forced the WB to give Batman a time out, leaving Joel Schumacher with a long and bitter battle on his hands as he fought to rebuild his reputation as an actually good director while Clooney went on to bigger, better things. <br /> <br />But Warner Brothers wasn't quite done with Batman just yet. After all, he's one of the great iconic comic book characters alongside the X-Men, Spider-Man and of course, big brother Superman. And once again the WB and DC struggled to get the movie Batman back on his feet, but it would require slimming/trimming/toning it down and going back to basics. Once again, writers, directors, and actors came and went in the seven years between now and then, but finally things came together with director Christopher Nolan, writer David S. Goyer and star Christian Bale. But how to make it fresh, appealing, new, not simply a rehash of the previous films but still undeniably Batman? By going back to the beginning, delving into what the earlier films only hinted at or lightly touched upon, so much so to the point that in the beginning it doesn't even feel like a Batman film. <br /> <br />The result is the familiar but well told origin story of how Bruce Wayne lost his wealthy and warm-hearted parents to a random mugger, Joe Chill, but still in connection with criminal kingpin Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). Years later the conflicted, spiritually lost adult Bruce (Bale), torn between a genuine desire for justice and his thirsting for revenge, embarks on a journey unto which he confronts his deepest fears, trains and hardens himself to his very limits and then, coming back to Gotham City to become symbolic avenger of injustice, the Batman, aided by loyal man-servant/surrogate father figure Alfred (well played by Michael Caine). Additionally, Batman must fight not only Falcone but the Scarecrow/Dr. Jon Crane (a lightweight Cillian Murphy), and Ra's Ah Guhl (played by Ken Watanabe and Liam Neeson, the latter in a rare villainous/anti-hero role that he plays very well), and he must reclaim his father's company from the unscrupulous Rutger Hauer with help from Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox, make an alliance with Gary Oldman's Sgt/Lt./eventually Commissioner Jim Gordon, and rescue his foxy/sexy childhood friend turned lawyer brunette Rachael Dawes (Katie Holmes at the beginning of the Tom Cruise fiasco). <br /> <br />Batman/Bruce Wayne is well played by Christian Bale. At times reusing his \\"American Psycho\\" performance, Bale hits a few flat notes but on the whole he's the best new Batman anyone could hope for: 6-feet tall, good looking, muscular, and actually possessing good solid acting ability, here's hoping they don't lose him.

0553212737|5.0|Siri Amster- Olszewski <br />                 August 24, 2006 <br /> <br /> Emma, by Jane Austen, was one of the most enjoyable books I have read recently. I chose to read Emma because, having read and loved Pride and Prejudice by the same author, I wanted to explore her other books as well.  The characters in Austen's stories are both intriguing and comical and her description of the era in which they take place creates a clear view of society in those times  <br /> I was enchanted with Emma because Austen beautifully blends together a simple story of a girl and a documentation of the societal behaviors of the time.  It provides insights into the life and social customs of a lady living in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  <br />One of the book's principle topics is marriage. The main character, Emma, approves of matchmaking for marriage and, through her, the reader gets a view into the different motives for marriage.  For some people, marriage was simply a way to advance in social status; for others, marriage was for love.  In Emma's time, marriages had to be matched according to social status.  One could not marry below their status.  Marrying too far above one's status could end up disastrously.  <br /> The book tells the story of Emma Woodhouse who is a pretty, wealthy, poised, and clever young woman. Her mother died when she was too young to remember or miss her and was raised mainly by her governess, Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor behaved like a best friend rather than a governess due to her mild temper and love for Emma. Therefore, Emma grew up without any firm rules or structure. This freedom caused her to think quite highly of herself and of her opinions. It was her excessive self-confidence that led her to often make mistakes creating misfortunes for others and embarrassment for herself.  <br />Jane Austen, by the style of her writing, creates some well-defined character while including other character that are left more open to the reader interpretations. For example, while Emma's faults are very apparent, I found her innocence to be charming and it created sympathy for her character. Other examples of characters like Emma are Jain Fairfax, Harriet Smith, and Mr. Elton. In contrast the character of Mr. Knightly, the family friend is set in stone. Within the first few pages of the book he is established as the moral role model of the story. Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. Weston, Mrs. Weston (the former Miss Taylor), Frank Churchill, and Miss Bates are all other characters that give off a particular feeling, the feeling that Austen intended. These characters all have good and bad qualities, all of which are left up to the interpretation of the reader. The novel is written in third person, however the detached narrator often sees through Emma's point of view. Having the effect of a not so neutral bystander.   <br />I highly recommend Emma to anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, witty book that captivates and enchants. While reading this book you will find yourself captivated in the pages of one of Jane Austen's masterpieces.
B0002S947K|5.0|Words cannot even describe how deeply I cherish this man's music. I will forever be grateful to Mr. LaMontagne for sharing his music with the world. \\"Burn\\" is the most heartbreaking song I've ever felt( yes you feel his songs ).

B000EMGAOY|4.0|Let me first say that this is another great album by RHCP. But wait, this is not a typical Chili Pepper album, this is a 28 track double disc. That being the case, it takes some time to delve into the album. Its almost overwhelming with so many tracks. Depending on how you look at it, thats either a good or a bad thing. I think its a good thing myself. There are so many tracks that there is really something for everyone on here. Do I like all 28 tracks? Honestly? No. But I do like quite a few of them, and a number of those are quite good. You have all sides of RHCP on Stadium Arcadium. So if you even have a passing interest in them, your bound to find something to appreciate on Stadium Arcadium.<br /><br />While it appears to be more mellow and soft, there is alot of funk and some of the best solos and riffs I've ever heard John Frusciante do. He is really becoming one of my favorite guitarists, and his work on this album is really something special imo.<br /><br />Jupiter: Alot of great tracks on this disc. Dani California is a great track, and a very strong single. Charlie is another great song with a funky intro and riff. Hump De Bump is great, She's only 18 for some reason is one of my favorite tracks, the chorus is very addicting. It was one of the first songs I really got into. Other highlights on this album are the songs Torture Me, Strip my Mind, Especially In Michigan and Warlocks.<br /><br />Mars: Strong disc, I usually lean towards this one a little more than Jupiter. Mars seems to be more upbeat and faster than Jupiter. One of my favorite tracks is Tell Me Baby, awesome song, and you certainly can't claim that this is soft. Pure funk. Hard to Concentrate is another awesome track with a great flow to it. Highlights include, 21st Century, Readymade, Made You Feel Better,  So Much I, Storm In A Teacup and Turn It Again.<br /><br />Overall, great album. Includes all the things you have come to appreciate from RHCP. It is a little more mellow and slower than older Chili Peppers material, but they are evolving and maturing. But they are still making great music, and thats the important thing. Definetly check it out.ower than older Chili Peppers material, but they are evolving and maturing.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I am sorry, but I really cannot recommend this movie for what it is supposed to be- And that is Jane Austin's Pride & Predjudice.  I am a fan of Austin and of the era.  I am more than willing to accept literary license, and even enjoy different versions of the same story, but it took me 4 tries to sit through this movie until the end.<br /><br />Kneira Knightly is a beautiful women, but she absolutely is NOT Elizabeth. The movie is ok, if you know nothing about Austin, the book, or how the wealthy of that era act and what they will accept. In this movie, Elizabeth is portrayed as a women who appears unkept, sloppy, drab and more than pleased with herself when she slights a wealthy member of society-which is pure hogwash for a woman of her time-no matter how intelligent or sassy she is. Besides, what would Mr Darcy even find to be attracted to, especially strongly enough to cause a minor scandal in marrying her -she looks like a shapeless frump. She has an unexplained smile/smirk on her face most of the time-which is destracting, since it doesn't belong there. I was so disappointed in this movie- and I only made myself finish watching it, because I paid money for it.<br /><br />Go ahead and buy it if, as I said, you have never read Austin or do not know much about history.  You will enjoy it for what it really is. A chic flick that takes place in the early 1800's.
B00023BLXA|5.0|Best movie I've ever seen!  It inspired me, made me want to get up and dance, and it was romantic!  Just the perfect movie in my opinion.  Between the music and the dancing, it's hard to explain, but this movie was to die for!!!!!!

B0000AQVCL|3.0|Jet is competent, but they are simply reprising the work of so many others before them.  They would be a very good group to encounter at some remote roadside biker bar -- the unexpected quality in dire surroundings would be a welcome surprise and compensate for the inevitable brawls and tawdriness.  But a disc on a major label? <br /> <br />Jet's album is called \\"Get Born\\" and they should heed their own title and sing like boys who were born much later than their music suggests.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Veronica Mars is one of the best shows on TV. I just got my 2nd season DVD a few days ago. While watching it I had some people who have never seen it and and both loved it, one who never watches any  TV. But this has changed their minds about nothing good ever being on TV. <br /> <br />This season starts with Veronica continuing to help classmates by solving their problems while also having a season long mystery or 2 to try and solve.

They along with the rest of the crew talk about the same subjects things they got, money and hoes. Man rap has gotten dipressing. The second problem I have is P's verse on Pearly Gates, I am religous and I think it's retarted to be talking down on anyones religion. I won't hold these against him because he just speakin his mind but it is still wrong to be talkin like that. 2/5 Only real good track is Put Em In They Place.

B000HC2LIK|4.0|I fully agree with the previous reviewers. I already have the original 1992 Director's Cut and have been waiting ages to upgrade it. However, now that the producers have finally settled their legal problems, we are being deluged with a surfeit of Blade Runner editions. This is the first and the least promising of three planned editions. The 1992 Director's Cut is a compromise cut. This barebones DVD is the same as the previous DVD except that it has been fully restored and given an anamorphic remastering.  <br /> <br />Following this edition, there will be another entitled, \\"Ridley Scott's Blade Runner: The Final Cut,\\" to be released in early 2007 to mark the 25th Annversary of the movie, which will include newly restored scenes and will be Scott's final word on the film. Then later in 2007, there will be the \\"Ultimate Blade Runner\\" which will contain all 4 versions of the film, the original U.S. theatrical cut, the expanded international theatrical cut, the 1992 Director's Cut and the 2007 Final Cut, all fully restored and in anamorphic transfers plus tonnes of extras. In addition, Blade Runner will also be released simultaneously on both Blu-ray and HD-DVD formats. <br /> <br />Buy this with your eyes open. It is recommended only if you're a completist or have only passing interest in the film. This edition will have a limited run of just 4 months before it is withdrawn prior to the arrival of the next edition.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|Mr. Clooney, while I love your movies and your politics, this movie was way too hard to follow.  It was interesting as well as depressing how the oil business is made but you lost me at the end.  Next time a little clearer please.

B0002YLC24|2.0|Since the credits indicate the screenplay was written by Delpy and Hawke along with Linklater, maybe it's too much to expect that self-absorbed actors would be able to accurately write about real and interesting people. While Delpy's Celine does have a few sparks of genuine insight (e.g. learning who you really are when you're not distracted by TV, shopping, etc.), Hawke's Jesse relies too much on cliches (e.g. marriage because of pregnancy eventually becomes bad marriage with little/no sex, etc.).  <br /> <br />Delpy at least appeared to try to play a flawed but genuine Celine whereas Hawke's Jesse was just too cool. He looked like he had ADHD and could barely wait for her to finish her lines, so he could throw out his single entendres. I agree with the other reviewer who thought the movie felt like a painfully long and awkward date. <br /> <br />What's so irritating about movies like this is how they try to make \\"real life\\" seem so meaningless while idealizing some unattainable fantasy--like somehow it's more romantic to experience a few hours of happiness with a complete stranger every 15-20 years while you marry and spend your life with someone you don't really love. UGGHHH!!!  <br /> <br />If you want to watch a movie about dysfunctional people, then rent/buy Mike Nichol's \\"Closer\\" where flawed but interesting characters are portrayed with sometimes painful realism. Closer doesn't try to romanticize the \\"love of your life\\" but rather show that what people expect from love may differ. Maybe Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke have never experienced real love, which is why they can't really write about it. <br />

0440238609|5.0|I found the first of Pullman's book, accidentally in Science Fiction, and got hooked.  Since then I've read the trilogy 4 times and bought it three times.  My first set I lent a friend; it disappeared; a second copy was not only read but read with curry sauce; and a third I bought just two weeks ago and gifted my daughter.  She read it, non-stop in three days and loved it. <br /> <br />Few books intrigued me or delighted me as much as Materials.  Pullman is a wonderful inventor of magical characters and creatures that become as human as the lead protaganist of the trilogy, Lyra, is mischieveous and endearing.  Science, nature, religion, culture and fiction are all drawn together in a web that makes each of the three books an unstoppable read.   <br /> <br />If I had to buy only one book, or in this case, trilogy, for an adolescent or adult, it would be \\"His Dark Materials.\\"    <br /> <br />This is an enduring story, one that not only makes one think, but makes one wonder about this world, and world's beyond.

Of course the science is spot on, since this is Carl Sagan. If we ever do hear from somebody not of this earth, this is how it'll happen. But that's a given. What's easy to forget is that Sagan gave us some very well-drawn characters from his world in an eminently readable style.

B000274THQ|5.0|Good Bye, Lenin! is a movie set in East Germany that starts in the late 70s.  We watch a family, in the opening credits, in which the father has escaped to the West, leaving behind his wife, and two kids.  Alex, the son, is the character who tells the story and we watch as the mother, broken and in pain from her husband dumping them, embraces socialism to the point where she is totally loyal to its ideals.<br /><br />  In 1989 she has a heart attack, falls into a coma, and misses the most important eight months in world history.  The fall of the Berlin wall, the collapse of communism, frankly everything she believes in dies a swift, total death.  Then she comes out of the coma and her son is warned by the doctor that ANY shock might bring another heart attack.  Any shock.  So her son has to make her think that NOTHING has changed.<br /><br />  The film is one of the funniest Non-English flicks I have EVER seen.  The son has to find food she likes (that no longer exists), has to set up the TV with a VCR so she only watches shows from before the collapse and even has to organize her birthday with people who know that they have to pretend that history hasn't passed her by.  Yet it has a serious underlining message about the importance of family that is touching (and sad at the same time) and I think a slight poke at materialism.

0143034901|5.0|Although I bought the book more than six months ago, like one of the reviewers above, I lost my way through the labyrinth but refound the path this week and reached its fully evolved conclusion.<br /><br />Not only did Carlos Ruiz Zafon write a literate, layered book, he provided resolution for the complex lives of his well articulated characters.  Often authors think the reader wants to spend hours or weeks pondering a cliff-hanging ending.  I am interested in both a good, or excellent read, and a sense of closure.  With characters as fascinating as Julian Carax, Daniel, Fermin and Nuria, I was delighted, more than pleased, to discover the paths they followed.  It endeared Zafon to me and elevated a good read to a better read.<br /><br />Could it have been shorter, yes.  Could it have been tighter, perhaps.  But should it be missed, no!
B000GTLQXU|1.0|It is difficult to believe that such copious amounts of money and state-of-the-art technology could produce a film even more boring and flatulent than the original.  Somehow Wolfgang Petersen has managed. This movie isn't just incompentently directed, poorly acted, and deadly dull.  It is badly written, stupid, and ridiculous.  Rent this CD, place it in your microwave, set the timer at 5 minutes, and get drunk in joyous celebration.  You will have rid the world of a minor evil and expunged 98 minutes of unmitigated crap.

B00004RD54|5.0|This sounds just as good today as it did in 1973. This was one of the first CD's I bought to replace my worn out LP. Definitely one of the all time greatest rock albums, not just live albums. With out a doubt, if Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner were not playing guitar on this one, it would be just another ho hum Lou Reed album. They raise it to the zenith with their blistering guitar work, both rhythm and leads. From Intro/Sweet Jane to the unreal guitar solo in Heroin that just keeps going, to the classic, Rock N' Roll, this whole CD it great, I would love to see it on DVD!

What makes this disk so enjoyable is the outstanding sound quality of DVD-A.  The performances were excellent, much of which may not have been quite so apparent until now.  I own ten DVD-A's and this disk is among the best of them in sound quality.<br /><br />If you like classic rock in general and Jackson Browne in particular, go ahead and buy this disk for your DVD-A player.  You will not be disappointed.
0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin's \\"Story of Ice and Fire\\" books are becoming legend among fantasy fiction lovers.  This book one \\"A Game of Thrones\\" ... introduces you to a truly ingeneous fictional feudal world of Lord's and Ladies as they really probably were (NASTY people)... of their \\"blooded\\" children and [...] children ... set in a world where summmers and winters last for a lifetime for many if not most.  This story is set in a time when summer is fading to winter.  The eternal struggle for the Lords is the control of the Iron Throne ... where the King of Kings resides.  The Lords are heads of \\"Families\\" who have been at war with one another throughout their known history. The holder of the Iron Throne rules all of the \\"Families\\", by majority rule, essentially. Ofcourse, if the King is murdered, entranced by a sorcerer, or co-opted by a rival family marrying their son to one of the Kings supporter's daughter ... thus stealing the King's support ... perhaps enough to challenge the King for the Throne.  Or, maybe the plot is to simply kill the King and all of his family at one fell swoop and sieze the Throne.  Can it be held against the revenge of King's supporters?  All of this and much more exist in this world, told from the viewpoints of many different Lords and \\"Family\\" members ... each chapter is headed by the name of the main character for the chapter... and the individual lives progress through the book in different chapters at different times in the story ... but beginning where the last chapter left off with that character ... WOW... I had to keep going back to remember where this particular character was going .... YOU CAN'T READ/LISTEN TO THESE STORIES WITHOUT BEING DRAWN IN ... SLOWLY AT FIRST ... WHICH MAKES THEM EVEN MORE ENJOYABLE.  I'm now listening to the second story ... \\"The Clash of Kings\\"... better because I already knew I was hooked on the stories...<br /><br />The hardest part of getting started in this book is trying to keep all of the family characters straight ... so you can understand the motivation behind their plots and schemes (plots within plots within plots... Incestious royal children acknowledged by the King as his children (wow) ... similar to understanding the early history of the Roman Empire actually ... as Machiavelli saw it in The Prince.  The ends justify the means.  If you enjoy the intregue of real history in a fantasy setting you'll love these stories.<br /><br />As for Roy Dotrice, the reader of the book I listened to, he grows on you as you progress.  Being a little snobish about my favorite readers, when I first began listening I wasn't drawn into the intricacy of the story because I wasn't drawn in by the reader.  When I finally started paying more attention to the story itself (because if you don't you will soon be lost) I found Dotrice's reading very well done, he has fairly good character recognition skills ... perhaps not the range of say Jim Dale or Simon Jones ... but well above average none the less...

0671434004|5.0|He became so famous as an astronomer that it's easy to forget he was one heck of a fine wordsmith as well. Yes he was. You've watched six shows, at most, on PBS. Sesame Street, Are You Being Served, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, Red Dwarf, and Cosmos with Carl Sagan. If you're brighter than me, throw in The McNeil-Lehrer Report or its sequel. But that's it.<br /><br />Why COSMOS? Well, if I type \\"billions and billions\\" in quotes, you hear his voice in your head. Yes you do. The man made astronomy interesting because he was a wordsmith.<br /><br />CONTACT is a novel by Carl Sagan. Copyright 1985, which works for me. I read it when it was new. Back in my security guard days, down in Tampa Florida. (Yo Bob!) I later saw the film, very well done, with Jodie Foster, but I can't remember it. One of the advantages of getting old.<br /><br />How does the book stand the test of time? So well that I'm gonna recommend you get it right now. Of course the science is spot on, since this is Carl Sagan. If we ever do hear from somebody not of this earth, this is how it'll happen. But that's a given. What's easy to forget is that Sagan gave us some very well-drawn characters from his world in an eminently readable style. And, as always, accessible science that makes you marvel at the possibilities. Keep in mind that I've probably never used the word \\"marvel\\" in a book or movie review before. I'm too old and jaded to marvel. But heck, I marveled.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, he had so much fun predicting the future. This far down the road, we can see where he misfired, which was almost never. We can enjoy how accurate he often was. This is where he let his subtle humor roam free, and we can love him for his wit. These are the traits I didn't catch 20 years ago, because I was looking for aliens. Which he also delivers, somewhat, but I don't even care at this point. I just know I love this book.

0671042858|4.0|HEARTS IN ATLANTIS by Stephen King<br /><br />THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON by Stephen King<br /><br />Two reviews in one? What up with that? Well, I read HEARTS IN ATLANTIS some time ago and, beyond \\"rah rah go read this,\\" I said it exposed my inadequacies as a reviewer. How stupid was that? I'm going to try again.<br /><br />I finished reading MY LIFE by Bill Clinton late one Tuesday afternoon, then immediately picked up THE MAN WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. I figured my old friend Stephen King could clear my exhausted mind. He immediately pulled me in, and I read it in a single sitting. It's gripping stuff. Incredibly realistic, insightful regarding human nature, and it'll scare your pants off. The Master is most definitely at the top of his game with this book. Ditto with ATLANTIS.<br /><br />Authors, how do you feel when you spend months (years?) writing a book only to have some reader say he polished it off in a single evening? Actually, I think you oughta feel good. No writer, not even Isaac Asimov, could/can be sufficiently prolific to be the only one a reader ever needs. I think this is very cool, and I love working with fellow authors to promote this thing we do.<br /><br />Okay, back to my book review. King was always great, right? But there came a point where a certain sameness crept in. It's hard to define, perhaps, but you know what I mean. I don't think he was having as much fun as he used to, and after a time, neither were we.<br /><br />Then came ON WRITING, which I never run out of breath raving about, and now books like these. He's scaling back the supernatural, which never bothered me at all, because he's found even scarier things to write about. The Master has raised his game, and it's a joy to know I've got a big old pile of unread Stephen King novels downstairs. Expect more rave reviews.<br /><br />Oh, and Stephen, if you're reading this, and you ever get the desire to raise your game yet again, just let me know. I'll go rent a truck and hit you with it. (It's a joke. Just like the idea that YOU subscribe to MY rag. I know you'd rather read DAVE'S RAG.)hit you with it. (It's a joke. Just like the idea that YOU subscribe to MY rag.

B0002XNT0I|4.0|How do you separate a socially important film from a great film? Sure this film tackled the AIDS/homosexuality issue head-on but that doesn't automatically make it a great film. I'm not knocking this film, of course not. But there's a lot of parts in it that I didn't like which maybe made it appear to be a lesser film than what it wants to be, it is or what everyone makes it out to be. <br /> <br />Andrew Beckett works for a prestigious law firm working on a big account. His health declines a little bit nothing overly serious until he's fired for apparently botching the case. Turns out not only is he a homosexual but he has AIDS so he figures that's why he was fired. He needs representation so he hires Joe Miller, a top and famous attorney who is, rather bluntly, very intolerant of gays. So they form an unlikely duo to battle a top firm while dealing with gay bashers to closet gays. <br /> <br />One small nitpick: it seemed like anyone that is in Andy's family or friends circle is against him. There was not a lot of normal everyman citizens who supported him. A similar problem in Brokeback Mountain where any scene with the 2 men was gorgeously shot while them with their wives looked rather bland and desolate looking, complete with sad looking wives. It's nothing that derails the film though. And I don't know why but I never liked Jonathan Demme's trademark of looking in the camera. It works for Silence of the Lambs but here it looks...weird, and maybe a bit too on the nose. <br /> <br />Now Tom Hanks did win the award for Best Actor but honestly it should've went to Denzel Washington who manages to be visibly struggling with his less-than-enthusiastic view on gays and the changing perspectives dealing with the case. Hanks, in a way, reminds me of Charlize Theron who put on ugly makeup for Monster. Losing a crapload of weight does not automatically give you an Oscar. No knock against Hanks but it seems funny it went to him instead of Washington. <br /> <br />Is it awatchable film? Of course, it's quite good and performances are excellent. I don't know whether you should blind buy it though, that's up to you.
0316776963|5.0|Another collection of essays from a brilliant wit who you know you love to read. It's like I've said in my reviews before. There's no need to review each book when I can just give the author a blanket endorsement and guarantee you'll love whatever you find by the guy. I love it when that happens. I may have annoyed Jan by laughing out loud too often. Sedaris is like that.

0804115613|5.0|First I saw the movie, then I read the book.  The book's even better, as books tend to be.  But if you don't mind, I'll just share my movie review:<br /><br />The copyright on this film is 1991. It is now 2005. Are Jan and I the last two people on the planet to see this film? I don't care. I'm reviewing it anyway.<br /><br />Students are regularly shocked to hear that I haven't been to the USA in 6 years. They assume I miss \\"my hometown.\\" I explain to them that I miss my father and his lovely wife, and once in a while my gorgeous little doggies, but not my hometown.<br /><br />But lemme tell you about Fried Green Tomatoes, which are delicious. This is the most accurate portrayal of Southern life I've ever seen. I don't say that lightly. I've seen many films and read many books which portray Southern life quite well. Author Fannie Flagg, who I'm old enough to remember from The Match Game, nailed it. She's more twisted than the other two Southern lady authors I adore, Harper Lee and Anne Tyler, and I like that in a person. Also, it would've been a crime if Fannie hadn't popped in for a cameo, so I'm happy she did.<br /><br />Fried Green Tomatoes is deceptively slow moving, as is Southern life. There's a whole lot of stuff in there, however, all of which is quite accurate. The good and the bad. Many parts of it will have you cracking up with laughter, but it's not always a happy-happy load of hooey. Our deep dark secrets are also in there. Subtly. I do appreciate subtlety. I don't see it enough.<br /><br />I could give you a list of all the things I loved about this film. It'd be so long you wouldn't read it. So lemme just say I'll watch it again -- I don't know how many times -- and that I may very well buy the novel. I get a strong sense that the film is quite true to the novel, but I like to see these things for myself. I betcha Fannie's got a way with words. If you haven't watched this film, get it. You'll love it.

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|An alternate title could be \\"Ray sells out,\\" and the only reason it won all those Grammys is because he died. It has some great songs. It has others with sappy arrangements from the Burt Bacharach/Richard Carpenter school of blandness. It's just too uneven to win anything solely on its merits. None of Ray's writing, and none of what I would call his signature tracks. But maybe he was old enough to get tired of playing the same damn songs all the time. Ray lost some of his edginess, but he could still play a mean piano, and of the 13 singers on this CD, he has the most soulful voice. Some great music on this CD, and I'm glad I own it. You got the right thing, uh huh.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Carrie has everything you could possibly want in a horror film.  Good characters, a good plot, good acting, and some very unsettling violence to top everything off.  Anyone who knows horror knows the ending of Carrie, but unless you have seen it for yourself (in the context of viewing the whole film) you will never know the intensity, brutality, and shock value of the prom sequence.  Brian De Palma put his name on the map with this movie, and rightfully so.<br /><br />Most know the basic plot of Carrie:  troubled teen is made fun of at school, abused physically and mentally at home by a psychotically religious mother, and the trouble teen just happens to be able to practice telekinesis.  Not a good combination.  The film moves along at an awesome pace, as De Palma lets the viewer get sucked in almost the exact way that Carrie is getting sucked in, just to have it all come crashing down in the gut-wrenching finale.<br /><br />This film belongs on the top of most horror aficionado's all-time best list, and it is definitely one of Brian De Palma's best films.
0380713802|4.0|You must know by now that I never write a bad review about this guy. In this book, we take a whirlwind tour of Europe. You can read the cover blurbs about how funny and perceptive he is, and how skillful he is with the language, and how eminently readable he is. I agree with every word. But I'd like to mention that this isn't some snooty tour guide or gushing forth bubblehead. He's an average guy who won't hesitate to tell you what sucks, or leave a place that he doesn't like, or bend over backwards to say nice things. He'll bash anybody, himself included. He's refreshingly honest.<br /><br />Plus, if you had it in your head that Europe was just one homogenous place, or if perhaps you've heard a whole bunch of national or cities names and characteristics and can't keep them all straight, this book will fix that right up. In addition, if you're overseas but in a country nowhere near Europe, perhaps some place in Asia, you can still enjoy some very familiar situations. In case you haven't guessed, I highly recommend this book.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV , this is it, the most demanding compilation to cover - what more can I say, these guys were at the very TOP of their careeer physically and mentally with this release, it not only is musically and technically great, but also a lyrical masterpiece that will last for decades, if not for only \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" for which DJ's will be keeping alive into the next century, guaranteed. Every time I cover it, it fills me with such emotion, it brings me back to the early 70's when I was experiencing it for the first time. <br />It's a great piece, my recomendation is to purchase it and play it loud, if possible by pressed vinyl via a high power tube amplifier to some very large wattage speakers.If that don't get you excited, nothing will;. <br />Too bad masters like John Bonham and Keith Moon are no longer with us. <br />My personal favourite is \\"When the Levee Breaks\\", with its  underscore and harmoica. <br /> <br />

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I Have really enjoyed watching the Pulse DVD. It was an excellent concert, and I like Pink Floyd's music.Watching this DVD have been an exiting experience.
B0000DERM4|5.0|I was about 16 years old when I owned THE WALL plus every single studio album that preceded it. I was a snob, however, and didn't truck with live albums. Furthermore, I was a Pink Floyd snob because I was a lyric snob. To me, everything before DARK SIDE OF THE MOON was something to be forgiven. Later, I'd allow UMMAGUMMA into the fold because the music spoke to me of things lyrics cannot, but otherwise I spent many years as a big old nasty Pink Floyd snob.<br /><br />I popped into a DVD store this week and was disappointed by the selection. In music, however, was LIVE AT POMPEII. The famous one, right? I bought it. Tracks from Echoes, Meddle, A Saucerful of Secrets, Ummagumma, Dark Side of the Moon... We're talking oldies here. We're talking Syd Barrett's influence, although he was in the nuthouse when this was made.<br /><br />The music is simply amazing. It moves me, it talks to me, it demands that I quit working to actually pay attention. I meant for it to be background, but it intruded. I thought I was buying the CD, but I actually bought the VCD, so I had a chance to see the guys at the ruins.<br /><br />These guys obviously have the skills to do anything they want, without thinking about it, and can therefore concentrate on what they want to say.<br /><br />Roger in the studio composing \\"On The Run.\\" David shirtless, or cradling the guitar in his lap and doing weird beautiful sh-t. Nick looking like he's about to pass out from exhaustion after every thundering flawless drum combo but driving himself relentlessly. Rick looking like Jesus when he's hairy-faced and like an imp when he's clean-shaven. Keyboard mastery. Roger beating the crap out of the cymbals and gong. Roger screaming like a nut in \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene.\\" In short, Roger having a whole lot more fun than he did moaning \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\" at the end of first LP of THE WALL.<br /><br />I'll tell you what I think. When I left the US, Pink Floyd had gotten back together after a nasty feud, and made some really awful music. They need to watch this VCD, together, right now. This is what creation is all about.

0792833201|4.0|To answer another reviewer's question, yes, this is a PG movie, althought it would probably be PG-13 if that rating had existed at the time. I remember watching it first in theaters, then on VHS. I never have seen R-rated movies, because I happen to think that you can experience fright without gore, romance without nudity, grittiness without 4-letter words. Just consider Alfred Hitchcock's classics, like the original Psycho, to see that it's suspense and the threat of doom that really count, not spattering blood and severed body parts. To answer another reviewer who said this film isn't for true horror film buffs, perhaps he's right. The reason this film was so popular is that it plays well on common fears, rather than simply showcase mayhem. The ending of the movie, where the family battles the demonic forces holding their daughter captive, is a bit over-the-top, but overall this is a good thrill ride that's also tasteful. I can't speak to the relative merits (or lack thereof) of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre--not my kind of movie.
0316779237|3.0|Another collection of essays from a brilliant wit who you know you love to read. It's like I've said in my reviews before. There's no need to review each book when I can just give the author a blanket endorsement and guarantee you'll love whatever you find by the guy. I love it when that happens. I may have annoyed Jan by laughing out loud too often. Sedaris is like that.
0452270073|4.0|Pat Barker's Regeneration is a well-written novel.  Barker makes it clear that many soldiers readily volunteered for the war, thinking it would be the great adventure they dreamed of as boys.  Instead of the \\"manly\\" adventure they were expecting, the disillusioned soldiers encountered something with \\"feminine passivity\\".  With the absence of true heroism and false tales of \\"sweet\\" death, Barker brings realism into the novel and deromanticizes the war.   <br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed the intersecting plot lines.  I noticed that the novel is divided into four main parts, each section ending with a different opinion or mood than the previous.  Within each chapter in the novel, scenes constantly switch.  In Chapter 17, the scene changes four times: Sarah and her mother, Ada in a café, Sassoon and Graves at a bar, Sarah and her friends working in the munitions factory, and finally Sassoon and Rivers present their different views on friendship and love between men.  With this technique, Barker brings up the conflicts surrounding gender issues with such intricate plots and complex characters. <br /> <br />One of the most memorable sections of this novel is when Rivers compares himself to Dr. Yealland and conveys a sense of guilt.  He realizes both he and Yealland are turning scarred young men back into soldiers when they no longer want to be soldiers.  Both doctors silence their patients in different ways, one cruel and the other more gentle.  Ironically, Yealland's horrific treatments often only worsen the patients though the treatments are meant to heal them.  On the other hand, Rivers emasculates various soldiers with his humane treatments.  Rivers often encourages his patients to spend time remembering wartime events.  In his sessions with his patients, Rivers often talks about the emotions and feelings of the patient, something females are more likely to do.  Rivers also feels somewhat guilty for the effect of this strong influence over Sassoon.  He feels thathe had a part in convincing Sassoon to go back to the war.  As Rivers sees Sassoon leaving Craiglockhart War Hospital, he knew that Sassoon was \\"going back with the intention of being killed\\" to further his own protests about the aimless nature of the war.  With all these guilty feelings culminating, Rivers experiences his traditional values and modern reality clash uneasily.  This experience questions his existing values and develops his conscience as a human being. <br />
086140324X|5.0|I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.<br /><br />A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!<br /><br />Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.<br /><br />Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.<br /><br />I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"<br /><br />I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it.d I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British.

B000HT386M|5.0|If you do not know who Adam Sandler is yet, then let me say \\"Wake up!\\" This is by far his best film yet, to go along with \\"Big Daddy,\\" \\"The Waterboy,\\" \\"Anger Management,\\" and \\"Happy Gilmore.\\" Oh, I was laughing so hard when I saw this in the big house. Not only is Adam Sandler great, but so is Christopher Walkin, who plays the guy who gives Adam Sandler this remote. Alright, let me brief you about this Blockbuster flick. <br /> <br />A guy who is down on his luck go to \\"Bed, Bath, and Beyond.\\" There he goes to the way beyond section of the store, where he meets the creator of the universal remote control (played by Christopher Walkin) that is a remote control not just for electronics, but for everyday life. With this remote, one could mute sound entirely, skip a part of life (such as, let's say you are in high school. Every time it was test time, the remote would skip it for you. How it skipped it, I am not saying). All in all, it is about one lucky dude who found a very powerful remote (he got it for FREE).  <br /> <br />So, get this film. You will not be disappointed, that is if you like Adam Sandler or if you just plain like comedy for comedy's sake. Hope I helped get you to laugh, because I sure did, as did the entire auditorium of the movie theatre I was at that day. Oh, and if you like this movie, check out \\"RV\\" with Robin Williams. Have fun and be ready to laugh out loud!
B000002LTV|5.0|Let's go way back in time, mid-eighties, pre-Internet, when I was hanging out on the local electronic BBSes. I met a jazz musician, Earl Rutledge, who loaned me his entire collection and turned me onto fusion jazz. Bob James, keyboard man, was awesome. You may know him because he wrote Angie, which is the theme song to the TV show Taxi. Earl Klugh, on bass, was a pretty good solo artist as well, but I don't know him so well. After nine albums and a live package of greatest hits, Bob James retired. Later on, he returned. However, he came back lazy. Then I left Florida in favor of North Carolina and lost touch with the jazz scene.<br /><br />2006. I was in a DVD store in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. I saw a large and wondrous collections of DVDs, but I already owned every damn thing they had. On my way out the door, however, I saw COOL.<br /><br />And so it is. This is Bob James at his finest, and Earl Klugh at his finest, and everybody else just doing what they do. If I lived in a Western country right now, and if money was no object, I'd probably read a bunch of reviews about the music of Bob James over the past 10 or so years and believe them. He's one of the greats.<br /><br />The first time I played this CD, in case you're wondering, Picasso crawled out from beneath the miao fabric which covers the big beanbag to listen. When the CD ended, she told me to play it again. I did. And I'm playing it again, right now. Yeah. She's listening, too, and it's cool if I get stupid and play keyboard on her head. We're a coupla hep jazz cats.<br /><br />In other words, Bob is back. I am happy. Life is good.
B00005JOYM|4.0|Compared to the visceral power of the documentary-like \\"United 93\\", maverick filmmaker Oliver Stone atypically goes a more traditional route in focusing his 2006 film on the two police officers who were able to survive the collapse of the World Trade Center at Ground Zero. Instead of going for an emotional gut-punch on a broad canvas, the controversial filmmaker plays it safe by depoliticizing the film from possible conspiracy theories and emphasizing far more on the personal impact. The result still works powerfully, but the movie sometimes feels myopic in making the rest of the day's tragedies a mere backdrop for the central story. Moreover, screenwriter Andrea Berloff, working from the remembrances of the real people, brings a certain TV-movie-level predictability to the narrow focus of the plot despite the devastating power of key scenes.<br /><br />The movie takes advantage of the audience's knowing anticipation of the events at the beginning, but Stone blessedly doesn't exploit the tragedies more than necessary. While he incorporates global reaction to the events, the story quickly hones in on John McLoughlin, who leads a volunteer brigade of four Port Authority officers to the site. In the midst of their evacuation efforts, they find themselves buried in the rubble with McLoughlin and Will Jimeno the only two who survive under several feet of debris. The film then alternates between the dark desperation of the two immobilized men and the agonizing waiting game experienced by their families. There is no getting around the harrowing personal drama unfolding, and Stone is careful not to step out of bounds when it comes to the heroism displayed that day by all the real-life characters shown.<br /><br />The acting is quite sturdy and well-grounded. After a long drought since \\"Adaptation\\", Nicolas Cage plays the taciturn McLoughlin economically, while Michael Pe&ntilde;a, who provided the most riveting moments in the otherwise manipulative \\"Crash\\" last year, brings an honest combination of ebullience and poignancy to Jimeno. Even though the wives are decidedly secondary roles here, Maria Bello continues to gain stature in her gritty portrayal of McLoughlin's wife Donna, while Maggie Gyllenhaal plays closer to the vest as Jimeno's pregnant wife Allison. As the rescuers, Michael Shannon plays former Marine Dave Karnes with steely, singular resolve, and Stephen Dorff and Frank Whaley make vivid impressions as fireman Scott Strauss and reactivated paramedic Chuck Serieka, respectively. Seamus McGarvey contributed the evocative cinematography, and Jan Roelfs' production design is piercingly accurate to our collective memories of how Ground Zero looked on that fateful day. It's a fine, moving drama in many ways but in certain respects, too safe in Stone's hands.of ebullience and poignancy to Jimeno.

B000059GHR|3.0|The Beatles made several hundred songs. Some you love. Some you don't. You know which are which. So swing on by a music store or a website and see what's on this CD. And, since you've heard every single one of these songs before, and you know what you do and don't own, you know if you want this or not. For me to actually \\"review\\" this 1/ONE/one would be a big waste of time. I bought it because I was Beatle-less. Damn nasty of Paul and Yoko to include only one song written by George, and to make it one I don't like. No Taxman, no Here Comes The Sun...<br /><br />{\\"She loves you, yes yes yes.\\" That was suggested by the father of one of the Four. Paul, I think. An English teacher, at any rate.

B000FVQM2Y|3.0|It's quite a precocious move to use 1940's-style film noir narrative techniques and place them in a contemporary high school setting, but first-time writer/director Rian Johnson, apparently inspired by the works of Dashiell Hammett, does an intriguing though overly convoluted job here as he focuses his labyrinth plot on Brendan, a teenager searching for his ex-girlfriend Emily only to find her murdered. The rhythm of Johnson's dialogue is peppered with an often inscrutable combination of presumably current teen slang and period noirish-type barbs. The result can sound like hipster's gibberish, and this is where the DVD's English for the Hard of Hearing subtitle feature becomes useful in catching everything being said and getting a chance to understand what the characters are exactly saying.<br /><br />The movie's timeline jumps back and forth from the moment Brendan discovers Emily's dead body at the entrance of a concrete waterway tunnel. His murky investigation has him dealing with a gallery of fellow teens who play out their high-school stereotypes. There's nerdy Brain, a social outcast devoted to Brendan; drama queen Kara, who easily manipulates guys to meet her needs; spaced-out punker Dode, with whom Emily becomes attached after Brendan; a thuggish bully named Tugger; and even a doe-eyed femme fatale named Laura, who may or may not be on Brendan's aide.<br /><br />The most interesting character is the Pin, a dead-eyed drug dealer with an Everett Sloane-type limp. A long way from his little Amish boy in \\"Witness\\", Lukas Haas plays the Pin with a curiously unnerving ambiguity. By now settled with his indie cred thanks to \\"Mysterious Skin\\" and \\"Latter Days\\", Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Brendan with a closed-off world-weariness suitable for his adolescent Bogie-style character. Meagan Good also makes quite an impression as Kara whether looking like a Cabaret-style Liza or sporting full kabuki makeup. In fact, I wish she switched roles with Nora Zehetner, who plays the pivotal role of Laura with an unfortunately whispery uncertainty. However, it's fun to see 1970's blaxploitation icon Richard Roundtree (\\"Shaft\\") play the put-upon vice principal with such unforced authority.<br /><br />Instead of going for the obvious black-and-white look of classic noir, Johnson has Steve Yedlin's clean, off-kilter cinematography, a major plus in adding to the moody atmosphere. The plot twists can be clever but without true emotional resonance, and the various elements have not been connected in the most dramatically effective manner. The result is a film that becomes as frustrating as it is creative. The DVD contains a feature-length commentary track from an especially lively Johnson and various crew and cast members, eight deleted and extended scenes interspersed with production stills and Johnson's introductions, and dispensable audition tapes for Zehetner and Noah Segan, who plays Dode.ays the pivotal role of Laura with an unfortunately whispery uncertainty.

B0000YB7Z8|5.0|I am not a big fan of live albums. Often the songs are poorly recorded live versions of what is already available on studio albums. Even when the music is recorded well, why have a live version when the studio version is better? However, there are a few live albums that present recordings better than those from a studio, or show a different side to a performer or group than the studio albums. This recording falls into the second category.<br /><br />Jethro Tull has presented many stylistic faces during their lengthy career. There has been blues/English folk music, jazz-flavored music, and the rock that has gotten Tull classified as a hard rock group. The wonderful feature of this recording is that Martin Barre's lead guitar put a harder edge on many of these songs, making them sound harder than the original studio recordings. Often there are extra riffs that flavor more staid recordings; other times there are extended instrumental portions where the lead guitar screams hard rock. As an example, while \\"Locomotive Breath\\" was never a pop song, the enhanced guitar work and extended intro change the character of this song significantly from the studio version. This version is better.<br /><br />A classic already considered hard rock, \\"Aqualung,\\" clocks in at over eight minutes, adding substantial length to the original. Much of that additional length is in an extended bridge and a lengthened ending that features pounding piano, drums and guitar. It is songs such as these that threw Jethro Tull into the hard rock/metal category, though Jethro Tull has a range far beyond this category.<br /><br />This remaster of the 1978 release is a very good cross-section of Tull's first ten years, better than the numerous compilations that are purported to be \\"best of\\" or \\"greatest\\" hits.  This remaster improves significantly on previous releases of \\"Bursting Out.\\"  Not only are all the songs from the original vinyl release available, but the first disk is introduced by Claude Nobs and the second disk is introduced by Ian Anderson.<br /><br />Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson continue to fill concert halls more than 35 years after the creation of Jethro Tull; an incredible testimony to the musical power of Ian Anderson and a group that has become nearly timeless. This album celebrates that group near the peak of their popularity and creativity; a worthy addition to any collection of classic rock and worthy of a 5-star rating.the second disk is introduced by Ian Anderson. <br /> <br />Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson continue to fill concert halls more than 35 years after the creation of Jethro Tull; an incredible testimony to the musical power of Ian Anderson and a group that has become nearly timeless.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I'm not going to go too much into the plot or characters here other than to comment on writer/director Rian Johnson's sincere love for the art of Hammett/Chandler-esque dialogue and direction that evokes the heyday of noir rather than the cookie-cutter flashy trash that most young directors seem to grasp hold of, is truly refreshing and amazing to behold. The plot itself is a bit of Hammett's \\"Red Harvest\\" (possibly his greatest work) and Chandler's \\"The Big Sleep\\". It's tense, a little convoluted, but breathtaking to behold. The performances are all spot-on and the juxtaposition of the 30's/40's era dialogue set in a comtemporary high school never seems silly. You know that this is not \\"our\\" universe as much as it is a universe of noir and pulp-isms. And being aware, you're already in on it and you take the ride and enjoy every minute of it.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Spielberg's latest MASTERPIECE proves once again why he's one of my favorite directors. It clocks in at over 2 and half hours. It's an objective, methodical look into the mechanics of assassination and it's effects on the pysches or souls of the patriotic. It is a brutal thriller, but an intelligent one that may wear down those viewers with less patience.<br /><br />11 Israeli athletes are murdered at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich Germany by a terrorist group calling itself Black September. 5 Israeli men are quickly assembled, their identities erased by the Israeli intelligence agency MOSSAD, and sent on a mission to assassinate those responsible. (Even though the events from the book were relayed to the author by the team leader Avner, played by Eric Bana, the rest of the film is considered by most to be fiction. Including MOSSAD. This has spawned almost as much controversy as Oliver Stone's JFK.) Information on the whereabouts of the Palestinian leaders of Black September is gathered from a shadowy French family with no ties to any political doctrine or government. \\"We don't work for governments.\\" (I expect this a lie. What other form of information gathering is there, except cladestine information gathering for governments? Or corporations? And anyone in the intelligence business knows that corporations are governments. A possible hole in Avner's story? Maybe he's covering up methodology in his story and protecting informants. It's not possible to trust everthing you read from an ex-spook. Everything depends on their motives and loyalties. These guys spew a lot of disinformation. From what I've gathered from my reading about cladestine Black Ops, the informants were most likely Arab, the information would have come from multiple contacts, and would probably have been passed over through the Agency. But, deep cover also means adapting your own informants with very little agency contact. I must assume the French informants could be real and that they are lying.) Be that as it may, the Israeli assassins pay extravagant sums of money for this information and their identities as Israeli agents are unknown to their informants. Soon the men are taken through European locales such as Italy, France, and Greece to eliminate those responsible for Munich, with the use of guns and explosives. Eventually, with a fullscale raid on a terrorist compound in Beirut. The assassinated terrorist leaders for Black September, who are under the auspices of the KGB and may or may not be under the auspices of the CIA, are quickly being replaced and the political affiliations of the Israeli agents are eventually brought to light. The Israeli agents then discover that information about them is also being given to the other side. And it may or may not be coming from the shadowy French. A very real scenario in the shadow world. Soon, paranoia sets in and no one is who they seem. And people are dying on both sides. Violence and retribution beget violence and retribution. A neverending cycle. During all of this the characters are forced to question the very nature of their own souls. This film poses the question, \\"Is revenge a worthy act if you are a civilized people and you have been attacked?\\" But being true to it's objectivity, it never answers that question. Our emotional ties to our identities are what doom us as a species. This is my own observation, not Speilberg's.<br /><br />Superb acting(along with English, you'll hear German, Italian, French, and Arabic being spoken), exotic European locales, objective portrayals of both sides of the conflict(can anyone really sympathize with terrorists? Here, we understand their frustration, but never their actions), an intriguing and timely story, suspenseful music, brutal realism, and great cinematography make this a MASTERPIECE of the genre and one of the BEST films of 2005 along with being one of the most IMPORTANT films ever made. It's surely one of the BEST in Spielberg's amazing library of films.<br /><br />AN INSTANT CLASSIC!! AND A MUST SEE FILM!!IC!! AND A MUST SEE FILM!!
1594200823|5.0|It is a cliche to say that a book will change you forever. But no matter how it sounds, it can be truly applied to this book. Take out air and water and food is the next important thing that concerns us all. But as the author writes in the book 'we spend a lot of time looking for a good auto-mechanic but somehow seem non-chalant about where our food comes from'.    The overwhelming message from the book is the call for transperancy because abuses have crept into the mechanized process of food production only because of the disconnect we have with what we eat. If we notice what really goes on with the corn that is planted or with the animal that is slaughtered, we are more likely to prevent the degradation associated with the process. Given the size of the population that needs to be fed, having a Jo Salatin for all of us is an unattainable utopia but what we can definitely do is take a more active role in procuring our food. The first step is being informed and 'Omnivore's dilemma' is an excellent introduction.    As some other reviewers remarked, the last 2/3 chapters about hunting/gathering can be trimmed as the author indulges himself here. But that is a trivial matter given the quality (and the importance) of the material elsewhere. Please read this book and recommend it to others at your next party conversation. I also hope some chapters of 'Omnivore's dilemma' will be taught in schools. As for me, make another tick Mr Pollan, you have another convert.

B00001IVOF|3.0|I would say this cd deserves 3.5 stars.  I wouldn't even feel too bad about giving it 4.  But it got 3 because it really dissapointed me.  I thought it would be a lot better than it is.  I would agree with some of the other reviews that said that it covers the same overplayed topics as many other rap cd's: guns, women, crime, etc.  There is definitely nothing groundbreaking about this cd.   <br /> <br />At least tupac had a wider variety of song topics and incorporated different themes on songs such as Blasphemy, Hail Mary, Death Around the Corner.  One could relate more to Tupac's albums because he often shares his internal struggles to do something with his life.

B000068QVN|4.0|By 1971, Grand Funk Railroad already had five LP's under their belts.  In retrospect, it turns out to be the ideal point in time for compiling a live GFR album. 'Footstompin Music', which would emerge as a #29 hit several months after the music from this disc was recorded, was being previewed on the tour.  While the liner notes quote lead vocalist and guitarist Mark Farner claiming, in 2002, \\"The song stays the same\\", none of these songs will ever again be played with the verve, sincerity, and energy they possessed as newborns in 1971.  And to give you some idea of where the band was at in that epochal year, four of them are from an appearance at Shea Stadium (with Peter Frampton, Steve Marriot, and their Humble Pie co-horts doing the opening honors), and five from the Funk's backyard of Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan.  As such, we're spared some of the band's more commercial numbers ('Some Kind of Wonderful', 'Walk Like a Man' and 'Loco Motion', which charted well in 1973 and 1974), and indulged in their primitive hard-rock beginnings.  The only loss would seem to be a rendition of the band's only #1 national hit, 'We're An American Band', which premiered in 1973. <br /> <br />'Live - The 1971 Tour' presents a wicked cross-section of sonic obliteration that was Grand Funk Railroad's forte.  Even songs such as 'I'm Your Captain/Closer To Home' (a #22 hit in 1970) and their cover of The Rolling Stones' 'Gimme Shelter', which feature some more subtle moments in their studio incarnations, are given heavy-handed treatments here.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, and indeed in a place like Shea Stadium it may be a necessity, but by the time 'T.N.U.C.' (with it's laborious Don Brewer drum solo) and the cover of The Animals 'Inside Looking Out' roll around, you may find yourself signaling Shea's umpire for a time out.  Even the catchy chorus of the encore, 'Into the Sun' can't temper the mega-decibel onslaught. <br /> <br />Nearly every number on the disc features someappealing aspect, defeating the notion that GFR lacked diversity.  'Paranoid' opens with a dark, forboding texture, and plies us with a wicked wah-pedal lead from Farner.  'Hooked On Love' is actually a suite containing three distinct segments, a mid-tempo jaunt serving as the intro, a barreling up-tempo bridge, and the nearly falsetto \\"hooked on love!\\" vocal coda.  'T.N.U.C.' (a mysterious acronym to this day) is a take-no-prisoners rockfest, featuring testosterone-laden lyrics such as, \\"I know what you're tryin' to do... ain't gonna happen...\\".  'Get It Together' is mostly instrumental excepting the engaging \\"got to get it together\\" mantra as the coda.  The opener, 'Are You Ready?', is predictably every bit as fast and furious, and BRUTAL as the remainder of the disc. <br /> <br />The album opens with the familiar Richard Strauss composition that serves as the opening theme for the Stanley Kubrick masterpiece, '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  The music conjures up images that are both primitive and futuristic... a perfect analogy to the blend of music served up by GFR.  Like other three-man-band's of the era, such as Cream and West, Bruce and Laing, the emphasis was on the power of rock, and the recording technology of the era is just barely capable of containing the wattage being generated here.  However, with the entire tour being recorded, you can bet an abundance of quality recordings served as the pool these gems were gleened from.  The recording (glorious in full 24-bit digital remastering) comes nicely packaged with a twelve page booklet detailing GFR's career and these particular tracks, and numerous period photographs and other artifacts.  Best of all, since the disc has been picked up by BMG Direct Marketing, the price has been driven down to the $6 bare minimum.  You can't ask for much more from a musical typhoon, whose echos are still surely reverberating somewhere.
B000002L7Y|5.0|introduced back in the phils. in '85, a-ha music such as \\"take on me\\", \\"love is reason\\" & \\"the sun always shine in tv\\" were the staples of new wave dance parties, such parties won't be complete without any a-ha  music.  but what appeals to me even back then was the diversity of their sound, ballads like hunting \\"high & low\\", and a personal fave, \\"living a boy's adventure tale\\" still linger on my mind after 20+ years. i've introduced my kid lately to the beatles & other class acts, and i wont mind my 4 year old daughter fall in love like i did with them especially with a  debut like hunting high & low.  their later materials like crying in the rain, living daylights & you are the one (which were single releases) were great stuff, but other songs from the respective albums won't much ring a bell. this is the  best album they came out critically & commercially. 80's lives on forever!
B000G759LW|5.0|She just keeps getting better!! If you don't plan on buying any CD's this summer at least get this one. It was well worth the wait for me. Christina really out did herself on this one. With songs like Candy Man and The Right Man she shows the talent a real singer should have to get paid the big bucks. Check it out for yourself you won't be disappointed.
6304698526|5.0|All the way, the best chase scene in motion pictures. Better than the Godfather, the 7-ups or any of those. Mcqueen was just a lock and load tough guy in this movie. No one will ever bang a 67 Coupe thru San Francisco the way Steve (or the driver double) did in this flick. The plot is your basic cop flick going after a killer/bad guy but don't try to fool anyone; You're waiting for that one shot where  Steve spots the black Charger and the chase is on.. The rest of the movie is basic cops and robbers. I liked the movie. By the way, if you have your video system is going thru your hifi, the chase scene is a full-on TURN-IT-UP-LOUD neccessity. To hear that Mustang banging thru the gears is just the way it should be. If your wife or girlfriend says its too loud, too bad. This is a guy flick from long ago.  Have fun with Bullit. It was McQueens attempt at trying to do his own thing without Hollywood getting in his way. He almost pulled it off. Selmar productions died a quick death but left a legacy.

0895260131|1.0|\\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam,\\" is a book which draws on people's relative ignorance on Islam written by the ever-nefarious and infamous author, Mr. Robert Spencer.<br /><br />In his book, much like all others concerning Islam, Robert Spencer tries to portray himself as a \\"brave\\" crusader to fight the \\"politically incorrect\\" status quo on Islam which in his view is still too tolerant of Muslims.<br /><br />Therefore Spencer's stated goal is to bring about ideological change and show the \\"evilness\\" of Muslims until society again starts the witchhunt so characteristic of Europe and colonialist pilgrims.<br /><br />Indeed he 'convieniently' overlooks those Islamic contributions that have produced the most tolerant, scientifically advanced civilizations of history and highlights only the bad which suits his dogmatic and well known anti-Islam agenda.<br /><br />What about talking about Arabs preserving Greek philosophy (by translating it to Arabic) and passing it on to Europe riddled in \\"Dark Ages\\" leading to the enlightenment. Jewish historians till this day refer to Al-Andalusia of Spain as their Golden Age that produced foremost Jewish intellectuals and philosophers like Maimoinedes. But of course that would be \\"politically correct\\" never mind historically and religiously correct.<br /><br />Or what about the Crusades leaving bloodbath against Muslims, Jews, and other Eastern Orthodox Christians who themselves later became reliant on Islamic spices and commerce of the East...but of course Robert Spencer wouldn't mention it lest we become \\"too tolerant\\" of those Muslims.<br /><br />Spencer is content demonizing Islam so he may be paraded on the right-wing radical websites and TV like FoxNews as \\"experts\\" on Islam when the next geopolitical terrorist attack occurs. But its awkwark sight isn't it when conservative media channels which claims to be \\"fair and balanced\\" parade a non-Muslim who lectures about Muslims beliefs and practices without having practiced it or known it. Where are the Muslim experts to counterbalance such open bias and intolerant view spewed by Mr. Spencer?<br /><br />Such abhorrent views which society finds normally unacceptable because of their racist and slanted overtones are covered by Robert Spencer tactfully by playing the \\"polictically incorrect\\" card.<br /><br />So in short, this book and others like them devoid of true essential Islamic sources and jurisprudence (yet are outrageously claimed to be based on them) is nothing less than an attempt by a demagogue and an opportunist to sell a utterly slanted, anti-Islamic book that curry favors with the views of radical-right establishment who already have a pre-disposed view of hating Islam.<br /><br />Its not \\"politically incorrect\\" its politically intolerant and slanted.

B000002G87|5.0|LAYLA AND OTHER ASSORTED LOVE SONGS, Eric Clapton's best album ever, was born from a love triangle between Clapton, his best friend (George Harrison), and the best friend's wife (Patti Boyd Harrison). The heartbreak and hurt Clapton felt when Patti chose to return to her husband led to a mix of hurt-charged originals and appropriate cover tunes, and when Duane Allman joined in on slide guitar, the result was the finest work of Clapton's career. It is not unconstitutional for towns to require community service from people who see this album as a mere emotional statement of love denied before letting them buy land. Instead, it is proper to view this CD as Clapton taking the forms of the blues and making them his own, with Delta, Memphis, Texas, Great Plains, British, and Chicago blues influences being mixed into an original vision that transcends most other white blues records ever made (the only equals being Robin Trower, the Allman Brothers Band, ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Savoy Brown, Chicken Shack, early Fleetwood Mac, Foghat, and John Mayall). In other words, this CD is about more than just unrequited love; it's about a transcendence of a whole musical form. Bobby Whitlock's equally soulful vocals rival Clapton's for pure soul and emotion. This album shows why I feel that if a person claims that Englishmen can't play the blues, his/her kids should have to complete hundreds of community service hours before graduation from high school as payment for their parents' provincial attitudes. LAYLA, especially its title song, in which Clapton digs so deep that it's the aural equivalent of witnessing a suicide or an exorcism, shows that British blues is just as valid musically as anything by B.B. King or the Allman Brothers.

B00005BCK6|3.0|The Chicago Crime book contaminated the iconian society, whose propensity for exactness and imitation built two war societies on the descriptions from the Book.  The society lived by the details of the book unquestionably.<br /><br />Spock argued illogically, the proper solution for the two war factions was unionification.  Spock disreguard the moral thinking which would have opposed unifying all the organized crime heads into one massive band of thieves.  The Federation entangle itself into a terrible dangerous and precarious situtation, as the figurative GodFather of all organized crime on the planet.  Kirk must have been out of his Vulcan head too go along with Spock and establish such an unlawful organization.  I question Kirk ability too be morally upright.  Spock acted against all recommendations that the computer could resolve no logical or ration solution to the problem.  The only solution was to change the idealogy of the groups into a peaceful constitution rule of law and let revolution forces emerge.  Instead, the Federation became the policemen of the galaxy in a government that enslaves and murders its citizens.  Outrageous!

B00006CXSS|5.0|As I watch this DVD it makes me a little sad to realize just what garbage most of TV is.  This production stands tall above most of the horrible pap you will see on TV.  Shows like this Deadwood, the Wire (seems to be a theme with HBO shows ;), new Battlestar, etc. make one pay attention- as if you are reading a good book. <br />I can see now how the stories all are integrated together- one episode will introduce a theme, character, etc which may not show up to a few episodes down the road- keep your Eye on Lt Spears who makes a scary introduction but will Amaze in \\"Breaking Point\\" . Of course you get the visual and sound of the battle, which while amazing also shows the sheer carnage of modern warfare, you touch the people in Easy Company and they touch you. Almost all of this is passed on true stories told by the Men of Easy Comapny who were in the middle of all this madness.  Stand outs include the episodes \\"Breaking Point\\"- a fine piece showing how to lead people and survive under extreme circumstances.  \\"Day of Days\\"- the Jump into Normandy and the days that follow- you meet one of the amazing People of Easy who is also a great leader, Captain Winters. A quiet red haired Gentleman who guides his men and will be noticed throughout your viewing - keep your eyes on the interviews.  You also get overwhelming documentary that if it doesn't get you on an emotional level nothing will.

Take a look at the book also- fine piece of Nonfiction War writing that this production is built on.
B00005JOQS|3.0|We have waited after that embarrassingly low-budget `Superman IV' and we have waited so long. We have seen TV series, yes, but what about the feature film? Now Superman finally comes back to the big screen, and maybe, just maybe, we should admit `Superman Returns' is not what we expected. Some have already panned it, even calling it `Superman Repeats,' and showing their disappointed feelings blatantly. <br /> <br />[ORIGINALITY ?] Or we should call it `Superman Recycled.' The only significant difference in the unoriginal story of the newest version is that to his dismay Superman returns to find that Lois Lane is now living with another man and her little boy. But who can blame her? For five years ago Clark Kent suddenly left the Earth without telling anyone about the true reasons? <br /> <br />This misguided idea of Superman's AWOL almost kills the first part of the film, in which we are told that Lex Luther returns because Superman failed to give testimony in court. We are also told that Superman travels back all the way to his birthplace only to find nothing. Yes, literally nothing. These are no thrilling news to hear, without which I can live and enjoy the film. <br /> <br />The real story gets underway when Clark Kent becomes Superman and saves the life of Lois Lane and other passengers on the airplane. The exciting sequences are what we want to see, and the film gets better after that despite the fact that the dull script is virtually recycling the old materials from the Richard Donner version. It is a shame that Lex Luther couldn't come up with any brilliant plans to terrorize the world, only sticking to his old idea about the price of the land. <br /> <br />Perhaps you are not supposed to find great acting here, and actually you don't find it. Brandon Routh is OK as Superman, but he looks slightly wooden and humorless, and so is Kate Bosworth who portrays non-descript Lois Lane. Director Brian Singer gives stress to the romantic side of the story, but more impressive is James Marsden as Lois Lane's fiancé who comes to realize their complex relations. Kevin Spacey is so-so as Luther, but you may miss Gene Hackman who effortlessly expressed the comic charms of this villainous role. Only Parker Posey and Eva Marie Saint know what they are doing and what they should do, especially the former as Kitty who gives precious comic touch to this film. <br /> <br />Much awaited new `Superman' entry turns out slightly above-average superhero action film. In spite of its undeniable merits such as exciting actions, the results do not exactly justify our long waiting, though.

B000067FP8|5.0|Gremlins 2: The New Batch is one of those rare sequels that's a lot more fun than the original. A virtual live action Looney Tune with more movie references than you can count and some great digs at 80s-90s corporate culture (\\"Have a powerful day!\\" urge the PA systems), it's a constant delight. Among the many targets are Yuppies, Batman, Eva Marie Saint, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, movie critics, projectionists, colorization (\\"Today on the Clamp Cable Network - Casablanca, now in color with new improved happy ending!\\"), Kander and Ebb musical numbers, Rambo, King Kong and Marathon Man's dentistry scene, re-enacted by a cross-eyed Gremlin version of Ed Wynn, ensuring that if you don't like one joke, another one you will like will probably be along soon. Tony Randell is the standout in the cast as the `Brain' Gremlin, although John Glover's childishly enthusiastic, deliriously misguided and irrepressibly irresponsible Donald Trump-Ted Turneresque mogul nearly steals the show. Even Christopher Lee demonstrates the sense of humor that's so tragically lacking from the man in real life. You also get to see Jerry Goldsmith demonstrating why he never took up acting (\\"Did she say she saw a rat?\\"). Stupid fun was never so smart. <br /> <br />The extras are good - a huge batch of deleted scenes, gag reel, brief featurette revealing Gizmo's increasing egomania, trailer and the alternate video remote sequence from the video release as an Easter Egg (the DVD is the original cinema version).
0380789035|5.0|How good? Well, as soon as I finished reading American Gods I didn't immediately turn back to Page 1 and start reading it again (I have only ever done this once), but I did immediately go online to see whether Anansi Boys, the sequel, was available in paperback yet. It wasn't. I'm going to have to wait, dammit! :-) But I was completely absorbed from start to finish and will be re-reading it again very soon.<br /><br />Prior to reading American Gods I had only seen the concept of 'gods among us' explored by Douglas Adams in his Dirk Gently books, where it is treated realistically and handled with dignity by Adams' deliciously humorous prose. Neil Gaiman takes the concept further, exploring the ramifications of multi-cultural pantheons (having been introduced to the New World by assorted multi-national settlers) trying to get by in modern America, and the problems arising therefrom, in a completely realistic way: I could imagine everthing in American Gods actually happening, which I didn't with Adams.<br /><br />The focus on roadside tourist attractions strongly reminded me of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, but Gaiman's attendent observations and extraordinary attention to detail struck me as being much more personal and direct.<br /><br />The story is told largely through the experiences of Shadow, a mortal who finds himself working for one of the American gods and having to come to terms with their perspective on life and approach to doing business. In the end, of course, his involvement in events is critical to their outcome.<br /><br />Like watching The Shawshank Redemption, American Gods is a story that unfolds, rather than a series of scenes staged for effect, and in this respect I cannot praise it highly enough. I found it a thoroughly engrossing read on all levels, immediately earning itself a place in my all-time top ten novels.

This plays slightly more quickly (?!) than the region 1 edition: the result is a 10-minute shorter film, with a noticeable increase in the crispness of the dialogue and music.  Also, the region 1 edition suffers from up-and-down volume fluctuations in the dramatic strap-down sequence.  The region 4 edition does not; its music is uniform and superb.

But with V for vendetta I just can't wait to see it again! Will have to get a book and also a DVD to add to my very-very strict DVD collection.  <br /> <br />Don't expect just to relax and watch the movie.

Highly recommended!!! <br /> <br />
B000F3AAUW|4.0|For better or worse, fairly or unfairly, Thomas 'Cee-Lo' Calloway and Brian 'Danger Mouse' Burton's Gnarls Barkley project, appropriately entitled St. Elsewhere given its escapist tendencies, will long be judged by its surprisingly familiar single, \\"Crazy\\", which shares more than a title with Seal's more modest moment-in-time hit. Both songs are colored by quiet desperation, sorrow, confusion, hope if not euphoria, exhorting more fearless, honest and faithful lives in which \\"miracles happen as we sleep\\" and \\"as we trip\\". But whereas Seal so perfectly captured that virtually global sense of rebirth, taking tentative new baby steps, feeling swept up and away by the breathtaking whirlwind of change that brought down both the Berlin Wall and Soviet Union but daring to defy conventional belief, Cee-Lo proffers, with blithe resignation, that any personal salvation or rapture lies in abdicating from the insanity of our times or, rather, how sanity is so conveniently defined, something that points to the primary musical origins of St. Elsewhere in one year: 1969, when disillusionment, sadness and a more cynical outlook upon the killing of what surely had to be one of Calloway's \\"heroes\\", MLK and Bobby Kennedy, had begun to seep through 'The Dream's slowly widening cracks and into popular music. In the process, Cee-Lo explores themes of manifest destiny, liberation, fear, the price exacted for awareness, sacrifice, self-destruction, deviancy and disassociation. Parents and their children alike have been forever subject to the rueful tones of Verse 2 as Calloway seems to play protagonist and 'devil's advocate' at once, asking himself as much as anyone the timeless question, \\"Come on, come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?\\" More than anything else, the generation and genre-crossing massive popularity of Gnarls' \\"Crazy\\" is, I suspect, a sort of commiseration and discovery of common ground, the acknowledgement that a lot of things have gone horribly wrongin the past quarter-century.<br /><br />If you were to ask me, musically speaking anyhow, one point on the grid was 1979's \\"Rapper's Delight\\", a godawful trifle which I've suffered bitterly ever since and triggered a very bad attitude about rap/hip-hop from the outset - it, more than any other recording, symbolizes the industry's slouch into pushing mere product, audacious or not. And in that time, I've so often lamented the dearth of truly soulful music, artists that inspired credible comparison to such immensely talented trailblazers as Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder and Earth, Wind and Fire. For every briefly encouraging \\"Yo Little Brother\\", \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" or \\"Hey Ya\\" there was six times the utter, unlistenable dreck like Newcleus, Dre or 50 Cent (truly an overstatement of value, that last). If the Eighties were largely a hit-or-miss affair where 'soul' is concerned (Prince, for all his obvious talent and popularity zenith of \\"Purple Rain\\", never really became a culture-changing force) in its twilight those ideals began to be revisited, particularly by British artists such as Seal, Roachford and rough-hewn, harder-rocking Stateside entities such as Guns n' Roses and Lenny Kravitz, paving the way for both Public Enemy and Nirvana's greater 'authenticity'. As the Brits always seem to demonstrate a much deeper appreciation of true American soul artists, this and \\"Crazy\\" catapulting to Number One on the strength of downloads alone fifteen years later came as no surprise. And if Outkast's sprawling 2003 double set Speakerboxx/The Love Below suggested  just how vital and dynamic urban music could be, then St. Elsewhere insists upon it.<br /><br />That said, the disc (especially \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\", the reworked Violent Femmes ditty, and \\"Who Cares?\\", vying with \\"The Last Time\\" for viability as a strong third single, not to mention a more industrial-sounding WAR with Eric Burdon nowhere in sight on \\"Go-Go Gadget Gospel\\") evokes fond memories of a slightly different, lateEighties record, also sonically rooted in 1969: Truth and Soul by Fishbone (along with the funkier, not-unexpected Sly and Clinton markers, a predominant influence is Blood, Sweat & Tears - go back, listen to \\"Ma & Pa\\" and \\"Question Of Life\\" and tell me I'm wrong!) as both albums echo with generous amounts of dub and frequently reconcile seemingly disparate sounds into something eminently listenable. For Gnarls Barkley, this feat can be laid at the feet of Danger Mouse, known for his gift of creating extremely diverse and coherent aural collages. As for Cee-Lo, he aspires to be both Impressions Curtis Mayfield AND Jerry Butler - suggestive of 'The Iceman' is \\"Boogie Monster\\", a cheeky and tremulous homage to.....the one-eyed nocturnal beast? No, but several are-they-or-aren't-they-double entendres, Cee-Lo's smirking concession and salacious cackle at the end all confuse the issue; thus, \\"Boogie Monster\\" still succeeds in drawing pre-adolescent correlations between innocence, sex and death. His voice closely resembles Benny Latimore of \\"Let's Straighten It Out\\" fame on that track and Norman \\"Hurricane\\" Smith elsewhere - tell me he couldn't drawl  \\"Oh Babe, What Would You Say?\\" and anyone would notice much difference - as well as Al Green and Fred \\"Rerun\\" Berry at the mic (fittingly, one set of Gnarls onstage alter-egos is that African-American TV icon and his \\"What's Happening!\\" friend Raj) but even so, he possesses a really unique combination of styles.<br /><br />The duo performed an absolutely spine-tingling version of \\"Crazy\\" on Britain's 'Top Of The Pops' last April with a far more somber arrangement, minus the very distinguishing, drier bass line, replaced by a slow, brooding march, dripping staccato organ and string notes. Those links to '69 were only emphasized; pithy, angelic, yet somehow unsettling vocal accompaniment typical of many Sixties AM classics (\\"Gene Pitney's \\"Town Without Pity\\", Tom Jones 1969 hit \\"Love Me Tonight\\" and \\"Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday\\" by Stevie Wonder, likely one of Cee-Lo's \\"heroes\\" that LIVES, rather than loses, their lives \\"out on a limb\\") graced it as with the follow-up single, \\"Smiley Faces\\", a song reminding me of a more forlorn \\"Games People Play\\" by the Spinners (UPDATE: it's July 2014 now and, having just gotten a Delfonics best-of collection, can tell you that Gnarls actually derived it from their, sure ENOUGH, 1969 R & B hit \\"Funny Feeling\\" - the common denom with both acts, late Sigma Sound maestro Thom Bell) just one of a few occasions where distinctly Seventies sounds intrude. Other such examples would include Chi-Lites-inspired harmonizing on the title track and a very Ernie Isley-esque guitar loop in \\"The Last Time\\", not to mention intermittent flute in several places (an instrument never so commonly heard with R & B as in '74 & '75). For that matter, an unlikely potential candidate for one of the earliest hip-hop recordings and doubtless sampled many times over is, of ALL things, \\"Burning Bridges\\", the Mike Curb (!!! how 'whitebread' can you get???) theme from a madcap, star-studded 1970 Clint Eastwood WW II movie called 'Kelly's Heroes'. Lest anyone think I'm giving Calloway's voice short shrift or insufficient props, that startlingly impassioned exhibition was doubtless among the greatest soul performances - ever, but you can decide for yourself on Youtube. Clearly, Cee-Lo was feelin' it!<br /><br />Of course, my focus upon the disc is as an aficianado of melody (and admittedly, there isn't a whole lot of rapping on this effort, so my praise may be regarded as a bit disingenuous by some) nor could I hope to speak with any credibility about from precisely where the beats, though impressive (especially the ridiculously difficult, and thus probably computer-generated, quadruplets on \\"Go-Go Gadget Gospel\\") were selected. Which further sheds light upon St. Elsewhere's widespread appeal: while the mad rhythm samples will resonate with younger generations, older folks will welcome the richer melodic touches not normally associated with hip-hop. Furthermore, Calloway's lyrics are insightful and brilliant in their deceptive simplicity. I accord it 4 stars not because \\"Necromancer\\" is distasteful but it just doesn't hold together as well, and a couple of other tracks are a bit weaker than the rest, but on balance, this record about finding balance in a listing world is audacious AND astoundingly musical. Can it even, finally, bring hip-hop back into the fold for everyone?  Or is the street backlash imminent?

Many of his stories are still great of course, especially the short ones like A Clean, Well Lighted Place and Hills Like White Elephants, which focus on a snatched fragment in a bar, or by a railway station to illuminate huge life truths.<br /><br />Over the long haul, Hemingway's style can often suffer. His terse, precise, hard man style often lags in patches over his novel length works, and at his worst he comes across as a dated, third rate social commentator. Not in this book however, Hemingway's first novel. His portrayal of wealthy, feckless expatriates in Europe in the 1920s is magnificent, with beautiful scenes crafted in sparse prose describing wet Paris streets and bars, the dusty heat of Pamplona and the tension inherent when young men travel in the company of a seductive woman.<br /><br />This short novel is a natural pair to Fitzgerald's masterpiece, the Great Gatsby which contains characters who are similar in many ways to the people who populate Sun Also Rises.

B00004R95F|3.0|The themes explored in this movie are pretty cliche - angst ridden young man finds illusory identity in youth cult, gets off with girl, gets dumped by girl, then goes beserk. But worth seeing for the brilliant evocation of a time in the 60s when gang war between Mods and Rockers ruled. And Leslie Ash at her finest as the temptress Steph (way before her ill advised lip enlargement). And Sting as a curiously stilted club hipster.

0780619587|5.0|\\"It is paradise to perform in front of an audience...I feel at one with the audience and I have an image in my thoughts which inspires me. I think of the beauty of the music and imagination it generates.\\" ~David Helfgott<br /><br />Comic and profound, Shine reaches into the heart of what every meaningful movie seems to embody. The underlying currents are dark and cold, but the heights reach for a much more breezy mood and playful appeal. As a child prodigy struggles to live his life and please his father, he finds ways to survive even when his mind is drenched in obsessions and his life is a series of creative adventures.<br /><br />As if he can't contain the creativity it jumps from him in moments of inspired greatness. The way this story is woven together on screen is especially entertaining and you can't help but cry, laugh and be pleasantly surprised by the moments of inappropriate yet hilarious behavior. When David Helfgott speaks it is fast and furiously with his mind making connections in a very intriguing fashion.<br /><br />One of the brilliant moments is when Sir John Gielgud is shouting: \\"You have to tame the piano...\\" David Helfgott does more than tame the piano, he gives the piano a heart and the way he plays can be exciting, tense, relaxing, dreamy, intense, heart-sigh beautiful or even soul stirring and profound. You live in anticipation as classical music springs to life from his fingers. When he moves to London to study at the Royal College of music, he suffers more from his illness and seems to be at a breaking point from which he won't recover.<br /><br />This story of an Australian Pianist with an almost bipolar lifestyle shows the intricacies of survival within an illness. At times, the places he lives are left in shambles as he follows one joy to the next. Shine has profound movies of brilliance, beautiful heartfelt scenes and a dark side that creates a struggle until the moment of redemption in the rapturous standing ovation. Shine had my full attention and took me on a wild emotional ride into the eccentric David Helfgott's world of joyful child-like expression.<br /><br />Artistic license seems to run freely through this movie and the director may indulge in docudrama in places. In the end, you may just want to set aside the controversy and enjoy this for the beauty and connection. In the end, it is love that saves us all from ourselves and makes life a worthwhile adventure. Shine succeeds on so many levels, where so many other movies fail. My heart was completely captured and I feel that if all people care about is how his father was portrayed, they sadly missed the entire point of the story.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewhad my full attention and took me on a wild emotional ride into the eccentric David Helfgott's world of joyful child-like expression.  <br /> <br />Artistic license seems to run freely through this movie and the director may indulge in docudrama in places.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|At first I wondered where this flick was going. But if you sit through this and focus, there is a point. The main character, Napoleon does seem like a totally socially inept nerd. But somewhere deep inside this kid has a SOUL He longs to connect. He's not a bad person. He's trying to rise above the swamp that his life is, and to some small extent, succeeds. His romantic interest, Deb, seems a little inept herself, but she has a degree of quiet charm about her, and she is trying to make a life for herself. All the main characters are struggling for a little bit of happiness, and to some extent succeed, even Grandma who has a boyfriend and rides ATV's. <br />The ending is a vaguely happy one, and if these losers can grab a little joy in life, well hell, so can the rest of us. <br />And don't forget to keep watching after the final credits, as there is about 5 more minutes of movie left.
0517147688|4.0|On first inspection, this is a very nice looking book.  It has an elegant cover and the pages are gold on the edges and tissue-ish.  It's a heavy book that will remain open to the page you are reading without having to hold it down.  However, after a few weeks of being read and carried around, it's durability is not quite as impressive.  The spine is beginning to break and the pages warp easily.  Quite a few typos too if that sort of thing distracts you.  For the price though, it's nice enough and I would buy it again.

Easy flowing and engaging romance.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I am amazed to have read reviews -- including David Denby's in The New Yorker -- that completely miss the main point of the movie: the \\"women's choice\\" thing - '50's feminisim - is the plot line on which to hang a story, but the movie is about a teacher of art history who -- it's hard to miss -- teaches art history, and thereby helps young people discover themselves and the world.  It is about the necessity of art education - and that necessity includes great music too, but for that specific notion we have the equally-wonderful Mr. Holland's Opus.

B0000025RI|5.0|most reviews on this board missed out one important item.  the musicianship on this CD under QJ is tremendous.  any jazz fan will easily recognise some of the names on the credit list.  Jerry Hay on trumpet (this cat has long experience leading big bands and you can hear jerry from Chuck Mangione all the way to Dave Grusin's big band), Greg Phillanganes, another superb expert on synthesizer, Larry Williams on sax.  Williams, in his own right is a fantastic tenor sax guy and you hear him very often on the GRP jazz label and then you have George Duke, man alive, here is a master of jazz who migrated through four generations from main stream jazz to fusion (rock) jazz and then collaborated a few funky jazz CD with bassist Stanley Clark.. then you have Paulinho da Costa, the famed Brazilian/American percussionist providing the beat, subtle but substantial.  you can hear Paulinho from Dave Grusin to George Benson... in fact, Paulinho played with Jazz greats like Dizzy Gillespie, Oscar Petersen...... with all these great cats. finally, what am i talking here, Quincy Jones HIMSELF was/is a jazz artist.  those follow jazz will remember his days playing trumpet in the 60s and even 70s.  QJ himself later was heavily involved with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in arranging the music.  it is not surprising that he brought in the \\"musicians' musicians\\" to add some serious musicianship to this endeavor.<br /><br />i regret that no reviewer has paid any attention on this fantastic line up of musicians behind this CD.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I, like many other people, became familiar with Pearl Jam via songs like \\"Alive\\" and \\"Daughter\\" that I listened to on the radio back in the 90s. I recently acquired a taste for the band via some videos of theirs I have been able to watch on the internet and, after a momentary lapse of reason, dumped listening to Hip-Hop/Top 40. I can safely say that Pearl Jam is one of the bands that brought me back to rock & roll. A friend of mine also allowed me to listen to this CD at work and, like one reviewer points out, it grows on you. I love the anti-authoritarian streak Pearl Jam has in their songs and the CD's strong anti-war message is a reflection of the band's (especially Eddie Vedder's) convictions. This album gets better each time I listen to it too and it is also refreshing to have read on Amazon and elsewhere that PJ has 'returned to its roots' too since I think this album's style of music is similar to their \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs\\" releases that I recommend you pick up as well. Hopefully, this will spark a resurgence of the grunge genre without copy cat Pearl Jam bands. This is a solid rock album with many songs with furious, in-your-face instruments and vocals and, so far, is the best rock album of 2006!
B000BJ7BCK|3.0|After a lifetime of being a punching bag for my schools I put together a few convenient opportunities and made a run for the top of my school's popularity charts. To my amazement (and most everybody else's) I was wildly successful, if only for one year. Those opportunities did all they could and soon I was back at the bottom of the ladder. This was 10th grade for me, and now, 9 years later that one year still basks in an immaculate glow unchallenged by any other memories of mine. And this is despite the fact that today, at my advanced age, I know that the price of coolness is originality and freedom and basically your soul. I hated the person I was back then but I loved being him. That time in my life was so intoxicating I may never get over it. And that intoxication and its hazards are the subject of \\"Sky High.\\"<br /><br />The story revolves around Will Stronghold, the son of two famous superheroes, as he is sent off to a new superhero school. After finally finding his superpowers and being anointed superhero (as opposed to sidekick), he leaves his true friends in the dust and being hanging with the other superheroes. This being a Disney movie we all know that along they way Will will recognize the errors of his ways and return to his roots, but along the way director Mike Mitchell delivers a very clever, very relevant look at modern high schools. My main complaint is that they give him superpowers at all. Why spend the first half of the film defending the idea of having no powers just so that he can go against them. I'm sure the idea is to give him excuse to get in with the popular kids, but didn't we just play that game with \\"Mean Girls?\\" It also gave the director an opportunity to show off some of his special effects fireworks. I really liked the way the film attacked the self-esteem drenched 90's. Sorry, not everybody can be a superhero, and I don't care what your second grade teacher told you. Some of us are sidekicks, and some of us are villains. One of the best scenes involves Will's dad complimenting him on actually hanging out with sidekicks, all the while condescending to them (\\"They've really lowered the bar at that school since my day.\\"). This swipe at all those parental types who have understated hatred for all things inferior (at least in their mind) is long overdue and refreshing (especially in the age of nepotism that we now live).<br /><br />There are a few other problems with this film, but they are mostly minor. To cast Dave Foley in such a pathetic role seemed a little cruel, especially considering the hard times his career has fallen on. The film also has a look that maybe it was made on the cheap. The special effects are there and used intelligently, but the production value overall seems to be sub-par. I also could have lived without the very obvious point they were going for that all forward females are not to be trusted and probably evil. I know Disney is not in the game of telling kids sex is good. But to tell a younger generation that anytime a girl shows special interest in you it's a bad thing just seems dishonest. Still the film is high quality and deserves to be seen, especially for anybody looking for a little fresh blood in the superhero genre. ***1/2best scenes involves Will's dad complimenting him on actually hanging out with sidekicks, all the while condescending to them (\\"They've really lowered the bar at that school since my day.\\").

B0006L0LOS|3.0|Which isn't saying a whole lot. Still, this got trashed to the extreme, and it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be. How does it rank with the superhero movies? Way better than that CGI turd the Hulk, a notch better than the Fantastic Four, based off better acting (and I'm talking the cardboard portrayals of Fantastic Four), and about on par with Daredevil (while the DD scene where he pushes a tooth out in the shower is awesome, is whole \\"blind fight\\" with Electra is crap... way to have DD keep his secret identity, script writers). Halle Berry's acting really wasn't bad here. Sharon Stone did deserve a Razzie instead. Again, better than what you'd think if you heard it was terrible, yet soundly average and formula overall.

B00005JOML|2.0|When one thinks 'Miami Vice', you think pastels, fast cars, constant action, and hip music. Now, thanks to this misguided \\"reimagining\\" of the hit 1980's TV show, when people think 'Miami Vice', they're going to think boring talk about drugs and not much else. To its credit, 'Vice' has a good soundtrack and some explosive action (some being the key word), but once it hits the half hour mark it becomes a mess of characters, locations, and drug deals that, unfortunately, never go bad (if they did maybe there would be a little action). 'Miami Vice' starts with a bang...literally, with a smackdown in a crowded nightclub, similar to the shootout in the crowded nightclub in 'Collateral'. <br /> <br />There is no telling my immense dissapointment with this movie. It starts great, with the aformentioned fist fight and a shootout. The previews for the movie were full of scenes and images of action, and so much of that is not even in the movie at all that one may think it was merely shot for the preview. Evidentally, this movie was originally 146 minutes long. It's now been cut down to 130 minutes, missing, from what I've heard, a boat chase and many lines of dialogue, including some whole scenes, including the one from the trailer where Colin Farell puts a grenade on the table while interrogating someone and tells them \\"Violence is real expensive.\\" The acting in the movie is OK. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farell, playing, respectively, Ricardo Tubbs and Sonny Crockett, never speak to each other, and Naomie Harris plays Tubbs' girlfriend Trudy. By the end of the movie, she has gone through such beatings (such as being captured and beaten by white supremacists and having a bomb strapped to her that detonates, but not to devastating affect) that the viewer (should) feel like they have gone through the beatings with her. But instead, we don't really care.  <br /> <br />The movie goes for shock value, like having KKK members and Nazi's involved in the plot, but it would have been moreshocking if they weren't cookie cutter villains. Instead of threatening to shoot Trudy in the head, maybe they could have shot her, and then everyone watching would be shocked, instead of bemused by the fact that we all knew what was gonna happen. The villains are so generic that I couldn't tell them apart. I felt as if I was watching a foreign film, because I couldn't keep track of the characters. The plot is also incredibly hard to follow. This is an actual line of dialogue from the movie: <br />\\"We got five kilos on the table. If you want, take them, but our men are gonna be behind you, taking your G's for our kilo's. If you really want this smack, you're gonna tell you're boys here to take they're *expletive deleted* guns off of us and take the stuff. But let me lay this out there. We got five K for ten G, twenty G buy you ten, thirty buy you 25. You want this, it's yours. For a price, for a discount.\\" <br />Did that make any sense to anyone? Anyone? OK, I proved my point. <br /> <br />The plot, from what I could gather, has Crockett and Tubbs going undercover to infiltrate a ruthless drug dealer, who somehow has ties to the KKK. Crockett gets into a relationship with the dealers girlfriend Isabella (Gong Li, who's English is so bad that she just starts pretending to be retarded eventually). The plot is non-stop talk for an hour and a half, until a drug and money trade is set up and by default there is a big showdown. <br /> <br />I have nothing against talkative movies. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Little Miss Sunshine', and there was no action in that. Well very little. As I recall there was some reckless driving. Woo! Exilarating! My problem with this movie was that it made no sense, and it was just extremely boring. I almost fell asleep, and I saw it in the early afternoon. There is a character who is killed off in the first ten minutes who evidentally has something very important to do with the plot, but he is never mentioned again. Michael Mann has made some great movies. 'Collateral' is one of my all time favorites, and so is 'Heat.' But this movie assaulted the original series, which is odd because this movie was written by Mann, who produced the original series. There could have been some great action sequences. There were many oppurtunities for car chases and even an airplane chase, but they are thrown away. The movies falls apart under its own heavy handedness. 'Miami Vice' wants to say something about America's current political climate, but instead, it just feels forced, and no message is ever made clear. By my dissapointment with the movie, that is not to say there is no action. There's an amazing, multi-stage gun battle at the end, which has some of the best stunts I've seen in a movie in a long time. The simplicity of the whole scene, with people shooting from behind cars and hiding behind dumpsters, makes the movie almost worthwhile. Instead of using lots of CGI and slow motion, Mann uses none and constructs a great shootout sequence. It's not better than 'Heat' or 'Collateral', but it's right up there. It's been a long time since a movie has gotten a reaction out of me, but this one did. In the final shootout, amongst all the chaos, one death stands out. I won't give away who it was, or who killed him, but the way it was done was genius: two men exchange gun fire, and one of the men is shot, splattering blood and matter all over the wall behind him. He swivels around, and we see that his entire back has been blown off, as has a large part of his chest. It's the only time in recent memory that a movie made me go \\"Oh my God!\\" <br /> <br />I gave the movie two stars simply for the action. Again, I stress that I didn't just go for the action. There are lots of movies with no action that I like, but what happened here was that I went expecting an action movie, not a movie that I really had to focus on and might lose track of if I look away for even a second. Perhaps that was my mistake, not fully knowing what the movie was. But as I see it now, this movie is a huge dissapointment.  <br /> <br />Runtime: 2 hours and 10 minutes <br />Rating: R, for strong bloody violence, language, drug material, and some sexual content.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|After all the criticism this movie attracted, I'll admit that I didn't have high hopes.  It was, however, better than I expected. <br /> <br />For those who, like me, haven't seen the original and are flying pretty much blind in considering this film, \\"Poseidon\\" tells the story of the cruise ship Poseidon.  After meeting a rogue wave, the ship capsizes, killing many passengers and stranding the rest inside the overturned boat.  A small group of passengers, led by Dylan (Josh Lucas) and Robert (Kurt Russell), leave the rest of the survivors and set out on a perilous journey to escape the sinking ship before it's too late. <br /> <br />Let me begin by saying that this movie is extremely intense.  The 98 minutes of this film consist of nail-biting situation after nail-biting situation after nail-biting situation.  If you're looking for a movie that doesn't halt for a whole lot of talking, this is the one to see. <br /> <br />I've read many other reviews that complain about the acting, and I couldn't agree less.  I think the acting was pretty darn good.  What can be expected with cast members like Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and Richard Dreyfuss? <br /> <br />The criticism that I will agree with involves the beginning sequence.  The director obviously wanted to \\"wow\\" viewers with the vastness of the ship and accordingly did a long pan around the entire thing.  Of course, all this was achieved through special effects, and with today's special effects, I would have expected more.  The ship looked fake and even slightly cartoonish.  The later special effects (ie. the ship getting hit by the wave and the ship slowly sinking) are not as disappointing, simply because the plot takes over and doesn't leave you too much time to consider the special effects shortcomings. <br /> <br />As an action-adventure film, this movie delivers.  It doesn't deliver too much depth or character-development, but it makes up for these in pure intensity. <br /> <br />4-stars - watch it,it's worth your while.

Bruce Wayne's journey to becoming Batman starts in Tibet where he meets a man named Henry Duccard.  Henry offers him a purpose and Bruce trains with the League of Shadows only to discover their pursuit of \\"True Justice\\" clashes with his beliefs.  Saving his mentor's life, Bruce returns to Gotham.  There, he gathers the tools needed to take his war on crime to the streets.    As Batman, Bruce stands up to Gotham's notorious mob boss, Carmine Falcone, leading him to discover a plot to destroy the city...    Excellent acting, Christain Bale IS Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Completely believeable and very real.  Batman is placed in a world where he can exist, without making the audiece feel like they're watching a fantasy movie.      Katie Holmes is good as Bruce's childhood frined Rachel Dawes.  I've never udnerstod why fans disliked her.  She wasn't in the oomics, and for creating a character from scratch, David S. Goyer did an excellent job.    Michael Cane, Alfred Pennyworth, a wonderful performance, with the charm and witty humor that is perfectly associated with Alfred Pennyworth, love watching him.      Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox is just plain and simply put, spankin' awesome.  His role as Lucius is perfect, they couldn't have cat anyone better than him for the role.    All in all, a wonderful Batman movie, the story's top notch.  The cinematography is fantastic, the action sequences will blow you away.  All fans of Batman who were bitterly disappointed with Batman and Robin, you have been vindicated with a movie worth of the title \\"Batman Begins\\".    About the Extras:    The second disc contains documentaries regarding the origins of Batman, the making of the movie, the comic books and how they made the Tumbler for the movie.  If you're a sucker for special features, wich I am, you'll love this disc.    Get these DVDs whilethey're still in stock, this will be gone before you know it!

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Ali G Indahouse is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)! <br />
B000ERU5EK|5.0|The album has been a surprise even for me who has been following A&B for quite some time. <br />I've played the album to friends who are not trance fans by any means and get asked about who's playing and how dancy/clubby the songs are in a relaxing manner. <br /> <br />'Tri-State' is a beautiful melodic introduction to the album, it sets the tone before the rest of the songs whack you out of place, let you cool off before the heat is put back on! <br />You will find 'Home' gives an excellent conclusion to an album with ups and downs. <br />There is a continued mix of instrumental and vocal tracks, which makes the album listenable in a lot of different environments. <br /> <br />My preferred tracks are 'Stealing Time', 'Air for Life', 'Cant Sleep', 'Liquid Love' - a 5 star definitely goes to 'Air For Life' whose enchanting vocals send you off on orbit. <br /> <br />I regret that other singles previously released by A&B were not featured on the album. I guess they wanted to only add new tracks and compositions into the album, still 'Far From In Love' and 'Razorfish' would have been excellent additions. <br /> <br />A&B are three excellent DJs and producers, watch out for more surprising guest vocalists in the future as I'm sure there is plenty of room for even better exceptional tracks to come out from these Fab 3's! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Go get it! Corinne is the next big thing. I'm not even going to lie to you, being flood with non-stop pop records everyday 24/7 via Mtv, Bet, Vh1, and radio this is a definate change. I was so used to hearing fast paced dancing tunes, that all the play on the radio now, but hearing Corinne made me stop and really appreciate the beauty of music instead of only great production. Don't get me wrong, the album is greatly produced the only thing the main focus is not on bangin beats but on a soultress, a wonderful voice, and her struggles with love. I swear this is a refreshing. For those like me who are so used to fast paced music videos with hip hop production, this may seem slow to you, but trust me it will grow on you because this woman doesn't sing only for the money, but for the fact she loves what she does and its real because it comes from her soul!
B00003CXCT|5.0|As these films have been reviewed and dissected many times over, not to mention the ever-raging debate over the \\"Special Editions\\" vs the\\" Original Versions\\", I'm not going to go into an in-depth story review or comparison here. These films waited way too long to be introduced to DVD, which is strange considering how George Lucas seems to love pushing technology. These films are the basis for his continuing standing in Hollywood, as well as the launching pad for several movie careers (can you say Harrison Ford?). Watching them now, you can see why everyone went wild back in 1977, again in 1981, and yet again in 1983. The basic plot of good vs evil, with plenty of temptation along the way for good to go astray, is as mesmerizing today as back then. A much-needed restoration and clean-up, both to picture and soundtrack, left these films shining like diamonds, with crystal clear sound. They never looked or sounded better. Of course, Lucas, being Lucas, made even more changes to his films before releasing them on DVD, much to the ire of Star purists. These changes are relatively minor, and are done to better fit the original trilogy with the later \\"prequels\\". If you are one to fuss over any changes to a film you already love, these alterations will drive you to distraction. However, the majority of the films remain unchanged from their theatrical run in the late 90's. I really won't go into whether I think Lucas should have left well enough alone or not, however, I do think he should have put the original versions with this set, instead of releasing them separately at a later date. The bonus features are a treat unto themselves, with a whole disc to devoted to them. This set represents Hollywood story-telling and imagination at its best, and a sizeable chunk of movie history. Not only is it worthy of being added to your collection, it really should be a staple of any movie collection, because it is Hollywood history.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Every so often an artist stumbles during their journey, but isn't that what makes an artist grow and mature?   And don't we do so in the process?   I recently purchased Madonna's tenth (twelfth if you count the remix album You Can Dance and the soundtrack to Who's That Girl?) album American Life.  Yes, the album that was referred to as 'tepid' by a reviewer in Rolling Stone.  Incidently, the review in question was not for this album, but Confession on a Dance Floor. <br /> <br />The term 'tepid', which means lukewarm, is not a term that can be associated with American Life.  This album is the epitome of Hell freezing over, if Hell was a dance floor.  We must ask though if this is the point or not.  Madonna is no longer the material girl or the ethereal girl of Ray of Light.  Here she is the Military girl, a guerilla warrior sent from the studio to stir things up.  Is this a surprise though, given the ending of Music?   'Paradise(Not For Me)' and 'Gone' were already glimpses into the folksy, introspective protest singer in some of these songs here.  This seems like a seemless jump for Madonna, a road she has been on since Ray of Light. <br /> <br />I will admit that these ideas expressed here are not new or original.  The American dream is a fallacy that many singers have used as inspiration.  The only uncomfortable part that listeners will feel is the persona of Madonna herself.  Rapping about lattes and lawyers on the title track, it must be taken in one of two ways.  She, either, believes that she is right and these aren't important or she is playing tongue-in-cheek with her celebrity status and wealth.  Personally, I am so inclined to believe the latter.  How can one criticize the lifestyle or dreams of others when the messenger is our dream?  Better to take shots at yourself before others shoot back. <br /> <br />To take American Life on a purely sonic level, Mirwais' glitchy beats and spare guitar compliments these themes.  Madonna has always looked to the underground movements in dance and techno for her inspiration.  She has worked with Bjork and William Orbit to create soundscapes to fit her current mood.  Ray of Light brought the sound of Massive Attack and Portishead into the mainstream.  Music relied on Euro pop and French techno to play as the disco cowboy pimpette.  Here, she delves into the icy beats of Miss Kitten and Fischerspooner to sculpt the gravity of her message with a healthy dose of irony (no, Madonna...ironic...who would have thought?) <br /> <br />American Life does have many a drawback.  Sometimes the music is too spare that her weaknesses show forth.  Her penchent for poor lyrics shows through many times (Hollywood for intance could have used some more of a sonic wall)  And for a woman that claims not to be religious, Madonna seems to like her allusions to Christianity or Kabballah.  There are some reteads of themes here too in songs about family strife for instance 'Mother and Father' and the power of love to help two people through ('Intervention', 'Nothing Fails')  The criticisms of Madonna's rapping on the title track are not as founded as the disturbing glitched talk-sung mess of 'Mother and Father', easily the album's worst track. <br /> <br />Out of the ten new tracks (minus the electro-spy freakout of 'Die Another Day', taken from the film of the same name), there are just a handful that live up to a Madonna which loved to break down barriers.  It is too bad she had to create one in the process. <br /> <br />Key Tracks: <br />Love Profusion <br />Nobody Knows Me <br />Nothing Fails <br />X-Static Process
0596007124|4.0|The book presents GoF design patterns in an interesting yet to the point way. GoF design patterns book serves as a corner stone in the software design patterns world, yet anyone who read it knows the writing style of the book is formal and seminal, given a lot of examples in the book it is still a bit hard to read and digest, I know a lot of people tried to complete the reading and quit half-way through.    Head First uses an interactive dialog style. It presents a design challenge, and then provides a \\"natural\\" solution and then presents the problem with the solution and evolves the solution to a design pattern, through this process, the reader will grasp the essence of the design pattern with all it driving forces under the problem context. At the end of each chapter, there is either hands-on exercise or game to reinforce the concept of design patterns and principles presented.    For people who want to learn or know more about GoF desgin patterns but intimated by its terminologies and jargons, start with this one. For people who are hardcore OO bigots, the original GoF book is still the best.

B000E41MS6|5.0|I have waited almost 20 years to watch new episodes of Doctor Who.  This new series is outstanding.  Mr. Russle T. Davies delivers a well crafted first series with the knowledge of a fan,and the production value of Hollywood.  Gone are the \\"sock puppet\\" special effects of the origional series, but the charm remains. <br />     The \\"Britishness\\" of Doctor Who is ever present.  Davies scripts keeps the Doctor's \\"wide eyed wonder\\" with new baddies to keep even the most hard core fanboy happy.  The casting works well, with almost instant on screen chemistry between Rose and the Doctor.  I can't wait to see the new Doctor in series two.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|Did not know it was based on a game.My girlfriend just likes horror movies and once in a while i will watch one  with her though i am not a big fan of the genre.    I must admit she made me discover  some interesting stuff that i would not have watched otherwise(The Ring,Ghostship and others)so i was ready for another one with the required frame of mind of: anything goes,let myself be entertained and so on...    WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!     Dialogues are so bad they must have been written by someone who did not even finish high school,the acting or actor direction totally inexistant,visuals and athmosphere pretty slick though copied from countless sources that even a non aficionado like myself would notice it.      What is wrong with people who finance or make movies like this???  I will never cease to be amazed at how low Hollywood can go!!!  This is one sub-trash compost heap of manure that should never have seen the light of a movie projector!!     More than enough said, though from the look i gave other reviews, i feel like i am in the twilight zone.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|To begin with I must praise how beautiful the film was. The pictures of the English countryside and some of the pictures of Elizabeth and Darcy were breathtaking. The music was also very moving and fantastic. But that's about all the good I can get out of it. I can simply not see Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth. She doesn't have the same wit and is on the point of tears many, many times at places where a true Elizabeth would have just been laughing in her head. Another complaint is when they first arrive at Pemberly, Elizabeth lets out this quaverly laugh and then says nothing else. It looks like she's going insane, very strange. Her mother as portrayed a bit too lightly and definitely not as annoying. They parents seem to love each other, which if you have read the book, they don't. The younger sisters Kitty and Lydia are very good for their parts. Mr. Wickham looks so much like Orlando Bloom it's scary and you don't really feel as if you know him.  Charlotte Lucas has scripting problems. She is a wonderful actress and I feel she is wonderful for the part, but the scripting doesn't do her justice. It makes her seems to much like a 20-th century woman. The quote \\"So don't judge me\\" in a reference to her conversation with Elizabeth when she explains her decision to marry Mr. Collins is the main example. Matthew Macfayden is possibly the best portrayal for the whole movie, with the exclusion of Charlotte Lucas. He seems to be much more attractive in this movies, both physically and emotionally. My only complaint is that he seems almost depressed at points instead of reserved. As to what I would do with this movie is buy the dvd, put in in a computer and take screen takes out, create my own movie with the soundtrack music so I could just enjoy what I wanted too. <br />  My personal reccomendation  for a good version of Pride and Prejudice is to get the 1975 BBC version. I feel that as far as wit and age it is the best portrayl. The 1995 version has some problems, such astwo scenes that wouldn't have happend in the 1800's, the age of the actors as compared with the ages of Elizabeth and Darcy and my main complaint is that every hint of wit between Elizabeth and Darcy seems calculated to wound whereas Elizabeth meant to be rude and somewhat cutting, but not the that degree. One note that may bother you is that my recommended version doesn't not contain as much scripting from the book as the 1995 version.
0385504209|4.0|Actually \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" doesn't present new ideas, but clearly puts lots of research into it. I think it is a good book for those who has an \\"open mind\\" and for those who are curious about several themes such as mathematics, religion, symbolism and art.<br /><br />It is a book that can make you feel like read other books in order to discover what is fiction and what is real.<br /><br />I am a mechanical engineering and I liked to know a bit more about Leonardo da Vinci, Gallileo, Isaac Newton and so on.<br /><br />I recommended it to many people, including my girlfriend Paula Bianca Durigon, who is a very demanding economist and she liked it as well.<br /><br />After \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" I've read about 8 books more. All of them linked in some way with the first one.<br /><br />\\"The name of the Rose\\", for instance, is a great book about similar ideas.
1594200440|4.0|Anybody who took social or political views that drove their parents into a loathing paroxysm will find some resonace here.  Anybody who has seen a parent lose control of reason--who refuses to listen to logic--will be humming right along with this story.  The advertising for this book makes it out to be a comedy.  It had me smiling in places, but it is a touching account of an immigrant family \\"finding it's way.\\"  It goes way beyond comedy.  In an interesting manner the author brings in bits of the sixties, Stalin's reign and World War II.  All these bits of history shape the family.   <br /> <br />Further, an elderly father is writing a history of tractors and snippets of his work appear throughout the novel.  Normally, I wouldn't read a work on mechanical engineering, but there is just enough here to be interesting without being tedious. <br /> <br />My only criticism is that some tightening would have helped, especially in the first half of the book.  The villan is totally wicked and her vile nature is somewhat over-articulated.  I got a little tired of wincing.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I know a lot of people disliked \\"Train of Thought\\" for its seemingly over-heavy, less-prog feel. I don't agree with this analysis of the album, but ok, some people didn't like it. <br /> <br />There is tons of good news here. The Dream Theater most of us remember are back in the progressive metal fold. While some now say \\"Octavarium\\" is not heavy enough it seems DT is damned if they do, damned if they don't. And that is a sign they are doing things right. <br />Progressive Rock has always been about change and pushing boundries. While \\"Octavarium\\" seems overly simple to some, I can't imagine what is so overly simple about songs like the 20+ minute title track which moves about segments with real grace. What I love about this track and about the album in general is the concentration spent on song form rather than chops, which is sometimes a problem for me when going thru the Dream Theater catalog. <br /> <br />There are several catchy, perhaps radio friendly tracks such as \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and \\"I Walk Beside You\\", both carrying the commercial flair like Styx, a band that does nothing for me. But they were somewhat progressive and made radio friendly songs in the 4 - 5 minute range, such as these titles. <br />Both are catchy, both show a maturity in songwriting, and lyrically, they are uplifing without being hoaky. <br /> <br />While the solos may be a bit slower and not as many Dream Theater move their progressive sound with a bit more popular feel. Maybe solo projects and exposure to pop oriented players such as Neil Morse and Roine Stolt have rubbed off? <br /> <br />Based on the criteria for what a good album should be, I can't see how \\"Octavarium\\" can be considered anything but a \\"4\\", with several songs nearing greatness. \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is a great song with tremendous playing. \\"Panic Attack\\" is probably my least favorite song, but I still find it enjoyable and have no desire to skip it from my m-robe playlist. <br /> <br />A solid album with a hint oftransition. The next studio album will tell if DT are trying new ideas or retreading old ones. I believe the former will be the case.

B00000K31Q|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. \\"Ten Things I Hate About You\\" is VERY LOOSELY based on William Shakespeare's comedic masterpiece, \\"The Taming of the Shrew.\\" The film is set in a modern day high school. Kat (Julia Stiles) is an angry teenage girl who seems to loathe all men. Her younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is a popular girl who can't wait to immerse herself in the dating scene. Unfortunately for Bianca, her overprotective father (Larry Miller) is incredibly paranoid and doesn't want to see either of his daughters come within 50 feet of a member of the opposite sex. In order to pacify Bianca's constant complaints, her father finally concedes that he'll lift the dating ban as soon as man-hater Kat shoes an interest in boys, which is unlikely to happen in the near future. Once Bianca's potential beau (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds out about this, he hires a mysterious classmate, Patrick (Heath Ledger), to feign an interest in Kat and loosen her up, thereby freeing up Bianca to date. At first Patrick is happy to oblige, but he is stunned when he begins to develop feelings for Kat, who isn't always as cold and collected as she appears to be.<br /><br />This movie is very entertaining. As a big \\"Taming of the Shrew\\" fan, I really enjoyed the occasional snippets of Shakespearean dialogue. This film does an excellent job of reinventing Shakespeare in a very modern way. Also, the young cast is talented and fun to watch. Stiles and Ledger have good chemistry together and make a very cute onscreen couple. Overall, I was very impressed!
0679783261|5.0|I am reading this book all over again for the, hmm, I really have lost count - let's just say the umpteenth time. Reading it was supposed to be a \\"filler\\" until the time I could lay my hands on an as yet unread book. Needless to say, though I have other books in line now, I am completely drawn in and am not willing to give up reading Pride and Prejudice till I reach \\"The End\\" again.<br /><br />This is a book which keeps growing on you and you like it even more on each subsequent reading. The characterization is simply brilliant. The dialogues, though too convoluted and flowery by today's standards, are a treat to read. The characters are all mostly likeable. Though it is supposed to be a romance, there is a whole lot more to the book. Each reading brings out subtler shades and makes you nod your head delighted as the new facet presents itself!<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice has to be one of my most favorite books of all time. I can read it any time and love it all over again. You are missing out on a real treat if you have not read it yet - go get it :-)!<br /><br />Another note: I think because the protagonist is female, women tend to enjoy this book a whole lot more than men!
B000GRUMQ4|4.0|The special effects are great and the plot is rather like the original except it is very slick. Enjoyable.
B0002IQNAG|4.0|This is a great film.  The subject of widespread societal panic and the potential for anarchy among the masses has always been attractive to me and this movie delivers (think New Orleans).  the film is scary and gory and over the top but it is also a biting social critique.  Brainless Zombies wandering around the mall beacuse it makes them feel safe. It sounds like the mall near my house!  It's great.  It reminds me of Grand Theft Auto.  You go into the mall and can pretty much murder the public at will.  A rifle shot to the head being the most gratifying.  The shear bliss of having the entire mall and all of if its treaures to yourself.  Looting and killing.  It's so liberating.
B000FA57US|3.0|A year after \\"Halloween 4\\", Jamie (Danielle Harris) is traumatized and is sent to a children's hospital for treatment but what they don't know is that she has a special telepathic link with her uncle Michael whom she thought was dead last time.

I thought this was a fun mindless sequel with some good splatter effects by KNB Efx (the company that did \\"Hostel\\" and \\"Kill Bill\\") and has a good storyline to it, it's not as good as the first, second, fourth and H2O but it's still an enjoyable entry in it's own right.<br /><br />This Divamax special edition DVD has excellent picture and sound quality with some nifty extras like audio commentary, an introduction, two featurettes and the theatrical trailer.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|When I first saw Hostel in the theatre, I was a bit taken back that it seemed more like soft core porn than a horror movie.  The entire 1st half is basically filled with nude women, and sex. <br />However, after watching the movie a few times, it really makes sense the way it was put together. <br />Definately not for folks who can't handle blood, guts, and oozing open wounds!  Great effects, and great story line.  It's hard to believe places like this really exist in the world. <br /> <br />I love the twist at the end - sweet justice is always a perfect ending.

B000G759LW|3.0|I bought this CD on it's release date, and didn't rate it immediately.  I wanted to give it a few listens before doing so, because I wasn't all impressed on my first listen. <br />My opinion hasn't changed much.  I feel this CD lacks substance. <br />The only real catchy tracks are \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" and \\"Still Dirrty\\" in my opinion. <br />I do love the packaging, and photography in the CD book, which is my main reason for rating this higher than 2 stars. <br />I love Christina's voice, but was just hoping for another \\"Stripped\\" moment...
B000003TA4|4.0|In a review for The B-52's \\"Cosmic Thing\\" (released in 1989), the star reviewer wrote that Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" made alot of things \\"irrelevant\\" upon its release in 1991.  I feel that sums up the impact of this album quite nicely.<br /><br />Very few albums come along and make such a cultural and musical impact to the point where music industry execs trip over themselves to find copycats to spread the magic (and money) and \\"Nevermind\\" was one of those albums.<br /><br />For today's teenagers who *might* watch VH1's \\"I Love the 90's\\" (and laugh at those early-90's hair and clothes), they would have a hard time grasping exactly how \\"Nevermind\\" (and the Sound of Seattle - including Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains) turned the music scene inside out in the early-90's.  Until then, so-called \\"hair metal\\" bands ruled the charts and even the late Kurt Cobain himself stated that people wanted something different than Warrant (although I never stopped loving bands such as Warrant, Winger, Poison, etc.  At least they could write songs dealing with topics other than being angry 24/7 and they could sing some great ballads).<br /><br />Nevertheless, I was excited to see the change this album brought to popular music (it was time for change) and the results (for me) were 50/50: It inspired some good ones and a whole lot of bad ones (but blame music company execs for that!).<br /><br />As for all this talk about The Beatles vs. Nirvana: People are simply comparing apples to oranges and it's outright dumb (ignorant, really) to compare two very different groups from two very different time periods (although it's worth mentioning that the first song Cobain played on the guitar was a Beatles tune and they were one of his main musical inspirations).  As much of an impact as Nirvana had in the early-90's, it was nowhere near the scale of The Beatles.  Period.<br /><br />For me, \\"Nevermind\\" is a classic and, 15 years after its release, you can still feel the change it generated within the music industry.

B00005JLEJ|3.0|Having viewed a number of Kurosawa films, I am struck by how often they are highly touted by foreigners, but really, they are nothing but a lot of overblown nonsense (even the Japanese public thought his movies were terrible, and they thought 'Godzilla' was a good flick!).  Ridiculous overacting, unbelievable plotlines, lousy editing, all are Kurosawas' trademarks.  I will grant the filming is to a very high standard, but who cares, if the story is a complete turkey?  The problem is that Kurosawa never knew how to direct actors, only scenes.  The fact that a number of excellent actors worked with Kurosawa and produced splendid performances (e.g. Takashi Shimura in 'Seven Samurai') had nothing to do with Kurosawa, but were more a happy accident.  'Seven Samurai' this ain't!!

B0002TX4QQ|5.0|*****<br /><br />\\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" is a brilliant, creative, exciting, disturbing novel about a mother's relationship with her son Kevin, who murdered several of his classmates and others at his high school.  The novel opens when Kevin is in prison, and is written from his mother's point of view, as she writes letters to her husband struggling to understand what might have gone wrong for her son to commit such a chilling crime.<br /><br />She evaluates everything, from the beginning---their marriage before Kevin, deciding to have a child together---on---to how Kevin changed their marriage forever, each step of the way.  The novel is composed of letter after letter to her husband, as she remembers, explores, and tries to understand.  It is a fascinating read, compelling, but also very dark.  I found myself identifying with her in her choices, and not knowing what to do at all as she would struggle with problem after problem.<br /><br />After the school shootings in the late 1990's that were in the news, I wondered, along with many others, what was wrong with the parents that they didn't see the signs, or what could they possibly have done or not done to raise such a hardened and cruel child.  This novel explores this question, with no definitive answers, perhaps because there are none.  However, it makes the reader think, and empathize with the situation the parents face by immersing the reader in their world.<br /><br />This novel is beautifully written, and if you are interested in the psychological puzzles surrounding the school shootings, should not be missed.<br /><br />*****

B000GCFO0I|4.0|I have seen several of these movies that are based on video games, but \\"Silent Hill\\" is the first one where I have been motivated to order one of the games and try it out. This was not just because of the bizarre world that I saw on screen, but also because of the testimonial provided by director Christophe Gans in the special features on this DVD, who started playing the original \\"Silent Hill\\" game and apparently got three or four hours into it when it hit him it would work as a movie. But there is something to be said for the bizarre world and if style overwhelms substance in this 2006 horror film that is more because the style is so omnipresent than the problematic elements of the substance.<br /><br />So I know nothing about the \\"Silent Hill\\" videogame and have no idea where the movie is being faithful and where it is grossly offending game players. Rose DaSilva (Radha Mitchell) has an adopted daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), who sleepwalks across the interstate in the middle of the night to stand on the precipice screaming \\"Silent Hill!\\" It turns out that this is the name of a ghost town in West Virginia that was abandoned because of uncontrollable fires in the coal minds underneath the town. Rose decides to take Sharon there because that is the sort of thing you do in videogames (or movies) when somebody in a heightened state of awareness starts screaming clues. Besides, Sharon keeps drawing pictures of the place. Rose's husband, Christopher (Sean Bean), does not think this is a good idea so she starts off without telling him and he spends the rest of the film playing catchup.<br /><br />According to everybody Rose asks, you cannot get to Silent Hill from here, except that there is a road sign that still indicates the turn off. However, when Rose takes the fateful road up to Silent Hill she does so by driving away from the female highway patrol cop on a motorcycle who pulled her over. The next thing we know there is a car accident and when Rose comes to again, Sharon is gone. We now have the basic situation of the movie: Sharon is lost in Silent Hill, and Rose is going to have to go find her.<br /><br />Beyond that I really do not want to say more about the plot of the film because what matters is not the specifics of how Rose tracks down Sharon, but that she does it in a world aptly described at one point on the DVD as \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" meets \\"Dante's Inferno.\\" The latter reference point is obvious because I was thinking early on that Gustave Dore's etchings for \\"The Inferno\\" were an artistic inspiration for what is going on here (along with Nine Inch Nails music videos) with Carol Spier's production design and Dan Laustsen's cinematography, but I can see where Rose and Sharon have gone down a hell of a rabbit hole as well. Rarely have I seen a film where what is happening is taking a back seat to the locale, but \\"Silent Hill\\" really is that sort of a film. I want to see what happens next for the visual dimensions rather than for what it means for the narrative.<br /><br />However, I will speak to the apparent confusion that exists over what is going on, without explaining what is happening (and with one hand tied behind my back). At issue is whether Silent Hill is a town gone wrong because of an unnatural disaster, like in \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\" (think of bituminous coal as the early 19th century equivalent of rampant nuclear energy), or whether it is an alternative reality, like in \\"Army of Darkness.\\" This is a key question, and the answer is that the film is both. That is not obvious, at least not until you catch the key visual difference between the two, but it is important to understanding what is happening in the film. Even at the end I am not totally sure what has just happened, but I saw the final twist coming and I liked it, and I have not liked the final twist in a horror film since \\"Honogurai mizu no soko kara.\\" Now I have to go see about playing that video game.gone.

B00004VY1A|5.0|Just before doing \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" director Peter Jackson (who can be seen in a cameo as \\"Man with Piercings\\") made an off-kilter horror/comedy movie called \\"The Frighteners,\\" the tale of the undead and the guy who makes a living off of them. Though \\"Frighteners\\" was barely in theaters at all, this cult flick is funny, creepy, well-acted and wonderfully directed.<br /><br />Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) has seen spirits and apparitions ever since the car crash that killed his wife. Now he operates an amateur \\"ghostbusting\\" operation that is supposed to exorcise ghosts from people's houses -- the problem is that the ghosts who haunt those houses are in league with him (Chi McBride as the opinioated afro-ed Cyrus, Jim Fyfe as the nerdy Stuart, and most of John Astin as what is left of The Judge).<br /><br />Frank's business certainly isn't hurt by the fact that for years after a serial killer's murderous spree, people have died mysteriously of heart attacks. Then Frank starts seeing fiery numbers emblazoned on the foreheads of people who will die, including the husband of doctor Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado). As if trying to stop a specter of death weren't hard enough, crazed FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) believes that Frank is the one murdering people. But the evil specter is still killing -- and Lucy is the next victim.<br /><br />Peter Jackson once said that he has a \\"moronic\\" sense of humor, and it shows up in all its glory here -- from bug spray dissolving a ghost's face to a piece of talking oily sludge to a drill sargeant ghost with submachine guns, this is weird and absolutely hilarious. It's the perfect blend of comedy and horror.<br /><br />But he's also good during the more serious moments, such as Bannister's flashbacks to his wife's death, or the eerie sight of homicidal young lovers dancing with a gun. The opening shot is pure Jackson, with the camera swooping through a window, past fluttering curtains, and though a hole in the attic floor to a screaming woman below.<br /><br />Jackson also takes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun at more conventional ghost movies: the big Gothic house, crazy old lady, ghost in '70s clothes, and Fox's hilarious turn as a ghostbuster. Nothing horrific is sacred. \\"There ain't nothing worse than a bunch of pissed-off brothers... that's ALREADY DEAD!\\" Cyrus yells at one point.<br /><br />Does it have a flaw? Yes -- the opening scene doesn't seem to make much sense later on in the movie. But Jackson makes up for that with a surprisingly tight, coherent plot, and a satisfying finale that makes more sense than most other horror movies do.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant, whether it's the twitchy, wild-eyed FBI agent, or the three weird ghosts. Michael J. Fox does an excellent job as Frank, with the right combination of cockiness and pathos, while Alvarado is solid as the idealistic young doctor. But the scenes are really stolen by Dee Wallace-Stone and freaky-eyed Jake Busey, as homicidal young lovers.<br /><br />\\"Frighteners\\" might not make you believe in ghosts, but it will make you laugh, shiver, and maybe even shed a tear or two. Wildly funny, weird, gross, and sometimes really peculiar, this is Jackson's splatter-gore at its best.the attic floor to a screaming woman below.  <br /> <br />Jackson also takes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun at more conventional ghost movies: the big Gothic house, crazy old lady, ghost in '70s clothes, and Fox's hilarious turn as a ghostbuster.

0515141429|4.0|I came into the Jack Reacher game late, having started with 'One Shot' and Die Trying' both of which I thought were excellent thrillers. So, I decided to go back to the beginning and see how the series all started. It's a totally engrossing and enjoyable read, although it definitely feels like a first novel. Some of the situations are more than a tad convenient,one of which Jack Reacher even cops to. Still Child is at his best when he's tying the action up in the final fifty pages or so with heart pounding suspense that never lets up. If this is the first thing you're reading by Child, you should find it a better than average book for the genre, if you're a fan it's nice to see the genesis.

B000002OX7|5.0|This is easily my favorite Who album, and one of my all- time favorites, period. For being one of their earlier releases, it shows a great maturity which generally occurs just before a band's demise (probably due to the pressures of a follow-up.) Thankfully, this wasn't the case with The Who. They had several other great releases and hung around for a long time afterward, with the exception of Keith Moon and John Entwistle (God rest their souls!) Every song on this disc is a winner, Pete Townshend pumping- out some of his best writing ever and each musician contributing to the utmost- Moon's smashing, bashing, but always exciting drumming, the OX tearing- up the fretboard on his bass as only he could,Daltrey belting- out some of his (or anyone's) best vocals and Pete's guitar playing at it's best. This recording can't be beat as far as stylistic changes, ear- pleasing melodies, catchy lyrics and teriffic songwriting. Even Pete's vocal interludes (which aren't always my favorite,) really add a touch of emotion to each song he appears on. I love every Who recording I've heard, but I think this one really captures them at the top of their game. I really enjoy the bonus tracks. Very good tunes instead of filler to take up space on a CD!
B00007LTIB|4.0|Following on the heels of an album many attribute to the collapse of progressive rock ('Tales from Topographic Oceans' in 1973), Yes sought to heal the gap it had driven between its fans--some loved 'Tales,' and others thought it was bombastic and (a classic pun) over the edge.  Critics saw 'Tales' as an opportunity to do something they had been waiting to do forever: demonstrate to the mere common man their birthright superiority by collectively dashing the whole of progressive rock into oblivion.    They successfully destroyed the further exploration and cultivation of the art form, but not the spirit of its followers.  It was in this climate, though, that Yes's 1974 release, 'Relayer,' was somewhat ignored and shunned.  The band did not succeed outright in reuniting its fans (three years later, the release of 'Going for the One' came much closer to this ideal) with 'Relayer,' but they did set down a truly progressive album, ripe with fresh ideas and a totally new direction for the band.    This new direction was fostered somewhat by the recent lineup changes (the exodus of drummer Bill Bruford after 'Close to the Edge' and keyboardist Rick Wakeman's departure after 'Tales').  Drummer Alan White was called in for 'Tales,' and to fill Wakeman's shoes, Swiss-born keyboardist Patrick Moraz was commissioned well into the 'Relayer' project.  White, now a seasoned member of the band, gained the confidence to give his best performance on 'Relayer.'  And Moraz, a fresh addition, offered a completely different playing style than Wakeman.  While Wakeman was steeped in classical, Moraz was much more influenced by jazz.    Now that I have given the facts, it's time for the evaluation segment.  I must respectfully disagree with many of the reviewers of this album in that I personally do not like Patrick Moraz's work.  Considering the matter at length, I find the parts about the album I consistently dislike are the keyboard lines.  The synthesizer programming is universally awful; most of the time it sounds like helium escaping from a balloon.  Also, Moraz uses almost all synthesizers, the Mellotron is often swallowed in the mix, and the Hammond organ is almost nonexistent.  The latter two are things I miss from the band's earlier albums; even Tony Kaye on the very early albums was proficient in the usage of the Hammond organ.  The Hammond, I believe, was integral to the band's sound.  And Rick Wakeman's classical sensibilities kept his contributions within the bounds of reason, whereas Moraz's work is rather grating and irritating.  Finally, Wakeman's synthesizer programming--though sometimes staid--had a warm and organic feel to it, something which I sorely miss on 'Relayer.'  While it is true that this album is indeed one of noticibly less absolute structure than the previous efforts, and while certainly its sound is rougher and harder, I think some sort of solid base was needed, and the keyboards would have been where I would have placed it.    As far as Alan White, I agree with most people (including Bill Bruford himself): He just doesn't quite measure up to Bruford, though he is very good.  Of course some of that may well be the somewhat flat production of this album (which was recorded in some sort of mobile studio), but it seems as though the life and breath the drumming had when Bruford was at the sticks has vanished in favor of a more \\"backseat\\" style of drumming.  The remarkable thing about Yes is that, on the three albums from 1971 ('The Yes Album') to 1972 ('Fragile' and 'Close to the Edge'), no member of the band ever served simply as background.  Most bands subjugate the rhythm section to a mere continuo, but not Yes.  Each member of the band stood out at some point or other in the music.  White, for all his efforts, sort of fades into the background in a way that Bill Bruford never did.    The remaining members of the band perform brilliantly as ever.  Jon Anderson's vocals are truly first-rate, Steve Howe gives what is perhaps his most daring technical performance all throughout the album, and Chris Squire's trademark Rickenbacker--muted a little in this album--is present as ever.  Overall the musicianship of the band is sterling, perhaps better than at any point or lineup in the band's existence.  I will never dispute that 'Relayer' is the most technically-advanced Yes album, and I will venture to argue that it is the most technically-advanced album in all of music.    But technical skill, dazzling as it may be, is not everything in music.     As far as the album itself, I wouldn't proclaim as some have that it is Yes's greatest achievement.  On the whole, it's somewhat less musical than most Yes music and a great deal denser and harder to appreciate.  It's also somewhat darker lyrically than the generally sunny material put out by the band in the past.  The first track is by far the best, and the next two just don't strike me as anywhere near as brilliant as some people find them.  In fact, I find the second track nearly unlistenable, especially the frenzied \\"Cha cha cha!\\" part near the end.  It is for the comparatively lacking status of these two tracks, along with the awful keyboards, that I only give the release four stars.  There is brilliant material on 'Relayer,' but I believe some of it could have been presented and developed much better.    For the most part, the entire album is a clear departure from the earlier releases.  It does not entirely lack structure as some people might at first believe; rather, the structure of each track is held together much more loosely then in the conventional sense and mostly by the format of the song, not the actual music itself.  This will take some acclimation, and all through this album one perceives the opposing forces of greatness and insanity battling it out, each with the ultimate goal of prevailing.  Throughout, a tenuous balance between the two is upheld.    I will now comment exclusively upon the first track, \\"The Gates of Delirium.\\"    This song will take a great deal of listening in order to appreciate.  Most people who first listen to it will find themselves wishing it to be over around about the ten-minute mark.  Of all the Yes I have sampled (everything from the debut up through this album, and then some of their later material), \\"Gates\\" by far took me the longest time to like.  And, unlike any other Yes song I have ever heard, I utterly hated \\"Gates\\" the first three or four times I tried it.  It is the wildest, most cacophonic piece of music ever recorded, I venture to say.    So why did I keep listening to it?  Well, I did spend a decent amount of money on the album, and if I had just left it on the rack collecting dust, all I would have had to show for it would have been perhaps one of the prettiest album covers Roger Dean ever produced.  Also, I refused to believe something that appealed so little to me could possibly have generated so much acclaim among progressive rock fans.  Obviously the music was very difficult to get into, and I decided to confront the challenge with repeated listening.    I won, so to speak, because I have discovered the magic of this track.  The comparison that is made most often is between \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" and \\"Close to the Edge.\\"  My opinion on the matter has changed with repeated listening to both, and I must now submit that I honestly cannot decide which of these phenominal epics is better.  I suppose it depends upon the day on which you ask the question, so for all practical purposes, to me it's a tie.    \\"Gates\\" carries the listener through one of the most engrossing musical journeys ever composed.  The basic story is that of a war, and then the silence which follows the fighting.  The story is told through both the words and the music, which is a trademark facet of Yes music since 'Close to the Edge.'  The ending sequence, excised as the single \\"Soon,\\" is breathtakingly beautiful.  It only really shines with all its might when absorbed just after the brain-shattering cacophony of the \\"War of the Instrumentalists\\" that comes just before it in the music.  After that intensity, one feels as though he had actually been part of the battle, and now that it's over, the sun is shining down in vivid shafts through the clouds.  And, up in the sky, the gates of Heaven are opening and spreading eternal warmth and beauty over the war-torn landscape.  The delirium of war is replaced with the glimmering, soul-fulfilling advent of inner peace.  It will give you chills.      The remastering of this album is a subject upon which I can't really objectively comment, for two reasons: I have never heard the album in any other form, and the intrinsic production quality is notoriously flat.  Alan White in particular suffers from this; the metallic elements of his drumming all sound unfocused and fuzzy.  Eddie Offord did his best, I believe, yet there was little he could do to counteract the substandard production derived from the mobile studio.  Bill Inglot did his best in remastering this work, and many say it is a startling transformation.  All in all, it's not bad, and when compared to most of the recordings of its era, it's utterly sparkling.  Still, though, I wish the band had recorded 'Relayer' in a real studio somewhere.    All in all, this album is experiencing a revival insofar as appreciation.  And I believe it deserves it; it was underrated in the beginning, and it is now finally seeing its due.  However, I would recommend 'Relayer' to only a very select group of people.  Devoted Yes fans (or is it Yesfans) probably already have this album in one form or another, and if not, what are you waiting for?  I would definitely not start with 'Relayer' if you are new to the band or to progressive rock in general.  'The Yes Album' (1971), 'Fragile' (1972), and 'Close to the Edge' (1972) (and in that order) would be your best bet.  If you like what you hear, you will (eventually) like 'Relayer.'  Basically, this is a fans' album.  Casual listeners probably shouldn't waste their time on this one.  I'm not trying to be condescending; I'm just trying to save you some time and money.
B00004U45G|4.0|For many people, Jimmy Page IS the soul of Led Zep.  Back in 1999, after finishing his world tour with Robert Plant - he went on tour with the Black Crowes presumably to fill the hole in the soul.  And you know what?  The combination worked.<br /><br />I had no idea what to expect when I heard that the two had teamed up.  The Black Crowes?  All I knew was their cover \\"Hard to Handle\\" and \\"Shake Your Money Maker.\\"  So the real reason for me buying this may have been Jimmy Page - but it takes two to tango - and incredibly, the Black Crowes made a perfect fit.<br /><br />LIVE AT THE GREEK is a trip into the heady past of Zep and its roots.  Chris Robinson doesn't have quite the same range as Plant - but comes close SURPRISINGLY in spirit and feel.  Surprisingly, he FEELS like a young Plant bursting out of the gates.  It's not easy singing any Zep song, but Robinson does his best in hitting the high notes.  He succeeds on most tracks -like Celebration Day, Out on the Tiles, Sick Again, Custard Pie -but he kinda flops on Heartbreaker.  (That's a minor foible though)  The band just rocks though and never lets up - twin guitars playing Zep and the blues - creating a full on sound that even Zep couldn't do in its later touring years.<br /><br />Ironically, the Page-Black Crowes combination evokes much of Zep's early years precisely because of the straight arrangements and the blues covers.  More so than Page-Plant could really do.  Of course there's no substitute for the real thing, but you can't blame a guy like Jimmy Page for jamming the world's greatest rock songs can you?
0962477060|1.0|I wish I would have came here and read the negative reviews before I ordered this book. Buried underneath all of these glowing reviews are a few that were much more appropriate. This book is almost like studying German in order to learn English. One of the key reasons for wanting to learn about notes, scales, chords, arpeggios, etc., is to be able to communicate with other musicians. Like one of the reviews said, unless the people you're with know this system, it's not going to help. I'd recommend the Hal Leonard/Musician's Institute book \\"Guitar Fretboard Workbook\\" by Barrett Tagliarino. It's available here on Amazon, and is the best written book I've come across. I gave it a quick first read-through, and everything made enough sense that I fell that once I read it a few more times, I'll understand it all thoroughly.

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|I popped this movie in the player having heard some of the negative comments and was really surprised. First, it's obvious what the political view of the movie is. Being somewhat moderate to conservative myself, I don't share the belief of the left that this movie is a portrait of our future. It's interesting how the Big Brother philosophy is tied together with a semi-Christian fundamentalist idealogy. Usually these \\"big brother\\" movies show government as soulless. My first thought after seeing this movie was \\"this is probably how it happened in Nazi Germany\\". When people are desperate or afraid (as Germans were in the early 1930's) they will sometimes accept anyone who \\"makes the trains run on time\\". Putting the politics aside, the movie was beautifully photographed. The atmosphere captures a sense of film noir, especially when dealing with the city streets. The movie was really well cast as Stephen Rea was good, and Natalie Portman was even better. Hugo Weaving does an amazing job of showing elegance, menace, and angst at times, all while wearing a mask! Not an easy acting job at all. Definitely a thought provoking movie. It's not Gone with the wind, but definitely head&shoulders above most of the garbage Hollywood puts out these days.

B000FVQM2Y|2.0|If people really exist that speak in such witty little snippets of encoded dialogue, I can't help but wonder how they would survive?  Perhaps they could find work in the waste-removal industries, where the ability to communicate is not a requirement.  Then again, they might also work in the lunatic fringes of bad-independent films where teenage girls recite poetic blubber while playing dischordic melodies on mommy's grand piano?  All told, this film has one of the most ridiculous scripts and premises I've ever seen, and I would realistically estimate that I've seen over 3,000 movies. I agree with the other reviewers who stated that \\"swallowing a brick\\" would be much easier than swallowing this implausible, self-important piece of fluff.  So I give the film \\"zero\\" stars for the incredibly bad dialogue, and \\"one\\" star for trying to pass a difficult storyline.  But the cast was superb, and merit five-stars... Even so, I cannot recommend this film.
B000EYK4KI|5.0|When I first saw this on release I wasn't expecting much, and by the end of it I was blown away.  This is Jolie's best action flick and she has some really nice comic timing which I'd never seen before, certainly not in the Tomb Raider films.  Pitt is about what you'd expect in a \\"light\\" mode, he's not as intense as in films like Kalifornia or Fight Club, but this is just a fun summer thing and he seems to be having a great time.    This unrated DVD is not drastically different from the original.  Actually I liked bits of the original better.  This version has a slightly more \\"indie\\" feel which makes no sense reading it here , but if you see both films you will see what I mean.  I guess \\"indie\\" in this context means \\"slightly more characterization and less gags\\".  But that's not why I like parts of the original better, the reason for that is that a few music cues were changed which I missed, and some of the Brody perspective scenes were cut, which I felt opened the scope of the film.  This version is very much a day with Brad & Angie, more than the other.      If you really like this film you need to get the original DVD of this as well since there is a major extended scene in the first release which is not repeated here.  But this release has hours of extra half-filmed scenes and ideas and it's pretty interesting how these other scenes could have changed the tone pretty dramatically.  In general I agree with Liman's choices, but it's too bad we don't see Terence Stamp in the final cut.  Nice as a DVD extra tho.    Anyways, this was my fav Hollywood film during last summer I think.  A nice surprise.    However maybe this is an easter egg but I couldn't find \\"Shooting School Combat Training Featurette\\".    And Brad's last word was \\"10\\" to help out the poster below.
0761129235|5.0|I found this book to be very informative it reminded me of a movie i saw a few years ago with bill murrey the shrink told him to use baby steps as he walked from the office to the lift he walked with tiny steps very funny anyone who is trying to build self confidence to move out of their comfort zone and do something differant as i am will find this a good start and a good referance in years to come
B000AADYYO|5.0|<br /> <br />I'm not a death metal listening type of guy, but even I love this album. You will not be disappointed at all.
0743454537|3.0|Though I wouldn't call the writing spectacular, the subject matter of this story is enough to make up for it. Filled with tension, sadness, and many difficult decisions, it was a very interesting read and good for discussion. The ending was a little too convenient with a predictable movie-like twist, but beyond that, I was not disappointed. I don't know if I would be compelled to pick up another of Piccoult's works, but may give her another try in the future.
B000A6T262|5.0|If you don't already own the Star Trek movie collection in DVD format, this is a must.  I hate special features, but the digital re-mastering is nice.  And the box set looks nice on the book shelf.
0972169504|4.0|You may wonder what a PhD student does in his/her life... well, as Cham says so evidently, he/she procrastinates. Often. Life in PhD is not that different from the real doctoral life (with some precautions), if you ever want to spend some time in a funny reading (or just procrastinate some real work) that's a good way of doing this. During the reading you will notice how the characters will be more and more refined as time goes on. The second book is a must-have! <br /> <br />As a PhD student in Engineering and an amateur cartoonist myself, I find Cham's work really good! <br /> <br />(now I will end procrastinating...)
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I really love the music. It is a great portrayal of action and adventure through the Hollywood Studio Symphony.
B000F48CD8|4.0|Jack White (of the White Stripes) and Jack Lawrence (of Detroit's Blanche).  That's all I needed to purchase this album, knowing little about the Raconteurs.  And it turned out to be a good bet. <br />My husband says that it reminds him of some 70's rock he used to listen to as a kid.  I understand where he's coming from, but the Raconteurs aren't simply a rock revival group.  The strange blend of White's whiny (and I don't mean that in a negative way) vocals paired with Brendan Benson's is oddly wonderful.  And the dynamics of the melodies never get stale. <br />I highly recommend this album.
0385512058|4.0|I enjoyed this book until just past the middle. It gave great ideas for success and how to plan your life. It gave great examples and dropped several important names. I was very jazzed until it started to become redundant. It could have stopped there, but it kept repeating itself till the end of the book. For the ideas and step by step instructions on how to improve your networking and improve your life I give it 4 stars.
B000FGGE68|3.0|This movie has a ton of action and it starts off right from the beginning but it's over the top in terms of action.  It had an interesting plot that seems to be overused but underdeveloped.  It's based on an infection acquired by many humans which makes them semi-vampires in that they're sensitive to light, have superhuman strength, but only live 12 years after being infected.  This of course divides humanity and a battle begins.   <br />Ifti <br />
B000EHSVOG|4.0|The newly released double disc edition of \\"The Towering Inferno\\", with its enhanced picture and sound, not to mention the additional poignancy of its parallels to 9/11, cements its place in Hollywood history as perhaps the greatest fictional disaster film ever.
B00006RJHG|5.0|This is another example of true horror. I love 70's horror movies, and this movie is another example of why. It makes you think and it keeps you guessing while giving you the ocassional BOO! Collectors edition looks and sounds great.
B0000029LG|1.0|this is the worst michael jackson cd and worst CD EVER-although everyone in every music channel had critisize this cd as the worst i just listened it and had to add my criticism too-it is the lowest of the low collection-when the collection itself(cd1) is good but all its songs are already in previous better albums,and cd2 which is the new material and the slbum itself-IS BORING,SUCKS and the only good song in it is SCREAM.SCREAM is the highlight song of this album and is the only reason i bought it-i have never heard this song on radio or saw the video on tv when it was released in 1995-i heard some review in mtv show about michael jackson career-that this song was barely played on radio cause its too noisey , a collection of BLOWING EARS beats-this song never topped the charts and even janet jackson couldnt rescue it.BUT I LOVE THIS SONG cause its a special song with special sound effects i have never heard in any song.im amazed how michael jackson and the producers thought about this amazing sound effects-and the video is amazing too and i heard in that mtv show that it was very expensive to make.but this song really not worth to buy a whole album just to have it-u should get this song in other ways just cause its a special original song that the 90's gave to the pop colture.this album is LOW OF THE LOWS and michael jackson hit rock bottom with this album and with his life at this years this album came out-overall michael jackson reached to a climax only in 1984 with thriller and he could never restore this success with his later albums-his sells only went down and he really doesnt know how to reinvent himself-unlike his sister janet and unlike the greatest MADONNA who always walk one step ahead of the public music taste.michael jackson go only down in failure road-with this album and his later albums-DONT WASTE MONEY ON THIS ALBUM OR ANY OTHER ALBUMS THAT CAME AFTER THRILLER AND BAD-cause michael jackson music boring and doesnt get updated. i dont know how viewers can give this album 4 or 5 stars-i would give it one big ZERO.
B000GGSM7G|5.0|Complaints that Rhino \\"screwed up the pressing\\" are flat out wrong. I queried Rhino directly about this release and \\"Dr. Rhino\\" subsequently informed me that Robert Smith himself took the opportunity to make some adjustments to certain aspects of the album he was unhappy with. The opening drum roll on \\"Shake Dog Shake\\" has been edited to meet Robert's original intentions (sounds the same to me though!) and he also intentionally sped up \\"Bananafishbones\\" by a semi-tone. The following is my original review of THE TOP, followed by a review of the bonus disk. ------------><br /><br />This brilliant album is as colorful as its cover. It's a fascinating window into the darkly distorted state of mind that Robert Smith (the Cure's mastermind) was regularly experiencing at the time, thanks to high drug intake and an exhausting schedule recording with the Banshees during the day while working on THE TOP at night. Some of his best music and most tripped-out lyrics are featured here.<br /><br />Smith plays most of the instruments on THE TOP while the talented but soon to be booted Andy Anderson plays the drums. Porl Thompson and Lol Tolhurst do contribute, but this is the closest thing to a solo album Smith has released, although I do have a bootleg solo album that Smith did by himself (it's mostly acoustic and sounds rather warm and sunny)[unfortunately, that tape was stolen and it's actually a band that has, incredibly, a singer that sounds exactly like Robert Smith]. With the JAPANESE WHISPERS singles, Robert Smith realized he could do any kind of music, and with the hallucinogenic TOP takes that notion to an extreme where he really lets it all hang out.<br /><br />The breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Shake Dog Shake\\" - a creepy, nightmare-ish vision with churning psychedelic guitar, death knell pacing and a grim smile. \\"Make up in the new blood/ And follow me to where the real fun is.\\" *****<br /><br />\\"Birdmad Girl\\" - beautiful song, lighthearted yet tinged with melancholy. Exudes an exuberant lust for life. Great piano, great guitars (both acoustic and electric). \\"She sends me everything/ She sends me everywhere\\" (love the way \\"me\\" switches from indirect object to direct object). *****<br /><br />\\"Wailing Wall\\" - a fantastically gloomy Middle Eastern atmosphere pervades as Smith's electric guitar hovers in waves throughout the background. *****<br /><br />\\"Give Me It\\" - full-throttle chaos and desperation, a truly harrowing vision. \\"Give me it, give me it give me it!/ Deaden my glassy mind!/ Give me it, give me it/ Make me blind!\\" ****<br /><br />\\"Dressing Up\\" - a dreamy, soothing respite from the madness. Soothing woodwind keyboards, very intimate. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"The Caterpillar\\" - A sweet, mildly plaintive song and quite unique. Highly creative with distinctive percussion (bongos, a clapper that flickers like butterfly wings) and other interesting touches. *****<br /><br />\\"Piggy in the Mirror\\" - The surreal lyrics reflect a very warped state of mind and are simply brilliant. The acoustic guitar solo at the middle 8 is otherworldly and exquisite. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"The Empty World\\" - Easily the weakest track on THE TOP, it features a military march on drums and a keyboard line that sounds like a Revolutionary War flute. It also explores THE TOP's central motif - altered mind states. ***<br /><br />\\"Bananafishbones\\" - Possibly Smith's most wigged-out, warped and psychedelic song ever and the best song on THE TOP. Absolutely churning and thick like caramel with an uneasy, off-kilter heaviness that makes the room swim. \\"Turn off the lights/ And tell me 'bout the games you play.\\" ***** [I loved the sound of the original recording, but Robert Smith must've thought it was too sludgy. This speeded-up version is snappier, but that \\"churning effect\\" is compromised and Smith's voice is considerably higher in pitch, halfway to Micky Mouse! Quite frankly I think he pretty much ruined this song by tampering with it, a form of historical revisionism that I'm totally against anyway. If you're a fan, hang on to your old copy or get one of those great sounding German imports of the original album]<br /><br />\\"The Top\\" - a dark, hypnotic, \\"place where nobody goes/ You just imagine it all.\\" Conveys a frightening sense of isolation. Cadences from percussion waver in tone and methodic drum rolls are divided into segments that make your mind swirl until an actual spinning top comes to a stop and falls over. ****1/2<br /><br />For some reason THE TOP is often misunderstood and slagged, but mostly by people who don't get the Cure anyway. Claiming the album is \\"incoherent\\" is missing the point, and calling it \\"disjointed\\" sounds ridiculous coming from people who love KISS ME KISS ME KISS ME as that particular album could be described the same way. In both cases, I'd use the word \\"eclectic\\" rather than \\"disjointed.\\" THE TOP is one of my favorite albums, by the Cure or anyone else.<br /><br />Disk 2 - rarities<br /><br />The unreleased songs on this disk are even weirder than the ones on THE TOP and some of the most interesting in this series of Cure album deluxe re-releases. The demos are actually pretty good, but mostly just show these songs in development and are inferior to the final versions. One exception is \\"The Caterpillar\\" featuring a very interesting take worth repeated listens, and the rough mixes of \\"Dressing Up\\" and \\"Wailing Wall\\" sound cool. The live bootlegs are pretty good/OK or fantastic, depending on how big a fan you are, but the live \\"Top\\" is really good. It burns slowly, sounding like a feverish nightmare. The rare, non-album \\"Forever\\" is also a gem well worth hearing. As usual, the whole package, including an informative essay and rare photos, is excellent.<br /><br />The first 4 tracks are previously unreleased songs.<br /><br />Tracks 1 & 2 - are Robert Smith home demos<br /><br />\\"You Stayed...\\" -  an otherworldly acoustic guitar excursion full of strange chords, Smith cooing and meowing in his highest range, his voice circling like a tortured ghost. *****+<br /><br />\\"Ariel\\" - The beat would end up getting used on the harrowing B-side \\"New Day,\\" but \\"Ariel\\" remains a serene gem. *****<br /><br />\\"A Hand Inside My Mouth\\" - lurching, lounge-y and groovy, full of clanging guitars, icy keyboards, a distorted trumpet and another genius vocal from Smith. *****<br /><br />\\"Sadacic\\" - a supremely sinister track. Robert Smith was burning his candle at both ends when these songs were recorded and his creative juices were sizzling. Like \\"Ariel,\\" this song contains elements later used on \\"New Day.\\" Features some deadly psychedelic guitar as only Smith can deliver it. *****+<br /><br />\\"Shake Dog Shake\\" - Andy Anderson joins in on drums here as he does on most of these demos. He's the only black man I've ever known to play in the Cure and he's got a terrific feel, always giving these songs a certain \\"pop.\\" This stab at \\"Shake\\" is inferior to the final master as are pretty much all of these demos but it's always interesting to hear Robert sing. His guitar sounds great. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Piggy In The Mirror\\" - Actually one of my fav Cure songs, I had a blast listening to Smith try to work out his vocal parts on it as the tape rolls. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Birdman Girl\\" - Another great song, this one sounds cool despite being a little half-hearted in places. Robert tries out some lyrics, seemingly improvised, and he plays the bass - quite well in fact. I know I'm gushing about the guy but he IS ridiculously talented and his only company during this time was a drummer and a drunk - oh, and a pile of mushrooms. ***3/4<br /><br />\\"Give Me It\\" - sounds fantastic. If you like the album version, you'll like this. Some might even prefer it. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Throw Your Foot\\" - Inspired by the boys' nightly mushroom mind trips,  this song is a goofy blast. Sounds great although it's nearly identical to the final master. ****<br /><br />\\"Happy the Man\\" - Another unhinged masterpiece, Cure fans surely drool over this demo. Invokes a peculiar atmosphere. Different lyrics - funny how Smith threw away so many great lyrics on these demos! He seems much more lucid on this version than the bizarre performance he unleashed on the world with the released version. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"The Caterpillar\\" - Worthy of repeated listens - the piano plays a much larger role on this version and it sounds absolutely fantastic. *****<br /><br />tracks 12 & 13 are rough mixes<br /><br />\\"Dressing Up\\" - gorgeous version. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Wailing Wall\\" - The guitar sounds like a black hole sucking in planets! Almost identical to the album, it's still worth checking out for the true fan. ****1/2<br /><br />Live bootlegs:<br /><br />\\"The Empty World\\" - sounds cool, makes me appreciate the original more.  ****<br /><br />\\"Bananafishbones\\" - a super-pumped-up blast through one of the best songs on The Top. The beat on this bootleg is faster than the version found on the original release. As mentioned earlier, the remastered album version on this release has been sped up (I know, it's cheating). Smith increased the speed by a semi-tone and the difference is quite noticeable. I prefer the slower, almost lethargic version which appears on the original LP, the way it swims and churns around like cold molasses. The title is taken from the J.D. Salinger short story \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" whose central character suddenly and inexplicably blows his brains out. *****<br /><br />\\"The Top\\" (7:13) - mind-blowing, a must for Cure fans. *****<br /><br />\\"Forever\\" - Off-and-on Cure member and multi-talented instrumentalist Port Thompson rejoins the fold on these live tracks and producer Phil Thornally fills in on bass. Originally released on the CURIOSITY cassette, this version of the rare, non-album \\"Forever\\" is quite different from the one released on the FAITH deluxe edition and features Porl playing some tortured, spasmodic saxophone. It's a stunning song that builds into a dizzying sonic frenzy.

B0000C9JFO|1.0|I read some good reviews about this movie. In adition, I respect french's cinema, they usually gives us interested and unconventional movies. So, I bought \\"Spanish Apartment\\". <br />A big dissapointment. Hughe one.  <br />It's candid, it's \\"naive\\", it's boring, with poor ideas, poor acting, very predictable. There's a lot of good movies around you, don't waste your time in this one.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What can I say? I am one of THEM.<br /><br />That makes me one of the masses of folks who have gotten a great deal of pleasure out of the Firefly series and the motion picture Serenity.<br /><br />It's all very hard to explain to someone who has not seen any of the shows or the movie. While the movie and series takes place in space, it is not about space. There are no aliens, and in fact you could take the space out of the show and still have the dedication you see from its proponents.<br /><br />It's really about independence and being a small fish in a large pond being overseen by some much larger fish who just want to \\"Make things better\\" for you - regardless of whether your idea of better and theirs are similar at all.<br /><br />It's about going against the grain and bristling at the influence of a huge bureaucracy that is too mesmerized by its own vision of the common good to critically examine what it has become.<br /><br />None of this requires that you must be a geek to enjoy these stories. You don't have to be able to recite all the episodes of Star Trek or have an opinion on whether the old or new Battlestar Galactica is better (all true geeks know the new BG is WAY better). If you have just been the poor schmuck standing on line at the DMV, you \\"get\\" the premise of a system that seems to work for and against you all at the same time. Crank that feeling you get up a couple 100 percent and your getting what firefly and serenity have to offer.<br /><br />In short, it is all worth your time. Every non-geek I have um... well... encouraged (Like locking them in a room with the DVD playing)... has been surprised by what they saw and thanked me for making them watch it.<br /><br />Take a chance to make the time for this movie. Before someone has to lock you in a room.
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|I keep seeing these great reviews of this movie.  Yet, I think I musthave missed something when I dozed off due to boring everything. I fell asleep shortly afer Portman met the \\"V\\" charater(sorry didn't find out his name) only to wake up to seeing her being abused by the same.  Did wake up for the final stupid part at the end.  Haven't see anything like it since Arnie in one of the last parts in \\"Raw Deal\\". My view of this movie is so different from others it makes me wonder if I saw the same movie.
0784011680|5.0|The movie to me should receive five stars; the acting was phenominal on Robert Downey Jr.'s part, as well as others in the story.  The story line itself was complete, from birth to death of Charlie Chaplin.
0375831002|5.0|When I finished this novel, I had tears in my eyes. It's a poignant tale, and not necessarily geared to \\"young adults\\" as the editorial reviews tell us.<br /><br />Set in Germany in World War II, the narrator of the tale is someone you never want to meet, yet your meeting is inevitable.  The narrator is, of course, Death.<br /><br />To say more would be to reveal too much--so just ask yourself: \\"would I like to get up close and personal with the Grim Reaper?\\"<br /><br />Before you answer \\"no\\"--understand that he \\"isn't violent\\" and \\"isn't malevolent\\" and \\"he is fair.\\"<br /><br />And then plunge into this splendid novel!
B000GB775E|3.0|In Just My Luck, Lindsay Lohan plays Ashley, the luckiest girl in Manhattan.  In one day, she finds five dollars on the street, gets a promotion and a new office, a date with a rich, cute guy, and accidentally picks up Sarah Jessica Parker's dry cleaning. Jake is the exact opposite.  He can't catch a break in any sense of the word. He's stuck in a dead-end job, the band he's trying to promote fires him, and he gets arrested often enough that he has a favorite police precinct.  When their situations are reversed, Ashley learns that she shouldn't have taken her lucky streak for granted and Jake learns what it means to get what he wants for once.<br /><br />At times this movie was cute, but it was pretty predictable. Samaire Armstrong who played Anna on The OC is the highlight of the film, in my opinion, as Ashley's best friend. The buddy interaction between the girls in the movie is much better than the love story. Overall, since I think this is Lindsay's first \\"grown up\\" romantic comedy and as such I can forgive the lack of plot twists and mediocre dialogue. Just My Luck isn't all that bad though and you could definitely do worse in the romantic comedy department.
6305064490|4.0|With the Holidays just around the corner, it's time to buy this DVD if you do not already own it. I was thinking of this the other day, when I read a research article by a family/child psycologist and in it was an off hand recommendation that every child should watch this movie regularly while growing up. I was not really surprised since I already knew this and had my own children watch it yearly as they grew.  The message is NOT sappy as is sometimes claimed, anymore than being loved and cherished by friends and family is sappy- and I am sure the researchers mentioned above would see a lot less people professionally if this simplistic message was embraced for the healthy \\"ideal\\" it portrays, instead of blown off as a sappy waste of time.<br /><br />I never finish this movie without a tear or two, and an all-over feeling of joy. If, for even a few days each year, I can go about my business feeling that It's a Wonderful Life, then this movie is truly art-for it has made an impression and changed my thinking, and made my world a better place. Buy it and Savor the goodness.
0385335482|5.0|This is a great book to read if you are stressed out or down in the dumps. The main character is so fun spirited, even though she is ditsy! I  just start to enjoy life as I am reading the book. I have read the first three books in the series and love all of them.
B000AM4PBS|4.0|Get a set for your parents, your sister, and all of your best friends. If your always searaching for just the right gift for your in-laws (and they're not humorless old farts) this should fit the bill. No matter how many times you watch these shows-they'r still funny. It's Friends-Nuff said. You gotta own them all-and this set is the best way to do it.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|I don't understand all the bad reviews. A romantic comedy by its very nature asks us to suspend our disbelief for the better part of 2 hours. Case(s) in point: \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" and \\"French Kiss\\". This is a good movie for what it is...a light diversion that doesn't tax the brain, make us cry, or make a political statement. John Kusak is understated in his performance(a good thing), and Diane Lane is surprisingly droll in hers. Want a smile on your face at the end of the credits? Watch this one.
B000HCO840|5.0|This film is a great end to the trilogy if that's what this is. But seeing how it made some much money I kinda doubt it. Anyway.  <br /> <br /> Over 95% of die hard comic book fans are going to hate this movie. Why? Because all comic fans are wannabe directors. The problem is that many aren't even satisfied with the comics themselves, as they are also wannabe writers as well. They may like this story arc but not the next. I know every single one of them will walk out of theather and say \\"I could have done that better\\"  <br /> <br /> The X-Men are a very complicated superhero team. With miles of backstory,over 40 years of history, and team roster that is constantly changing. Any director would find this  a very challenging project to undertake. The fans all have their own favorite characters of the 198 currently in the comic. Some will be disappointed if their fave isn't included. Others have their favorite stories that they want to see done. Yet, a lot of those stories require a tons of exposition to make sense to common moviegoer.  <br />  <br /> Let's take the Dark Phoenix story. In the comic Jean seemly died while saving the X-Men. Only to come back extremely powerful. During a fight with the Hellfire club Jean's dark side was let loose. She went into space and devoured a sun that was supporting life for over 5 billion people. The aliens then come to earth and demand that she die. Now any comic fan can tell you I left out a whole bunch of details. In a movie I would need to introduce the hellfire club,the Shi'ar imperial guard and explain all their powers. Plus the effects for each of those powers. Not to mention the phoenix devouring a sun and show the deaths of the inhabited worlds.  <br />  <br /> Its impossible. So this is a different story. To be enjoyed on its own merit. Not compared with a comic that cost about $2.50. One day the technology will allow an X-Men movie to be closer to the comic and not cost close to a quarter of a billion dollars. But that day is a ways off yet. Superhero films are so much better now. The effects have given us some great action when compared to the 50's,60's and 70's.  <br /> <br /> So enjoy this movie and stop trying to make a better film in your head. Cause everybody knows that no matter how great the special effect are you can always make something better in your mind.
B00005JOYM|4.0|Before I review the film, understand that 9/11 wasn't something I experienced at a distance. I was in the WTC ten minutes before the first plane hit. When it hit, I was in my office right across the street. When the buildings came down, they ripped the windows off my entire building. My building was close enough that our ground floor level served as the morgue for the site. It was One Liberty. You can take a look and you'll be surprised how close. Wierdly, if you are into movies, when you watch The Siege with Bruce Willis, its our building that got the car bomb. <br /> <br />When the first plane hit, the building security told everyone to get to the other side of the building until further notice. When the second plane hit, I told our staff to get out.  Go down the stairs, not the elevators, young ones help the old ones. I helped our last two older employees down 18 flights of stairs after locking the office. Not that locking mattered. Everything not nailed down that was worth anything was stolen within a few days anyway. <br /> <br />Down on the street, I stood in a crowd of thousands and watched several dozen people jump to their deaths. Everyone was crying. It never occurred to me that the buildings were going to come down. My impression was that it was a heck of a mess and I couldn't see how they were going to put out the fires.  My instinct was to run to help.  But I had a six month old and I stayed with our employees until I could convince them all to leave. <br /> <br />In subsequent days, I was at Ground Zero many times, all related to work. No one went there for curiousity, not after the first time. <br /> <br />It smelled. The air was toxic. You could smell poison in the wind and the air was claustrophobic. They say that soldiers on the battlefield know the least about what's happening and that day, I can confirm it. There were rumors everywhere, that NY Downtown Hospital had been hit, that the White House had been bombed. I heard someone tell me that there had been assassinations. Everyone was confused because no one had the whole story. Not yet.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure we still have it all. But that someone's plan involved the successful highjacking of four planes simultaneously...that sounds a little too ambitious to actually work.  <br /> <br />I titled my review, \\"Oliver Stone got it right for a change.\\" He really did. I've had a troubled relationship with Stone's movies in the past. He's a terrific filmmaker and its usually his lesser movies that get my attention. Platoon was good, but I'm not sure I've seen the definitive Vietnam movie yet. I think Platoon was more about war mythos than about the war itself. Maybe the best movie about the war was Born on the Fourth of July, but that was a Stone picture too. JFK was fun, but he admitted making up parts out of NOTHING. The Doors was an interesting character study, but I don't think for a moment that Val Kilmer was channelling Jim Morrisson. Alexander was horrible. <br /> <br />Having said that, Natural Born Killers, Salvador, Wall Street and U-Turn were excellent. Pure stories with the right balance of surrealism/realism, politics and drama. They told great stories in interesting ways. <br /> <br />Stone turns off the tricks here. The only trick on display is someone telling a human story amidst events so large that they dwarf everything else. <br /> <br />That day, it was what it was like. No one's story was big enough to notice on 9/11. The stories that made up the pastiche of the people's occurences that day, they all melded into one big pot. That the pot is the collection of the stories, that is why I think America, as melting pot, is such a target for the terrorists. I believe they hate that we can pull off disparate views with such grace and elegance and Stone's movie makes a human story of an inhuman event. <br /> <br />I have trouble judging WTC as a movie. I think every actor did a fine job, particularly Nicholas Cage. The script was good, the effects perfect. Stone doesn't show the explosions but, after all, what would seeing them add to the human story. <br /> <br />But Stone's made me sit up and take notice. As much as I dislike some of his movies, I will always go see the new Oliver Stone film. Even when they don't work, they do it in the most interesting ways. <br /> <br />World Trade Center is the kind of movie if you wonder what it was like to be down there, at Ground Zero when the attacks came. Then it goes inside and we see the valiant efforts of men working to save lives. <br /> <br />Great flick.  I will watch it again. <br />
B000AADYRQ|5.0|The brilliance displayed in every facet of this album, both musically and within the lyrics (the entire album is essentially a short story) is continuously astounding to me. I live in NYC and will often play this album on repeat on my drive down to Virginia. If you have not played \\"What Sarah Said\\" at full volume with the windows down, singing along to the refrain at the top of your voice, while questioning your own life and what it will be in a way that only that song can, well, then you truly missing an experience that you need to give yourself. It will improve your life. Buy this album.
0060254920|2.0|What story does this book tell you? I didn't \\"get\\" a story out of it. But there is no disputing how wonderful the illustrations are. This is one of those books that has become a classic for two reasons - parents hear other parents saying, \\"Oh, I LOVE that book!\\" so they think that they should love it too (even though they really don't get a story out of it either. \\"Yes, yes, it is the finest cloth I have ever seen!\\") This book won a prestigous award, therefore it must be super, wonderful, superlative, superlative.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|I loved this CD from the moment I started listening to it. Very refreshing to listen to someone with real talent and a real voice. Hope to hear more from her in the future.
0375701427|2.0|I agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not the characters. He goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for \\"the swede\\", without letting us know who the Swede really is. Roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration. <br />It gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. I loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|As usual,this new Dream Theater DVD release won't let you down. As has been pointed already by others, the image and quality sound is excellent (but I won't dare to say that quality is better that their previos DVD concert, Live in Budokan). <br />The band shows such energy and vitality, their enthusiasm is contagious. For those who might question \\"why a new DVD concert?\\" there's your answer: all the members seem happier to play than ever. Their motivation is still there. And they're still in the peak of their skills.  <br />I was particularly impressed by James La Brie's vocals. He's singing better than ever. <br />The set with the band and the orchestra (songs 9 to 14) is a good example of how that combination has to be done. There's a perfect integration of both. You never loose the feeling that the band is the most important thing, but the orchestra provides a very powerful and beutiful enhacement in each song. I was particularly impressed by the performance of \\"Six deegres of inner turbulence\\". To complete such a long piece without flaws, is a very difficult task. But Dream Theater and orchestra carry it out perfectly. <br />Some may question the choice of songs for a 20th year celebration, but in the end I think the most important thing is that the group celebrates the STYLE that they have been cultivating during all these years. And for 2 and a half hours, they do it through their whole performance, not through specific songs. <br /> <br />THE EXTRAS <br />The highlight of the \\"Bonus\\" DVD is the documentary about the story of the band, using archive footage and interviews with all the band members (yes folks, John Myung talks more than ever!), including guests Charle Dominici and Derek Sherinian (no Kevin Moore though). To cover 20 years in only 55 minutes is somehow incomplete, but I'm happy they put main focus in the very origins of the band. <br />There are also 3 songs from different concerts that are far from being fillers, because they have very good quality of sound and image. One of them, ANOTHER DAY, was evidently left out of the \\"Images and Words-Live in Tokyo\\" concert, while the others (The great debate and Honor Thy Father) come from unreleased concerts of 2002 and 2005. <br />And finally, there's a brief, funny, Beavis and Butthead-type animation snippet that in the main concert is shown in the background of the \\"Octavarium\\" performance.
B00005RYL2|5.0|Classic of '80's SciFi.  The THX is the best as well as the original Highlander.  This is superior to the sequels.  Bonus: '80's Flashback.  It's gotta be in your collection.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I really enjoyed North & South. It was interesting to see the struggles between the owners of the cotten mills and the workers in that time period. The acting was great and I really enjoyed the characters!
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Definitely one of the best. Johnny Depp is great as Wade Cry Baby Walker. There is great music, great scenes. It is just a fun film all around
B000GFLKF8|3.0|After viewing this film it was obvious that Spike Lee was the director as it dragged along and extended to the brink of boring, Spike`s artistic signature.  He also never misses a chance to tediously focus on racism issues predominately produced by his white characters.  However, in this film he inadequately described and almost missed the racist atrocities that were the reasons behind this bank robbery and main plot of the story.  For the viewers that haven't seen this film yet, I won't elaborate.  With such an outstanding cast, great story and entertaining premise why was Spike Lee selected to do this film?  Denzel Washington is a great and gifted actor, but his loyalty to this overrated director by continuously appearing in his films is frustrating.  The actors alone in this film make it a worthwhile two hours but I wish I didn't buy it.
B000HT386M|5.0|I rented this movie expecting to be disappointed.  I sat down to watch it with my girlfriend, and waited for the (nowadays) usual predictable plot.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br />Sure, the begining of the movie is standard stuff, but then you start to laugh, and laugh, then laugh some more... and then you cry like a baby!!  Well, at least my girlfriend and I did.   <br /> <br />And when a movie makes you laugh, then makes you cry, and leaves you feeling GOOD all over... that's a GREAT movie, isn't it?   <br /> <br />And it has a message to boot!  I recommend it 100%!   <br />
B000002O4X|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite soundtracks to listen to.<br /><br />The music calms me and puts me in a good mood.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina has given birth to perhaps the best album of the year which incidently brings back the sounds of the 30's, 40's, and 50's. What can I say to emphasize this point? Well first and foremost she has an amazing voice, after \\"Reflection\\" it was quite evident that inside that mousy ex-mousekteer was a very strong singer. She further proved this with \\"Stripped,\\" which I have to say would be my favorite album up until she released this one. Second, not one of the young pop tarts crowding the billboard chart could pull of an album such as this, that reminisces on the music that built the music we love today. And thirdly, every track delivers beautiful lyrics and amazing sounds. So my suggestion, pick it up as soon as possible, in the two weeks since owning it I have listened, oh it must be millions of times now.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I am not a die hard fan don't get me wrong- always kind of tuned in to what this band was doing though and sometimes owned their disc's. I know that they have changed over the years- but I would call it evolving and development more. I haven't over-played this set yet- it's been two weeks and it has been in the car/stereo constantly so far. My kids love it too- great purchase for us!<br /><br />Stand outs; Wet sand, Slow Cheetah, and Hard to concentrate.<br /><br />The whole CD is great though; I rarely give something five stars.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album rocks! Avril Lavigne is a really great singer! She does cuss a little bit in 2 of her songs but it's still good! This album is MUCH BETTER than her previous album! In her other CD, she acts like a punk and tries to be so cool, but in this one she finally uses her common sense in my oppinion, and makes much better pop music instead of her other punk and rap! <br /> <br />1. Take me away - 10/10 An awesome beginning to the album! I like the beginning of the song a lot, too. This also has a great chorus! <br /> <br />2. Together - 10/10 Nice! I really like the tune and vocals in this, it makes it sound so musical. I think this song should be a single, I'm a little surprised it isn't. <br /> <br />3. Don't tell me - 10/10 Cool! This has a nice chorus, and the lyrics are pretty interesting, I like how she wrote it all out and everything, and the video of this song is pretty good, too. <br /> <br />4. He wasn't - 7/10 Um, why does this song have a music video? This is the only song on this CD that I really don't like too much. It just sounds so weird, and I don't get why it was made a single. <br /> <br />5. How does it feel - 9/10 When I first listened to this one, I didn't really like it cuz I'm not a big fan of slow songs like this one, but I listened to it more and it's actually not bad! I especially like the ending when she sings \\"how does it feel, you're different from me\\" in a high-pitched voice, it makes it sound very pretty. <br /> <br />6. My happy ending - 10/10 AWESOME! Best song on the CD! I first heard this one on the radio, because it's one of her most popular hits, and I really liked it! And check out the video, it's great too! <br /> <br />7. Nobody's home - 10/10 This too, is one her most popular hits, and it's really cool! The video was pretty interesting. This is a sad song, but I like sad songs a lot surprisingly, and this is the type I like. <br /> <br />8. Forgotten - 9/10 This one is also pretty good, I like the tune it's very creative and full of meaning, and I also like the way she made herself sound in this. <br /> <br />9. Who knows - 10/10 Ah, finally a happy song! I may like sad songs, but I love happy songs! In this song she's basically telling a story of how someone looks very familier to her, and how she'd like to get to know him some, and I like that. It's definitely easy to understand. <br /> <br />10. Fall to pieces - 10/10 Wow! This one is pretty good too! I'm surprised she doesn't have a video of this song, cuz I think I've heard it before on the radio, but I'm not sure, it might've been something else. I like the lyrics too, they make the song sound very pretty. <br /> <br />11. Freak out - 10/10 This one's great too, and once again, the tune and instruments sound very familiar, like I've heard it once before or something, but not as much as the previous one, and the lyrics are cool. <br /> <br />12. Slipped away - 10/10 This song is very sweet and very sad at the same time. She wrote this song in memory of her grandfather, because he died, and tells how much she misses him in this song, and I like it a lot, it's a great ending to this song. <br /> <br />Well, there it is! I told you I liked this album better than her previous one. And thanks for reading this review, I hope it was helpful(forgive me if it wasn't)! So buy this CD, it's definitely worth the money if you like Avril Lavigne a lot! <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|He sharpened his propaganda sword in \\"Bowling for Columbine\\". Then he gained 700 pounds and made \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\". If this film carried a fraction the weight of Moore himself it would be a substantial film indeed.<br /><br />\\"There is no terrorist threat!\\" That is a direct quote from Michael Moore. I swear I am not making that up!!! I have seen him on TV saying those exact words; if you have doubts check out his biography on the IMDB. They credit that quote to him as well. To be fair, I don't know whether he said that before or after 9/11 but it really dosen't matter. Either way it shows a profound disconnection with reality, and you can be sure that this film is entirely colored with the same type of rhetoric. Here is another typical Moore quote. \\"The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not 'insurgents' or 'terrorists' or 'The Enemy.' They are the Revolution, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow, and they will win.'' Its almost impossible to believe he actually said that. If stupidity was a sport he would be olympic champion. They are not insurgents or terrorists? Let me tell you, if I were a terrorist and I had to pick my campaign manager, Moore would be my first choice. These quotes don't have anything to do with the movie in and of themselves, but you need to see what Michael Moore really believes to put the film into some sort of context.<br /><br />What Moore is doing in this film is nothing new and its really very simple. His film uses tricks that date back even before the great Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl. Moore is merely using clever editing and movie magic to completely manipulate the truth. Moore has theories but no facts to back them up; so what does he do? He goes out and completely fabricates the facts. What you as the viewer has to decide is: Do I care that Moore gets his point across, even if it's in a dishonest way? I personally don't like to be lied to; you may feel differently though.<br /><br />Jean-Luc Godard the famous filmmaker and founding member of the French new wave said of Moore: \\"Post-war filmmakers gave us the documentary, Rob Reiner gave us the mockumentary and Moore initiated a third genre, the crockumentary.\\" I didn't say that; a French filmmaker did. Now if a Frenchman (they are generally very anti-war/Bush) can see through the lies of this film, it shouldn't be a problem for any American to do the same.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is a pack of boldface lies and manipulations but if you watch carefully you will see upon closer inspection that Michael Moore is, in fact, enormously fat.<br /><br />This film is cleverly edited for sure; you have to give Moore credit for that. But it is not honest in any way.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for \\"Fahrenheit 9/11 ½\\"ding member of the French new wave said of Moore: \\"Post-war filmmakers gave us the documentary, Rob Reiner gave us the mockumentary and Moore initiated a third genre, the crockumentary.\\" I didn't say that; a French filmmaker did.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever made! Forget about stupid shows like Seventh Heaven and whatever the hells on the friday night line up these days. Veronica Mars, is the best show on the planet and I could care less who agrees.  <br /> <br />Anyway's: The second season is even better than the first, with lots of murder and mystery this show will surely keep you on your feet. I just bought season 2 this week and I'm already done watching it. That's how good it is. The last episode was awesome it almost left me in tears. I'm not gonna get into what this show is about because everyone basically gave the whole biography so you can catch others reviews. But I truly believe this show deserves an award, it's awesome! Go and buy Season 2 and if you haven't even watched season 1 yet, buy BOTH! Trust me it's worth EVERY penny! And I MEAN EVERRRRRRRRRRRRY PENNY! <br /> <br />
0156027321|4.0|Of all my summer reading this was the most edifying. This is a book I would read again. I found myself writing down segments that moved me and there were at least eight. Though many found the ending perplexing, I found it devine. It was perfect and Pi Patel was the ultimate winner. I laughed out loud at Pi's antics and I praised his supreme intelligence. And though Pi spent most of his time with animals the most profound part of his character was his love of humanity. Thank you, Yann Martel, for the gift of this most incredible story.
B000066NW0|2.0|Ok, this album wasn't that great at all. I have her other album, too, called \\"under my skin\\" and that is SO MUCH BETTER. In this album, she's just acting like a punk and trying to think she's all cool and everything. I do like her, but many of the songs on this cd were NOT my kind of music. <br /> <br />1. Losing grip - 7/10 One of the worst songs on here. She just sounds so weird when she sings the chorus, and I don't know why it was made a single! <br /> <br />2. Complicated - 10/10 One of the BEST songs on this album! I'm guessing that this song is what made her so popular in the first place, because it's so well-loved and well-known, and I heard it on the radio a lot when it came out. <br /> <br />3. Sk8er boi - 10/10 Another great one! I love how she wrote this song, she sang it like she was telling a story of how a boy met a girl and fell in love in the end, and I like that, it's very interesting. <br /> <br />4. I'm with you - 10/10 This is a beautiful song! Although there is a certain word in the chorus that I never say because of my christain beliefs, I still love it! This, like complicated, is a well-loved and known song of hers that I've heard on the radio. <br /> <br />5. Mobile - 8/10 Not too good. When I heard the beginning of this, I liked it and thought it was going to be a good song, but it actually wasn't, and the chorus was what made it go downhill. <br /> <br />6. Unwanted - 8/10 Again, not too good. I really don't like how the verses are slow in this, if they weren't I'd probably like it a little better, the chorus is ok though. <br /> <br />7. Tomorrow - 8/10 Yet again, not that good, and it's one of those types of short songs that I don't approve of. She only sings the chorus in this twice, and it gets a little boring. <br /> <br />8. Anything but ordinary - 10/10 Finally, we come to another one of the few great songs! I really like the chorus in this, and the verses are nice too! I like how she talks about her life in this song and how she wants to do more than ordinary things. This should be a single, and come to think of it, I think I might have heard it before. <br /> <br />9. Things I'll never say - 8/10 Once again, this is just another song that's a lot like the other ok songs on this album. The chorus just doesn't sound right, but the verses are ok, and the lyrics are pretty good. <br /> <br />10. My world - 10/10 At first, I didn't really like this song at all, I thought it was kind of stupid. But now I do like it a lot, because she tells about where she grew up in this song and tells about her personality, and the tune really isn't that bad! <br /> <br />11. Nobody's fool - 6/10 YUCK. Probably the worst song on here. She raps in the first and second verses in this song and tries to make herself sound cool, when really, she sounds like a trash-talker. The chorus isn't even that good, even though she doesn't rap in it. <br /> <br />12. Too much to ask - 7/10 Another bad song. How well does she think she did in this anyway? Cuz when she sings, she sounds so lazy, and she sounds like she's not really trying hard enough. It just sounds like her voice is drifting off in the backround during the chorus. <br /> <br />13. Naked - 8/10 Better than the others, but still not so good. I'm sure she could have thought of a better ending than this to put to this album! <br /> <br />Well, like I said, this CD was very disappointing. So I'm telling you now, if you have Avril's other album and you think this one will be a lot like it, think again! She has a totally different personality in this album, and I don't really know why so many people on here like it.
B000022TSY|2.0|This is one of those movies that is on the AFI's \\"Top 100 films of all time\\" list. In my opinion that list is bogus. Only about a quarter of the films on that list deserve to be there. I don't think Easy Rider is anywhere close to one of the top 100 films of all time. Easy Rider seems fairly pointless. Billy(Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt (Peter Fonda) drive around on their choppers, pick up a hippie, and drive around some more. That sums up the first half of the film. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly boring, but it isn't exactly a great story either. To be honest this movie doesn't really have a story.<br /><br />Dennis Hopper directed this film and the word is that he was completely stoned out of his mind. I can believe that. There is a scene at the end where the Billy and Wyatt drop some acid and go on a little trip with two hookers in a cemetary. To me it seems pretty easy to shoot an acid trip. Just shoot random stuff, cut it together randomly and voila! You have your scene. Or better yet, give the camera to a monkey. The out of focus shots and frenetic animal jerkiness will only add to the overall aesthetic of the scene. Its ok for the first 20 seconds, but anything longer than that gets monotonous.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is amazing as usual. He is so good, so convincing, and has such presence that he completely steals every scene that he is in. The other actors are good too in their own ways; Dennis Hopper made me laugh several times, but then again watching stoned guys do stupid things will usually make you laugh anyway.<br /><br />The cinematography is very good. L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kov&aacute;cs does good work and he captures the scenery very well. God knows there is plenty of time for that during the course of the movie. There is a little incongruity towards the end when they try to match 16mm footage with the rest of the 35mm film, but other than that the picture is good. There are some weird things done with the editing that I didn't really understand or care for. There is a reoccuring theme of stuttering images before cutting to a new scene. It kind of seems like a film student experiment that was left in the film accidently.<br /><br />I'll bet this movie was great back in the days of hippies and woodstock, but now it just comes off flat. It does give some insight into that time period, but there are many other better films that can do the same thing and tell you a story at the same time.<br /><br />My rating: 2 of 5.

0743201140|5.0|This is a wonderful book and the StrengthsFinder assessment is very insightful. However, the access code which comes with each book is only good for one assessment. So, if you buy a used book, or borrow from the library, you'll miss out on the best part - learning your own strengths.
B000002GJ7|5.0|WOW,  Is all i had to say after listening to this, EXTREME ROCKS!!  I really didn't get into the Sinatra-Type piano song. <br />If your a guitar player, this will inspire you.  It did for me anyway, much more than Van Halen or RATT let's say.  A great buy and so way under rated.
B00005JM0B|1.0|I hated all three of these movies, they are all so stupid. Please have one machine kill not three different ones. This movie should not even be here they ended it in the second movie don't bring up bullcrap that they didn't stop it be cuz they did. Arnold acting in here was really bad and so was the entire crew. John connor was the biggest wimp of all time. No wait he's the second the ifrst is mark patton's chracter from NOES 2. You want real Arnold movies get Predator that is way better then this garbage.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|\\"Silent Hill\\" <br />***1/2(Three and a half stars out of four) <br /> <br />Rated R: Strong horror violence and gore, disturbing images, and some language. <br /> <br />Reviewed by: Andrew Goodman  <br /> <br />  I love this movie! To me, it is the best movie this year... so far, and it is definitely the best \\"VIDEO-GAME-TO-MOVIE\\" EVER MADE!  <br />   It starts out with Rose (Rahda Mitchell), and her husband, Chris (Sean Bean) searching desperately for their daughter who has gone for a midnight stroll in her sleep. Rose eventually finds her and saves her from taking a deadly flying leap. Sharon, Rose and Chris' daughter (while still asleep), starts screaming the name, \\"SILENT HILL! SILENT HILL!\\" This, to me, was the only cheesily delivered line in the film. Sharon has done this many times before, and Rose can't take it any more. So Rose and Sharon take a trip to the hellish town of Silent Hill... <br />   After I saw this movie, I was so jazzed that all I could do was talk about it. I was so relieved that it wasn't a retarded \\"video-game-to-movie\\" movie. Everything was so perfect! The music was perfect (straight from the games, and some have been re-recorded with real instruments!), the photography was perfect (they used many crane shots to mimic those of the games, and some scenes are almost shot for shot identical to the videogame), the acting was perfect (except for the very beginning. The \\"Silent Hill! Silent Hill!\\" was kind of weak), the dark nature of the games is intact, the occult religion is just like the games, and the disturbing images are not held back.  <br />   The movie filled a lot of the plot holes that the games have, when you see the movie you'll know what I mean. It was also VERY intense. It almost has you cowering right from the beginning. The first time that I really got scared was when Cybil and Rose first see the Patient Demon. Cybil kills it, and then looks up a hill next to her to see another one coming. <br />   The film, however, is not without its flaws. With a running time of 2 hours and 5 minutes, many people thought it was on the long side, but it didn't feel that way to me. There were definitely some \\"unneeded\\" scenes though, such as those with Chris (Sean Bean). Originally, Gans and Avary had an all women cast for the film, but after the studio read the screenplay, they were told to add in another character that was male. The scenes with Chris, while interesting, didn't add anything to the film... except a longer running time. This is the main reason I took off half a star from my rating. <br />   I am a huge fan of the games, so naturally I loved it, but it's not for everybody. Many might think it's too in-descriptive, too long, too violent, or that it doesn't have a strong enough plot or script. Many film critics are discrediting this movie as being just that, but they are just one point of view. The kind of point of view that prefers the sappy drama/feel good/Oscar contender's type of movie. Don't listen to the media! If you like the games, or are just a fan of horror movies, then go see this movie! Draw your own conclusions of the film. <br />   If you are like me, then once you finish seeing \\"Silent Hill\\" for the first time, you'll want to go buy another ticket and see the movie again!  <br />   I hope you enjoy the film. <br />Later, <br />Dark      <br />
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|I really love this CD. Corinee Bailey Rae is a wonderful singer and I can't wait until a new cd comes out.  Thanks
B000G759LW|4.0|Say what you want.  This woman can blow.  Mentioning her name in the same breath as Britney Spears is like comparing Marvin Gaye with William Hung.  If you didn't know who was singing you wouldn't know what to do with this album.  So stop hatin' and give the woman her props.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I must say this concert is unreal, the stage is huge,and the light show is second to none. If you like pink floyd this is a must buy. The transfer from tape to dvd was done very well along with the 5.1 sound, the only draw back is it was not done in wide screen. <br />  Watch it at night with all the lights out and CRANK IT UP ! Enjoy everyone

B00000JNNY|1.0|Turns out I purchased this cd for one song.  I was very disappointed with the rest of the cd.  The song At Last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd.
B00005JOQS|5.0|I took the opportunity to see this film multiple times. In a regular cinema twice and in I-Max 3D, three times, each time was enjoyable.  <br />First, the casting of Brandon Routh was a stroke of genius. For Superman, there should be an actor that embodies that confidence and grace of a legendary iconic figure. In the case of Brandon, he does a very good job of picking up where Christopher Reeve left off with his portrayal of Superman. His physical presence, in the costume, lets you know he is Superman. He looks like a man with purpose in the airplane rescue scene and when he's thwarting catastrophe in Metropolis, his face tells he story. As Clark, he's as humble as ever, but his humanity comes to life, which I think was an excellent angle to approach the movie. As Clark, he feels feelings of loneliness, vulnerability and even down the woman situation, he shows signs of jealousy towards Richard White. Brandon's portrayal of both personalities was very convincing. There were times when the personalities merged when Superman eyes watered when he heard Lois tell Richard that she never loved Superman. Another emotional scene was the tearfilled joy when he came to the bedroom of Lois's son, Jason. He touched the kid's face and rehearsed the words of Jor-El, the same words that he was told in the original Superman movie when he was traveling to earth as an infant.   <br />As for Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, did a descent job. She played the woman scorned card well, giving Superman a super guilt trip. She seems to forget that he's the sole survivor of a long since extinct planet. The man should leave just to see with his own eyes that there is nothing left. Even men need closure at times. I do agree with most reviews, that she doesn't look the part of a mother and her youthful look doesn't allow her to pull off the role of an implied older woman. Casting a different actress may have done wonders for the character. <br />Kevin Spacey's version of Lex Luthor was great. He was darker and more thuggish. He had a coldness about him, even in his voice that was fitting of a man who has no regard for human life. Yet again, convincing performance. <br />Overall I think there could've been more action sequences. The ones in the film are awesome, but for a Superman film, fans want to see more cool stunts. There could've been more depth to the story in different parts of which I won't go into, but the film did what it needed to do. It re-established the characters. A smart thing to do considering it has been 19 yrs since the last Superman film. It wouldn't be fair to the cast to knock their work too much. They had some awfully big shoes to fill. Christopher, Margot and Gene made the Superman legacy what it is. Let's give the new cast a chance to prove themselves and that should be decided based upon their performance in the pending sequel. <br /> Now that the door has been opened with the Man of Steel re-intergarting himself back into society, we can look forward to better story arcs and more formidable villains. No more Kryptonians or Luthors. There should be more danger. I mean, lets see the Kryptonian really explore his powers and let's see him get angry for a change. It's time to see Superman kick some butt!
B000FWHVKA|5.0|This is not what I expected from The Knife. The allure of this disc is not the booty-shaking techno-thump that Goldfrapp have been into recently, though I must say that I do enjoy what they are doing. The Knife has taken a different route. Think Aphex Twin's 'Selected Ambient Works' carefully blended with Vicious Pink Phenomena and Pink Industry with a little Fad Gadget thrown in. The vocals are often electronically manipulated, but it never becomes a gimmick. And The Knife displays the touch of a very light hand; less is more. In addition, the individual tracks never get overblown and the variety of the sound palette/songs has kept me listening closely from beginning to end, again and again. I really think The Knife is onto something here. From listening to only parts of their previous releases, it seems that the group has focused more on sonics and the crafting of sound/mood with less of a focus on the groove. And this is a good thing. Listening to this disc, I get the same feeling as  when I first listened to Autechre back in 93. `Silent Shout' is much creepier, but that alien feel dominates. It seems as if this is music from another place or another time. For the average listener this may be hard to like at first, but repeated listens should help. `Silent Shout' is an unusual pleasure.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I have been looking for a new style of music, and in St. Elsewhere's Psychadelic Soul, I think I found it. For the most part this CD is unbelievably entertaining, and I love cruising to this CD. It's a great CD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I purchased this DVD after seeing the Serenity movie.  Initially I went to see Serenity the movie as it looked like 'Han Solo - The Movie' and I was pleasently surprised with what I saw and wanted to know more about the characters.  After doing a bit if research I found out about abd purchased Firefly the Series.  Firefly the series is excelent and develops the memorable characters (some of the best characters in recent TV) as they travel through the Firefly universe looking for or doing 'jobs'.  I look forward to any further development of this universe and charcters in hopefully another movie or series. Highly recommended.
B00006CXSS|5.0|It was the greatest WWII series or movie i have ever seen
B00000K3D4|4.0|I love this movie.  I've enjoyed it with my children and now am watching it with my grandchildren.  I think it's suitable for children over 6 years of age.
1592402038|4.0|A talented writer can enliven the most ordinary topic.  Lynne Truss has accomplished this with \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves.\\"<br /><br />If you are considering purchasing this book, take this simple test.  Read the following four quotations.  If you are intrigued, and especially if you resonate with Truss's passion for punctuation, I believe you will love this book:<br /><br />\\"If the satanic sprinkling of redundant apostrophes causes no little gasp of horror or quickening of the pulse, you should probably put down this book at once\\" (p. 1).<br /><br />\\"If there is one lesson to be learned from this book, it is that there is never a dull moment in the world of punctuation.\\" (p. 125).<br /><br />[The comma] \\"tears about the hillside of language, endlessly organising words into sensible groups and making them stay put: sorting and dividing; circling and herding; and of course darting off with a peremptory 'woof' to round up any wayward subordinate clause that makes a futile bolt for semantic freedom.  Commas, if you don't whistle at them to calm down, are unstoppably enthusiastic at this job\\" (p. 79).<br /><br />\\"In the family of punctuation, where the full stop [period] is the daddy and the comma is mummy, and the semicolon quietly practises the piano with crossed hands, the exclamation mark is the big attention-deficit brother who gets over-excited and breaks things and laughs too loudly\\" (pp. 137-138).<br /><br />Truss's book is engaging, charming, and funny.  However, a friend and I both experienced the same phenomenon: we ran out of enthusiasm before reaching Truss's own \\"full stop.\\"  But even if you don't finish the book, the glass will be left half full.
B0000004V2|1.0|I should have taken heed per Alan Williamson. I'd heard this band could be like Led Zeppelin.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|How could you give a movie 1 star that you fell asleep during the first 15 minutes watching, then waking up with only about 20-30 minutes before the 2 hour mark?  When you read a book do you just skim over the first 30 pages, then skip to the last 50?    V for Vendetta was by far one of the most powerful movies of 2006 (and up there with the most powerful movies ever for that matter)!  I actually fell asleep too during the beginning the first time I watched it because it was LATE and I was TIRED, but a few days later I started it from the beginning & was completely blown-away.  Maybe you should actually try watching it so you know what the hell it's about before you pass the rediculous and ignorant judgement that you have on this masterpiece & I'm sure that right after you're done watching VfV, you'll go right to your computer to edit your absurd review!      There are enough detailed reviews about VfV, so all I'm going to say is that I've truly believed for years that this is what we will be facing in the near future in our world with all of the greedy politicians out there who are doing a damn good job of conforming the masses & sadistically stringing them along with their propoganda like puppets on their fingertips.    To all the conformists out there:  Try questioning authority & thinking for yourself.  If you continue to go along with what you're told, just sit back and watch our freedoms slide further and further down the drain from all the power-trips...oops...I mean politics until our world is a spitting image of what it is depicted as in the year 2020 in VfV.  Look at all of the changes in our society in the last 15 years, and with the world changing faster and faster every year that passes...just imagine what we'll be facing in even the next 10 years if certain things don't change.  Instead of just writing off VfV with a closed mind & bad review, I highly suggest you watch it with an open mind & try thinking outside the box for once in your life.  What doyou have to lose other the brain-wash you've subjected yourself to ever since you could make decisions?!?

0679422714|2.0|I am no Mao fan; nor am I a Mao apologist.  There is no doubt that the Chinese people suffered greatly during the whims of Mao's reign, and that many people continue to suffer today.  However, my objections to this book is that it is painted as a scholarly work, and as it is one of the most biased histories I have ever read, I find that I view the whole work as flawed.<br /><br />There are many sweeping assumptions about Mao's motivations, gleaned from scant or small pieces of evidence, or interviews with third parties. Some of them seem so far fetched that I found myself cringing.<br /><br />I have read \\"Wild Swans\\" and enjoyed it as much as can be said for such a harrowing story.  However it is with this knowledge that I can see what the authors are trying to achieve with this book.  They do achieve it, and have stirred up considerable controversy with this work, but I feel some of the scholarly merit has been lost in the ranting.

0740748475|4.0|I recently bought this boxed set for my husband and he has enjoyed many hours of reading with lots of laughter. Although the volumes are rather heavy it is good light reading and he definitely recommends this set to anyone who is a fan of Calvin and Hobbes. What a shame that the Author does not produce this strip any more. A wonderful collection to have.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|This is clearly one of the most polarising of Jane Austen adaptations on film. Some viewers will love the genuinely moving acting, the authentically costumed characters, the beautiful scenery and sets, the incredible story-telling and the wonderfully subtle touches that abound in this film. Others will loathe the complete absence of makeup, the fact that Amanda Root is visibly older than 29, the slow and tender story, the use of natural lighting and the re-writing of the Mr Elliot sub-plot (including his unforgivably and casually cruel behaviour towards Mrs Smith).<br /><br />I acknowledge both of these views. Certainly Amanda Root does not enhance her natural sweet looks, and she does look a little too old for the part of Anne Elliot, but mon dieu, her acting! That is something else again. In terms of the emotional involvement and the ability to subtly create this gentle and loving character, no better actress could have been found. If only she'd  been permitted to \\"youthify\\" her looks a little... After all, in the novel she is described as a very pretty girl - although it's true her looks had faded somewhat, her appearance revives mid-way through the novel to the point where she has enough beauty to attract the admiration of passing gentlemen - but to be honest, I do prefer superb acting to superb looks, and that is why I find Amanda Root's portrayal so very moving and real.<br /><br />Ciar&aacute;n Hinds is excellent as Captain Wentworth, Anne's love whose proposal she rejected some years ago. He is not movie-star handsome, but a well-looking man whose serious demeanour is not cloaked by his occasional more lively ripostes. In personality and character, he is undeniably the right match for Ms Root's Anne. The interaction between the two of them is so gracefully subtle that it might be missed by viewers who expect a more obvious approach. He is very deliberately ignoring Anne, although with perfect politeness. More and more, the appreciative viewer will notice that there is a quite remarkable sensitivity between the two of them, and the beauty of Anne's character is so wonderfully brought out by Amanda Root's acting that the love between these two characters is truly and fully realised.<br /><br />The sub-plots are also superbly explicated. Anne's selfish and heedless father (Corin Redgrave) and monstrously insensitive and vain sister Elizabeth(Phoebe Nicholls), not to mention her laughably tiresome sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), are so well played that one becomes genuinely outraged on Anne's behalf as one sees their carelessly selfish behaviour. Mr Elliot (the brilliant Samuel West) doesn't really get enough storytime in this adaption, unfortunately - I do think the script didn't quite manage to include his motivations and personality well enough for a proper understanding of his character. But the wonderful Fiona Shaw is perfect in the role of Mrs Croft (Anne's put-upon friend who has fallen upon hard times), and Lady Russell (Anne's mentor) is just sheer delight in her well-meaning snobbery as played by Susan Fleetwood. I also found absolutely perfect the self-seeking Mrs Clay (Felicity Dean) and the thoroughly nice Charles Musgrove who, having been rejected by Anne, decided to wed Mary instead (very, very well played by Simon Russell Beale, who makes this sort of role look completely effortless).<br /><br />The look of this film is lovely in many ways. The lack of makeup may take some getting used to, but there's no denying it's authentic, and with such excellent acting from everyone involved, the dynamics of the film are unsurpassed.<br /><br />The truly magnificent singing of opera singer Rosa Mannion in one of the scenes is the first truly appropriate musical performance in any Jane Austen film. (All too often, the standard of singing or playing in this sort of film is clearly 'quite nice', but certainly not the result of natural talent honed by years of training - as would indeed have been the case with young ladiesof the genteel class. Or... if no natural talent was possessed, perhaps the young lady in question would learn the harp instead of singing. But music was an essential asset for any damsel of the period who had any pretensions at all to social graces.)<br /><br />To sum up: for those who want a film that is purely escapist, that is full of lovely-looking people floating about in 18th century clothing and that is \\"exciting\\" to watch, this is probably not a film that will appeal to you. For those, however, who are willing to plunge solely into the subtleties of this film and its beautifully moving performances, there will be great enjoyment for you.dies of the genteel class.

Sometimes, their Chinese university teachers show it to them in class. So, I thought I'd see why they love it so much. I'm still wondering. This is a two-page short story, not a film.

B00005ATQF|5.0|There was a point in the eighties and nineties when we were bombarded with Vietnam movies and Vietnam TV series. Overloaded with guilt about ignoring the war and its veterans, we went to the theaters and watched every awful flick Hollywood could churn out. I had a vague memory that FULL METAL JACKET was the best of this bunch. Yeah, I was right. It's excellent.<br /><br />If you've seen the film, of course you remember the drill sergeant. I could quote the first five minutes of his dialogue and bounce out of every mailbox with a spam filter. What do you figure? An hour of writing time for each minute of dialogue? Two hours per minute? You can't possibly take it all in at a single viewing. I have subtitles on the DVD, which is good because sometimes I laugh too loud to hear the words. The guy raised profanity to an art form.<br /><br />Boot camp was a powerful and accurate depiction of institutionalized abuse and manipulation. I know a lot of vets, 1940s through 1980s. They tell me this is real. It damn sure feels real. I won't let my inner cynic say anything about what the locals could learn from this DVD.<br /><br />But, this particular tragedy was only the first half of the film. Armed with whatever they learned in boot camp, they still had to go fight the war. This part of the film was also excellent. Jim Brown didn't run through a minefield or anything like that, but this film's probably more real.

B000BB1MI2|5.0|The film is delicious, and I don't even like chocolate.<br /><br />I brought some baggage along, since I suffered through that 70s (I think) Disneyed (I think) version in my childhood. Gawd, did that ever suck. Roald Dahl, meanwhile, is an author I spent a bit of time enjoying a few years ago. What he wrote for adults is brilliant. What he wrote for children is brilliant. He never talks down to anybody, which is part of his brilliance. Plus his way with words, plus the fact that I think he was absolutely nuts. In a good way, okay?<br /><br />As I watched this DVD, I saw a few bits that were modernized. Otherwise, it was impossible to tell which bits were Dahl and which were Tim Burton. And nobody cares. Nor should they. Tim Burton was born to turn a Roald Dahl masterpiece into a film. The spirit of the Dahl story, which I haven't read, was undoubtedly here. Damn, this movie is so much fun. I hate that my DVD (from China, not Amazon) has bad spots, meaning I had to skip a couple of segments. I'll find another copy, though, and watch it again. This is an instant classic.

B00005ASOC|5.0|I never get tired of watching this. Sean Connery is brilliant as a reclusive author. Rob Brown debuts as a high school student in the ghetto who is secretly a damn intelligent author in his own right. There's so much in this movie that's about writing and so much that isn't. Many themes I don't feel like spoiling, and you can find another review if you want plot spoilers. The writing is sharp, the language is clever, the characters are brilliantly portrayed, the dialogue is witty and observant, and the plot is surprisingly enjoyable to watch. F. Murray Abraham shines as a teacher I prefer not to emulate, and perhaps he got many of the best lines. This DVD is just perfect. Go get it.<br /><br />Oh, and let me talk about piracy. I bought my copy from Amazon. Region One only. China's Region Six. If I find a DVD player in China that will play only Region Six DVDs, then I've just been encouraged by the DVD people in the USA to buy a pirated DVD in China because that's the only way to watch the DVD here. In other words, this regional protection scheme encourages piracy. I hate that. As a retired software pirate who helped bankrupt the Commodore computer company, let me say that protection schemes never work because criminals can always get around them. They only inconvenience law-abiding citizens, which is what I'm trying to be now.
B000002UCN|5.0|sad but true.this album has 7 beatle songs on it,only a few of which he actualy wrote and 4 of his own stuff.starting off theres \\"something\\" from abbey road.he wrote that song and hit #1.pretty good for a guy who only wrote  a handful of beatle songs.it was written for patti harruson his then wife.when the beatles disbanded that parasite got with eric clapton who wrote 2 more hits for her \\"wonderful tonight\\" and \\"layla\\".anyhow,then theres some filler then another classic from abbey road called \\"here comes the sun \\".more filler,then \\"for you blue\\".i always liked that one even though it wasnt as pop as the others.the last beatle song is from \\"the white album\\".\\"while my guitar gently weeps\\".its beautiful.now right there,youve already got your moneys worth but he threw in a few of his own songs so itd be a best of george and not georges favorite beatle songs.so heres his tunes........\\"my sweet lord\\" dedicated to lord krsna.actualy some of the words he sings repetively is the krsna chant only in english.its a very pretty song.then he does a save the earth song with \\"give me love,give me peace on earth\\".it also is very inspiring.i forget \\"you\\".than theres a save the starving  people song called \\"bangla desh\\".its ok but its a reminder of how awful life can be so i usualy skip that one.\\"dark  horse\\" is pretty self explanatory and lastly theres \\"what is life?\\".another  trancendental type song.i think of the 4 beatles solo greatest hits albums,id rank this one 3rd.but hes still a beatle so 3rd still ranks in the spectacular.
B000274THQ|5.0|German with English subtitles. I'll summarize what's on the cover.<br /><br />Alex and his family live in East Germany. His mother, a devoted Communist, goes into a coma. When she awakens, the Berlin Wall has fallen, but Alex hides this from her. She still has a weak heart, and the shock of Capitalism might be too much.<br /><br />What a wonderful angle for approaching the reunification of Germany. A memorable blend of the dramatic and the comic. Not \\"laugh track\\" comic. Wit and a delicious sense of irony. Is that \\"East German humor\\" or just the filmmaker's sense of humor? Whatever it is, I love it. It's so unlike what I'm used to seeing.<br /><br />Also, lest we forget, I live in a country that has opened to the West and is, for the most part, communist only in name now, so I'd like to laud the realism. When East met West in Germany in 1989, at times they seemed to be from two different planets. It's not like that in China, although it probably was when Nixon came to town. This is a remarkable film, well worth watching.<br /><br />I've reviewed one other film about a pretense, by the way, but I didn't tell you about the pretense because I didn't want to spoil the surprise. It was LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, by an Italian director. In it, some Jews get sent to a concentration camp, but our hero convinces his son it's a voluntary trip to an exclusive holiday resort. Wow!<br /><br />To continue digressing, to such a degree that Dr Z might be proud, I started writing a book where my hero had a specific type of amnesia. He lost 18 years, I think it was. When asked who the president was, he answered Bush, but he meant the first one. My little joke. I really wanted to do the time warp here, and how you'd do things differently if you suddenly became the person you were 20 years ago. Then 9/11 came along. I didn't want to write about it. Plus, the original project was getting boring, so I just scrapped it.
B00026WUAU|3.0|this album,from 1978 was really kinda plain compared to most of dylans stuff.the really good songs here are \\"no time to think\\" and a sad song \\"is your love in vain?\\".its not bad just he could do so much better.
B00003CXC7|4.0|When I was a child, I got so sick of hearing how brilliant Alfred Hitchcock was. To the extent that I never watched any of his movies, if you can believe it. Well, this one's pretty damn cool. I really don't want to overanalyze all the techniques that our beloved director employed so well, lest I spoil the fun. The plot centers around a question. Did Raymond Burr kill his wife and chop her up with saw and knife? That's the impression injured Jimmy Stewart got from peeping through the windows. We had to throw in some subplots and have some fun as well, because of the length, and it's excellent in doing that. Almost everybody sends up himself or herself a little bit, and we have some laughs in addition to trademark suspense, and it's a great film.
B00000253N|4.0|this is one of those albums youre supposed to listen to all at once not track by track.anyhow,#1 is \\"tangled up in blue\\".im not sure what the moral to the story is but its a good song.the next 3 songs are ok but of listened to back to back are more enjoyable.the next song i really liked was \\"youre gonna make me lonesome when you go\\".the rest is just average.but averahe for dylan neans better than 95% of the stuff out there.
B0009X7664|4.0|{The only reason I gave it a mere four stars is that the book got five.}<br /><br />My earlier review of the book amounted to little more than \\"rah rah rah, go read this!\\" Now let me go into some more detail. The story is excellent on many levels, and it's a bit more complex than a retelling of the plot would indicate. \\"Black man accused of raping white girl in the Depression era.\\" That's the court case that drives some of Harper Lee's novel. Gregory Peck won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of attorney Atticus Finch, one of literature's most memorable characters. And yet, in the novel, Atticus isn't the main character. This book is about his daughter Scout and his son Jem. Scout is our narrator, and what we see (and don't see) comes from her.<br /><br />So how did this translate to the big screen? Quite well. The child actors, both newcomers, were excellent in their roles. Ditto on the boy who portrayed Dill, whose part was far larger in the novel but which is good in the film as well. The book had a large number of plots and subplots, so the filmmakers had to strip some away to make it work as a movie. They chose well. The results are still as complex and multi-textured as life itself.<br /><br />I watched this maybe a month after reading it, so I remembered 90% of what would happen, along with much of what was deleted. I doubt the movie could have been done much better than it was, and I'll watch it again. I'm aware of all the \\"deep dark Southern secrets\\" from the novel, those that were in the film and those that weren't. I got a strong sense that the actors were equally aware, and that's cool. Nobody could fit them all into a film that lasts under 2 hours, so they only chose the most relevant. This is how it should be. I very love this film, as we say in China, and it'll probably be in my DVD collection until I die.<br /><br />Oh, and this is purely coincidental. Later in this newsletter you'll see \\"The One-Plot Wonder,\\" which I wrote over a year ago but chose to rerun. I made this decision long before watching TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. But this book, and this movie, are a fantastic example of what I'm talking about. It has many plots. It's what we should aspire to every time we write.ar ago but chose to rerun.

B00003CXCD|4.0|Recommended to me by students here in China who probably didn't understand any of the word play. Back in the days of black-and-white Hollywood movies, they were masters of romantic comedy. Here's one.<br /><br />Gregory Peck was simply fantastic. I'd never seen him before. (Gasp!) It also introduced Audrey Hepburn. I know almost nothing about her career (gasp!), but I'd say she had more ability as a newcomer than a lot of veterans ever achieve.<br /><br />A simple premise executed almost flawlessly. Princess runs away from the spotlight and finds love with a commoner while hiding her identity. It begins with subtle humor, progresses to highly visual humor, then turns serious because there is a dilemma at its heart. Two hours may have been a wee bit too long, but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />In its day, I'm sure filming everything on location in Rome was a big selling point. It's not in color, but great cinematography is a joy forever.
B00026WU4G|4.0|the opening song here was  the epic \\"jokerman\\".its really a beautiful and wonderful song.then the raspy dylan comes out for another great song,\\"sweetheart like you\\".those 2 songs saved this album from a 3 star rating due to thier masters in awesome.
B0001XALTG|5.0|Ewan McGregor joins another fine ensemble cast.<br /><br />It's always been fashionable to say everything has been written/said/filmed/whatever before. As an author/reading junkie/movie buff, sometimes I start to believe it. Then a film like this comes along and kicks me squarely on my ample backside. Humor that's dark, witty, wicked, gritty, accurate. Based on a novel by someone with a true appreciation of, and a gift for, the language. No hesitation to smack you hard with the grim reality of heroin addiction.<br /><br />You're groaning. I can tell. You're thinking this is such a stale subject that it only proves my opening premise. But, you're wrong. Yet another keeper. Maybe I'll stay out of the DVD stores and let my lovely wife keep buying the films. I ignored this one for years because the cover's so ugly.<br /><br />I'm sure the novel was fantastic, and I know it must be damn hard to translate such novels to the screen because we've seen so many failures. But with a great screenwriter plus the right production team and actors, it can be done. It has been done. If you spot this, consider picking it up. But do read the reasons it's rated R. It's not for the kids.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|this album was good from beginning to end.it silenced the critics that hadnt shut up in years,he made a really good album ending his slump of so so  albums.he segued from  the hippie/folkster into the burned out genius we loved from the 60s only now it was the 90s.the album was an important bridge in his career and the most listenable album since nashville skyline.32 years earlier.
B0002XNT0I|2.0|Denzel Washington is probably my favorite actor. Even in that dog of a movie called THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, he shone. Tom Hanks? Well, lemme quit hating the guy. This is a well-intentioned movie, Tom did a creditable job, and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Antonio Banderas fly in the face of his Latino studliness by playing a gay guy. A passionate one, though, since he's still a Latino, after all.<br /><br />Actually, this is a Hollywood \\"message movie,\\" and you know what that means. It's about as subtle as Michael Moore. Those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours. Those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie, those who don't agree with the message, stay as far away from it as possible.<br /><br />There's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with AIDS boy. The way they stared at him reminded me of \\"lao wei in China\\" experiences. Denzel's character was reminded of segregation, even though he's too young to remember it, and started to care about Tom Hanks' character.<br /><br />AIDS discrimination is bad. Actually, any discrimination at all is bad. And that's the movie's message. I agree with the message, but still. That's all we've got.<br /><br />As a totally irrelevant non-sequiter, if the name \\"Sam Francisco\\" means anything to you, you've seen subtle commentary on discrimination.<br /><br />I love a great courtroom drama. This one was merely good. With so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film, they had to take a few shortcuts here. Sad, ain't it? But even so, a well-intentioned film that I'm glad I saw. Once. Not twice. Once is enough, thank you.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|Horror not being my favorite genre, this one ws pretty good, until it got really gory toward the end.  I laughed out loud at the scene where Rose had to pass through the group of nurses who were arranged in line-dance formation, when they turned around en masse and staggered toward her.  My son said, \\"What's so funny?\\" I said \\"ITS JUST LIKE THRILLER!!!! How CAMPY can you get?\\"  Worth watching the whole movie just for that scene! Special features were really good, also.
B00028HBKM|1.0|The acting was fine, but I fail to see the point. We've got a guy with a thorny crown, covered with blood, hauling a cross. He falls down. Evil Roman soldiers beat him for falling down. He gets up and hauls it some more. He falls down again. They beat him again. Etc. I just don't understand why we need to see anyone, Jesus Christ or anybody else, taking such an ass kicking. What was it, 90 minutes out of 100? We need some more story here, Mel. I was glad when Jesus died so I could change the channel. Oh, there was a brief resurrection. Two seconds, sunlight through a hole in his hand, Michael resisting the urge to make a horrible joke about eating M&Ms this close to Easter Sunday.
B000066744|3.0|Fresh off popping a boring movie out of the player, I popped in this one. The premise is that a boy was born on a ship in 1900 and never set foot on land, truly a man without a country. The recreations of those olden days were simply a pleasure to behold. As in, the sets and the clothes. Tim Roth is talented, watchable and likeable. A brief appearance by Clarence Williams III is definitely a highlight of this film. Many years after THE MOD SQUAD, it's nice to see him having a bit of a career renaissance with a different generation of viewers.<br /><br />The cover bills this as \\"a fable,\\" and it is. I could comment on how the ship is a metaphor for the \\"average\\" life, blah blah blah. It's an old metaphor, perhaps one that worked in the novel. In the film, it was a surface little speech at the end. In essence, this film was about as boring as the one I started watching before it, yet I only saw 30 minutes of the first and the full two hours of this. What's the difference? I love the sound of a piano played by a master, preferably of the fast variety. Our protagonist was written as a prodigy, and I loved it whenever \\"he\\" played.<br /><br />Incidentally, when I found myself showing THE FIRM to three groups of students in two days, this is how I kept my sanity. I closed my eyes and listened to the piano player.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|These guys finally put together a bunch of good songs. I think this is their best effort since Vs.
B00003CX95|2.0|Mel Gibson as a medieval Scottish Rambo. I spent the first hour waiting for something to happen, and when it finally did I found it difficult to care. The second hour had me laughing where it was supposed to, and I learned that the great thing about kilts is you can moon the British army. Hundreds of bare white backsides, or frontsides if you prefer. The third hour was a bit long. This was a loaner, and I fast-forwarded through all the action scenes, so it wasn't so bad. Since so many of my students write about it, I guess I had to watch it. I solved some crossword puzzles at the same time.
0385483821|2.0|Contrary to popular opinion on this website, I found this book to be boring, repetitive and badly written. It was so boring I struggled to finish it during a journey where I had little else to do. This book summarizes a few events that were significant to Intel and offers advice on how similar business changes should be handled. Being an engineer, and not a manager, I found this to be vague and rambling. However I do agree with the book's title - Only the Paranoid survive. I think this outlook is useful for everyone, and not just business types.
B00005K3OT|2.0|Highly acclaimed. That, I knew. I watched the first 30 minutes, which is 1/4 of the movie, before I decided to hang it up. New lady moves into a conservative French town and opens a chocolate shop. This upsets the local church, even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate. Okay. Can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot? Nope. This one's boring.
0743267478|3.0|All in all a worthy effort.  The premise is very creative, and on that merit alone it's worth a go at this book.  Yes, there are extraordinary coincidences throughout the plot, but that goes with the territory.<br /><br />The characters are touching, though I did find in many circumstances that they seemed more than a little cliched.  I am curious as to Mr. Swarup's research process for this book.  Did he merely pass through the shantytowns of India, or did he work hard to understand the people therein?  A good interview question for any journalist or fan to ask of him should the chance arise.<br /><br />The prose is rather basic, but after all it is a first-person account of the main character.  While the character does claim to have a working knowledge of the English language, he will never be confused for a highly educated native speaker.  Therefore, I can excuse the quality of language, as anything overly florid would have come across as disingenuous.<br /><br />As for the literary merit of the text: this is nothing more than an imaginative story, well told.  Looking for hidden meaning in prose that will never achieve greatness is a wasted effort.  You can enjoy this book without dissecting its literary value.  The world needs blockbuster entertainment as much as it needs high-falutin' artistry.  This book is the former.<br /><br />This is a good end-of-summer, transit-through-airport read.  A fine first effort for Mr. Swarup.  Imaginative and touching, if not overly literary.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|It's about how James Barrie wrote a play I've spent a lifetime avoiding. PETER PAN. The movie is awesome. Johnny Depp is awesome. Life is awesome when you can kick back and enjoy something like this. Gorgeous cinematography, top-notch acting, kids I don't want to kick on sight, character development and themes that matter, with a light touch that assumes the viewer isn't stupid. I'll watch it again.
B000002L99|5.0|David Lee Roth exits...Sammy Hagar enters. <br /> <br />There was arguably no bigger change in lead singers in rock and roll history. This was the band's first album with Sammy, and somewhat surprisingly, it became a huge hit, going platinum six times to date and featuring several huge hits. <br /> <br />Now, I'm a relatively new fan of Van Halen, and being an 18 year old in 2006, I'm not the person to go to when a Sammy/Dave debate erupts because, well, I really didn't live it. I like both versions of the band differently...with Dave, the band was much more about \\"show\\" than artistic brilliance, while with Sammy, the band displayed more of a melodic, flowing sound with more of a pop beat to it. <br /> <br />5150 is an album that really includes a lot of different qualities. In some instances, like on \\"Good Enough\\" and \\"Get Up,\\" you'll notice many of the same sounds and apects that would be on a typical Roth-era tune. In other areas, such as \\"Why Can't This Be Love,\\" \\"Dreams,\\" and \\"Love Walks In,\\" the band expands on their dimensions by including a more pop-heavy beat, with Eddie's work on keyboard becoming as prominent as his always-brilliant guitar playing. Add in a couple of solid rockers like \\"Summer Nights\\" and \\"Best of Both Worlds,\\" a meaningful title track, and the party sounds of \\"Inside,\\" and you have an excellent album from top to bottom. <br /> <br />The Sammy Hagar-era of Van Halen will always shine brightest on 5150 because it really touches upon so many different things musically. If you're a newcomer to Van Halen and want to really explore both eras, this is a great way to start on the Sammy Hagar side of things. <br /> <br />Trust me, you're likely to enjoy it.
B00003CXA2|5.0|In my mind, I had the bare bones of a scathing review that would showcase my slyness and writing skill. I was ready to hate this movie. Dumb guy juxtapositioned into great moments in history? Life is like a box of chocolates? Tom Hanks? Much to hate. However, I enjoyed it. If you ever see a guy in a white suit waiting for a bus, don't sit with him or he'll tell you his life story. I jest. It's a fine movie.<br /><br />My dislike of Tom Hanks goes way back to a sitcom called BOSOM BUDDIES, built on the unbelievable premise that the only way these two guys could find an apartment was to dress as women. What I noticed, week after week, was that Tom Hanks' lack of talent dragged down Peter Scolari. I've also seen Hanks in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE GREEN MILE and APOLLO 13, and he did nothing in any of them to raise my opinion of him.<br /><br />(APOLLO 13 works because a skilled ensemble cast and a wooden \\"hero\\" to lead them can be a highly effective device. Schwarzeneggar built a career on this, and I don't fault him for it.)<br /><br />But I can't conceive of anyone except Hanks as Forrest, Forrest Gump. He was excellent. I'm also proud that I immediately recognized the young actor from THE SIXTH SENSE when he was but a brief flash of hair. He has a presence that we'll enjoy for many years.<br /><br />The marketing department dropped the ball on this movie. They made it sound like I'd learn some deep life lessons from a guy with half my IQ. An offensive premise, and I don't even believe in IQ tests. It's not like that at all. It's such an unusual juxtaposition (there's that word again) that nobody knew how to pitch it accurately. Sometimes it's like that. We're authors. We know this better than anyone. I may hunt down the book.
B00006V9A0|2.0|Nirvana's deepest desire was to be indie rock, and appreciated as such. To be more than a trendy, ultracommercial mega-band with predictably loud, thrashy songs with a slick production, ready for the radio. They were punk rock. They were anti-establishment, anti-corporate, and -- to their ultimate destruction -- anti-fame, fortune, and stardom.  <br /> <br />What is \\"Nirvana\\", the album? <br />It is a record that tempts a dedicated fan into purchasing a CD for one song. Not very Nirvana, is it? But then, it's not Nirvana. It's Courtney Love. But that's another story. <br /> <br />As a record, it doesn't hold up THAT badly. Admittedly, the song selection, though composed of Nirvana's best-known songs, doesn't run together very well. Also, the inclusion of one or two live acoustic performances (depending on which edition you buy) towards the end is jarring, no matter how good the actual tracks are. Besides, how can anyone even consider running \\"Bleach\\", \\"Incesticide\\", \\"Nevermind\\", \\"In Utero\\", and, of all the moronic things to do, \\"MTV Unplugged in New York\\" together, and think it would pay off? Well, PAY off it will, but that doesn't mean it WORKS. And the one unreleased track (officially unreleased, mind you: heavily bootlegged, albeit the demos and live performances were of poor quality) is slotted into the opener's spot, rather than \\"About a Girl\\", which belongs there. It should be LAST. It's obvious. Isn't it? <br /> <br />And as for it being an introduction to Nirvana ... nah, not so much. It's jarring and nonsensical as far as the tracklist goes ... \\"Incesticide\\" is the most accurate picture of Nirvana, circa 1987-1993, showcasing all aspects of their musicianship, except for their subtle acoustic works. Even if the odds 'n' sods collection was released in '91, it still tells the entire story of Nirvana's music until \\"Unplugged\\", \\"In Utero\\" being more back-to-basics than a step forward (certainly a step forward from \\"Nevermind\\", though). As for hooking someone,which is a different deal altogether, \\"Nevermind\\" is the only word I care to use. <br /> <br />So, there's a new track, \\"You Know You're Right\\"; a track from \\"Bleach\\", two from \\"Incesticide\\", four from \\"Nevermind\\", and four from \\"In Utero\\"; one from \\"MTV Unplugged in New York\\", and a bonus track from same if you're lucky. That's 14 or 15 songs. And Nirvana songs are brief. Very brief. This is no longer than a regular LP, and I'm talking big black dinnerplates here.  <br /> <br />As another manifestation of the punk rock ethos of Nirvana, a multitude of great songs were held from LPs and released as B-sides, and performed at radio appearances, that ARE NOT PRESENT. It is not explicitly stated whether this is a greatest hits compilation or a best of. If it's the hits, then I have two points to make:  <br />a) Well, fine. But since when did \\"About a Girl\\", \\"Sliver\\", \\"Been a Son\\", \\"Dumb\\" or \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" ever chart? And <br />b) Why not just make a best of? <br /> <br />\\"Aneurysm\\" is missing from this disc. And that WAS released as a single, and hit something like No. 7 or No. 11, too. Posthumously, yes, but so was \\"You Know You're Right\\". And all the wasted space ... little over half the CD is used, and Nirvana had tons of great material! Where is \\"Polly\\"? \\"Breed\\"? \\"Scentless Apprentice\\"? \\"Dive\\"? \\"Stay Away\\"? \\"Om a Plain\\"? \\"Something in the Way\\"? \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle\\"? It WOULD HAVE FIT. Most of it, anyway. Miss out a track or two, likely just one, and I haven't even mentioned \\"Old Age\\" or \\"Verse Chorus Verse\\", both officially unreleased tracks, and both equal to or better than \\"You Know You're Right\\".  <br /> <br />Wait a minute. Why's it a single disc at all? <br />A double-disc compilation is required. <br /> <br />But stop. <br />This was unnecessary. Hence the title of this vitriolic piece. Where is the box set, Courtney? Well, it's here now, but two years after the release of THIS. And what THIS is ... can't be posted.  <br /> <br />The album quotes Kurt Cobain, the man himself, saying he loved albums that delivered good song after good song after good song. But though \\"Nirvana\\" manages that without barely trying, it's still preferable to listen of the original records, for the thematic cohesiveness, and because they delivered song after brilliant song just as well, and made more sense, too. \\"Nevermind\\" is a lesser album than \\"In Utero\\", but its tracklist is a succession of diamonds. And as shiny as diamonds, too. \\"In Utero\\" is, as a whole, an experience. <br /> <br />\\"Nirvana\\" is lifeless. If there had been a trace of the real band somewhere within this release, it would probably be halfway salvaged already. For one thing, Krist or Dave (and Kurt wouldn't allow a compilation at all, probably) would stop to think before pairing the dirty grunge of \\"Bleach\\" with the power pop of \\"Incesticide\\" with the furious but slick punk rock of \\"Nevermind\\" with the blasted soundscapes of \\"In Utero\\" with the laid-back, subtle textures of \\"MTV Unplugged in New York\\" with the bass-laden, Sabbath-riffing of \\"You Know You're Right\\". <br /> <br />An end to the exploitation of a dead man and his legacy! <br />You think Kurt's death would mean he would be honored more? No, it doesn't. It only goes to show that dead men can't resist at all. And if Kurt's legacy isn't being honored, what the hell can he do about it?
B00005ATQ9|4.0|I suspect most readers have a list of authors who they've heard of, and perhaps even quoted, but never read. My list includes William Makepeace Thackeray. However, now I've seen the film. I recommend it highly. 1975, directed by Stanley Kubrick, starring Ryan O'Neal and some folks with talent.<br /><br />This is a sweeping story of one man's life in the 18th century. A poor Irish lad aspires to English aristocracy, whereas the author enjoys skewering that aristocracy. Thackeray's narrative is featured in the film, and it's a delight. Wry wit, lovely understatement, satiric and sly with only a hint of cynicism. Cynicism's gloomy. We can be perceptive without it. Well, I can't, but Thackeray can. I love it.<br /><br />During the 90 minutes before the intermission, I was astounded by Ryan O'Neal's lack of range. But hey, he looked pretty and he remembered his dialogue. This is an ensemble piece, so no more was needed from him. However, in the second 90 minutes, he grew into the part. That was more impressive than his hair.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick was almost invisible. He let Thackeray's writing and the actors' acting do all the talking. Since that was the best way to present this, Kubrick impressed me yet again. There's a reason this film won four Oscars, and I highly recommend it.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Great album. Big up to Stephen Marley who produced this.. and in my opinion easily the most talented Marley, its a shame he hasn't released an album on his own. I know that people call this \\"reggae\\" but it really isn't! If you want real contemporary roots reggae check out Midnite, Bambu Station, Dezarie, Willmore Daniel and Ras Shiloh. The style is distinct from bands like the Wailers or the Abyssinians but just as edgy. If you think Damian Marley is good wait until you hear Vaughn Benjamin, Jalani Horton or the ethereal Dezarie. Even check out Talkin' Roots, the best ever reggae compilation of all time! no kidding.  <br /> <br />Peace.
B0001XAPX8|2.0|A professor notes that, five weeks into the semester, two students have never appeared in his class. He asks if they are spooks, as in ghosts. But they happen to be black, so this professor (Anthony Hopkins) is sacked. You lost me that quickly. There is no credibility in this premise.<br /><br />Furthermore, he happens to be a black man masquerading as a Jew, and he later falls into an affair with Nicole Kidman, who is a poor young janitor illiterate. Or so I've read in a review somewhere.<br /><br />Which boundaries are stronger? Old and young? Rich and poor? Educated and uneducated? Black and white? People who watch this movie and Michael LaRocca?<br /><br />Yep. I gave up in 10 short minutes. This is too heavy-handed, obvious, Hollywood, blunt force trauma. Give them a good cause, and a novel by Philip Roth, and they can ruin it in a hurry. Damn.

B0001Z52RU|3.0|I've never seen Fitzcarroldo, one of many Werner Herzog masterpieces, but this is the story of all the difficulties he faced in filming it. This film was filmed by Les Blank, not Werner Herzog. Burden of Dreams is positively fascinating, and Werner Herzog is a compelling presence who you simply must love. He filmed Fitzcarroldo in the Amazon jungle for over five years, and the story of how he did it is gripping. Bonus material involves him eating his shoes, looking back at all this 20 years later, and some other cool stuff. Get this one. Do it now.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Is this band part of some Aussie invasion?  First Jet comes along, get airplay but are really throwbacks to great 70s rock.  Now Wolfmother comes along, sounding like Led Zep... and I'm blown away.  I don't think I've heard any band carry the Led Zep torch better than these guys.  I love it.  Screw marketing, merchandising deals, movies, gangsta clothes, fragrances sold by the artists, a line of clothing, etc, this is just great rock with no BS. <br /> <br />To get a sense of their sound, definately think of Led Zep, Sabbath, and some Deep Purple, mixed together.  These guys rival them all.  Several folks have called them ripoffs.  Maybe, but I think if you had to pick bands to ripoff, you could do a lot worse than ripping off those three bands, and these guys do it with class. <br /> <br />If you like bands more modern bands like the White Stripes or Raconteurs, like Jet or early Clutch, you'll love this.
6305648522|4.0|Another three-hour monster covering most of a man's life. Actually, the life of a special friendship between a projector operator in an old theater and a wonderfully naughty ten-year-old boy. It alternates between the amusing and the sad, as life will do, and you'll think about it after it's over.<br /><br />Writer/director Giuseppe Tornatore has an excellent visual sense. He must, if I noticed it. Also, he has a very obvious love of old movies, and I wonder just how much of this is autobiographical. The truth doesn't matter. The ability to make me wonder is the point. Character-based stories do that. I've been preaching it to novelists for years.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I tried to buy a Swivel Sweeper after seeing an ad. on TV. The advertisement was two for the price of one. When I called to place my order it was an automated system to which I foolishly (and to my regret) put in all my details. (Well putting in my credit card number gave them everything they wanted to know, name, address and telephone number). Then the automated voice told me I would receive ONE Swivel Sweeper for $39.95 it was NOT as advertised on TV so I said \\"NO\\" (it gives you that option) but then, after hanging up, I started to panic that I had submitted all this information and I wanted to make sure it had been deleted since I have already had my identity stolen once. <br /> <br />So I went to their website, I found at least three different telephone numbers for Swivel Sweeper and two for Ontel Products, I also found two ways to contact them by email.  I tried them all.  <br /> <br />\\"Customer Service\\" is a misnomer with this company there is NONE.  <br /> <br />All the telephone numbers were either automated or no reply, that includes the Ontel office numbers as well. The emails I sent, one using an online form and the other addressed to help@ontelproducts.com received no reply.   <br /> <br />Keep away from this company..........    <br /> <br />I am very worried about the security risk and cannot help wondering how many people have access to my credit card information now.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Wow, I love the look of the first five minutes. It took me that long to determine the audio was in Russian only. I think this can only happen in China, folks. Back to the DVD store for me.<br /><br />(8 months later...)<br /><br />I went to a DVD store that doesn't sell pirated copies. Triple the price, perfectly legal, royalties to the authors and such. Wow, I love the look of the first five minutes. It took me that long to determine the audio and the subtitles were Chinese only. Hmm. One day I'll return to the land of illegal DVDs and find an English copy. Again, the powers that be force me to pirate. The business model is flawed, folks.<br /><br />(English at last...)<br /><br />I've spent 30 or so years of my life wasting my money on films based on comic books. Have you? If so, it's because you were hoping to see this film. You've been disappointed most of your life, same as me. But, at last, here it is. I have no desire to reiterate all its strengths, because others have done it before. I bet you, my readers, have already seen this film. But if not, well, find a way to see it right now. You'll love it the way I do. Yes you will. There is no way they could make it better. None.
1932100660|5.0|I'm so incredibly happy to see that a book like this has been published.  I've been on a vegan diet for two years prior to reading this, and my health, body, and mind have been in better shape than ever.  I have more energy, my weight stays pretty consistent and no more knee pain after running!  My husband switched at the same time and his allergies while still present, are MUCH better.  Both of my vegan kids are incredibly healthy too and rarely get sick.  I've been onto this information for awhile now how whole foods, plant-based diets are beneficial to health (as well as the environment, and let's not forget animals).  But it's nice to see the scientifically-proven evidence presented in this book.  It makes me so angry that the dairy, meat and egg industries spend so much money to brainwash the public into thinking their products are healthy so that they can increase their revenue, even though they are well aware that their products have been shown to damage health.  I really wish every single person would read this book to benefit their health, and especially the health of their children!!!!
B0006J28L4|5.0|I haven't seen this DVD in China. I ordered it from Amazon, USA, shipping costs out the wazoo and I don't care.<br /><br />The very sight of this film's title probably made some readers cringe. It's also possible that saying the wrong thing about it will make people unsubscribe. Those are two reasons, right there, why the story is relevant. Anyone who can stir up that much controversy is surely worth hearing. As authors, most of us spend our lives spouting for all we're worth and hoping somebody -- anybody -- feels our words. Malcolm X had listeners. Yes he did.<br /><br />I laughed out loud several times. This matters. It's not just some dark (forgive the bad pun) movie about oppression and such. It's about life in an exciting and sometimes frightening time, and about some folks who liked to have fun, and just very cool in general. This ain't a freaking documentary. Well, it is, but at the same time it ain't. It's quite an enjoyable bio about a quite interesting guy. One who shares my initials of ML, but that's quite irrelevant.<br /><br />This film is not only about the words that came out of Malcolm X's mouth. I respect his mind, and I was pleased to hear what he had to say, whether I agreed or not. His words gave me plenty to think about. Often I did agree, but that's just me. That's only part of what this film is about. It's about one man's extraordinary journey, in pursuit of truth, whatever the hell that is. I've spent my life questing after that myself, without the added burden of followers and such.<br /><br />I know that director Spike Lee has perhaps rubbed some folks the wrong way. Myself included. Deliberately, too, which I respect. But not here. This story is far too important. I have nothing but respect for everyone involved with it. Denzel, of course. He became Malcolm. Alex Haley, author of the biography that I own but have not yet read. (I will!) So many actors and actresses that I recognized and appreciated. Excellent soundtrack, of course.<br /><br />What did I know about Malcolm before I saw this film? Nothing. We don't talk about him where I grew up, except perhaps to spread a few horribly wrong lies. I choose not to repeat them. You've probably heard them, and if you haven't, I don't want you hearing them from me.<br /><br />I was stunned to learn that Malcolm was, in fact, a walking talking breathing stereotype. He was a gangsta, plain and simple. Nothing to lose, brilliant, and just mean as all get-out. Eat your heart out Snoop Dogg, and Malcolm dressed better than Deion Sanders to boot. Then prison, militant racist Islam, betrayal, pilgrimage, and finally the realization that Islam is neither militant nor racist. The guys in this story never overcame sexism, but not even science fiction does that.<br /><br />Spike Lee made this film in 1992. I don't know if he could do it today. Hating Muslims has become quite fashionable, has it not? This really does piss me off, even though Islam may be the only religion I haven't subscribed to at some point. I guess intolerance of any sort pisses me off.<br /><br />This film is very relevant, very moving, very important. Will I watch it again? Damn straight. I don't feel I can use it in a classroom because it'd take me too long to explain it all. But for you in the West, my \\"mandatory\\" list is very short. This film is on it.urse.  <br /> <br />What did I know about Malcolm before I saw this film? Nothing. We don't talk about him where I grew up, except perhaps to spread a few horribly wrong lies.

B000AWYOGE|3.0|It's a rather good remake although it's not as frightening as the original.<br /><br />Walter Salles did a good job at re-writing the story so it can fit the Americans' taste. Unfortunately, it looks as if he tried to give explanations where we needn't them, whereas sometimes the story gets so much complicated that you don't know what's true or not (if it's Jennifer Connelly's character's imagination or reality).<br /><br />So please watch the original instead which is one of the best horror films of the last twenty years, or if you want to take a look at this one, watch it first and then the original. Keep the best one for last!
B00005JNNZ|3.0|Dear God in Heaven, I'm watching something that's popular in the USA right now. What are the odds?<br /><br />Ken Carter rides his gleaming Mercedes into the stereotypical ghetto of MTV films and teaches a basketball team how to win games, become scholars, and quit acting like a bunch of damn hoodlums. \\"Based on a true story.\\" One of these ghetto school movies comes along about every five years, and they're always based on a true story, and they always end with \\"Thank you, teacher, for saving me from myself.\\"<br /><br />Okay, that was kind of cruel. Not wrong, though. This incarnation of our savior is Samuel L. Jackson, who I have much respect for. Shaved head, voice like John Amos, eyes like Mike Singletary. So far so good. John Amos is also a fine actor, and I bet some NFLers still have nightmares about Mike Singletary's eyes.<br /><br />Rob Brown, who debuted in FINDING FORRESTER as an intelligent, good-hearted high school basketball player stuck in a bad neighborhood, returns as an intelligent, good-hearted high school basketball player stuck in a bad neighborhood. Hey, play to your strengths. He also gets his girlfriend pregnant. Oops. Slam dunk, baby!<br /><br />If kids grow up watching and emulating these stereotypes, at what point does portraying a stereotype become portraying realism? I don't know, but this movie certainly wanders into that territory. A token white guy, a token Hispanic, a token Asian, no decent parts for the ladies, many MTV moments and an urban contemporary soundtrack I bet the rappers fought to be a part of. But hey, if that's what everybody's watching anyway, why not make a movie like that with a message worth hearing?<br /><br />This is a feel-good story that offers no surprises. You can see the ending, more or less, coming two hours away. Further proof that Hollywood doesn't do subtle. But even so, I'm glad the movie's doing well, and if you rent or buy it you'll watch it all the way through.
B000AWYOG4|2.0|In similar vein to The Grudge and The Ring (penned by the same author as this yarn), Dark Water is a Hollywoodised (for that read watered-down) take on a fairly stylish Asian original horror. <br /> <br />Whilst not only lacking the class of the original, Dark Water also suffers from being quite a weak and formulaic ghost story.  I mean come on! We can all surely guess what's happened to the missing girl after the first 15 minutes and how many times has the old \\"invisible friend\\" routine been trotted out before?   <br /> <br />There are no real shocks along the way - just a mildly creepy atmosphere and I'm surprised this was 15 rated.  I've seen scarier PGs! <br /> <br />On the plus side, Pete Postlethwaite as the flats' handyman harboring a terrible secret and the little girl Ceci (Ariel Gade) put in very convincing performances.  The material here isn't really strong enough to make their sterling efforts truly memorable though. <br /> <br />Disappointing. <br /> <br />
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|I love the original, and I've heard good things about this one. I saw enough to learn the subtitles are unreadably Chinglish, and that I won't understand the dialogue unless it's loud. The video is low quality, as if some guy pirated it with a camera in a theater. So I'm going to pick another time to watch it. I'm not in the mood tonight.<br /><br />It starts outside prison, which never happened in the original, and with Adam Sandler being difficult to watch as usual. If you've seen this, and if you love the NFL the way I do, tell me the truth. Is this crap?<br /><br />Oh, and let me share the cover blurb with you. \\"Protect is a red very a fit of occupation rugby contestant ever, but was closed into because of a certain reason jail. The jail grows the cool love rugby, however born nature Endure. He hires the exclusively those excel the jail that play the rugby, letting them proceeding with prisoners' game.\\" Yeah, I think Roger Ebert wrote that.<br /><br />** UPDATED SEVERAL MONTHS LATER AFTER SEEING THE CORRECT DVD **<br /><br />The first eight minutes reminded me why I hate Adam Sandler. Actually, I didn't need that long. That's just how long it took to end the drunken party of a sort that only happens (I hope) in Hollywood movies with overworked stereotypes, and the car chase with cops who are overworked stereotypes. And Adam Sandler, himself an overworked stereotype portraying a character who is yet another overworked stereotype. Convinced that this was the only scene he and his peeps felt compelled to splice onto the original movie, all of which happens IN PRISON, I ejected the DVD and got back to it three days later.<br /><br />Segment three begins with Sandler's arrival in prison. However, it isn't a real prison. It only exists in Hollywood movies. It's where they lock up the cliches. I waded through ten more boring minutes of prison guard violence, brutal crotch hits and so-called wisecracks. The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared.<br /><br />\\"The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared.\\" I never thought I'd type those words.<br /><br />At last, the movie. What came before was backstory in the original film. I dunno why they felt they had to show it now when they were only going to tell it later, since it was too boring to show. Oh well.<br /><br />When this film got down to the football itself, that's when it got real. This one isn't for the girlie girls, okay? Since there were many NFL players in this film, football is what they know. Kinda surprising the prison wasn't more realistic, though, since many NFL players know that subject as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed the hell out of its juvenile humor in a testosterone-charged way. I appreciate what it has to say about football, prisons, violence, and whatever else it's on about. How brutal was the original? So brutal that this one was less so in spots. They tinkered with a few bits, but in a good way. A homage not a copy, they say. I agree. It's excellent. I'll keep it and watch it again, skipping the first 20 minutes or so, and I'll love the hell out of it. It's a damn shame to think everything else Sandler makes will probably suck like the parts of this movie I'll keep skipping./> <br />\\"The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared.\\" I never thought I'd type those words.  <br /> <br />At last, the movie.

B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, and more other talent than I can remember. But who cares? The story's the thing.<br /><br />If you set out to write something that takes no risks whatsoever, you can write a Garfield comic strip. Tim Burton could never do that. He takes risks, communicates his ideas, and makes you think. You must suspend more disbelief for him than any other director I can think of, but it's usually worth the effort. BIG FISH seemed to be faithful to a novel, and it also seemed to be quite slow at first. But it was laying the groundwork. You'll enjoy this strange movie, and you'll think about it after it's over.<br /><br />Oh, one of the themes on the surface of BIG FISH was that dad was a teller of tall tales, his son wanted to know the real him, and it was damn hard to sort the truth from the fiction. As I was editing RISING FROM THE ASHES, allegedly about my childhood, I had no idea what I remembered and what I made up. The stories we tell ourselves...
B000G759LW|5.0|What a refreshing sound.  This album has something for everyone. With this album, Christina toys around with the sounds of blues and jazz along with the pop sound of today.  She pulls it off well. Christina was executive producer on this album and co-wrote all of the songs. Way to go for her!!!  For anyone who says Christina can't sing, must have their ears plugged or something.  This girl can sing!!! To compare her vocal ability with Britney, Hilary, Lindsay, Ciara, Janet even Madonna is obsurd.  This girl is in the league with Mariah, Celine and Whitney whom all have vocal chops. Where many of the pop sounds today are all sounding the same, Christina has stepped it up and pushed the creative envelope once again. All the songs are refreshing and enjoyable.  However, my favorites are: \\"Ain't no other man\\" \\"Candyman\\" \\"Hurt\\" \\"Oh Mother\\" \\"Back in the Day\\" \\"Mercy on Me\\" and \\"I got trouble\\".  This is a must have album!!!!
B00005O3VC|5.0|I saw this when I was a teenager, and I was probably drunk. So, how does it hold up, after the fanfare? Quite well, thank you very much. Silly as heck and I laughed out loud repeatedly. It's still a damn fine film.
1573301183|5.0|I happened on this band, Alice in Chains, purely by accident. I have been listening to classic rock-n-roll for nearly forty years and was tired of the same ole stuff. I saw a few of their videos and was intrigued like many of Layne Staley and his incredible and unique voice; when I saw one video from the unplugged DVD, I decided to give it a shot. I was not disappointed. This was an incredible night in April 1996 when the band had the magic. What immediately struck me was how truly talented the musicians in this band were/are. Jerry Cantrell and Staley harmonized very well even though you could see how much the heroine addiction had robbed Staley of his vocal power. Sean Kinney is one of the best drummers I have ever seen; very professional. The best selling point for this DVD is that my wife is a classical music buff but she really enjoyed watching the video and has become a fan of AIC as well. It's very sad that Staley couldn't kick his drug problems so that they could continue to make amazing music like they did that night. For those fans out there like me that are looking for some great music, you cannot go wrong with this one!
B00003CX9S|5.0|This is the new and improved David Lynch version, and you have no idea how much I despise director David \\"Twin Peaks\\" Lynch.<br /><br />Powerful, powerful movie. Great cast, phenomenal screen writing, and a welcome retake on an old classic that I've seen and enjoyed. I tip my hat to director David Lynch. I don't agree with his decision to use black and white. He also felt compelled to throw in a few surreal elephant moments that only distract the viewer. But 95% of this film is fantastic. This is some powerful stuff. Sir Anthony Hopkins, Sir John Gielgud, and a compelling performance by John Hurt as The Elephant Man.<br /><br />You'll watch this more than once, and it doesn't even matter if you know the story because you saw one of the other films.
B000GGSM7G|5.0|Robert Smith sounds likes he's losing his mind throughout this entire cd.<br /><br />But that's ok.  This cd is a lot of fun and one to put on when you want to remember the music from the 80's.<br /><br />The songs are all fantastic - except for the unfortunate 'The Empty World'.<br /><br />Most of the hardcore fans have done a great song by song break down. I will say 'Piggy in the Mirror' is one of the most interesting songs the Cure has ever put out.<br /><br />The extras are a real treat and the same care that has been given prior Cure deluxe releases is present here.<br /><br />If you buy this cd be sure to give it multiple listens before throwing it out. It does grow on you.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This film is better than anything else I've reviewed this week, or in a very long time. But you want details, so here we go.<br /><br />Director, star and co-writer Roberto Benigni. 1998 Cannes Film Festival winner. Winner of three Oscars. Italian with English subtitles.<br /><br />Forget every word I've ever written to the effect that romantic comedy is dead. The first half of this will make you laugh. Often. The second half turns darkly humorous, and I guarantee you've never seen anything like it. It'll rip your guts out and haunt you for weeks. The blurb mentions \\"satire, physical comedy, social commentary and a touch of the surreal.\\" Yep, that's what I saw. The trailer, in English, summarizes it well in only 30 seconds. I'd have sworn that was impossible. Lemme hire this guy to write my book synopses.
B00003CWPL|5.0|An absolutely twisted and deep film. I immedaitely conencted with Lynch's dark take on the stresses of impendig fatherhood, and the visceral disturbance that this movie conjures is simply unparalleled. Lynch's first and possibly best work.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|I'm starting to appreciate John LeCarre novels more than I did when he was all over the bestseller list. This film version of one was acted well, but in 30 minutes there just wasn't anything to engage my interest. Not its characters and not its plot. A good cause worth building a story around, but not this story. I quit watching, so I guess I could be wrong, but I doubt it.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Jack Nicolson and Diane Keaton pair up in this comedy about an aging playboy and an older professional woman. Good script and well played as these comedy greats make a good pair. This movie is, however, better suited for those who really like romantic comedy. Most men will probably not like it as much as the female audience as there are a few scenes where Mom and Daughter have a woman to woman discussion about love. Its always fun to watch Diane Keaton and Jack Nicolson in any role. Well done. Gives the older single man something to think about as well. <br />
B00007G1ZC|2.0|I have nothing but respect for director Akira Kurasawa. The only Japanese director I know by name. Like every other movie of his that I have seen, this is Japanese with English subtitles. Eight interrelated stories for a total of two hours. I watched two stories. 30 minutes, or 1/4 of this film. Still bored, I gave up. His use of the colors of nature was positively breathtaking, but I just got bored. Every color of the rainbow, I suppose, since the cover plus what little dialogue I read leads me to believe that's a unifying theme. I also read on the jacket what this film \\"is about,\\" and I'm with him. But, well, I didn't watch it. I may have just been in the wrong mood.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I ordered two of these and recieved them very quickly. One had come dislodged from the bracket that secures it inside the dvd case and so was scratched up pretty bad.

0446310786|5.0|{Note -- I lost my book review, so here's my movie review.  It should give you the impression that I absolutely love this book like you wouldn't believe.  Yep.  That's right.}<br /><br />My earlier review of the book amounted to little more than \\"rah rah rah, go read this!\\" Now let me go into some more detail. The story is excellent on many levels, and it's a bit more complex than a retelling of the plot would indicate. \\"Black man accused of raping white girl in the Depression era.\\" That's the court case that drives some of Harper Lee's novel. Gregory Peck won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of attorney Atticus Finch, one of literature's most memorable characters. And yet, in the novel, Atticus isn't the main character. This book is about his daughter Scout and his son Jem. Scout is our narrator, and what we see (and don't see) comes from her.<br /><br />So how did this translate to the big screen? Quite well. The child actors, both newcomers, were excellent in their roles. Ditto on the boy who portrayed Dill, whose part was far larger in the novel but which is good in the film as well. The book had a large number of plots and subplots, so the filmmakers had to strip some away to make it work as a movie. They chose well. The results are still as complex and multi-textured as life itself.<br /><br />I watched this maybe a month after reading it, so I remembered 90% of what would happen, along with much of what was deleted. I doubt the movie could have been done much better than it was, and I'll watch it again. I'm aware of all the \\"deep dark Southern secrets\\" from the novel, those that were in the film and those that weren't. I got a strong sense that the actors were equally aware, and that's cool. Nobody could fit them all into a film that lasts under 2 hours, so they only chose the most relevant. This is how it should be. I very love this film, as we say in China, and it'll probably be in my DVD collection until I die.<br /><br />Oh, and this is purely coincidental. Later in this newsletter you'll see \\"The One-Plot Wonder,\\" which I wrote over a year ago but chose to rerun. I made this decision long before watching TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. But this book, and this movie, are a fantastic example of what I'm talking about. It has many plots. It's what we should aspire to every time we write.purely coincidental.

All the way to Wild is the wind, a perfectly executed ballad. Station to station is not only an incredible imprint of the  man's soul but of Earl Slick's. To this day every time I hear \\"Stay\\" I feel something incredible.  <br /> <br />There isnt a day that goes by that I dont listen to it, Bowie is god for me, and frankly I wouldnt take any review  under 5 stars for this.

But still. I bet Ray Bradbury, his editor, or both, used a dictionary when they worked on Fahrenheit 451. Maybe Celsius 9/11 would be a better title. I can spell that.<br /><br />Last week, a friend whose writing I greatly admire asked me an interesting question. Is this movie as popular in China as it is in the U.S.? My answer was that I don't know because I haven't found the theater in Shaoxing yet.<br /><br />The film's getting the ink over here. But I doubt it's in the Chinese theaters yet. They don't just whack in subtitles. They dub every film in Chinese, a source of justifiable pride. So time is required.<br /><br />On the other hand, I saw the VCD in a video store and snagged it. I prefer DVDs, but they didn't have one. I bought the DVDs of ROGER & ME and BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE in Hangzhou, and I recently ordered DUDE, WHERE'S MY COUNTRY? (a book) from Amazon.<br /><br />All the DVDs and VCDs here have a number of language options, and if the original film is in English, one option for the audio will be English.<br /><br />(Except for HAMLET with Sir Lawrence Olivier -- he only speaks Chinese. All these years that you thought he was British, you were mistaken.)<br /><br />We know what Michael Moore's going to do before we watch any of his films or read any of his books, don't we? He's gonna find some facts, mix in some opinions, and make us think. I suppose if you like someone he's aimed at, the thinking parts gets a wee bit painful.<br /><br />It may surprise you to know that Michael Moore always gets a few laughs out of me. Since TV NATION.

But I laughed at FAHRENHEIT 9/11 several times.<br /><br />I enjoy \\"reviewing\\" something that you've already heard about. It saves me the trouble of recapping the plot before I go into my opinionated spouting mode.<br /><br />I read an article in a Fayetteville (North Carolina) newspaper about how this was surprisingly popular in that Fort Bragg town. It included the line \\"Twelve other theaters in North Carolina are carrying 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' according to the film's Web site.\\"<br /><br />What? You mean only 13 theaters in all of North Carolina are showing this? Would it really have been harder for me to watch it if I hadn't moved to China? Please don't make me confess my deep dark secret, that I was born in Fayettenam, I mean Fayettehell, I mean Fayetteville.<br /><br />I'm glad FAHREINHEIT 9/11 was released in an election year. When I left the U.S., the First Amendment guaranteed freedom of speech. It's nice to know Bush hasn't repealed it yet.<br /><br />Oh, and I think Michael Moore should be grateful he's not Chinese.

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I must confess to being one of the many doubters, who wondered aloud when the trailers for this P & P came out, Do we need another one? At the time my answer was: We Don't.  After finally viewing it, my opinion remains unchanged.  And it isn't just that the BBC version got it so right that we can't get over it.  It's a lot more: No doubt, there are moments of beautiful film captured here.  But the screenplay, which squeezes the book into just over two hours -- is botched, terribly so.  We know from other Jane Austen films that it is NOT impossible to capture the essence of the novel in a short time frame (when in doubt, please consult Emma Thompson!); nothing close to coherence happens in this film, as anyone who has read the novel and watched it can attest.  Those familiar with the novel will see immediately where scenes have been combined, re-arranged, or re-imagined entirely, often to bizarre effect.  Those who haven't read the novel will be utterly confused.  One explanation will suffice: Wickham's character is not sufficiently developed to make it clear why he departs, and why Elizabeth is so upset when Lydia elopes with him.  All of the important context for this storyline is dropped.  The random modernizing of language serves no purpose that I can find -- either leave Austen's beautiful language alone, or modernize entirely, and update the time as well, whereby Emma becomes \\"Clueless.\\"  As to characterization, I find no evidence of Lizzy's and Mr Bennet's wonderful relationship (in fact, Donald Sutherland looks bored), I don't see much chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy, or much chemistry between anyone for that matter.  Costumes are not period appropriate, which again would be fine, if there was some coherence to the choices that were made.  And why is everyone's hair wild and ukepmt?  Finally, I am told that the Bennet's \\"status reduction\\" -- whereby Longborn is made to look poorer than the novel suggests -- was done to draw a clearer distinction betweenElizabeth's and Darcy's status.  This was hardly necessary, and random flights of geese, chickens and pigs all over the place is completely annoying.  The entire film feels rushed and perfunctory, like the cast is haunted by the ghosts of prior versions, even before the camera starts rolling, and says \\"Let's just get on with it.\\"  Jane Austen -- and her fans -- deserve better.
B000059LGC|4.0|MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS must have impressed me, because I bought this the next day and watched it that evening. It's great. Agatha Christie wrote novels with the intention of writing novels, but as luck would have it they translate into films quite well. Exotic scenery. A peek at how rich folks live. An all-star cast in fun roles that are meant to be a bit over the top, so that we think everybody is the killer. And everybody has the means, motive and opportunity to be the killer. But who is it?<br /><br />In this particular film, I solved it somewhere between the time that Poirot solved it and the time that he explained it, which is about a ten-minute window. Agatha Christie wrote some damn tough puzzles with a very sneaky wit because she was having fun, same as her readers, or in the case of this film the actors and audience.<br /><br />This is Peter Ustinov's first outing as Hercule Poirot, and he was an excellent choice. In the previous movie, Albert Finney was perfect because it was essential that we underestimate the Belgian sleuth. In this movie, it was essential that we did not.<br /><br />Oh, and for no particular reason, I'll mention that I've always liked David Niven as a distinguished elder gentleman. When he was a young pretty boy Pink Panther with disco hair, I wasn't impressed. British gentleman Niven is in this film, as a fellow detective and a friend to Hercule Poirot. I like it.

B00080ZG10|5.0|I'm saying it. The only reason Leonardo DiCaprio didn't win an Oscar is because Ray Charles died. You know I love Ray's music, the movie called RAY, and over half of the GENIUS LOVES COMPANY CD. You may also know that I despise TITANIC, sight unseen, simply because it is soooo not my style. But guess what? Leo can act. I was totally floored. In other news, the script was awesome, the life of Howard Hughes was far more compelling than I could have realized at my young age, and this was actually too short at 2 hours and 40 minutes. Go get it! I WILL watch it again. This is why people make movies. It's why we watch movies. We want to see more of these.

B00005JN2Z|2.0|It's amazing just how quickly I decided this movie really sucks. A music video without the music! For the USA Today, MTV, no attention span generation! With exclamation points! However, just to be fair and because I had nothing better to do, I endured 20 minutes. Give me a medal! Tom Cruise looks better with mustache, beard, gray hair. Jamie Foxx's talents are wasted here. It's writing like this that makes us realize that Aaron Spelling was much better than we gave him credit for.
0345298349|4.0|I arrived at this novel indirectly, after having read 'Havana Bay' and 'Polar Star';#'s 4 & 2 respectively in the Arkady Renko series. There is also the 1983 film-noir, starring William Hurt as the protagonist Arkady. Semi surprisingly the author, Martin Cruz Smith, an american, reveals considerable knowledge of cold war Moscow. Research which took him eight years to complete this book. 'Polar Star' and 'Havana Bay' make better narrative sense if read in chronological order I found to my slightly humourous dismay. Fans of Major/then Colonel Pribluda will be pleased to know his character appears in both sequels.
6305212112|5.0|The copyright on this film is 1991. It is now 2005. Are Jan and I the last two people on the planet to see this film? I don't care. I'm reviewing it anyway.<br /><br />Students are regularly shocked to hear that I haven't been to the USA in 6 years. They assume I miss \\"my hometown.\\" I explain to them that I miss my father and his lovely wife, and once in a while my gorgeous little doggies, but not my hometown.<br /><br />But lemme tell you about Fried Green Tomatoes, which are delicious. This is the most accurate portrayal of Southern life I've ever seen. I don't say that lightly. I've seen many films and read many books which portray Southern life quite well. Author Fannie Flagg, who I'm old enough to remember from The Match Game, nailed it. She's more twisted than the other two Southern lady authors I adore, Harper Lee and Anne Tyler, and I like that in a person. Also, it would've been a crime if Fannie hadn't popped in for a cameo, so I'm happy she did.<br /><br />Fried Green Tomatoes is deceptively slow moving, as is Southern life. There's a whole lot of stuff in there, however, all of which is quite accurate. The good and the bad. Many parts of it will have you cracking up with laughter, but it's not always a happy-happy load of hooey. Our deep dark secrets are also in there. Subtly. I do appreciate subtlety. I don't see it enough.<br /><br />I could give you a list of all the things I loved about this film. It'd be so long you wouldn't read it. So lemme just say I'll watch it again -- I don't know how many times -- and that I may very well buy the novel. I get a strong sense that the film is quite true to the novel, but I like to see these things for myself. I betcha Fannie's got a way with words. If you haven't watched this film, get it. You'll love it.

B0000942EX|5.0|Many critics initially reviled this album when it first appeared in 1973, though Tull fans loved it so much that it went to number one on the charts. With time better explanations of the music exist, and music has evolved to the point where the music of \\"A Passion Play\\" has achieved a better perspective. However, the music and the composition, confusing as it may initially appear, allows you to recognize that this was an attempt to create an epic and eclectic work. In some ways the work is unfinished, because the original studio sessions stopped before the original concept was completed, and thus Jethro Tull had to cut three albums sides of material to two. Some of the music originally intended for this album appeared on later albums; one example is \\"Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day,\\" which eventually appeared in \\"Warchild.\\"<br /><br />The album was intended to tell the story of a recently-deceased man seeing his own funeral, and his journey in the afterlife, including purgatory and hell, and eventual reincarnation. In addition to this primary story was the inclusion of \\"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles,\\" a story likened to stories from Winnie the Pooh to Peter and the Wolf.<br /><br />\\"A Passion Play\\" combines ten tracks into a single work (according to the official Jethro Tull web site). As in \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" there is an occasional uneven spot in the transition from one track to the next. However, as in the earlier album, the transitions and concept works nearly as well. The music is certainly well refined, with hard-driving rock riffs, drums and synthesizers keeping Jethro Tull at the more experimental, progressive edge of rock. I warn you, though, that the music requires a good sound system to be able to listen to music that extends from very quiet to very loud. I compare this music to classical music, which similarly has sounds that extend from soft to loud and also requires a good sound system. I also warn you to attempt to understand the lyrics at your own peril. The lyrics verge on the incomprehensible, even for those who have studied them at length. The lyrics are poetic and symbolic, and attempt to describe events and concepts barely attainable by the human mind, much less by a human language.<br /><br />Music such as this does not attempt to pander to a \\"style\\" or to commercial success. This music is art. Thus, a listener should interpret the meaning, significance and relevance of the music individually. I will not pretend to tell you that I understand this work in its entirety. Perhaps Jethro Tull never intended for listeners to understand the music, in the manner of Yes's \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans.\\"<br /><br />Note that this version of \\"A Passion Play\\" is a Japanese remastered release of the original 1973 album.  This version includes an enhanced video track of \\"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles.\\"  While the video is nice to have, the cost of this CD is significantly greater than the cost of a U.S. release without the video.  I recommend purchasing the U.S. release and then buying a Jethro Tull DVD, or several, given the price difference.<br /><br />While I may not be able to define or understand progressive rock, I know it when I hear it, and this music is definitely progressive rock. Listen to this music only if you are prepared to be open-minded and to accept it for what Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson attempted to do, and not for the misguided interpretations of those who think they have the divine ability to judge the work of an artist as trash.<br /><br />Enjoy!tand the lyrics at your own peril.

B00006JJ51|4.0|This is the record that for all intents and purposes invented gangster rap.  I still remember where I was when I heard this, and, like hearing Public Enemy's debut, my reaction was a mix of \\"What the [...] is THIS?\\" and \\"where are my drums?\\"      MCs Ice Cube, Ren and Eazy E are massive cartoon \\"niggaz,\\" swearing, shooting, screwing and smacking their way through a landscape of lusty women, corrupt cops, suckas, drug dealers and gangsters.  Dre and Yella's beats are simple, solid yet at times oddly fluid.  It would be hard to think of any social group that NWA leaves off its offensive, funny and often very insightful hit list:  blacks, whites, police, women, gays, straights, gangsters, dealers, politicians, pot smokers, gold-diggers.  Perhaps the only group NWA doesn't take aim at are religious.      20 years later, it's still fresh, funny and booty-shakeable.  Enjoy \\"the strength of street knowledge!\\"
B00000DOZJ|5.0|Until I became a fan of progressive rock I was unaware of the pre-Phil Collins history of Genesis, or, as some fans describe it, the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis. I was unsure of what to expect when I first played this CD because progressive rock has wide variety. I was pleased when the first track, \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight,\\" starts off sounding like Jethro Tull's unique style of folk-rock. Just like classic Tull, this track soon gets spiced up with excellent guitar and drum work. The guitar in this selection is particularly interesting and challenging in portions and, with the complex lyrics, puts this selection squarely in the center of 70s progressive rock. Genesis does use some kind of synthesizer on this track. The synthesizer could be a mellotron or a chamberlain, or perhaps even a moog. I am unsure.<br /><br />Foreshadowing the mellow Genesis of the future is \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe).\\" However, the cryptic lyrics that nearly make sense and generally do not, along with the unusual rhythms (sort of a jungle theme from time to time) keep this song in the progressive genre, though toward the pop side of progressive. This song was the first hit for Genesis in Great Britain.<br /><br />The third track, \\"Firth of Forth,\\" is a wonderful track that has elements similar to King Crimson's early work in combination with excellent semi-classical piano and flute. The synthesizer and drums round out an intertwined, lush and sometimes sparse sound to create yet another outstanding progressive rock track. The lyrics for this song are more readily understandable, though still very euphemistic and poetic.<br /><br />Phil Collins takes the lead vocal honors on \\"More Fool Me,\\" once again foreshadowing the future of Genesis. This short track is a kind of interlude between the much longer \\"Firth of Forth\\" and \\"The Battle of Epping Forest,\\" feeling almost like an intermission because of its relatively simple construction.<br /><br />According to the booklet accompanying the remastered version of this CD, the nearly 12 minute song \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" was \\"Taken from a news story concerning two rival gangs fighting over East-End Protection rights.\\" The song has a short introduction featuring vaguely military sounding music. The lyrics are about conflict and the results of the conflict, but the grim lines are moderated by the satirical nature of the entire song. Even the music is ironic, often light and playful in the midst of the death and destruction of the fight between the gangs. The end is outrageous and ironic. This music is one of those progressive rock creations that require hearing for full appreciation, and may never allow full understanding.<br /><br />Leading from one irony to the next is \\"After the Ordeal.\\" The English seem to enjoy poking fun at religion and this instrumental does well. Even the quasi-Elizabethan music feels vaguely religious without being so.<br /><br />The seventh track, \\"The Cinema Show,\\" is the fourth long track. This song is a dramatic story about Tiresias, a character from mythology who, in one version, was changed for a time into a woman, and then later back to a man. I leave the reader to discover the full story. However, the song brings in other elements to fill out the promise of the title, and because of the frequent ambiguity of the lyrics I am unsure of whether the intent was to harmonize the elements of the song with Tiresias's story, or whether the intent was to describe the elements of entertainment, since both Romeo and Juliet and Tiresias have been featured in various movies. In either case, the synthesizers are well-performed and much more subdued than those often featured in some other progressive rock work, such as, for example, that of Yes or Rick Wakeman.<br /><br />The CD finishes off with the wonderfully bizarre and eccentric \\"Aisle of Plenty.\\" There are some songs that are better left to the listener, and this is one of those.<br /><br />As with much of progressive rock, this music is for the listener that likes a variety of progressive rock, particularly the kind created by groups such as Yes, King Crimson, Jethro Tull, and the Moody Blues, among others. While the music is somewhat mellow, there are places where the guitars take over and drive or pull the music along. The lyrics are sufficiently cryptic to challenge anyone attempting to decipher them. This album is a progressive rock classic from the early 70s, setting the stage for Genesis progressive rock album that followed, \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.\\"<br /><br />Be aware that this CD was remastered in 1994 and the remastered version is available new.  This version may only be available used.<br /><br />Enjoy!/>As with much of progressive rock, this music is for the listener that likes a variety of progressive rock, particularly the kind created by groups such as Yes, King Crimson, Jethro Tull, and the Moody Blues, among others.

B000FS9FCQ|1.0|Lucky for me did not pay money to see this movie.  But I am wondering who I can send a bill for getting 2.5 hours of my life back. <br /> <br />This is one of those movies that gets all hyped up just like Blair Witch.  Then after some time people actually watch it and say \\"what the heck was that\\".  And video stores buy millions of copies...and almost nobody buys it. <br /> <br />Anyway seriously this movie has some very slow points.  It is also quite long over 2 hours.  I usually like the vigilante film but this one does nothing for me.  It has a very 'in your face' you should be nice to gays/lesbians message to it.  They center on this society elite that are basically the thought police who are imprisoning, experimenting and killing political radicals and gays and lesbians.  Of course the movie does little to indicate the actual views of political radicals. <br /> <br />I do not know how this movie is selling so well, but I imagine it wont last, once people actually start to watch it. <br /> <br />If you really want to buy it...just wait there will be hundreds of used / returned copies for cheap in the stores and online in no time. <br /> <br />Sin City, Darkman, Dark City, and Matrix are far superior to this movie. <br /> <br />
630521610X|5.0|Scream pokes fun at horror movies while actually being a horror movie. It's great fun with a really good cast. They all probably have their most memorable roles here. David Arquette's best character has to be  as the bumbling Deputy Dewey who has a thing for the reporter Gail Weathers played by Courteney Cox. Cox playing  Weathers showed she can do more than play Monica on Friends. She's probably just as known for the part as she is for Monica. She's great at playing a tough as nails reporter and it makes me wish she was casted as Lois Lane in Superman Returns!  While Neve Campbell should've went on to being a big star after this seies as well, yet you barely see her around these days.<br /><br />  Campbell plays Sidney Prescott and drama seems to follow her where ever she goes. Her mother was brutally killed and now a year later a killer with a ghostface mask is after her and her friends. Drew Barrymore is really good as the victim in the opening scene. She helps make it one of the most popular and memorable scenes in movie history. The rest of the movie is really good too but not as good as her opening scene. The whole series probably isn't as good as her opening scene.<br /><br />  Jamie Kenedy probably has his best role here too in a movie as a film geek named Randy that's obsessed with Jamie Lee Curtis. He has some of the most memorable lines in the movie and he delivers them well and gets some good laughs. Mathew Lillard \\"before he was Shaggy\\" and Skeet Ulrich who are two underused talented actors are also good here too. Lillard plays Sidney's bestfriends' b/f while Ulrich plays Sidney's b/f. Lillard is whacky and nutty while Ulrich is just basically there for us to think \\"is he or is he not the killer ?\\" . Rose McGowan \\"before Charmed\\" plays Lillards g/f who is Sidney's bestfriend. She's both spunky and cute in her role and has a memorable scene with the killer. The film is one of Wes Craven's best and although I loved part 2 it's not as good as this one is. It does have  a good cast too though. Part 3's new cast fails to impress though. This one however has a great cast, is funny and is  good for a scare here and there with some gore too.It does have  a good cast too though. Part 3's new cast fails to impress though.

B000067DGX|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. At first you may think that it's for kids but you are very wrong. I watched this for the first time when I was in my 16-18 year spirt and I laughed non stop. The story is Sulley accidentally lets a little girl into there world. Usally him and all the other monsters who work at monsters inc go through a door that leads them into a childs room once there they scare the kids and the childrens screams are put into capsules and brought back and used as energy. So when the girl gets into there world it causes alot of trouble. This is a great film that you can watch alone or with your entire family.

Mom especialy enjoyed Elvis and thru that enjoyment I grew up listening to him in our home. This compilation is an excellent package for seasoned fans as well as newcommers to enjoy the magical legacy that Elvis has given us <br /> <br />Except for \\"Thats All Right\\", all the goodies are here, including a very timely update of \\"A little Less Conversation\\". This is an excellent example of what recent technology can do for dated recordings. It is very easy to listen to, non-fatiguing and warm. I chose to purchase the import version of 1's on vinyl. Sterling sound has done a wonderful job of remastering and cutting this album on 2 LP's. While the cd version is excellent, the Lp version is over the top. This is truly how Elvis should sound. The quality of the vinyl used is excellent; extremely quiet and detailed. It has all the quality of a cd, but the warmth, liquidity and detail that only vinyl can give. If you have a system that includes a turntable, I can't recommend enough that you look for the import and secure it for your collection <br /> <br />Hats off to Ted Jenson and George Marino at Sterling Sound, NY. for this stunning vinyl remaster.

0743201140|2.0|The concept is great, and the strengths it 'allots' to you are most likely accurate for who you are now. But I don't think it's accurate if I switch jobs from consultant to baker or banker to physician. The problem is when you answer the questions, you answer them as you think about how you behave at your current job. Well, with different jobs, I behave differently (this is my 3rd 'career' switch). I've taken various tests like these, including the Jung personality test, a Myers Briggs test, and a work behavior test in bschool. Each test was taken years apart, yet what each one declared as my inherent personality or 'strength' differed. I'd put the most value in the Jung test as it asked questions about how I behaved at work vs. how I behaved when not at work so it assessed the two differently. I think that gave a better understanding of me. Quite frankly, I just feel this exam is flawed - not the concept, to build on your strengths, that's a fantastic idea. But the test to determine you strengths I don't believe is accurate in the sense that I don't believe it gives you your 'inherent' strenghts, but rather your 'strengths right now'.

B000FUF6QS|3.0|MY REVIEW OF THE SINGLE DISC EDITION:<br /><br />When I saw the previews for the upcoming remake of THE WICKER MAN with Nicolas Cage, I tried to remember what I'd seen of the original film.  It was ages ago that I saw it and I'm sure it was cut to ribbons since it was on TV, but I was intrigued enough to buy the DVD based on my memory of the film.<br /><br />After reading the other reviews here, I'll have to find the original 100-minute version because--even though I've now watched the 88-minute version--I STILL feel like I may have missed the movie I wanted to see!<br /><br />The cast was enough to get this version.  Christopher Lee is always worth watching and he brings the same energy to this role as he did as the very cheerful MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.  It was interesting to see Diane Cilento since she recently made headlines by openly discussing her turbulent marriage to Sean Connery (Connery has since abandoned the idea of writing his memoirs).  Super sexy Ingrid Pitt makes a too-brief appearance as a librarian (did she cut loose as she did in THE VAMPIRE LOVERS in those 12 minutes missing?).<br />But the really sexy role goes to Britt Ekland (another MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN connection!).  Whether bartending in tight sweaters or dancing nude singing a siren's song, she's enough to tempt any man away from just about anything.<br /><br />I loved British horror films of the 50's, 60's and 70's, but THE WICKER MAN plays more like a detective story for most of its running time.  Don't get too frustrated by the lack of \\"scares\\"--it is all leading up to something.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this story will play to a younger generation.  Young people today have been raised and indoctrinated to be so horribly accommodating to anyone's beliefs--no matter how different or bloody or just plain weird--that the notion of a entire island community given over to pagan practices may not have the same effect as it did in the 1970's.<br /><br />I wonder how the new remake will play out.<br />If it's like all the other current remakes, Hollywood will cut all the story's wit, mystery and nuance while opting for cheap scares and dumbed-down plot points.<br />Oh, well.<br /><br />MY REVIEW FOR THE 2-DISC SPECIAL EDITION (since Amazon doesn't separate the two, review-wise):<br /><br />THE WICKER MAN was a challenging film when it was released in the 1970s and it remains a challenging work to this day.<br /><br />Just before this Two-Disc Special Edition was released, I bought the single disc edition to check it out since I'd only seen the film on late-night horror shows (cut to ribbons, to say the least). Unfortunately, I found out that even the single disc wasn't considered \\"the real version\\" in most of the reviews.<br /><br />I ended up buying the Special Edition because I wanted to see more...and I was not disappointed! If THE WICKER MAN intrigues you, then it's worth getting to see what was left out. Although most purists complain that the additional scenes are poorly filmed (they look like they were shot with a video camera), everyone can see exactly what was cut from the film as they watch it. I suppose it would be distracting to anyone seeing the film for the first time...but I'm assuming that most already have.<br /><br />I loved the cast. Edward Woodward is perfect as the stiff-upper-lip Christian policeman, never overdoing it but conveying his temptations and struggles. Christopher Lee gets to exhibit the same sort of menacing glee he'd bring to his happy assassin in the following year's THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN. Britt Ekland was never sexier (she would also bring that hot bod to GOLDEN GUN, although only in a bikini). In small roles, Ingrid Pitt (the Hammer babe of THE VAMPIRE LOVERS and others) and Diane Cilento (Sean Connery's ex!) clue you into something really wrong as sensuous women on a boring old island.<br /><br />I remember there was some uproar when the film came out since it appeared that paganism had \\"triumphed\\" over Christianity in some way. At least storywise, one might reach that conclusion. I didn't react that way. Spirituality can hardly be completely represented through individual characters or situations, let alone contained. The fate of the police officer is, at best, a martyrdom that transcends a film's ending of who lives (triumphs) or dies (fails). He remained faithful to the end. And so do the singing pagans!<br />I believe that's part of the reason that the film still resonates to this day: This collision of beliefs remains consistent and the drama of THE WICKER MAN is not that anyone has a crisis of faith, it's that everyone remains totally committed, even to the point of sacrificing your own life or sacrificing another's.<br /><br />Did I mention how hot Britt Ekland looked in this...?<br /><br />(I haven't seen the recent Nicolas Cage remake but, since it's an American studio remake, I'm sure it's a train wreck).<br />At least more people will watch the original.tuality can hardly be completely represented through individual characters or situations, let alone contained.

0060763280|5.0|what the author talks about makes a lot of sense and very practical.
B0007TKNII|4.0|The visual experience of this film is top-notch.  Very good directing, set design, costumes, cinematography, etc.  Joel Schumacher should be saluted for his big-screen adaptation of a very moving stage show.  In particular, I think the transitions between \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" are a very nice touch to an already grandiose and elegant story.  And Minnie Driver's Carlotta is a good enough reason in itself to see the movie.  She's hilarious. <br /> <br />But then there's the singing.  The Phantom of The Opera is the one musical I will go out of my way to see.  There's just something about the story and the music.  They're both hypnotizing.  But the success of the production in my mind has everything to do with the quality of the voices in the pivotal roles (i.e. Raoul, Christine, and The Phantom).  If these three players are cast well, the story is a sight to behold.  If not, it's a tough story to sit through.   <br /> <br />Patrick Wilson's Raoul is the best of the three.  He has the look AND the voice that I would expect in that character.  He's the dashing suitor with the good looks, good intentions, and sweet voice.  Wilson plays his part perfectly.  He's not overbearing and he, for the most part, hits all the right notes.   <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum tries valiantly to play the \\"damsel in continuous distress\\" that is Christine.  She tries...but it's just not enough.  When it comes to the demure Christine who misses her father and who is humble about her talent as a singer, Rossum is adequate and even endearing at times.  But when Christine is supposed to be a strong, proud woman who realizes who she is and how she's being unfairly torn between what she wants and what others want from her...Emmy just isn't believable.  She's got a good voice (i.e. she can carry a tune pretty well)...but it's a small voice.  In my opinion, Christine's voice should be every bit as powerful as Carlotta's (after all, they're supposed to be competing with each other for the lead in the Opera Populaire's performances).  And you should be able to feel Christine's anger over being a pawn in the love triangle between her, The Phantom, and Raoul.  Emmy comes off as a scared, meek little girl throughout the story. <br /> <br />And then there's The Phantom.  In my opinion, Gerard Butler was chosen for this role solely because of his looks (which is, in itself, counterintuitive because of his character's deformity).  I can't see how there could be any other justification for his selection as the namesake of what I consider to be Andrew L. Weber's crowning achievement.  Once again, visually the Phantom is right on.  Butler pulls off the mannerisms and the visual portrayal of the Phantom's anguish.  And his costumes are and absolutely perfect reflection of his dark, yet elegant status.  It's an understatement to say that he looks the part.  But the man simply cannot sing.  The Phantom is supposed to be Christine's teacher...and she comes off sounding at least 10 times better than he does.  His voice is downright laughable during all of his parts but I found his vocals exceptionally inadequate during songs where he's supposed to be showing intense emotions (Music Of The Night and Masquerade come to mind).  The louder he is, the more squeamish I get.  God bless him...he's trying.  But playing the role of The Phantom to its utmost is a tall order to fill even for well-trained and talented vocalists.  The only time Mr. Butler sounds like he belongs in the role is when he's whispering.  That's as much as I can give him. <br /> <br />So I give the film 3 stars...mostly for visuals.  There are the occasional stand-outs vocally but simply changing the casting of either Christine or The Phantom would have easily earned a 4 or 5 star rating in my book.
B000FUO0C4|5.0|At its core A PASSAGE TO INDIA is a darkly pessimistic view of the future between India and Great Britain. When E. M. Forster published it in 1924, England had but recently begun to divest itself not only of its overseas colonial empire but also the attendant mind set that was proving more difficult to eradicate.  Many English still believed, even if subconsciously, that Indians, in their swarthiness and what to the English seemed like their grubby living conditions in Bombay were utterly incapable of carrying on in any meaningful way without the constant assistance of Britain.  It was against this background that Forster wrote of the bitterness and harsh feelings that he saw as deeply ingrained on both sides.  Ironically, for those who view his book as a raw but honest portrayal of this mutual acrimony, Forster himself is guilty of the same underlying assumptions against which he so eloquently rails. <br /> <br />The dramatic focus begins with Dr. Aziz, an intelligent Moslem physician who sees the English as arrogance personified but is inclined to think that with a growing understanding and compassion, the walls of prejudice may be breached and India and England may co-exist in reasonable harmony. He is aided in this belief by his association with Mrs. Moore, a liberal Englishwoman, and Cyril Fielding, an equally understanding principal of the British Government College.  However, when Aziz attends a bridge party given by various English personnel, he is rudely treated and is humiliated, causing him to rethink his earlier optimism. The climax of the book occurs when Aziz invites Mrs. Moore and her friend Adela Quested to visit the mysterious Malabar Caves, where wind and echoes resound.  During their trip, Adela hears the wind and becomes disoriented. She later claims that Aziz assaulted her, a crime for which he is arrested and tried in court.  This trial becomes a national event, and when Adela recants her accusation, Aziz is freed, but he is terribly embittered, and India itself sees the accusation as yet another example of English condescension.  The novel ends with Aziz breaking all ties with his friend Fielding. <br /> <br />Early in the novel, Forster clearly states his belief that it may not be possible for English and Indians to live in harmony.  He suggests that in the early and friendly relations between Aziz and Fielding such a harmony may be realized, but as the book's events reveal, that this harmony is but an illusion, as wispy as the sounds echoing from Malabar Caves.  The friendship between the two is not strong and is based more on shared philosophical goals than personal affinities.  During the course of the bitter trial, this friendship proves incapable of supporting the strain and is finished.  The other liberal, Mrs. Moore, is conveniently spirited out of the book so she need not testify on Aziz's behalf.  When Forster closes with Aziz defiantly proclaiming that he is now staunchly in the camp of those who oppose social reconciliation, there is a tendency to overlook what undercuts what otherwise might be Forster's surface sadness at his view that matters between England and India are irreparably breached.   Forster is so relentlessly insistent in his belief that this gap is permanent that the reader begins to wonder whether Forster's reasons lie more with subliminal agreement with the \\"white man's burden\\" rather than any objective assessment of undeniable fact. Further, when he allows Mrs. Moore to so conveniently avoid helping Aziz during the trial, Forster may simply have found the path of least resistance and thus not have to worry about questioning his own underlying assumptions.  The problems, then, in identifying and confronting the issues that Forster raised in 1924 are as elusive today as were the echoes that resonated so loudly in the Marabar Caves the day Adela Quested opened that can of racial worms.    <br />
B0000683DH|5.0|'The Wrath of Khan' is arguably the most famous out of all of the Star Trek movies to date. Ricardo Montalban returns once again to reprise his role as Khan, the villain from the original series episode \\"Space Seed\\". As expected, Montalban exceeds in this role that he has established as one of the greatest villains of the Trek universe. He looks different, a little buffer and more grey, but he is still the same evil character we have all come to hate.<br /><br />This movie features a lot of interesting and very famous moments. This was also the first film appearance of Kirstie Alley. The story is very compelling and the characters/actors work so well together, you can feel their friendships and hatreds between each other. If you notice during the movie, they do give hints by things they say and do of how the movie will end. The script is well written and has me in tears every time, no matter how many times it is watched. This is a must have for lovers of Trek and sci-fi, you have to see this movie at least once in your life time. After that, you will want to see it again and again. It is just that good.
0486424545|5.0|The world of HOWARD'S END is a study of polar opposites: reason versus passion, idealism versus pragmatism, and sentiment versus sense.  In E. M. Forster's other novels, he expands on them as well, but in them he does so in a light and bantering tone such as in A ROOM WITH A VIEW or in culturally clashing context as in A PASSAGE TO INDIA.  But in the English country-house world of HOWARD'S END, Forster takes a middle view.  His focus is on a close up examination of the contrasting and clashing universes of two families: the Wilcox family of reason, practicality, money, and general conservatism; and the Schlegel family of idealism intellectualism, sentimentality, and general liberalism.  In such a clash of cultural outlooks, Forster implies that any reconciliation between them can be achieved only at the cost of human tragedy.   <br /> <br />The Schlegel sisters Margaret and Helen are vacationing in Germany where they meet the Wilcoxes.  Rather inexplicably, Helen is invited to visit them in London.  Helen accepts, and falls in love with Paul Wilcox, a match of which the Wilcoxes much disapprove due to class differences.  Sadly, both Paul and Helen agree not to see each other. Forster here depicts how status can be used as a club to crush human love.  Later, the Wilcoxes rent a house that is coincidentally near the Schlegel home. Ruth Wilcox, the matriarch, meets and develops a sincere liking for Margaret and they become fast friends.  When Ruth dies, her family discover a letter in her effects that her final wish was to pass her ancestral home, Howard's End, to Margaret.  The Wilcoxes disregard the letter and do not tell Margaret of its contents.  Ruth's husband meets Margaret, and despite the differences in their ages, status, backgrounds, and political convictions, they fall in love and marry, much to the disgust of his family.  Meanwhile Helen falls in love with a disreputable young man named Leonard Bast, who is married to a much older harridan who tricked him into marriage. This woman, again coincidentally, was once the mistress of Mr. Wilcox.  Helen gets pregnant by Leonard.  Mr. Wilcox writes a will that leaves Howard's End to Margaret just as Ruth would have wished. <br /> <br /> There is very little of the levity that one finds in A ROOM WITH A VIEW. HOWARD'S END is a dead serious look at a society that prides itself on clean class distinctions, an abiding concern of Forster's, but here his focus is on presenting then unveiling the sources and consequences of those artificially erected barriers that Forster implies are built in to an entrenched and ossified caste system that has little chance to change.  The conservative Wilcox family, though tarred with a broad brush of authorial disapproval are not seen as totally in the wrong, nor are the liberal Schlegels depicted as purely driven saints from heaven.  Forster is careful to show families in contrast and clash but also families that intersect at critical points of common humanity.  As both families emerge either cleansed or sullied, Forster seems to say that both are like everyone else, and that if even clashing cultures can find that point of intersection, then the tragic end of HOWARD'S END need not be replicated in those clashing cultures. <br />

0375701427|3.0|This book is long and difficult to read.  It examines its characters, especially the protagonist Swede Levov, it terms of their motives; several times over and in great length.  Only in-between these long periods of introspection do the characters see action.  We learn more about the denizens of this book by narrative speculation than we do by actions that speak to us directly.     The Swede is larger than life, the aggregate of his surroundings and his place and time in history.  He is what the kids growing up alongside him want to be: a man of collective aspiration.  Yet his persona proves elusive.  He stands for and all the conflicts inherent in his times--forties and fifties Newark, New Jersey.  The book spends the majority of its rather dense four hundred pages trying to tease out the mystery of this man.  The reader is subjected to a prolonged and grueling examination.  We are given glimpses of a vision but never the Technicolor whole.  We are lead to believe that by understanding the Swede we will understand his age.  But this never comes true.    Synopsis:    In 1968, Swede's daughter, Merry Levov, commits an act of terrorism that throws the whole Levov family into disarray and uproots them from their contented existence in pastoral suburban utopia, separating them from a place where values are truths and meanings are plain.  Without these easy truths, the Swede is at a loss to understand what has happened to him and how he might be at fault, even who he is.  -- And if he doesn't know, how the heck are we supposed to? --  The book is a pilgrimage of conscience leading more to an understanding of the process of a man's moral undoing at the hands of his unrelenting conscience, than to knowledge of the man himself.    Warning.  You will not like this book if you don't like \\"boring\\" books.  American Pastoral is often very \\"boring.\\"  It pulls you along at such a pace that you're always on the verge of putting it down, until some morsel of action or realization excites you on . . . until the inevitable next lag.  The characters in this book remain essentially inert.  They are never animated.  We are drawn a grand portrait but never see it come to life.    While Nathan Zuckerman, a childhood friend of the Swede's brother, provides us with the narrative, which we are told is a story loosely based upon the Swede's life, and Zuckerman is the focus of the first ninety pages or so, after that we are left solely with the fictionalized Swede.  Zuckerman never reenters or makes further comment or connects the man's story to what is happening in the present day.  Maybe we should have seen more of Zuckerman.  Maybe we should have been privy to him getting in touch with Swede's brother again, Jerry.  Or maybe Zuckerman should have visited the dead Swede's grave.  Or met with Swede's second wife.  Better yet, have gone to find the present day Merry.  As it is now, Merry just drops unceremoniously off the stage at book's end.    But there are positive comments to be made as well.  The life, philosophy and tradition the Swede's father's glove factory is very well described.  We are given a comprehensive understanding of the business, and it is all very interesting.     But back to the Swede.  Nathan Zuckerman writes:    \\"I dreamed a realistic chronicle.  I began gazing into his life--not his life as a god or a demigod in whose triumphs one could exult as a boy but his life as another assailable man.\\"    Yes, this man is assailed.  By his surroundings and his times but mostly by his own conscience.  He is the incarnate of an age.  Yet the truths and values he represents cannot be fully apprehended and understood because they are transitory and ephemeral--transitory and ephemeral *define* the spirit of the age.  Times change.    This book tried something huge and, more than likely, unachievable.
B000G759LW|2.0|Will someone explain to me why this pop tart Christina Aguilera is considered so spectacular?  While there's no denying that she has a stronger voice than most of her peers, that doesn't change the fact that her songs are as generic as they come and lack a certain timelessness that the best music has (her last two albums are already very dated sounding - this one is likely destined for the same fate), and the lyrics read like the prose of a grade schooler.  I haven't even mentioned the fact that some of the hooks are flat out annoying.  Take \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", for instance: It uses a repetitious horn sample, and Aguilera goes from her overuse of melismas (you would think by now she would have learned how to really sing) to basically spitting out the lyrics during the chorus as if she drank about 20 espressos.  <br /> <br />The album is admirable in its attempt to integrate classic sounds with the overproduced contemporary pop that has become Aguilera's bread & butter over the years.  Where fault can be found is that Aguilera always feels the need to oversing, much like her childhood idol Whitney Houston.  The great singers of the past were known for often using restraint when it was called for - in Aguilera's case, it's always brash and in-your-face belting, even during the quietest moments.  The overreliance on contemporary technology, with samples and sequencers often being used in favor of live instrumentation, also brings this album down.  The themes also get tired after a while as well - yes, Christina, you've found a man and you're happy, and that's just peachy ... now sing about something else already! <br /> <br />On another note, you can't help but notice that there's something artificial about Christina Aguilera.  In a matter of years she has gone from \\"Look at me, I'm a perky little cheerleader\\" to \\"\\"Everything is so dark and bleak, and I have a million piercings now\\" to \\"I want to be Jayne Mansfield or Marilyn Monroe\\".  This is reinvention taken to the extreme, and not knowing who she is or what she stands for makes her difficult to make any kind of connection with - but then again, she fits in with the lot of pop acts these days in that sense.  One thing hasn't changed, and that's the fact that Aguilera always tries to play the sex appeal card.  Whatever.  Hey, Christina - if you really want to shock people, how about walking around fully clothed for a change?  I won't say that she isn't attractive, but in all phases of her career she has looked less like a recording artist than someone who walks the streets of the Red Light District. <br /> <br />In summary: A commendation for an attempt at musical reinvention (hence the extra star), but nothing special and really not deserving of all the publicity it has received.  This might have been stronger if more of it was in the vein of Aguilera's collaboration with Herbie Hancock, but instead it falls back too often into safe territory for her.  While there is some potential here, Aguilera still needs to learn how to sing properly, and she also needs to spend as much time on her songs as she does her image and how she chooses to dress.  Oh yeah - she needs to step out of the comfort zone more often.  Back To Basics is alright, but it's nothing to write home about.  Don't believe the hype.

B00003CX5P|4.0|This is the Best Star Wars Movie ever! Here are all the reasons why I love this movie: <br /> <br />1. Jar-Jar Binks is an excellent addition to the Star Wars universe. He is a deep and powerful character that is wonder to watch. He brings a certain intensity to the series that we have never seen before. <br /> <br />2. We hear people say \\"Poo-Doo\\" a lot, and we all know what THAT means! That's just hilarious. It made me chuckle every time I heard it. <br /> <br />3. Jar-Jar gets hit in the groin. More hilarity! That just cracked me up. <br /> <br />4. The way Jar-Jar talks is the best! \\"Me-sa tinkin' we-sa bein' in deep poo-doo bom-bad!\\" Poetry. Sheer poetry. <br /> <br />5. Jar-Jar has a long tongue, which is really funny. He gets it electrocuted, sticks it out at Qui-Gon, uses it to eat frogs and fruit, and other REALLY FUNNY things.  <br /> <br />6. A big animal farts, which makes Jar-Jar hold his nose and say \\"Pee-yoo!\\" That was the BEST EVER! I'm glad that George Lucas took the Star Wars universe seriously enough to present this prequel installment that really stays true to the source material. I felt like it was just like watching the original series in some ways. It took me back to moments in the original Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope) where old Ben Kenobi kept telling Luke to pull his finger.  <br /> <br />7. The movie doesn't waste any time talking about Darth Maul, giving us any detail into his past, showing some insight into his character, or anything else stupid like that. It's like George Lucas already knew from the beginning that nobody would be interested in him. <br /> <br />8. This movie shows Anakin before he became a member of N'Sync. He was pretty awesome too. He built his own droid, built his own podracer, won a pod race, piloted a starfighter, and destroyed a trade federation droid control ship, all before he was 10 years old! Is that not cool or what? That's why I say that this movie is even better than Home Alone 3. I'd like to say thatit is just as good as the 1st Home Alone, but it's hard to beat Macaulay Culkin. <br /> <br />9. Some of the acting in this movie is the absolute best. To me, I think it would be kind of difficult to deliver all my lines in a flat monotone, without showing any facial expression whatsoever. But Natalie Portman pulls it off brilliantly! She is to be commended for that. <br /> <br />10. The dialogue is hard to beat, too. We get to hear some nice speeches about midi-chlorians (cool!), and we also get some lines that don't make any sense on the surface, until you start to think about it. (\\"We are brave, your highness.\\") And something about a trade blockade and some kind of war and the senators are all a bunch of idiots, and well, I couldn't really figure out the story. All I know is that Jar-Jar Binks rocked! <br /> <br />The only reason I give this movie 4 stars rather than 5 is because it doesn't have any Ewoks in it. Ewoks (taste like Chicken!) would have been an excellent addition, and I think Lucas just missed the boat on that one. <br />
B00026WU4G|5.0|As an earlier reviewer noted, this album is in many ways a Christian album, or an album filled with religious references.  It may not have been as direct as the previous 3 albums were, but they were still there.  A lot of people got totally freaked out by Dylan's Christian conversion.  Frankly, I never understood why.  So they seemed to all breathe a collective sigh of relief when this one turned up.  I have always adored this album, not because it was his \\"secular\\" album coming after the Christian phase, but because it's damn good music.  Every song on it is great Dylan, and he could have easily made a double album, because as you know, the stuff he didn't put on this album made it to The Bootleg Series, Vol. 3, and it's just as good as the stuff that made it on the album.  My favorite songs are Union Sundown, Neighborhood Bully, and Jokerman.  There's also a video for Jokerman, which is filled with artistic references and is one of the best videos I've ever seen (I just saw it recently on youtube).  Unfortunately, the rest of the 80's wasn't very good for Bob, and he didn't really make another great album until Oh Mercy, even though I think that album is a bit overrated.  This is great stuff...

B00005JOYM|2.0|Oliver Stone told the press that he wasn't going to turn 'World Trade Center' into some leftist political propaganda machine (anti-Bush, etc.). But maybe he should have. September 11th, 2001 will live forever in the history of America, especially in the lives of those who were a part of it. Other than a few glimpses of victims running around, and some explosions, Stone keeps our attention on the several NYPD cops inside the tower just before the building collapses. After that the movie collapses. The dialogue between the surviving cops who are waiting to be rescued is cliched and very poor. I don't blame the actors. They are given nothing to do. The poor wives are given nothing to do other than remain in a constant state of panic which wears thin after awhile. And what of all of the other victims? What of all of the other cops and firemen who also went inside and never came out? I realize that Stone wanted to concentrate on these two cops, but by doing so, he forgets what the movie should have been about. The attack on New York. The collapse of the Twin Towers. Some 3,000 people - men, women, children - dead. Where is the feeling of horror? People fell to their deaths from a hundred stories up. The death of children. The bravery of all of those cops and firemen who knew they weren't coming out alive. I couldn't feel the terror those people must have felt. The story of two rescued cops wasn't enough. It didn't leave me in tears. New York was attacked that day. The Twin Towers were completely destroyed. Thousands of people lost their lives. What do we tell the dead, Mr. Stone, and those who lost their loved ones? When the Titanic sank and took some 1500 lives with it, we barely remember the people who survived. There was heroism on that night to be sure. But it is the dead we remember the most, and care the most about. Though Oliver Stone's movie was well intentioned, there is too much to tell, and this tale of horror is far too early to make in to a movie. We're notready. We don't understand fully what happened. I believe the nation is still in shock. Thousands of lives are calling out still to be heard. The survivors and the dead. The voices of the dead on that fateful day clearly drown out any good intentions Stone has. I suggest watching a good documentary on the subject. At least then your tears will be real.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend of mine knew I liked TV shows which were different and he recommended \\"Firefly\\".  It was a great show that ended too early. Every episode, I grew to like the characters more and more.  The crew of the Serenity was a group of very unique personalities and you grew to accept them as part of your family. You not only like these people, you learn to care about who they are and how they came to be on Serenity.<br /><br />Captain Reynolds kept you smiling with his laid back ways yet he had a heart of gold. His humor and compassion reminded me of a cross between Hans Solo and Indiana Jones.<br /><br />I've described this show to others as a western science fiction show.  It is set in space yet it is filled with scenes with horses, shoot-outs and bar room brawls. Everything about it makes it enjoyable and fun.<br /><br />Even though humor is a part of \\"Firefly\\", there are moments of intense drama and darkness. You experience many things with the crew-sense of family, loss, loyalty, love, suspense and laughter.<br /><br />\\"Firefly\\" was also made very well. The writing, acting and everything about each episode makes this show special. You will not be disappointed bringing the crew and their lives into your home.

0440238609|5.0|Ignoring the religious aspects for the moment, this is a well-written and well-crafted set of books.  The author creates a consistent world, which believable characters.  The story is tight, the writing is good, plot is fun and dramatic. It is well worth reading.  <br /> <br />Now that being said, I do not recommend these books to those who are sensitive to religious issues.  If you do not want your adolescent to have exposure to ideas that contradict your own then keep them away from these books.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed it at 33.  My eleven year-old goddaughter has picked it up and seems to be enjoying it as well.  We will speak at length on what I do and do not disagree with afterwards.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Is that you should read the book, [[ASIN:0393327345 Fight Club: A Novel]]. And then you should read some more books, like [[ASIN:1601640021 Rabid: A Novel]], [[ASIN:0374279128 Tree of Smoke: A Novel]], and[[ASIN:0786168773 Survivor]].     The movie is good. Brad Pitt as Twitchy Tyler is superbly cast, though I always pictured Tyler as black. The movie, however, has a different end than the book, and it's a big difference.     The book's end is about taking power back for yourself. The movie's end is about losing power over your obsessions. This is large difference. The book is way better, and if you see the movie, you should read the book twice so you understand where Chuck is coming from.

B000BB1MIC|5.0|I thought this was a great season.  I got a little tired of the rift between Emily/Richard and Lorelai relationship.  BUT I loved the new Logan/Rory relationship.  It was a refreshing change to see some new characters as well as all of the old favorites.  I was getting tired of seeing Rory with guys who just drained her and did not challenge her.  I do not feel that Logan would be a good match forever, but it is nice to see her stepping out of her comfort zone and having to work for something as well as have fun in college, which I think is a better portrayal of college life.  This is definately a series that I will be sad to see end when it finally does.  There is none other like it.

0060899190|3.0|I am a loyal PostSecret.com reader where 1-10 post cards are published per week.  And after they've been posted, there are no archives, they just disappear.  This is not criticism to Frank Warren, who has put so much time into the site and compiled the book. It's criticism for the content in relationship to the chosen format of the book.   <br /> <br />I paid roughly full price at a local book store as I'd been waiting months to get my hands on the book. But was finished with it in a couple of hours. I may look at it again, but probably not. Probably the most disappointing aspect was that a sizeable portion of what's in the book are secrets that were also on the website, and I'm quite sure Frank receives so many Post Secrets that we'll never see them all. I *thought* that was the purpose of the book; to include fresh, unseen cards. And the space, in many cases, was badly used where more new, unseen cards could have been displayed. <br /> <br />Overall I liked it very much, but felt I paid for a couple hours worth of brain food and nothing more. I't a high quality, well made book, but I won't buy the next one... I'll look at it at the bookstore. Or wait and buy one that's been used.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|What a suprise. After the POP STAR persona, it is hard to believe that this exccellent guitarist is the same muso. This is power trio stuff that doesn't need to hide from any comparisons. Very tasteful playing and great tunes or interpretations. He can be heavy when it is called for, but never looses the musical thread of his playing for the sake of flash. If you like the guitar, MAYER should be in your collection.
B000BBOUU4|2.0|I hate to compare remakes to the originals, because oftentimes they should be able to stand on their own merits and are worlds apart from their counterparts.  As is the case here. <br />Tim Burton's remake of Ronald Dante's bestselling children's novel is very much a Tim Burton film.  Dark, dramatic and with a lot of hidden meanings for the adults.  And this, I think, is the first problem with this film.  The original version was light and funny.  Silly, sure.  But it never seemed dark, even in its most serious, retrospective moments.  It was a child's fantasy and despite the now-cheesy nature of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, the cheese quotient just seemed to work.  Of course we knew those candies were blown up beach balls and the choco-river was brown colored water, but we wanted to believe in the fairy tale and so we did.   <br />Mr. Burton's version is definitely much more spectacular with the special effects.  But somehow they just don't translate into a fluffy child's fantasy.   <br />The second problem, and a much larger problem, is the casting of Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.  I think Johnny Depp is a tremendously talented actor and he was perfect as Edward Scissorhands.  He brought depth and emotion to a troubled and dark character.  But he was terribly miscast as Willy Wonka.  He played Wonka as a flat out oddity, he of deathly pale skin and pageboy hair cut.  His effeminate voice and pure glee in the discomfort and almost destruction of some of the children is disturbing at best, and borders on cruelty.  Whereas Gene Wilder played Willy Wonka as an eccentric but loveable fellow, Depp's Wonka belongs on a therapist's couch.  Whereas you could laugh at Wilder's Wonka or believe that he truly loved making candy, you just have to wonder how Depp's Wonka could have made it successfuly as a business man.   <br />Add to the mix the background story of Wonka's childhood and his dentist father, from whom he is alienated . . . well, do we really care?  Isn't the story about Charlie and his wish fulfilled?  Rather, this version seems to be about Tim Burton and his wish to remake a child's classic as far from the original as possible. <br />The children bring bright spots to the otherwise heavy film.  They are splendid little actors and perfectly cast.  As in the original, the parents have little to do, other than stand by while their children are taught lessons.   <br />The Oompa Loompas also make a return appearance, although the songs here, rather than being silly little ditties, are geared almost toward music videos. <br />All in all, I would steer clear of this one and pull out the 1971 version.

Yes even Vin Diesel produces the goods, albeit in a role which is tailor made for him, as the murderer Riddick who must put aside his nature, and help his fellow survivors.<br /><br />The plot sees a rustbucket, slow lane space freighter damaged in space by a meteorite shower. In a stunning sequence, it is forced to crash land on a bleak planetoid. The survivors of the crash find themselves in a harsh, sunbleached environment where the very ground and rocks seem to pulsate with heat, from the harsh and unrelenting sunlight. The dazed and confused survivors are led by the ship's pilot, well played by Radha Mitchell(Silent Hill). Wandering around the desert in search of food and water, they arrive at a seemingly abandoned settlement.<br />There they learn that the planet is home to millions of flying carnivorous monsters who only emerge in the dark. Things get even worse when they find that the planet is about to get plunged into a long period of perpetual darkness.<br />What follows is a terrifying fight for survival as these people try to stay alive.<br /><br />Director David Twohy has made a visually stunning Sci Fi film on a modest budget.<br />The images that remain in my mind are the as follows:<br />- The aforementioned crash.<br />- The discovery of a seemingly petrified forest which on closer examination turns out to be the skeletal remains of long dead huge beasts.<br />- The rising ringed planet which blots out the sunlight and the subsequent emergence, in clouds of millions, of the winged carnivores.<br /><br />The pace is breathless and relentless.

0684833395|5.0|There's a war on, everyone is crazy, and none of the airmen who has flown close to the mandatory number of missions seems very happy when someone raises the number of mandatory missions. There's a way out: all a crazy airman has to do is to ask the doctor to ground him. But there's a catch.<br /><br />\\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\"<br /><br />Thus Joseph Heller introduced a new term into the English vernacular. Catch-22 is a view of the world in all its absurdity and contradiction. It's a novel that explores critical issues like war, identity, and the struggle of the individual against bureaucracy run amok--all while being tremendously funny.<br /><br />The story centers around Yossarian, a bombardier trying desperately to save himself; men he knows keep dying because they're sent on one dangerous mission after another in an effort by their commanding officer to show his zeal and to be promoted.<br /><br />Each chapter in the novel is entitled for a character or location in the story, allowing us to focus before moving on to the next part of the story. In this structure, we learn the absurdity of the situation, the apparent inability of anyone to stop the wheels of the bureaucracy, and the success of those who exploit it to their own ends, all while proclaiming themselves to be working for the greater good. (Everyone, after all, has a share.) Then there are the efforts to achieve recognition by the sincerity of the form-letters sent to the families of the airmen killed. And the work of a schemer trying to get his picture the Saturday Evening Post.<br /><br />Some call it bitter or critical of bureaucracy. I call it an honest look at the results of consolidating power. Catch-22 is a brilliant work, well-deserving of its reputation as a classic of American literature, one of the best novels of the twentieth century, a thoughtful commentary that apparently heeds the advice offered by another brilliant explorer of the human condition from a century before.<br /><br />\\"If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you.\\" --Oscar Wilde.Then there are the efforts to achieve recognition by the sincerity of the form-letters sent to the families of the airmen killed.

Very catchy tune, funny concept  <br />2.Who knew - 9/10 Quite a sad song really, worthy single.  <br />3.Long way to happy - 8/10 Great song, possibly next single  <br />4.Nobody knows - 8/10 Another enjoyable but sad song  <br />5.Dear Mr.President - 9/10 Utterly brilliant...needs to be a single but I think it could be two controversial (Even for Pink)  <br />6.Im not dead - 8/10 Nice melodic chorus overall a good song  <br />7.Cuz I can - 8/10 Classic Pink. Up-beat, catchy and in your face.  <br />8.Leave me alone (Im lonely) - 7/10 One of the weaker songs on the album. Still passable.  <br />9.U + ur hand - 8/10 Great song, similar feel to 'Cuz I can' Also her current single.  <br />10.Runaway - 9/10 Very much like 'Dont let me get me' and 'Just like a pill' Again Classic Pink. One of my favourites.  <br />11.The one that got away - 7/10 Not feeling this song at all. Very Country Western style  <br />12.I got money now - 9/10 Great song, worthy single  <br />13.Converstations with my 13 year old self - 8/10 Great song to end the album.  <br />Bonus tracks:  <br />14.Fingers - 8/10 Really catchy tune. Should replace 'The one that got away' This really shouldnt be a bonus track.  <br />15.I have seen the rain - 7/10 Not bad I suppose.

0876855575|5.0|I have been returning to the work of Charles Bukowski (1920 -- 1994) after reading his novel \\"Factotum\\" and watching the movie based upon it.  Bukowski's novel \\"Ham on Rye\\" (1982) is a coming-of age novel in that it tells the story of Bukowski's protagonist, Henry Chinaski, from his birth to his young manhood, ending with the attack on Pearl Harbor. (\\"Factotum\\", written in 1978 covers the next period of Chinaski's life, after he has been rejected for the draft and wanders from city to city in search of work.) Chinaski is based loosely on Bukowski's own life; but \\"Ham on Rye\\" and Bukowski's other novels are, after all, works of fiction and should be read as such.<br /><br />The scene of \\"Ham on Rye\\" is Los Angeles during the Great Depression, particularly the lower middle-class homes in which Chinaski grows up, as families struggle to survive and to escape from poverty. Bukowski is at his best in describing dingy homes, streets, schools, and desperate people.<br /><br />But \\"Ham on Rye\\" is a coming-of-age book told with irony and twists.  It seemingly mocks the story of self-discovery and self-awakening common to these distinctively American books, but in the end I think it follows the pattern of a coming-of-age story in spite of itself.  Most American coming-of-age books recount the life of a young person and end when that person comes to some crisis which he meets and, thus, attains a degree of understanding of himself which he carries through life.  Bukowski's book tells the story of an unhappy childhood, as Chinaski is subjected to an overbearing father and frequent beatings.  In addition, as an early adolescent, Chinaski develops a terrible case of acne which exacerbates his tendency to aloneness as well as his anger and rebeliousness.  After graduating from high school, Chinaski loses a menial job, enrolls in a Junior College, and begins to drink heavily.  He is well on the way to a life of alcoholism, fighting, wandering, and gambling that is detailed in chronologically later novels of Chinaski's life, such as \\"Factotum\\" or \\"Women\\".<br /><br />Yet for all its rawness and Chinaski's sense of failure and purposelessness, the book conveys a sense of promise.  The book shows a young Chinaski forming the desire to be a writer, and beginning to work at his craft and respond to his experiences in a manner that, years later, would result in \\"Ham on Rye\\" and in Bukowski's other works of fiction and poetry.  Some of the best moments in \\"Ham on Rye\\" show the adolescent Chinaski sitting alone in the Los Angeles Public Library and ultimately discovering authors, including D.H. Lawrence, Upton Sinclair, and Sinclair Lewis, who speak to him. As had many before him, Chinaski learns that projecting oneself into artistic creation offers a form of release from the difficulties of everyday life.  Chinaski writes: \\"Words weren't dull, words were things that could make your mind hum.  If you read them and let yourself feel the magic, you could live without pain, with hope, no matter what happened to you.\\" (p. 152) These words reflect the theme of \\"Ham on Rye\\" and, I think, of Bukowski's work as a whole.<br /><br />Similarly while suffering from his acute acne, Chinaski develops a character a WW I pilot named Baron Von Himmlen, and writes stories of his imagined adventures.  Chinaski writes: \\"it made me feel good to write about the Baron.  A man needed somebody.  There wasn't anybody around so you had to make up somebody, make him up to be like a man should be\\". (p. 168)<br /><br />\\"Ham and Rye\\" is the story of how a young man found himself in adulthood leading a life of alcoholism, poverty, and loneliness, with no ambition and seemingly few prospects.  The book is full of adolescent sexual frustration, dysfunctional families, rawness, vulgarity, and failure.  It also includes some funny scenes. The story is told in a sharp, crude, no-nonsense style.  But together with all the outward failure and the shocking scenes, we see a young Chinaski inthe process of attaining his dream and gaining victory over himself after all.  In spite of the dead-end vicissitudes of his life, Henry Chinaski perseveres and gradually brings his experiences alive and learns to make something worthwhile of his existence.  He learns to reflect upon himself and his life and to describe them without cant or mercy.  Henry Chinaski becomes a writer.<br /><br />Robin Friedmang Chinaski in the process of attaining his dream and gaining victory over himself after all.

B000GRTQSE|5.0|Since Time Out Of Mind, us Dylan fans can be proud again to admit that we're fans of the new stuff, not just classic Dylan. Modern Times is his third release in a streak of impeccable material. The latest is a return to the styles Dylan introduced in Love and Theft-- blues and rockabilly. As with that album, Dylan (aka Jack Frost) produced Modern Times. Here, the songs are longer, the lyrics arguably more memorable and there's a few more down-tempo ballads. Contrary to the popular notion that Dylan's voice is incomprehensible (probably owing to his horrible performance at his 30th anniversary concert), the singing is so clean you can understand everything without the benefit of a lyric sheet (though it would have been nice to have).     As I said, the songs are longer: the shortest is 4:58, the longest over eight minutes. Dylan borrows from blues standards on Rollin' and Tumblin' and The Levee's Gonna Break, but liberally infuses a mess of his own lyrics. When the Deal Goes Down and Workingman's Blues, especially the latter, are his best ballads in decades. All in all, its not as forceful as Love and Theft. It's not as surprising as that album was, but hardly less of a masterpiece. His lyrics have gotten sharper and wittier, jumping out at you at odd moments with silly innuendos, jokes about getting old, an Alicia Keys name-drop. It's altogether friendlier and more fun that the last two releases.    Like reviewers elsewhere have said, Modern Times is unlikely to win him many new fans or impress fans of his earlier work that never bought into his new stuff, but those who've stuck with Dylan over the years and listened with awe to Time Out of Mind are not going to be able to put down Modern Times for quite awhile. Now I just wish Dylan would put out albums more often! Maybe in a couple years Columbia will release all the songs (I've heard about 2 hrs worth) that wouldn't fit on these last three albums...?    About the bonus disc: don't waste your money. Everyone knowsColumbia's holding on to a ***-load of unreleased Dylan stuff and all they could choke up for an extra eight bucks is four (okay, one of them is new...) mediocre tracks that barely differ from the album versions? Instead of offering something interesting for fans and collectors they're just taking advantage of those few who'll invariably say \\"why not?\\" and throw them the extra few dollars. Buy the regular version. You won't miss anything by skipping the bonus DVD (no one's going to watch it more than once anyway).

Modern Times is his third in a streak of impeccable releases. The latest is a return to the styles Dylan introduced in Love and Theft-- country-blues and smart rockabilly. As with the most recent album, Dylan (aka Jack Frost) produced Modern Times; as such its feeling is closest to Love and Theft-- warmly personal, like listening to the band in a small nightclub.

Altogether, it's friendlier and more fun that the last two releases; it might be Dylan's most 'personable' album since, well, 'Another Side...' or 'Self-Portrait.' The last track, Ain't Talkin' is reminiscent, stylistically, of Time Out of Mind's opener, though it's probably coincidental. Dylan sings, 'Ain't Walkin', Ain't Talkin' in the same tone as Love Sick's lyric 'I'm Walkin', bringing what Columbia's been labeling a 'trilogy', full-circle.     Though reviewers elsewhere have said that Modern Times is unlikely to impress non-fans, I can't imagine how anyone couldn't enjoy the heart-wrenching warmth and sagacious wit flaunted by Dylan and his band. Dylan's last two albums and his live shows, on the other hand, are denser affairs, more tuned to the mind of the familiar fan, but, similar in appeal to, but greater in quality than, Johnny Cash's later recordings for American Records, Modern Times is Bob Dylan singing for everybody.  And just as well, those who've stuck with Dylan over the years and listened with awe to Time Out of Mind are going to keep Modern Times out next to the CD player for quite awhile.

There is only one sure way to kill a ghoul and that is my destroying its brain. Too often people forget this and are turned into zombies themselves or simply destroyed by the rampaging horde. <br /> <br />On a more serious note I thought this book was a great entertaining read. Brooks is quietly slips in a few comments on American dietary, recreational and general living habits. The only knock against the books is this: there needs to be some more illustrations!

The background music complements David's voice and enriches the whole listening experience of this collection.  A signature of Whitesnake's songs is a fancy guitar solo act performed by the talented John Sykes, which is found about midway through each track.    As might be expected for a hard rock group, fast-paced numbers can be found in this collection.  \\"Bad Boys\\" starts out with a fast strumming which leads into the story of a boy living the fast life on the streets; and \\"Children of the Night\\" is a party song directed to fans about enjoying loud music.  In both of these tracks, John's guitar solo rises to a screeching high point which gives energy and drive to his act.  \\"Give Me All Your Love\\" is a bouncy, lively piece about a guy falling into love at first sight.  This track is also marked by a screeching guitar solo in the middle, then descends into a quieter spot with thumping and organ, then rises again with David's vocals.  Another fast-paced love song is the keyboard-driven \\"Straight for the Heart\\", where vocal harmony accompanies David; this is a very melodic piece that makes a good party song.    Relatively mid-tempo selctions can be found here too.  The well-known \\"Still of the Night\\" is a fairly long track about passionate love.  This piece has a prominent instrumental section in the middle that begins with a mellow reflective keyboard and guitar, soon followed by a faster part with \\"strings\\" and John's guitar; many listeners may say this number reminds them of Led Zepplin and Robert Plant, but this was not the intention of Whitesnake and David Coverdale.  The melancholy \\"Crying in the Rain\\" is another song that some fans say sounds like the other act.  It just so happens that both singers have a powerful voice, and both groups use guitar acts in the background.  This opening track can more easily be attributed to Whitesnake though, with John Sykes' elaborate guitar solo act in the middle, and David's screaming at the end part.    Two major hits can be found among the slow-paced items in this self-titled album.  The most popular of these is the ballad \\"Here I Go Again\\", about a man who has found himself all alone once again after a breakup.  Here, an acoustic piano can be heard toward the early part of the song, which is unique in this collection.  Those listeners who may have purchased the single version when it was available on 45 (rpm vinyl) were getting another version of this song, it does not sound quite the same as the superior album version.  The other very popular hit is the gentle sounding \\"Is This Love\\", with a flavor of rhythm-and-blues mixed in with power rock.  This soulful track stands out in contrast to many of the other pieces on this album, which are simply fast hard rock or softer power ballads; this song attained very high status on the charts.  It was later included in a compilation of popular rock ballads put together by another recording company.    The last track on this album is another slow-paced song \\"Don't Turn Away\\", in which the title gives the clue to what this is all about, the guy is begging his girl not to leave him.  Like the other ballads, this track is relatively sad, in contrast to the faster numbers on this set.  It gives a closing, ending finale to the album, and to the band lineup.  After this album was completed, John Sykes and the other members had to leave the band, with only David remaining.  There has not been another Whitesnake album with the unique touch of John's guitar ever since.    This album represents the high point of Whitesnake's career, at least in the USA.  If detailed ratings were possible, the sound quality would get 5 points on a 5-point scale, and the variety and creativity would get 5 points on a 5-point scale.  Overall, this work of art deserves 6 points on a 5-point scale but the 6 point rating is not available here.  This album should be in the possession of every Whitesnake fan.
0446677450|5.0|This book was like the proverbial lightbulb coming on in my head!  I've already lined up my first investment seminar in the next couple of weeks, and am very eager to expand my financial intelligence!  I highly recommend this book - it doesn't reveal everything you need to know (that would take an encyclopedia's worth of knowledge) but it is an EXCELLENT starting point for any beginners looking for a starting point on their road to wealth.  I highly recommend this, and have been blabbing about it endlessly to all my friends.  5 stars!
1573301183|4.0|what to say about AIC unplugged?  just awesome!  so glad they got this performance on film.  prob the greatest unplugged ever.  layne can still belt it out, even though he was obviously on the downside from his addiction.  sad watching him just sit in a chair on stage, barely mobile.  but when he opened his mouth, ahhh, that voice... just amazing!  a definate must have!  i had it on cd for yrs, but seeing it is a whole other level... just a great performance!
B000002MP2|5.0|Just felt compelled to write a review considering what I'm listening today and how far I've came from Green Day and their incredible inspirational and energetic albums, Today I'm a guy that listens from Meshuggah to Radiohead to The Beach Boys. Apart from what others have said and I quote Sonic Youth when they said \\"Green Day is not punk\\" and I disagree, they embodied the enegery, the cathartic explosion of youthful angst filtered through simplicity yet a complexity thats highly misubderstood. I believe they WERE punk and maybe they still are, but Dookie to me meant a lot. As a musician they were highly influential to me, and is an inlfluence I'll never deny. Dookie is an amazing album!
B00005NG9Z|4.0|what to say about AIC?  just one of the greatest rock bands ever.  and here all their videos collected on one dvd.  wish there was more behind the scenes stuff, but a great dvd nonetheless.  every video in its entirety.   good stuff!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I know I am going against the grain of the other reviewers here,but I have been listening to this virtually non stop for a week. I downloaded and bought the album,the cd came today while I have been listening to my downloaded version of the cd.Dylan is talking to the world through this cd.,faith,fate,working for nothing(Workingman Blues 2)and ingest some humor along the way.The musicianship is superb and the recording/production despite Dylan claiming all music sounds terrible (recording).This is undoubtely the best cd this year which has been pretty dismal.So all you naysayers go back and listen and listen,you will find a masterpeace .

B00005JO9J|4.0|I was turned onto the show by my sister and only started watching it in the second season.  Fortunately, the network started running the series over on Thursday nights so I was able to watch it all from the beginning.  It's the best writing on TV today.  So I bought the DVD to watch while on the treadmill.  Imagine my disappointment when I started watching the DVD and since I had just started the series on Thursday nights, I could spot right away that some of the episodes are abridged.  I don't know why they did this.  I would have been very confused, I think, had  I not seen the original Episode 2 The First Cut is the Deepest, and not understood how Meredith ended up at the nursery watching the babies and how she ended up carrying the severed \\"appendage\\" around all day and night.  George's part was almost entirely cut out.  They should have left the episodes intact.
B00005OMTT|3.0|This CD has a great collection of enigma songs. But the sound quality really is very bad.
B000EBEHR2|4.0|\\"Meds\\" has to be one of the most pleasant surprises of the year for me. Not because it is another strong record in Placebo's all ready consistant canon of work, but because after a greatest hits compilation and a \\"vacation\\" from each other a few years back I figured the band was going to go the way of the buffalo, call it a day and persue the ever wonderful solo projects/ new band that, hey, you know, always works, right? <br />Suffice to say Placebo are back and have put out their fifth studio record, \\"Meds\\", and almost stubbornly Placebo continue to improve and build upon their past success. <br />All press leading up to \\"Meds\\" found the band commenting on how it was going to be a rawer record, but that's not entirely true; \\"Meds\\" is really just a mix of all the best elements of their previous four albums. The record has the raw energy of Placebo's first two records, \\"Placebo\\" and \\"Without You I'm Nothing\\", with the most consistant songwriting and light electronic flourishes that marked \\"Black Market Music\\" and \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\". <br />There are no clunkers here. The ballads, like the excellent \\"Pierrot the Clown\\" or the slow building lead off title track, are melodic and properly moody but never dull. The full out rockers, like the excellent \\"Infra-Red\\"(an instant Placebo classic in my humbled opinion), are anthemic without being cheesy, and even a few experiments, like the vaguely trip hop feeling twofer \\"Space Monkey\\" and \\"Follow The Cops Back Home\\", never feel forced or tired but rather expansions of Placebo's sound. <br />Although, in the US rock press, Placebo have consistantly been compared to the Smashing Pumpkins, and although there is some truth to those comparisons, Placebo remind me more of the Cure, in their inate ability to blend the meloncholy with melody and atmosphere without ever sounding forced or phony. <br />Many people seem upset that Placebo have not just continued to write \\"Nancy Boy\\" and \\"Pure Morning\\" five times over, which is surprising since Placebo is one of the few bands that I can think of who continue to progress and grow with each succesive record, building on the strenghts of their previous records. \\"Meds\\" continues this trend excellently, and if you are a Placebo fan(or if you're not and are curious about the band), \\"Meds\\" is an excellent addition to your record collection. Easily one of the best records I have heard this year thus far.

0465092756|4.0|It is said that over the entrance to Plato's Academy hung a sign that read \\"let no one ignorant of geometry enter these walls.\\"  A similar sign should be posted on the cover of this book, also mentioning a knowledge of calculus, algebra, and number theory.  Nonetheless it is a very good book which illustrates how fads and peer pressure can effect even the most dispassionate among us.    It's basic message can be summed up as follows: 20th century physics did a great job of explaining how the world works.  By 1975 the fundamentals of underlying reality were pretty well understood, save for a few loose threads.  The most troublesome of these was the question of how to explain gravity in a way that harmonized with quantum mechanics.    A group of well-meaning mathematicians and physicists developed an idea called string theory to solve this final problem.From the first it appealed to many as an elegant and beautiful theory, and soon the physics community was singing its praises.    Unfortunately, many decades later, it remains not only unproven but unprovable.  No one has yet devised a way to make predictions from it that can be proven true or falsified, ex. the claim that there are dimensions beyond the four we currently experience.  Without the ability to empirically examine its claims, it is not science, but rather a form of mathematical philosophy.  Given this, it behooves the scientific community to look in other directions for a true unified field theory.    It takes the author 275 pages to say this, and along the way he dumps on heavy doses of higher math terminology which will leave the unitiated with their heads spinning.  Being no mathematician, I was sent to the dictionary numerous times seeking meanings for several of the terms he threw out.      I suggest that prospective readers familiarize themselves with  the following terms before tackling this book:    Imaginary numbers    Symmetry (as used in physics)    Representation Theory    Field theory    Differential Geometry    Spinors    Supergravity    And there are more that I can't think of right now...    Despite its challenges I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand the current state of thought in advanced physics.  It gives a glimpse of the dark side of science, where universiy politics and trendy ideas all too often decide how research dollars will be spent.    A suggestion to the publisher: you may want to consider including a glossary at the end of future editions, explaining the jargon in layperson's terms.    As for myself I enjoyed the mind-expanding effect that came from the struggle to understand the technical details, and I believe I was actually able to grasp the gist of most of them after supplemental study.  Mathematics experts and intellectually courageous seekers of truth should enjoy the book as well, once they grasp the significance of supersymmetrical forms not breaking down under vacuum conditions, leading to speculation about how the beta function, first studied in the 1800s, seemingly has the potential to describe an analytic s-matrix.  Elementary!
B000294SFW|5.0|Although 'Inferno' may not be the best Motorhead album w/ the current line up (I reserve that distinction for 'Bastards' or 'Sacrifice', so far), it certainly kicks some serious tail.  The two best tracks are definitely \\"In The Black\\", a grinding rant about stalking Miss Right(now), and \\"Smiling Like a Killer\\" which is an all-out revisit (but by no a re-hash) of \\"The Hammer\\".  What I don't understand is why other reviewers compare Motorhead to bands who are, at best, suited to carry Motorhead's equipment (Slayer/Metallica).  Motohead is \\"it\\"... to rock'n'roll what Cash is to folk/country.  If you want rock, buy Motorhead.

0060899190|5.0|I wasnt expecting what I was about to read, but I was glad I read it. I related to a lot of people in this book and Im sure you will too. True emotions pour out, you cant help but laugh and you cant help but cry. Im glad I just happen to come across this book!  What a quick read, less than an hour, you cant put it down.
0375831002|5.0|This book will strip you down until you are raw, vulnerable and gasping for air.  This story unravels the true meaning of love, compassion, humanity and devastation.  I recommend you read this book alone, where you can be humbled in privacy.
B000000OY9|3.0|I hated this album when I first heard it, due in large part to the fact that \\"Weight of the World,\\" the opening track, is perhaps the worst cut on the album. However, I have to agree with the reviewer who said this album has a charm. It's a weirded out charm, but for me, it's there. It's not Neil's best, but the songwriting showcases his ability to write simple catchy songs. \\"Violent Side\\" is amazing, especially the coda. Check out \\"Bad News Beat\\" with headphones, the synths really make sense. And the lyrics and structure of \\"Hard Luck Stories\\" are successful. Really, I think this album would appeal more to non-Neil fans than the hardcore Crazyhorse freaks out there. If you like Kraftwerk, if you like (or have a soft-spot for) Invisible Touch-era Genesis, then this might just be a discovery for you. For Neil fans who want to see the whole picture of his output, then this is a unique and challenging, though admittedly minor, piece to the puzzle.
B00006I53S|3.0|Was greatly disappointed in the construction of the lens. Lens tubes wobbles at 28 - 70mm but seem to tighten up above that. Does that impact picture quality? The IS is the reason I upgraded to the Canon, but instruction say to turn this function off if shooting fast moving items [horse races]or from a tri-pod [duh that makes sense] And not to use the IS if shooting from a moving vehicle of any kind. Also that the IS may take up to 1 second to stablize in low light. So I guess if you want sharp low light pictures and take your time the IS will benefit you the most. Oh, it does work in normal light if you have real shakey hands. The auto focus seems to wander more with IS on, so snap and shoot is limited. Like most I think the 28-135 is a great \\"go to\\" lens and know probably 50% of my shots have been made with that glass. But being somewhat budget concious I am disappointed in the expense for the IS function and the poor fit of the lens tube [it actually rattles!]. Don't forget a 72mm UV filter will start around $25 for a low range glass. A low range Circular Polarizer will start around $65. And like most Canon lens, a lens hood is about $25. Way to go Canon.. If I could sell mine for what I have in it, I'd go back to my Sigma 28-135mm W/Macro. But then this observation is what makes horse races, different views from different area's. I think a 28-135mm glass is a great lens, just not the expense associated with this one.
B00005U2JL|5.0|I was very pleased with the sound and video quality of this performance. It looks like a collaboration of different shows pieced together to form one hell of a spectacle. A definate must for any Marilyn Manson fan!
0060734191|5.0|How can one describe these books?? They are some of the greatest fantasy I have ever seen (and I read a lot!).  The scenes of Death...in the Old Kingdom...especially the characters of Mogget and the Disreputable Dog in _Lirael_ and _Abhorsen_ are all fantastic and imaginative.  Words cannot describe it. <br /> <br />For what it's worth, I love these so much I can list all of the Necromantic Bells.
0452270073|4.0|Regeneration by Pat Barker is a great novel depicting and justifying the anti-war movement of Siegfried Sassoon and other protesters during World War I.  Barker displays the naïveté of the young men before they are sent out to the battlefield, full of excitement fight the Germans and in their complete masculinity.   Instead these men face a more \\"feminine\\" side when they break down from their confrontation with the true horrors of the war.  Deemed mentally unstable by their superiors, the scarred soldiers are sent to recover at Craiglockhart, a convalescent hospital for combatants of the war.  Regeneration illustrates the different ideas of true valor of the various Craiglockhart patients as well as of the doctors (namely Dr. Rivers) working there.  <br /> <br />A very poignant part of the book is when Rivers visits Dr. Yealland's hospital and sits in on one of the awful treatment plans of Yealland.  Feeling immensely guilty and remorseful, Rivers sees the similarity between Yealland and himself, as they both force unsound men back onto the battlefield when these men have no more urge to fight.  Though the two doctors' opinions, personalities, and rehabilitation strategies differ drastically, Rivers still feels troubled.  Yealland's treatments further impair the conditions of his patients, whereas Rivers uses gentle encouragement and conversation about emotions to cure his own.  While many victims in the beginning look to Rivers' curative ideas as very feminine (like speaking about one's feelings), ultimately Rivers' succeeds in re-emasculating the Craiglockhart combatants.  The friendships that he forges with his various patients differ greatly from the aloof and godlike behavior that Yealland displays towards the soldiers convalescing at Queen Square. Although Rivers' therapy is much more compassionate, viewing Yealland's treatments causes Rivers to nonetheless begin to question his principles and alter his views on the war.
B00005JPE7|5.0|Boss Fan, I think you said it well.  Since the movie isn't set for release until December 22, 2006  I believe that before the \\"critics\\" can bash it, they should at least see it.  I am giving this a 5 star rating because I am a fan, and based on the first OFFICIAL trailer at [...] I think this movie will give the original Rocky a run for it's money!  Go Sly!
B000683VI4|3.0|I couldn't find this movie to rent at my local video store, and I couldn't buy it at any store I went to. Everywhere was sold-out.   It was with much anticipation that I ordered this movie.  I was desparate for a good cry and had been told by a plethora of friends and relatives that this was the movie to watch.  My sister even said that the devil probably wept when he saw this movie, as well.  I popped my popcorn, grabbed my best friend, and sat down with a box of tissues and watched...and watched....and watched.  Sweet movie, beautiful sets, pretty good acting skills....lots of great elements, but alas, no tears....  Disappointment ensued, then the self-concious idea that I might be heartless, then anger, then I decided to move on.  It's a perfectly lovely movie, but the story is, maybe, a little far-fetched. I'm sure stranger things have happened, and, frankly, there are some hot love scenes I wouldn't mind recreating.  And there you have it.  Still not sure what all the fuss is about.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you like clever, thoughtful and (a little) campy Sci-Fi; this is a great series for you. Science fiction with a Western flavor. I would not recommend it for children. You should review yourself because of some themes and off-screen actions.
1878424319|4.0|Ruiz' book is wondrously targeted to those of us who live our lives in fear and insecurity.  Based on the wisdom of the Toltec Indians, the book explains that the world we live in, our perception of that world and our feelings about the world are related to our upbringing and our \\"domestication.\\" <br /> <br />When people are domesticated, they become aware of the negative impact that all things may have on their lives.  They become insecure and fearful.  They act overly cautious and do not reveal the truth of their feelings to one another.  Ruiz tries to teach that to live a totally happy life is easy, it only takes the will to do so, and the effort of one's mind to put one in a place of pure love. <br /> <br />While over application of Ruiz' theory can lead one to stoicism and insensitivity toward others, the main thrust of the theory is to not allow others to inflict pain on you, because you have transcended this mundane reality.  You do not feel pain, even if others are directly attacking you, because you know that their attack represents errors and faults in their way of perceiving the world. <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended for all people who feel that they are bound up in a never ending nightmare, a personal hell.  This Toltec wisdom allows one to introspect and to cast out all emotional poison and fill one's heart with pure and undying love. <br />
0375422307|5.0|This was an amazing reading experience!! I loved the two books and felt it was the easiest way to learn about Iran, but most of all it is a universal story of a young girl and her emotions, relationships with boy friend, parents, husband, girl friends and grandmother   it is wonderful and i will share with my daughters
B000059Z8J|5.0|My title says it all.  This two sided disc is LOADED with special extras.  Outstanding commentary track with Richard Donner and amazing extras showing how they made Superman fly, all deleted scenes added to the movie and shown separately, screen tests of various actors trying out for the role of Superman, Lois Lane, etc., just loaded with outstanding extras.  I can't say enough about this DVD and what's most amazing of all about this disc is the low price.  It could easily sell for triple the price and still be a bargain.
6304698623|5.0|I am rarely moved by a film as I have with this one.  This film is fairly flawless with wonderful (not over the top) acting, zgreat wonderful visuals and a poignant adaptation of the novel.  Liesel Matthews is just wonderful never going over the top.  It would be so easy to camp it up and get that hollywood feel but instead you are drawn into a story of complexity and drama.  I can't help but think about Oliver Twist when I see this film but it's a different story altogether.  I recall when this first came out and Gene Siskel argued that despite wonderful films like this, everyone complains that no family fair exists.  It's out there if you look for it.  This is a real gem that sadly tanked in the cinema.
B00021R7CG|4.0|This flick was first aired as an HBO special movie. It was as riveting and conscience-raising as the original movie Fail Safe, not to mention a stellar cast, all in small but integral roles. I recommend it highly, it entertained my then pre-teen sons to the end result of taping it, and ultimately wearing the tape out. Enjoy!
B000FZETIO|4.0|Like every Pretty in Pink fan I was excited about the up coming release of the Pretty in Pink Everything's Duckie Edition, the previous DVD edition was lacking in any features. More over I thought I would finally see the much talk about original ending with Duckie and Andie Dancing to \\"Heroes\\" by Bowie; well even thought the packaging says \\"THE ORIGINAL ENDING: The Lost Dance\\" in big bold letters, this is not the case. The only thing they show of the original ending is footage of them shooting the original ending and brief bits footage at that, the rest is just the actors and the director talking about the original ending. TALK? Is the footage lost? After all the hype online about finally being about to see the original ending and some very deceptive packaging this is a huge let down. I am happy to see this movie get a better DVD treatment, but the other great features on the disc seem over shadowed by this lacking feature that seemed promised. If this is the only reason you are planning on updating your disc is to have the original ending, be warned, if you want interviews with the cast and director than the DVD delivers.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Nine times out of ten, when you buy a CD on the strength of one song you heard on the radio, you're gonna get burned.  In this case the purchase worked out, and the remarkable virtuosity of Muse was laid before me.  Where do I begin? Muse sounds like... well, who hasn't been mentioned yet?  I'll tell you who, System of a Down is in there, alongside the barrage we've already heard; Radiohead, Queen, ELO, and reportedly Rush, though I'm yet to detect it.  Yes, I did catch the classical music references, and- somebody stop me- did I actually hear a Theremin in there, or is it just particularly ethereal and bizarre keyboard work?    Let's face it, Muse is their own band doing their own thing.  Music, writing- art in general- is a cannibalistic enterprise that borrows from what has gone before.  What is important is building on what has been done previously, and Muse has constructed a musical castle on the foundations laid by others.  Sometimes you think a song is promising more than it can deliver, starting with duelling Latin guitars and a clog dance, yet somehow building on that theme to deliver rock opera of the likes unheard since Meatloaf and Queen. Not to be stranded in a genre, Muse deftly slides into a Depeche Mode beat, dance-trance psychedelics for a backdrop, or the sound of Prince in his heyday.    Muse is quite simply their own band with their own sound, and they have to be heard to be believed.
1591396190|3.0|I have never made the time to review a book, but this book came highly reccommended by other reviewers.  Since I cant know their business backgrounds, I'd like to help someone else in making the decision of reading this book. <br />This book is a little \\"pie-in-the-sky\\" optimistic.  The business examples they use are most likely the only business in the world that can compete using the blue ocean theory.  (I believe the businesses used as examples in this book do not know they were using a blue ocean theory to get where they are, they are just the lucky few) <br /> <br />If you are in sales and a potential client asks you, \\"What makes you different than the competition?\\"  You know your answer is always total BS, \\"We care about our clients, and are regularly using new methodologies to develop the proper tools to cultivate long lasting relationships with them...\\" (You know your lines)  If a potential client has to ask you this question, you are not using Blue Ocean business planning.  If you were, you would be so different than the rest, clients would flock to you.  Think about how few businesses out there can actually say they have no direct competition? <br /> <br />I see a few Blue Oceans that I did not recognize before reading this book: <br /> <br />1. Time Travel <br />2. Teleportation <br />3. Reincarnation <br />4. Cure for Cancer <br />5. Cure for AIDS <br />6. World Peace Model <br /> <br />I may sound jaded, but I have never held a job, nor do I want one.  I have been out on my own in the business world since 1987.  This book presents some food for thought in where you can compare yourself to the competition but the changes necessary to be a complete Blue Ocean may require ground up rebuilding of your business or a complete business change. <br />

B000G759LW|1.0|She is amazing and talented, there is no question about that. I am a huge fan of her both for her music and her as a person. I was so excited to hear the new album was finally out. I love \\"Ain't no other man,\\" so I was excited to hear what the rest of it sounded like. I don't get it. I listened to it and was like \\"ehh, it's different.\\" Everything sounds the same and is more like a journal entry then a song. Unlike \\"Stripped,\\" it didn't feel like a journal entry that was made into a good song. It was missing the personal touch of that album. It felt like an attempt to make a themed album in a particular genre and just didn't feel like all the material even connected with her.\\"Candyman,\\" sounds like a sample of \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,\\" to me. Hopefully I'll like the remixes. Sorry to all the other xtina fans, I don't mean any harm.
0895260131|5.0|It is becoming patently obvious to even casual observers that there are reviewers who simply have not read the books they are treating...or they have such a bias that if these books re. the Islamic threat made a statement that 'the Sun rises in the East and sets in the West' the book would be attacked as  an assault on the good name of Islam....Caveat Emptor is the guiding phrase. I have read this book and 'Londonistan' and could not be more impressed with the straightforward delivery of fact after fact after fact. As Daniel Moynihan said \\"you do get to have your opinions...you do not get to have your own set of facts\\". (sound odd Ms. Wilkes??) If Spencer, for example used third or fourth party sources rather than the Koran itself as well as 1300 years of history showing that conversion to Islam 'at the point of a sword' (a la the FOX reporters!) IS THE NORM and NOT the exception, then perhaps --perhaps--she would have a case.  She does not.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|Star Trek- Nemesis redefines what Star Trek means. With the departure of Riker, Troi and the death of Data we have \\"gone where no one has gone before\\" and we shall never see these days again. <br />Captain Picard has his memories of Will and Deanna but with B4 he has a living, breathing reminder of Data. Giving his life was the ultimate sacrifice and was the point (to me) where he really became human. He gave his life for his fellow man which is the greatest thing anyone can do. Star Trek-Nemesis will forever stand in my mind as one of the greatest Star Trek movies ever. There should be no more sequels-this story has gone as far as it needs to: WHERE NO ONE HAS GONE B4!!!
B0007P3582|1.0|This album really was properly titled the massacre. That pretty much summed up the experience. The more I hear this idiot stumble over his words like a 90 year old stroke victim, the more I wana vomit. I can't believe this [...] is selling. I would like to thank todays youth for allowing \\"music\\" like this to stick around. It shows how true music is losing its grasp in today's society. This is why I don't listen to any rap made after the mid 90's.
1594200823|5.0|In this well-sourced, comprehensive, and non-sensational \\"tome\\", the author explores and exposes the behind-the-scenes version of ou r food (and food supply) chains.  The first part of the book looks mostly into the issues related to corn, the second looked at similar issues from the standpoint of 'grass' - animal husbandry. The third part on hunting seemed more or less a misfit in the book, though the discussion on ethics regarding hunting was fairly interesting.  Very often, the argument for vegetarianism is based purely on ethics ( I grew up one mostly for religious reasons). This book clearly presents an objective case for that, though that per-se does not seem to be the intent of the author. A critic may be able to be nitpick some oversimplifications in observations especially when the author sometimes goes off on a tangent describing events related to his childhood or seemingly unrelated events.  However, the mere gravity of the theme, the simple narrative style and the objective tone of the book clearly overrides any such minor defects. Using a first-person narrative style, the author easily connects to the reader and is able to convey very interesting observations convincingly. The reader should be aware that the book is fairly long and though written in a very simple style, does require some investment of time to read, reflect, and critique. This book, along with \\"Fast Food Nation\\", perhaps clearly captures the essence of our current dietary habits and the problems associated with it.  A must-have.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First off, this review is NOT directed to Slipknot. This is cut and pasted from a lamb of god review. But due to the clonelike nature of thrash you can apply it to slayer, cannible corpse, and whatever other thrash bands are out there. When will everyone(being the ten fans that thrash metal has) wake up and realize how lame thrash metal is. It's worse than pop. Nowhere in this noisy, s****y, abomination of metal and any of the other albums did I hear at least one measure of music that sounded somewhat like a pre thought, put together tune. It all sounds exactly the same and every band seems to have the same idiotic gimmick that gets more annoying each and every day. \\"Hey look at me I have blood on my album and I worship satan. I also weigh 80 pounds soaking wet with my idiotic looking thrash metal shirt on that you can see from miles. Look how much gore my shirt has. Cool huh...Thats hardcore man. Wana be the 8th person to buy my album? I'm trying to break my last record of 12 album sales. We are talented because we can play crappy riffs fast and YELL EVERY SINGLE LYRIC\\". Thats why the only time you hear a good band with any kind of melody or originality in this genre(Slipknot, killswitch engage) you hate it. Must be because they actually attempted to push the boundries beyond constant screaming and \\"xeroxed\\" songs. I look forward to the day when I will no longer have to sit through a thrash metal band during a concert opener(because those are the only sets you can get). Just go to hell, i mean thats what most of your \\"music\\" is about anyways. You like to say that you are carrying on the music and traditions of megadeath and pantera...GIVE ME A F****N BREAK!!! Those bands have tons more talent that all of the new \\"heavy metal\\" bands put together. So do us all a favor and end your retarded, clonelike, talentless movement. I swear I'd rather listen to a disgusting sounding ashlee simpson record than this. One more thing, I find it ironic that you hate alt-metal beingthat I always see you opening for THEIR shows. You F***in hippocrites.      With that said, about the album review...It's great to hear a new metal band with some sort of depth and talent. Great album by slipknot    - Yours truly      one more thing- \\"Snively Azagthoth Robotnik \\"Dr. Robotnik's Henchman\\" (Robotropolis, Mobius)\\" How g@y is that?
B000G759LW|5.0|This album is so good, it should be called back to what everyone else should be doing with their music. Christina's voice always screamed jazz and it was great she was able to actually make that her muse in this album. With so many standout tracks on this album, it's hard to decide which is the best. I think the most well written song is \\"Save From Me Myself\\". It's amazing how she put together what most of us feel when have found \\"the one\\". \\"The Right Man\\" also follows that theme, but you really feel like you are in a church watching someone get married with this song. \\"Still Dirrty\\" answers all those questions about her \\"turning\\" prim and proper. \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" gives it an exclamtion point. I personally loved \\"Stripped\\", but this album is a best album of the year nominee for sure. In my humble, it's this year's \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\". X-Tina is back.

B00000JGOH|5.0|I first saw this movie some years ago but only seriously started reading about Shakespeare, his life and times since then. Recently I had the opportunity to see the movie again, this time on DVD. The movie, although an imaginative creation, is well rooted in historical realities. Shakespeare was a commercial artist in commercial theatre, Shakespeare's plays were the popular entertainment of his day, the City of London regularly threatened the 'low brow' theatre entertainment industry with closure, Shakespeare often wrote parts for his favourite actors and his theatre's stars. All these aspects are illustrated in this rollicking screen play. And it leaves us with the question, surely Shakespeare must have been in love to write of love so passionately.<br /><br />This irreverent production is actually uplifting. Shakespeare was probably the greatest artist of all time, but he wasn't an inhabitant of some ethereal Mount Olympus, he and his work is down to earth. That's what makes him and his work great.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I actually bought this season one box set because a friend of mine said it was great. I saw part of an episode and wasn't totally sold... at first. Then I got sucked into it! I am almost done watching the box set, then I can open up my Serenity DVD and watch that!!! I just can't see how some shows are on TV and this one is not, or, at least had a chance at a second season. Original idea combining science ficiton with western... I love it! I recommend checking it out!

B0007KTBIU|5.0|Loosely rooted in real American history and based upon people who once actually lived, \\"Pocahontas\\" is a very different kind of animated classic from the House of Mouse. It's the tale of a beautiful, free-spirited, young (but not as young as Disney's usual) Native American princess who crosses paths with an English explorer named John Smith, only to have romance quickly develop between them. John Smith arrives in the Americas just in time for Pocahontas, who is troubled by her father's wish that she marry hometown hero Kocoum and, confused all the more by a mysterious dream, is in search of a different path to follow. John Smith is also in search of something, and when he finds Pocahontas, he thinks he has found it. The problem is, John is filled with prejudices against Pocahontas and her people, until she shows him the light. She teaches him about the beauty and wonder of nature and how we are all connected to each other. But love makes John an easy sell. His fellow English settlers are not quite so easily convinced. They only see the Indians as dangerous savages that must be destroyed to make the area safe to live in. Matters are made worse by the greed of their leader, Governor Ratcliffe, who is convinced the savages are hoarding the gold he can't seem to find by digging up the land. Their violent actions lead to violent reactions from the tribe, which culminate in a fiery confrontation that only Pocahontas's love and understanding can bring to peace.<br /><br />The first time I saw Pocahontas, and for long after that, I had mixed feelings about it. I'm a hardcore Disney fan, and there's little I hate more than to be disappointed in a Disney animated feature. Unfortunately, this was something I had to deal with for... possibly the first time ever in theaters upon seeing \\"Pocahontas.\\" Not doubt, \\"Pocahontas\\" was always a gorgeous film. The art is Disney at its best, and the music and songs are truly beautiful. The comic relief, in the form of Pocahontas's animal friends, is right on the money. The voice cast is top notch, with Mel Gibson as John Smith and Irene Bedard as Pocahontas (Judy Kuhn doing her wonderful singing voice), David Ogden Stiers as Ratcliffe and his servant, Wiggins, Russell Means as Chief Powhatan, Christian Bale, Linda Hunt, and more rounding out the cast, but there was just something missing,...something crucial. I soon decided that the problem was in the villain, Governor Ratcliffe, who just wasn't villain ENOUGH for my tastes. This sudden realization of what was wrong with \\"Pocahontas\\" was a big mistake, but it's one that is still commonly made. I failed to see then, that the true villain of \\"Pocahontas\\" is not Governor Ratcliffe at all, but \\"prejudice\\" itself. This is something that is even pointed out in the DVD's audio commentary, but, of course, I only heard that recently. My bad. I should have been able to see past the expected to the pretty obvious. However, while this knowledge does help improve the movie somewhat, it still doesn't take it from, \\"good, but not quite `Disney' good,\\" to \\"Instant Disney Classic.\\" As it turned out, the secret lay in a cut musical number: \\"If I Never Knew You.\\" One day, while watching the network television premiere of \\"Pocahontas\\" on ABC, I learned about a beautiful and wrongfully cut scene from the film in which John Smith, while awaiting his execution, shares a romantic duet with Pocahontas in which the two truly expose their feelings for and to each other. It's the moment in the movie where we truly get the feeling that these two love each other, and not having it in the film was a horrible mistake! And, why did they cut it? Because little kids were bored with it. Thank goodness for DVDs and Special Editions! In this 2-disc, 10th Anniversary DVD release of Pocahontas, that glorious scene has been completed and restored to the film, and it makes all the difference in the world! There's even a new reprise of the song near the end as Pocahontas and John Smith exchange two lines, and that moment will bring you to tears! After finally viewing the movie with \\"If I Never Knew You\\" intact, I can happily say that \\"Pocahontas\\" has gone from one of my least favorite Disney films to one of the best! There may be no drop-dead gorgeous, redheaded mermaids and no delightful singing bears, but Disney has managed to take a more real and serious subject and turn it into a wonderful new masterpiece! Now, if they could only fix \\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire.\\"<br /><br />As for the DVD, this incredible 10th Anniversary Edition is a huge improvement over the Gold Collection release. The film has been digitally remastered and is presented in anamorphic widescreen. Your are given the option of viewing \\"Pocahontas\\" as it plays, which means the \\"extended cut\\" with \\"If I Never Knew You\\" intact, or choosing the shorter, far inferior theatrical cut. Why would anyone want to do that? Still, options are always nice to have. Disc One also includes a fine and informative audio commentary with producer and directors that will only heighten your appreciation of the film. An art project, game, and two sing-along-songs (\\"Colors of the Wind\\" and \\"Just Around the River Bend\\") are included on Disc One as well, along with the Vanessa Williams video for the pop version of \\"Colors of the Wind.\\" Remember how they used to play Disney songs like that on the radio during the Disney Decade? That was so cool.<br /><br />Disc Two is loaded with great extras for the serious animation enthusiast. There's an enjoyable making-of featurette hosted by Irene Bedard, an early production reel, loads of galleries and clips on one of my favorite subjects: character development (art design, layouts, and backgrounds are also covered), scene production comparison reels, the pop video for \\"If I Never Knew You,\\" a featurette on the music of the film, and one about the decision to restore the movie's (very necessary) cut scene. One of the highlights of the DVD extras for me was definitely the discovery of the thankfully deleted talking turkey character, Redfeather, while what some might consider a low point is the lack of insight given into the real history behind Pocahontas, Smith, and the others. Further extras include an awesome selection of fascinating deleted scenes, two theatrical trailers, a neat featurette on the movie's ambitious premiere in Central Park (on a row of 8-story movie screens), a multi-language clip reel of the Oscar Winning song, \\"Colors of the Wind,\\" and a very cool publicity gallery which includes a fun fashion spread from Harper's Bazaar that used Pocahontas as a model! Yes, you get to see Pocahontas drawn in modern clothes, in full color, and she looks darn good, even if I am more of a Tink and Ariel man myself!<br /><br />The is one DVD Edition I can't recommend enough, primarily because it presents a movie you've seen before as you've never seen it before, and, in this case, I think most people will find the extension to be a huge improvement. Bottom-line, even if you weren't a fan of \\"Pocahontas\\" before, do yourself a favor and check it out one more time in its extended cut. It's not the same experience.

B000F6IOC0|5.0|Loved it.  It is even better than \\"Underworld\\".  I liked the continuation of the story.  The story didn't drag.  I hope they make another sequel.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I loved this movie...Its like a detective story, using younger people to pull it off..And thats just the beginning. The cast is just incredible and the director is a awesome...This movie is on the top of my charts...Check it out....

The 4 \\"rules to live by,\\" if you will, could be viewed as basic but can and help to change your life if you are vested in learning the techniques and aquiring a stronger sense of self.  Highly recommend especially for those who struggle with who they were taught to be Vs. Who they actually are.  Learn to rid of guilt, learn from mistakes and move on.  Learn to trust yourself and be who you want to be. <br /> <br />All in all a great lesson though I disagree with some of the wording or interpretation of words.
1577314808|5.0|This book has been a blessing to me, and I think like many things - you get out of it what you put into it! Many times, I would find myself astonished at how situations being described were 100% dead-on and relative to my same experiences. Once you realize how stuck we become in learned patterns, you realize that change is in order and this book is a great start into finding your own reality and peace. There are times you may need to read passages and even chapters over and over again until it makes sense or sinks in. In fact, as soon as I was done with my first read, I immediately started over again. I bought this 3 months ago and I am on my 3rd time through - each time you will grasp more and challenge yourself to accept new ways of perceiving things. When I am overly stressed, I will pick it up and just read until I feel calm again.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|This is a good album. A good Depeche Mode album at that. I like the direction the band took with this album. It almost has a industrial feel to it. While it is darker than some of their older stuff, I wouldn't call it darker than say, Ultra. Anyways, I've enjoyed this album alot, even though I'm not what you would call a hardcore or devoted DM fan.<br /><br />The album does have a remarkabe flow too it, from begining too end.  There are times when it feels like I'm listening to NIN, I know others feel the same way. But thats not a bad thing, and I think this is a great \\"return\\" album for the band. There isn't a weak spot in the whole album and some spots sound....almost \\"magical\\" for lack of a better word. My two personal favorite tracks are \\"Precious,\\" and \\"Damaged People.\\" Precious is easily one of DM greatest songs. Other great tracks are A Pain That I'm Used To, John The Revelator, & Lillian.<br /><br />Well done Depeche Mode.
B000FIMG68|5.0|It may not be as exciting as season one, but there is a lot more action. If you like romance and junk like that this season doesn't have too much of it, but I will say there is some. It was not as good as season 1, mostly because of the season finally. It does  not make you as excited for season 3 as I was for season 2. Overall it was a great season.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse first caught my attention with Absolution which I loved. Then I went backwards in the Muse discography and started listening to Origin of Symmetry, which is a genius album in its own right. Both of those albums are fantastic and worth having in your collection. With that said, I was interested to hear the new Muse album. How would Black Holes and Revelations compare with the previous two albums?<br /><br />Quite well, and in fact it easily surpasses Absolution and is on par with Origin of Symmetry. On first listen, there were a number of songs I liked. But this is one of those albums that only gets better the more you listen, and in my opinion that is a sign of a high quality album. It has lasting value and you won't quickly get burned out on it.<br /><br />Black Holes and Revelations is a beautiful album, it really is. Muse has to be one of the mose unique and creative bands to come out in years. People have compared Muse to bands like Radiohead and Queen, and while shades of both bands are found in Muse's music, Muse have created a sound that is all their own while at the same time paying tribute to some of their musical influences.<br /><br />The album starts off with a bang on the track, Take A Bow. A powerful song directed towards some of the political leaders in the world, you hear Bellamy's enchanting voice saying, \\"You Will Burn, You Will Burn...\\" Awesome song. The second track, Starlight is also a fantastic song, and more upbeat than Take A Bow. Map of the Problematiqu is one of my favorite tracks, a fast paced spacey song with some clever guitar work on it. Assasain is track 7, and its another one of my favorite tracks, I love the introduction, its a hard song, yet melodic at the same time. Knights of Cydonia is a excellent way to end the album. Its the most electronic song found here, and its very epic and broad in its scope. It sounds like vintage Queen at some parts. But I don't find that to be a bad thing, as its sounds awesome. One of the great things about this album, is that despite hearing some crazy sounds and electronica, Bellamy's voice fits in and flows perfectly with the music, adding a great cohesive feel to the album.<br /><br />Conclusion, Black Holes and Revelations is a broad and epic album. If your a Muse fan, don't hesitate to buy this album, its among some of the best work they have ever done, and its one of the best albums of 2006.great things about this album, is that despite hearing some crazy sounds and electronica, Bellamy's voice fits in and flows perfectly with the music, adding a great cohesive feel to the album. <br /> <br />Conclusion, Black Holes and Revelations is a broad and epic album.

0790749858|1.0|My daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school. It wasn't until years later that I saw it, and I was HORRIFIED!!! This was a movie aimed at children??? What does a children's movie need a sexy bunny for? The lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and \\"strutting her stuff\\" on the basketball court in a very provocative manner, until the male characters were panting, drooling, and clawing their way after her like a bunch of  sick, depraved perverts. This scene was highly innapropriate for children, and is NOT the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls. Not only that, the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities. This movie should be kept far, far away from children, and was truly deserving of zero stars.
0375422889|5.0|It causes wonder with its sensitive and prudent style and, ultimately, by its incredibly smart, honest and thoughtful result.
B000G759LW|2.0|I was intrigued by this concept album and bought it on its strength.  I'm sad to say that although there are some fun moments on the album where everything gels nicely, mostly it feels overbloated and surprisingly, a bit directionless.<br /><br />Christina mixes in some old sounds and horns to conjure memories of the past, but never goes far enough.  She stops short at conjuring the innocent fun and musicality of teh time.  Instead she samples which I find a bit shallow.  All the songs definately sound of this era and not of the past.  Add in the trite pean to fans \\"Thank You\\" and the cloying \\"The Right Man\\" along with \\"Save Me FromMyself\\" and you begin to see the half-hearted effort in actually paying respect to the past and building upon it.<br /><br />I applaud the idea (and wish it was done more often) but the execution on this album fails to live up to expectations.
0679422714|5.0|Raised in China with the Chinese language and culture, Jung Chang has the ability to present a view of Mao from the inside looking out, thus giving us her unique perspective. I recommend reading Ms Chang's book with Jonathan Fenby's biography of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Mr. Fenby of course being a westerner who views China from the outside looking in.

B000002UJQ|2.0|I have tried many times to get behind this album. I have even tried to buy the hype. It just isn't that great. I dont even think it is good. I like the song Karma Police but that is it. One reveiwer is pointing out how we who give it a low rating must be musically immature. I disagree. I dont care for the album. Get over it.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Great music.  Makes you want to get up and dance - or sing - or both.  Filming in a New York winter helps to really bring you into their angst.  I loved it.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is the definitive rock and roll record.  Not just because the music itself is great but because on this album the Rolling Stones literally define rock and roll by showing us it's evolution.  There's gospel, blues, country, rockabilly, soul, and of course the sum of all those parts called rock and roll. <br /> <br />The atmosphere is dark, murky, smokey, and boozey and I think it's the perfect album to listen to at night.  And this album has so much damn soul. Every song rocks and rolls and's filled with soul.  I love it.  <br /> <br />\\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile on Main Street\\" are the two greatest rock and roll records I've ever heard but \\"Exile on Main Street\\" just barely edges \\"Sticky Fingers\\" out because of it's great atmosphere. <br />
630460291X|4.0|Review Disclaimer:  Please note, this review is for the original DVD release, not the special edition 2 disc set.<br /><br />First of all, I know this will get me a few unhelpful votes, but I have to get this off my chest.  This is the first DVD I have ever seen, that requires you to turn the disc over to watch the 2nd half of the movie.  This movie was no longer than 160 minutes (I forget the exact length) and I have watched plenty of 2 hour plus movies, and TV sets, which last up to 3+ hours per disc.  For the life of me, I don't know why the production company decided to split up this movie.<br /><br />Since this was very unclear on the copy I rented, I inadvertently, started the DVD on the side of the 2nd half of the movie, being completely clueless why the movie started in such an unusual way.  Keep in mind, so very few DVD's are like this. Also, the movie starts up right away, and no menu pops up, so you are clueless.<br /><br />I can only remember Laser Disc movies doing this, of which I am also a collector, so I would think that my knowledge of this format is what made me realize what the problem was, as quickly as I did.  I'm sure other customers must have had this same issue, I'll check the reviews after I get done writing this one.<br /><br />Now, the movie:  Phenomenal, understated, and absolutely breathtaking cinematography.  Kevin Costner does the worst British accent I've ever heard (Hello, Madonna!), but that is beside the point.  I think he does a wonderful rendition.<br /><br />I would love to see the special edition of this movie sometime.  Maybe I'll rent it.<br /><br />MC White said:  Two thumbs WAY up!!!

B00009XITP|5.0|I rented this movie from my famous well known online rental service (not the most popular one, the second most popular one) for my spouse, and boy was I stunned, and stymied!  I think I'm gonna start ordering more movies for my wife, because every time I do, I get a rare jewel!  And such was the case again!<br /><br />This movie is the classic \\"fish out of water\\" story, the one we've seen a millions times, but when you have a cute teen female, with enough Charisma to get OJ acquitted 10 times over, you know you have a winner. I had never heard of Amanda Bynes, (sorry, I'm not quite yet with the Nickelodeon crowd!) but I immediately wanted to know everything else, Amanda was in, after seeing this movie.<br /><br />A refreshing \\"remake\\" of an old classic, The Reluctant Debutante, another movie that I had not seen, or would ever consider putting on my Rental Queue, one that splashes some water on a dry, weathered face of a middle-aged man.<br /><br />Check out the commentaries, for an interesting explanation of the behind the scenes, etc.  Amanda's overview is a bit \\"kiddish\\" but that just makes you like her more.  Very charming, and charismatic.<br /><br />I highly recommend this. You will be cheering for the Yank, by the end.<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!  You'll love it!
0385334176|4.0|Vonnegut's mordant humour, born from dark despair is in full flight with this novel. His characters are haplessly and passively accepting of the card tricks Fate shuffles; cards turned with lusty zappiness. As he deepened his craft, Vonnegut's books eased into conversational pace. The quality is detectable from the early awkwardness of,'Mother Night' to this smooth,'Dead Eye'. At the height of his powers he gave us,'Cat's Cradle'(my introduction to his writing & still my favourite), 'Slaughterhouse Five,'(made into a passable movie) and later,'Bluebeard'. All of Vonnegut is worthy stuff.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|..but I really liked this band. Being a drummer with a jazz/fusion-background this type of playing was never something I heard very often, but I can guarantee that any drummer looking for speed will not be let down. The drummers doublepedal work is unbelivable. The singer is terrible but I should probably just accept the fact that it's what most people listening to this genre wants to hear and I'll go with that. A wall of noice is a good way of describing the sound. Nice little tempochanges here and there keeps me listening.

Denzel Washington is one of my favorites, and here he plays a slightly scruffy, smart, wisecracking detective. He gets off a few great one-liners--in trying to calm down an irate Sikh whose turban is removed by police and screams and yells about discrimination, Washington says \\"I bet you don't have trouble getting a cab in NYC.\\" A bank is robbed and the burglars disappear--he's just smart enough to be puzzled, rather than simply frustrated.  <br /> <br />Jodie Foster is marvelous as a shadowy \\"fixer\\" of problems--who exactly is she?--we never really know. Clive Owen is the brains behind the operation--and a clever one it is. <br /> <br />We only begin to see what must have happened in the last scene or two--the burglars have high motives, and the real \\"bad guy\\" is nailed. We left the theatre with heads spinning, only then understanding the clues that had been left along the way. I suppose there were holes--but not so many as to mar this thoroughly enjoyable film.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This movie is a timeless comedy. Anyone from a college freshman laughing at how crazy his/her college life can be to a corporate executive reliving their college conquests can relate to this movie. It is one of the all-time greats!
0596000480|5.0|This book truly is the grand daddy of them all!  The depth of Javascript resources is immense.  I cannot even begin to think of the number of times this book has saved my bacon when working on a particularly sticky issue.  Also, having the complete list of methods and properties in one place is extremely helpful.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0007MAO0M|5.0|this western had an adult format with a realistic story and the scenery and backdrop excellent. the time of year was obviously cold and damp right down to the actors breaths.  each actor was well picked for movie. I thoroughly enjoyed all the details given to each setting such as saloon, restaurant etc.. very entertaing movie.
B000GGSM94|4.0|Even though I have never been a fan, and I know little more about them than what I've heard on their various CD's, I've been asked to write reviews for eight different albums by the Cure. My indifference makes me an outsider, so Cure fans hate my reviews, while everyone else simply ignores them. To me, it's an ironic conundrum - writing these reviews provides a form of self-torture that is actually very Robert Smith-ian in its own way. If anything, that should help me to understand the band a bit better, and maybe it is working, because in the process, I've grown to like \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me.\\" I bought this album upon its release in 1990, but I never appreciated it. To me, it droned on endlessly, meandering from song to song with no sense of structure to support any of it. I still think of it that way, except now I hear the droning as an advantage, and I appreciate its lack of structure for the diversity it provides.<br /><br />A 2-CD set may be a bit much, especially when the `bonus' disk contains little more than vocal-less demo recordings. By the time you hear Smith's caterwaul on track 10 (\\"A Thousand Hours\\"), it's genuinely disconcerting, so you may want to permanently glue the `bonus' disk inside the package. The original album is a different story entirely. The leadoff track, entitled \\"The Kiss,\\" best encapsulates my change of heart. My impression from 1990 had me wondering \\"Christ, what is he kissing, a sea monster?\\" Today, it still sounds ominous, but for some reason, it also sounds somewhat enticing, like a sensual attraction toward something forbidden. \\"Catch\\" is completely different and actually catchy, especially for the Cure. It is also extraordinarily gentle for a band that is so obsessed with chaos. It even has violins!<br /><br />The inconsistency that I suggested earlier causes the album's mood to veer all over the place, and the predictably morose drone of \\"If Only Tonight I Could Sleep\\" is telltale of what I do not like about the band - a dull, uninspired one-chord drone, with the slight novelty of sitars and such providing only marginal interest. Luckily, things snap back to attention almost instantly with \\"Why Can't I Be You.\\" Lyrically, the song fits the band's formula, except they disguise their self-loathing with an upbeat, double-time rhythm and poppy horn charts (played on keyboard) that could have been borrowed from Madness. Speaking of surprises, did you ever in your wildest imagination picture the Cure as a funk band? Me either, but \\"Hot Hot Hot!!!\\" is almost convincing, in a pasty, `80s English sort of way. \\"Hey You\\" rocks out and even has a saxophone solo, while \\"Just Like Heaven\\" is almost happy, even!<br /><br />Perhaps I subconsciously felt compelled to retain my prejudice against the Cure (was it ever a secret?), but little by little, \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\" wore me down. The sheer quantity of material might have something to do with it, because 18 tracks is a LOT of music, and yet the band keeps things interesting throughout. Previously, I dismissed the Cure as a band capable of conveying one mood (depression) with expertise, but this album broadens their palette considerably. Here, they reach out for new territory and they deserve credit for it, especially since they succeed most of the time. They still sound like a dour bunch of doughboys, but at least I now know that they are capable of more than one mood.

B000002MG1|5.0|Let's face it: all these Amazon reviews are written by those that either love or hate the product. Even the worst (stuff) will get 5 stars if the owner likes it.   I must admit I never liked REM until I heard Nightswimming. It is, as some have written, a peon to the road not taken. And perhaps that is why it connects with my nostalgic soul so deeply. It paints a picture (diffferent for each listener, to be sure) of some moment in time when a decision was put into action, or a love was lost, or a cosmic mistake was made and all that's left is memory. It is nostalia, regret and heartbreak writen in song and framed by the sad, sweet melody of a lonesome piano.  You can find your own connection, to be sure. But I guarantee, you will find it in this song, if not this album.
0689865384|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendations I found online and I'm really glad I did. The synopsis has already been well described here. I just want to add my \\"thumbs WAAAY up\\" to all the other glowing reviews. As I read this book, I kept thinking of how the concept of beauty changes so much over time. I wonder what will be considered beautiful in 300 years (about the time this series is set). I was also wondering who got to decide what was beautiful when the operations started, and had it evolved over time. Interesting things to ponder as you read...but making you think is what really good fiction should do.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I always consider Pink Floyd to be a class act. As they have said the music is the important thing. Not about them. After seeing the concert in 1994 I see what they mean. Great DVD but I thought the production crew extra didn't fit in. Mainly the couple of geeks that spend most of their time chasing down beer and acting stupid. That would be something you would find on a Motley Crue Dvd.
0783117523|4.0|Nice movie with a resonable story and a keeper for anyone looking to add in his collection great nude scenes with Angelina Jolie. <br /> <br />:-)
0783240287|4.0|when I saw the play in Branson last summer, I absolutely loved it!  This DVD was great entertainment also.  I showed it at our Vacation Bible School, and the kids loved it too.  a couple of parts were a bit racey, but over all it was great.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I had popped this movie in my DVD player one night, thinking that I would only start watching the first ten minutes or so. But after the first 5 minutes I was hooked until the very end! The movie is very thought provoking and stayed on my mind long after it was over. However, there was one slight little problem that I had. When I realized whose voice was behind the mask, it sort of messed it up a little for me.... but I got over that. ^_^ After all I loved his performance, and Natalie Portman's. Brilliant.
B000DN6ZGC|4.0|Ahhhhh Yessssss..... Another great voice. Great to hear that the youth of today still have what it takes to keep up the great tradition of awesome vocal talent. Great tunes from start to finish here. Corinne is the next big name in a long line of great Jazz influenced singers.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Dylan's blend of blues and folk music may not appeal to everyone, but I think he sounds very good.  Rollin and Tumblin and Thunder On The Mountain are my two favorite songs here.  They sound so upbeat, and I enjoyed them very much.  Beyond The Horizon and Aint Talkin are two very spiritual songs about having faith in a higher power and the after life.  This is a very pretty song.  When The Deal Goes Down is a track about remaining loyal to a friend when times are tough.  Nettie Moore is a good song about a drifter who plays in a cowboy band.  It is a song with a deep beat  I think Working Man's Blues and Someday Baby are two tracks that prove that Dylan is a skilled blues guitarist.  Spirit on The Water is a beautiful song about how friendship can turn into love.  The Levee's Gonna Break is a highlight track about someone getting out of prison trying to start a new life.  This song is about how difficult the readjustment process can be for someone in that situation.  Dylan's latest musical effort is one of his best.
0452270073|4.0|While reading Regeneration, I particularly enjoyed Pat Barker's ability to integrate the poetry of various writers, like Sassoon and Owen, into the setting of a war hospital during World War I. I thought it was interesting to see Sassoon express his feelings of resentment and defiance against the war through his poetry. In the beginning of the book, Sassoon uses active measures to express his feelings by writing a declaration against the war and actively speaks about his resentment against the unnecessary suffering caused by war. However, Sassoon later learns that acting defiant against those in power will just get him in further trouble. Therefore, Sassoon starts using a more passive approach to expressing his opinions, \\"All the anger and grief now went into the poetry\\" (221).  <br />I also found the relationship between Sassoon and Owen interesting because Sassoon played the role of a mentor to Owen and helped hone his writing style to create great poetry that we appreciate today. Sassoon encourages Owen to publish some of his poetry in the Hydra, the hospital magazine. With this initial encouragement by Sassoon, Owen was able to gain confidence to start publishing more and more inspiring poetry. Sassoon also learned from Owen that even though war is such a huge part of their lives, their poetry did not have to be all about war, as seen through Owen's poetry. By encouraging each other, Sassoon and Owen each helped each other create great poetry and improve both of their writing styles.
0452270073|4.0|Going into this book I thought it was going to be another war story about the closeness of soldiers on the battlefield.  Surprisingly it took place in a hospital away from the war, and even more surprising was from the point of view of a doctor, not a brave soldier.  It is obvious when reading the book that Pat Barker put much effort into writing it.  She thought through each character and his/her relationship with others whether it is comrade, mentor, father, doctor, patient, coworker, or oneself.  She had to research mental illnesses and different methods to handle muteness, or repression of memories, to name a few.  One of the most interesting facts about the novel is some of the main characters actually existed, such as Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, Robert Graves, and Dr. Rivers.  She manages to work into the book some of Sassoon's and Owen's poems. Although this book is fiction, it is fascinating that there is some truth to it, which the author makes a note of at the end.  This kept me very interested and covered much ground from passionate young love blooming, to grotesque war stories, and even works in a little conflict with sexuality.
B000GRTQSE|4.0|Dylan has releasesd another slow paced CD, I guess that when you are 65 and have been jamming for over 40 years you will slow down. This CD sounds a lot like the last one. My favorite song is working mans blues 2. Old fans like me will always pick up the new Dylan release. Dylan is a real treat to see live. Enjoy and keep jamming.<br /><br />Philip.

B00007KQKM|5.0|I thought oh no not another version of this book, I can't bear it but when I saw it, I was blown away.  Sean Bean is great as the \\"lover\\" and smolders all the way through but he can also act!!  Almost as good as his Sharpe role. <br /> <br />I thought the period sets and cast were well chosen and one can easily get lost by oneself for 4 steamy hours!!  I felt that the length was good it gave the film time to unfold rather than be rushed through in 2 hours.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The motherlode. <br />This has been put together brilliantly and the music,of course,is transcendent. <br />The ( contemporary ) interviews with Paul,George and Ringo are frank and fascinating and are cleverly interwoven with old John interviews. <br />You know these faces and these voices so well,and yet the level of intimacy and open-ness is such that you really feel like you are being taken into their confidence.\\"It was like this...... \\" <br />To describe this anthology as \\" definitive \\" misses the scale of the undertaking.In 200 years,people who love this music will refer to this anthology.What a thought. <br />
B000GYI32M|2.0|Compared to season's 1 & 2 this season is pathetic.. the story line drags on and it just isn't good.. i watched the whole thing waiting for it to get better but it didn't happen. i'm only buying this box set because i have 1 & 2 and i want to finish the set.. The end of this sucked the most.. if you havn't watched it yet you will be dissapointed!!!!!!!
B000G73U5Y|1.0|This CD is \\"A Decade of Steely Dan\\" only they took out \\"St. Louis Toodle-oo and replaced it with \\"Dirty Work\\"- great song- and added a song each from their 90's releases \\"Two Against Nature\\" and Everything Must Go\\". If you really want a comprehensive collection w/out having to buy the box set or all of the albums separately, go buy the 2 cd Showbiz Kids collection fom a few years back.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I give five stars to the show, I mean, I really don't need to say how great the show is, but I wonder why Warner decided not to include a 5.1 track, there are other tv series which have Dolby Digital 5.1 so don't tell me there's not enough \\"disc space\\", in these days 5.1 sound is basic for a dvd, I'm not asking for 6.1 DTS-ES, it would be great... but hey I'm only askinkg for standard 5.1 audio, is that too much to ask? I think not, so it's a shame the lack of the 5.1 track but... I guess they gotta leave something for the HD
B00005K3O4|4.0|Very imaginative and creative effect for aliens from outer space. I just thought the begining of the movie was too redundant of other typical movies.

1559409002|4.0|WOW! This is the first film that ever scared me $#!^less!!! This and the opening of Chiller Theatre (with the 6 fingered hand) spooked me to the bone as a small boy. As an adult, it seems laughable, but it brings back fond memories of my first childhood freak out scare. I doubt it would have the same impact for an adult who had never seen it as a child, or a child in this day & age with all the gore & horror and violence widely available to them on cable, with so many parents parking their kids in front of the [...] tube. This film is a timeless classic not because it was so polished & perfect, so masterfully written, filmed or produced or even well acted (although I have to give the actors some brief moments of brilliance) It was great because Herk Harvey accidentally tripped over some really interesting stuff. Call it quirky black comedy, call it cheesy tacky irony, call it a breath of fresh, yet very inexpensive air, call it what you will. This fractured flick will always be indelibly inked in my memory. My advice? Try to look at it with innocent childrens eyes & perceptions and it will be much more enjoyable (alone in absolute silence would be even better!) ENJOY!
B0002W18MU|5.0|This final album really touched me. It is raw and filled with humility. I have actually purchased this for my closest friends.
0156027321|2.0|This book is a hard to believe novel. It is not quite a thriller. It does not make you want to keep reading. It is quite dull. I am glad I read this book though. It is one of those books you couldve went without reading but glad that you did.It tells you about the Hindu, Muslim and Christian religion. it also tells you a lot about survival. I wouldnt recomment it for a free read but it should certanly be read.
B000FMGTTE|4.0|I love the original work done with John Williams' themes from Superman: The Movie.
1400079179|2.0|Like many of the later reviewers, I came to this novel with a couple of years' hype preceding my read.  In the end I thought I would try to find time to read the book before I saw the movie.  Now I'm not sure I want to be bothered with the movie after all.  The writing is not good.  It's that simple.  I'm not even talking about the plot here - literally (forgive the pun) the quality of the writing - the use of the English language.  An interesting idea for a plot, although frequently pretty far-fetched, seems to have been squandered for the sake of producing an ultra lowbrow result.  My enjoyment was finally squashed by Brown's obvious lack of attention to detail.  If the quality of his research into his main plot lines were as poor as his research into day-to-day life in Great Britain then it is an even bigger load of bull than it appears anyway.  Like most good fiction you have to able to believe the events could be true to gain the maximum enjoyment and one of the ways for an author to acheive this is attention to detail.  Here that attention is sadly lacking.
B000065V41|5.0|This movie has been one of my favorites since I was a little kid. It is sweet, endearing, funny, and just generally fantastic.  <br /> <br />The story is the classic Christmas Carol: Scrooge is a mean miser, and one Christmas three ghosts appear to teach him a lesson. <br /> <br />Cliche as it may sound, this is one of those rare movies that is \\"fun for the whole family\\"; my brother and I watch it every year, and still love it even at our advanced ages. :-)
B00005OAIE|2.0|I just want to say that \\"No Such Thing\\" is a sludge of crap. That song made me so depressed in late 2002 that it was not funny. I felt as though that nailed the coffin shut on rock and roll as I knew it; most of these songs didn't even try to hit the mark. There were some that were halfway decent like \\"Why Georgia?\\" and \\"Neon\\", but there was only one really good song on here which was \\"Love Song For No One\\". Listening to this made me think that he was more concerned with making sure that the sound on this record was as stripped down to where no one would suspect that he used any machines, but that's only half the battle the rest are good solid songs that can stick to your ribs, and none of these would. To me it reminded me of eating Tofu, and we know how wet and runny that is. \\"No Such Thing\\" is a song that just didn't take off with me, and I feel it has no meaning, and then when you top it off with a melody, and notes that are about as cheerful as sitting through a dark, gray, dreary rainy season this will make you want to end it all. I often wonder what Mayer had in mind when he recorded this. To me he should stop hiding, and show the world who he is, and what music is at the center of his heart.  <br />
B00008DDSC|5.0|It's been very humorous reading reviews of this movie by people who are more vanilla than vanilla, including the one by Amazon. \\"One of the more bizarre sadomasochistic relationship.\\" Hah! If anything, it's on the tame side. Unlike most Hollywood movies which appropriate BDSM imagery, without context, for shock and titillation values, \\"Secretary\\" understands D/s dynamics. It isn't just about bondage, pain and humiliation. It's also about pleasure, caring and love. It's about realizing who you are and being unafraid of it. The story ends on an unrepressed happy note. Although some of us debate whether or not she should have gone back to the office with him.  <br /> <br />One of the keys to happiness is to be who you are and not what others want you to be. And that is a common Hollywood theme and universal truth that cuts across all ideology and sexual orientations.
B0002W18MU|4.0|Listening to the late, great Johnny Cash on this album gives one the true meaning of being aware of one's mortality.  His voice quavers, loses timber but is definitely the Man in Black.  One only hopes to have the same grace and style when knowing you are soon to meet your Maker (the same goes for George Harrison's Brainwashed).
B000G759LW|1.0|I really tried to like \\"Ain't no other man\\"..gave it many listens and just couldn't bring myself to like it...While the instrumentation was interesting and different, her constant oversinging really gets in her way, especially when I know Christina does have a good voice, which is apparant on her other albums. Unfortunely, I didn't even like the only song that had any prayer of being a hit (mentioned above). The other songs on this album are more of the same; oversinging, no restraint to the runs and lack of good hooks to draw the listener in.   <br /> <br />Christina's Stripped album was far better than this, as was her first album.  Christina should be saying her prayers to the MTV fairy for all the publicity which I'm quite sure had a hand in making this album so popular.
B00004ZBVG|4.0|Gene Hackman plays a career Air Force intelligence officer with a passion for golf. He looks for the day when he can retire and try to join the pro tour. In the meantime, however, he is still a serving officer in Vietnam. <br /> <br />Retirement is fairly close when he gets shot out of the sky while riding on a B-52 mission. He is the only survivor and he is someone that the Viet Cong would very much like to capture. He has to run for his life. In his running, he is aided by a forward air controller played by Danny Glover.  <br /> <br />Hackman knows that the area he is in is due to be carpet bombed in a few days and he has to get out of there. The problem is that the VC are listening in on the radio and that makes planning problematical until golf proves to be a useful escape tool. Hackman knows the layouts of the world's military golf courses like the back of his hand and comes up with a code using golf terms and the layout of well known military courses to let the rescuers know how to keep up with him. Its still tough going, though, and the VC don't give up easily. <br /> <br />This is a rather good movie and one could almost be fooled into thinking that Danny Glover really does love his country...almost. <br />
1593975635|2.0|THREE! THREE! THREE YOU STUPID MORONS!!!!!! you could've heard me yelling as I listened to the end of this audiobook.  Then, it actually went downhill with the rest of the ending.<br /><br />Up until then, I found Digital Fortress to be high mediocre, bordering on ok.  I hadn't figured it all out in advance, which is usually a plus, but the reason it can't be figured out, is the unbelievablity.  These idiots can't really be in charge of the secrets of the USA, can they?<br /><br />My advice, listen to CDs 1-8, skip the last two, they won't enhance your experience.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|I would like to refer you to my review of the original trilogy dvd last year:<br /><br />\\"These are great flicks (I was born in 1971, so Star Wars was my life!), and I will buy the DVD, but I anticipate shelling out another 100 bucks in a couple of years when you issue the super expanded version which contains the directors edit as well as the original theatrical version (ala \\"Aliens\\") \\"
B000GRTQSE|4.0|Caveat, I have only listened to this album once and I am sure my opinion will change in the coming days.  I feel it is important to get my initial impression entered because first instincts are often the truest. <br /> <br />I'd like to hear more Dylan both lyrically and instrumentally and less band. <br /> <br />The first few songs are simply boogie-woogie rockabilly.  The next few have a strong Leon Redbone feel.   <br /> <br />The amazing tongue tripping lyrics are missing.  It seems to be mostly simple rockabilly. <br /> <br />Ain't Talkin' seems to be the most Dylanesque musically, in instrumentation, and lyrically.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Five MESMERIZING Stars! When he was declared the &#34;Boy Wonder of Folk&#34;  he backed it up with recording after recording, singing in a voice like no other. Over the decades the voice has become dark and mellow like a fine, aged whiskey. This recording is loaded with FABULOUS haunting songs from beginning to end. Alot of blues, country-tinged songs, folk and protest songs. And the lyrics are truly SENSATIONAL: stark, dense, humorous, full of images that keep coming, one after another, like tennis balls from a practice machine. You can barely appreciate one image before the next one has overtaken you. Some of this is breath-taking music of the highest order. And when you read the lyrics, it's pure poetry that ranks with today's best poets.  'Pieces De Resistance' are everywhere. Trust me, &#34;Thunder On The Mountain&#34; went straight to my IPod and immediately on the road with me tonight, thanks to an early availability of the download: a total success of a song that ranks right up there with his best lyrics. Then he deals up a loping, intimate love song, &#34;Spirit On The Water&#34;, with equally wonderful lyrics full of stark, beautiful images, almost like a bookend to &#34;Thunder...&#34;.  The bluesy &#34;Rollin' and &#34;Tumblin' &#34; is great. There is alot of classic rock and R&B with Dylan lyrics on top and it's great. &#34;Nettie Moore&#34; is vintage Dylan and a masterpiece of a commentary on slavery and undying love. &#34;Ain't Talkin&#34; is pure BRILLIANCE. Never one to let success, GRAMMYs, Halls of Fame, and an Academy Award slow him down, Bob Dylan is as vital and timeless as ever. Thank you, Bob Dylan, welcome back!! And special thanks to the producer, Bob....er Jack Frost. LOL. My Highest Recommendation. Five HUGE Stars!!!  (Note:*This review is based on a 10 track ITunes Music download.)
B000FTCLO4|4.0|the fact that you can't download the songs onto your computer kinda is a drag. The dvd has froze my computer a few times. But, the six songs are good for the most part, in particular 'Gravity'. The music videos are good except for \\"The Hardest Part\\". Does not do the song any justice. If your a Coldplay junkie, buy it.
B0002X314C|4.0|I avoided this album for the longest time due to my dislike of \\"Ordinary People,\\" however after hearing \\"Let's Get Lifted\\" one day I broke down and bought the album.  What a great purchase!  The creativity and musicianship on this album are stellar.  Legend has created an album that crosses over the normal boundaries of Soul R&B, reminding me a lot of Hill's MISEDUCATION in terms of originality, quality, and overall mood.  Certainly an album worth buying and I look forward to his upcoming sophomore release.
B000GPIPVU|4.0|Ray Lamontagne's new album TILL THE SUN TURNS BLACK makes a solid follow up to his great 2004 debut TROUBLE.  TROUBLE introduced a singer who was favorably compared to such heavy weights as Van Morrison and Otis Redding.<br /><br />While TROUBLE hit you over the head with it's great title track and then continued with some songs in a similar mode, the new album is a different beast altogether.  TILL THE SUN TURNS BLACK moves at a slow simmer, rising only above a whisper on a couple of tunes.  Despite it's subtlety, this album packs the same emotional punch as its predecessor.  Lamontagne's songs are floated on quiet string and brass arrangements with acoustic guitar and stirring vocals to create a music that falls somewhere between the blues and the music of Nick Drake.  It all shadows and smoke.<br /><br />Fans of TROUBLE will no doubt find much to like here, but will need to approach this new release with patience.  A point of reference for existing fans would be TROUBLE's closing track ALL THE WILD HORSES.  It is an album that will reward the listener with more depth each time they play it.
B00005ATQ9|3.0|Stanley surprisingly romantic in his depiction of Barry Lyndon. Ryan O'neil also receives 3 stars for his portrail of a spoiled, ambitious, and overgrown child.

B000GFLKF8|4.0|Clive Owen is cucumber cool as Dalton Russell, the brains behind this cleverly executed Manhattan bank heist that isn't quite a bank heist. Denzel Washington is the cynical, hard-boiled detective cum hostage negotiator Keith Frazier, who finds that he's more than met his match. Russell outwits Frazier at every step and this creates a tension that is hugely entertaining to watch. Chiwetel Ejiofor, one of my favourite actors, moving a couple more steps up his destined career ladder, puts on a convincing American accent (though maybe not quite a New York one) as Washington's keen and respectful sidekick.<br /><br />And just to make things even more interesting, enter Jodie Foster as mysterious power broker Madeline White, looking as slinky and sexy as I've ever seen her and with an agenda that seems only clear to her. It's a great story with many twists and turns and an ending that no one could possibly foresee. They say a jack-of-all-trades is very rarely the master of any. Spike Lee does an excellent job directing this movie and though he has had a number of culturally iconic successes in the past, this is the first movie I've seen where he directs and directs only. I think this one could be his most commercially successful as a result. Post-9/11 issues are raised and - as one would expect with Lee - this includes issues around race, particularly racial profiling but the issues are handled well and seem an integral part of the plot, rather than something that was just added on to make a point.<br /><br />A stellar support cast, including Christopher Plummer, Willem Defoe, Carlos Andres Gomez and the incomparable Peter Gerety make this a very watchable movie. The screenplay, written by Russell Gewirtz is rather convoluted and not everything makes perfect sense but this doesn't detract from the sheer entertainment value provided here. Even if it's only to finally be able to make complete sense of the storyline, this is a movie worth watching over and over.

0375703861|4.0|The first thing I must praise is Zadie Smiths EXCELLENT writing style.  She is truly masterful in her descriptions and she makes the characters, with all their hopes, flaws, and passions come alive.  The writing is so beautiful that even if you are reading a part that isn't particularly entertaining, the writing is enough to keep you turning the pages until you get to a part in the story line you really enjoy.  There are many quotes or paragraphs in this book that just ring out as true lessons about life.  I loved it!   <br /> <br />The book, as a whole, offers us a great glimpse into London and the various cultures to be found there and their efforts to maintain or find their identity in a foreign land.  By cultures I mean beyond race to religion as well as age and each character's efforts to find meaning, love, and passion in their lives, whether that means dwelling on the past or joining a fundamentalist islamic group.  Each character's search for their place and their identity is beautiful.  You find yourself cheering them on and feeling their pain when they make a wrong decision or their dreams don't turn out the way a fairy book story should.  I felt that Zadie Smith was presenting me with LIFE AS IT IS in a beautifully wrapped package full of great prose and heart touching stories.   <br /> <br />Although I cannot say enough about how much I loved Zadie Smith's writing, it did feel at times that she went on tangents that didn't seem central to the story.  However, these tangents were interesting but I found myself getting frustrated as I neared the end of the story and so much was left unresolved that so much room was spent on these tangents.  Further, as you read, you may find yourself frustrated as Smith transitions from character to character with much unresolved and unsaid about the character you just read about.  I found myself saying, \\"Wait!  I want to know more about what happens here!\\"  In the end, however, Smith masterfully ties all the characters and their story lines together in a blockbuster ending that keeps you turning the pages hoping it doesn't end where it does.    <br /> <br />In all, it is an excellent book that makes you think about life, identity, love, and passion.
1559408855|2.0|The movie held my interest, but the only reason why was to see what sick thing would happen next.  Like more horror movies the further it went the sicker it got and its one of those kinda movies that when its over you feel  you need to smoke a pack of cigarettes and take a shower.  It makes you feel like your just not clean.  If I was asked if I would recremend this to someone else I doubt I would.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|i'm not looking for a very high \\"helpful\\" rating here...just wanted to show my support for this incredibly powerful movie. <br /> <br />and for any of you out there looking to this movie just for some mind bending action since it's directed by the same guys as the Matrix...don't even watch it if that's all you're after...this movie is much deeper and greater than just satisfying eye candy and special FXs.
034544678X|5.0|I absolutely recommend this book to everyone who is likely to encounter a dog in their lifetime! It is chock-full of excellent information and is written in a very accessible voice. I also love the author's sense of humor.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I do not trust any batteries except Canon for my Canon cameras. <br />I have found \\"compatible\\" batteries do not always charge in <br />Canon charger, and do not last as long on camera.
B000068PQ0|5.0|From start to finish, this album will continuously blow your mind. You will find yourself thinking about it when it's not with you. This cd has stayed in my car for 4 years now. And I don't see it going anywhere any time soon.<br /><br />This cd is best listened to in one sitting with the tracks playing in order. Each song fades into the next in a liquid-like wave fashion.<br /><br />At first you will just appreciate the incredible use of instruments and the soft poppy tones of the music, but after more and more listens, you will find yourself creating stories to go with each song. And you're going to clearly see Yoshimi battling the robots. Especially in Part 2, which is mostly instrumental.<br /><br />If you don't have this album, you should go out and get it, just to see what all the fuss is about. I promise you won't be disappointed. I have several other Flaming Lips albums, and this is definitely the best. So, if you're interested in finding out what the Flaming Lips are all about, get this album.
0805023461|5.0|I was so pleasantly surprised when our copy of Polar Bear, Polar Bear arrived, I immediately read it to my 2 and a half year old son.  He owns the board book, so I decided to purchase another copy since the board book has seen better days.  We both just simply loved the replacement.  It was in mint condition and the quality of the pages is wonderful.  Couldn't be more satisfied with our find!!!
0596007124|3.0|I'm a big Fan of the Head First series, but I feel as though the descriptions of this book were a bit misleading in that there is barely a mention of Java in the book outline, but the book itself relies heavily on the use of Java in its examples.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|About the 300th time around and I still love the CD!!!<br />Just got this cd today, and I listened to it twice through.  While I'd initially have to say I like the soundtrack for Pirates II slightly better, this cd's got a certain charm to it.  Each listen through reveals a different nuance.  It's exciting and daring with a dash of suprise at all the right times.
