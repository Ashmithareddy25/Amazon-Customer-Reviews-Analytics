B003N0XDT4|4.0|First: quality is AMAZING. Music quality is miles above what my computer can offer on its own; same for my android.<br /><br />The main issue that I've come across often is that when I use the device as a DAC, it fails to amplify the signal to the right side. The sound is there, but minimal compared to the left side: totally unacceptable. Note, this is ONLY a problem when using the device as a DAC; the amplifier (aux-in) function works just fine. In fact, you can get the DAC to properly power the right channel by softly jiggling an 1/8th inch jack inside the aux-in while the device is plugged in by usb - this need for constant jury-rigging indicates serious quality control issues with at least one batch of these devices, as I've found multiple complaints of this *exact* problem spread across the internet. The device is usable, but I suggest going for one that does not suffer from this oft-occurring defect. Perhaps the Andes E07K or a similar model.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|...most of the time. I wish the radar would function a bit better, but otherwise this app is pretty useful on a daily basis.
0790729628|2.0|arrived timely, double sided vidio, one side (standard screen) locks up and skips, directors cut side plays clean. disk appears clean with few scratches, must be damaged in just the right place to cause issues.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Not as good as I thought it was gonna be. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. I will give it another watch when I'm not so tired.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|i love the way susan sings...susan is an inspiration...i love her take on the songs...she makes me happy..i love everything about her
B004LROUNG|4.0|This was a very nice story.  It made me laugh out loud several times & I found myself laughing at one particular scene every time I thought about it.  The characters are realistic and the writing is simple yet elegant.  I enjoyed this book very much.  Job well done JG.
B008MM9630|4.0|could be worse my biggest complaint is u only have so many points to use at a time so if u run out of energy u have to wait to do things.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is fun!  it's super easy and super addicting, Much easier if you know other people playing it though.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|I own a couple of RC 'copters, so I thought I'd give the FAOTD a try. I played the first 5 levels, and got 3 stars on each with just a few tries. Having experience flying RC heli, I was more comfortable using the joystic control.  The Devs are correct in that the controls are sensitive, which is true for the real thing as well.  Here's a tip: throttle is up and down, not speed.  Learn to hover first, and flight is easier.<br /><br />The game played well on my Samsung Epic4G.  The tutorial is nice, and there are options to turn the music and sound off.  This could be a fun time waster for someone who loves to fly his RC when not at home, or while the real thing is charging :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The<br /> best game of it's type I play for hours at a time very addictive can't put down good job
B00936A0RU|4.0|This movie was a little left field which I loved.<br />The acting was great and the ploy believable well done I will recommend this movie.
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|mediocrity with a vengance, more undead, more milla in sexy outfits, zombies with guns, cameo aperances by game characters and those who don't know them, your not why? no back story no plot points twowards there character nada they just show up. If you looking for mindless action resident evil tops the list.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I think the plot was very average, I felt the movie was not complete, it is setting up for new characters and a new franchise.<br />I wish them all the luck and maybe a better action movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wow lots of plot twists. I like the one year advance in episode 9. Can't wait for season 4! Why need 20 words? I can say it efficiently in less!
B005LAII3A|3.0|I enjoyed the movie although the plot was all over the place.<br />Special effects were very well done.<br />Another downer was most of the movie was set in a twilight or dark
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the greatest game of all time i love it so much i highly recommend it to both kids and adults xx
B009MO57H6|3.0|This movie was nowhere near as good as the past movies in the series. We had to sit through 10 min about the last movie a little trite. I still enjoyed the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing I have beat so many friends and braged it has been awesome I recommend you get this game because I don't know it is just so awesome. When you get nervous play subway surfers. When you are sad play subway surfers. When you are board play subway surfers. It helps but that is my opinion.
B005LAII8A|4.0|Loved the ending even though you can guess what is going to happen.<br />I love that it is not just a happy ending.<br />Go for this movie if you want something different.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I thought I would try this book since I usually love all book to movie types and now that it's a movie..... ha... I couldn't get pasted the boring first page.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Fast moving movie I love how they included the other three movies.<br />Just sit back let the movie go and enjoy the ride.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really love it...<br />usually I don't read this kind of books, but I just can't wait for the third book..
B004MC8CA2|4.0|My husband downloaded this to my Kindle as a surprise. It's great for comparing different versions of the Bible when studying a specific passage, and makes finding passages very quick and easy during a sermon, or when trying to find a verse that one can only remember a keyword or two from. There are several reading plans to can choose from to read through the Bible in a certain time period. The online feature allows one to read notes others have made concerning various passages, so that even someone who is unable to get out much can enjoy studying with others.
B008KE3960|4.0|This game is an excellent time waster. The game play borders on addictive and then gets somewhat repetitive in later missions. There's no need to spend money to get new planes and maps, they tend to come as you advance through the levels. overall, I'd recommend it, as the game play is smooth, as are the graphics.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|The kids love it! Took them a while to figure it out. Other than that they went thru the levels and had a lot of fun.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|there are too mnay bugs in this app. it force closes after playing for a few minutes, and every time I start to make progress in the game, it crashes and won't reopen. I've had to reinstall this a few times because of that.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really like this book and bought knowing that the movie was coming out and I wanted to read the book before I watch the movie.  I am disappointed that the movie trailers show that they have changed so much of the book.  Read the book first and see for yourself.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Hey, it's the Big Bang Theory.  What's not to like?  They're always hilarious.  My wife and I watch 2 or 3 episodes every night.  Yes, I know...we need to get a life.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a good logic game.  My 5 year old even likes to play it and can even complete some of the earlier levels on his on.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Hey, it's the Big Bang Theory.  What's not to like?  They're always hilarious.  My wife and I watch 2 or 3 episodes every night.  Yes, I know...we need to get a life.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have just finished this book and loved every minute of it. Can hardly wait until the movie comes out to see how different it will be on screen. The book is always better than the movie. Always.
0765325950|1.0|For the reader to have to buy a hardcover to read this is unconscionable in this day and time.  I bought the book from Audible when I would rather have had it available to read on my Kindle or Ipad.  To be told that the reason I can't read it the way I want to is because we want to drive up it up to number one in sales is absurd.  I am not going to buy it in hardcover.  If I hadn't invested in all the previous books I wouldn't have bought it at all.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Could it happen?  This book as all ways seem as if Clancy has a inside track to Possible events, that we need t watch out for.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Great movie, especially if you are patriotic. We would recommend this movie for an audience of any age.  Gary Cooper Is a terrific actor.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very good game! I would rate this a 10 star if they had a ten star rating.
B003UESJEM|1.0|We were very disapointed in this movie.  The language was awful!  We thought it would be funny and entertaining; however, it was far from that.  We would not recommend this movie, in fact, we have destroyed the DVD we purchased.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I loved that I got this so quickly and that it was packaged nicely and our family enjoyed the movie very much. No complaints whatsoever.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Hearing this song again brings back all the excitement and action of the movie &#34;Skyfall.&#34;  Since this song is not included on the soundtrack of the movie, I'm very glad to be able to have it as a single.  Terrific!
B009ZUKY52|4.0|muy bien cumplio las espectativas, buen sonido, facil de usar y excelente la entrega. muchas gracias por lo que me mandaron
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is wonderful. Much better than the original in my opinion. The larger monkey and more power ups are great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and I can't even put my kindle down because it's so fun I just wish you would give me a choice of one free character I actually want.
B00B2QA2F4|1.0|Couldn't even finish watching this. If I could get my money back I'd do so. As a huge fan of Wushu/Wu Xia fantasy Chinese films, this is a horrid hip-hop-ification with terrilbe acting, stupid script and just all around self-indulgent (hey, I'm a rapper, give me money to make a film with me in it ...). Truly awful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun!!!!!!!!!!I wish the people you could buy were cheaper- and the limited people wouldn't be limited::: over all it is really super game
B0015DROBO|4.0|It took me awhile to get into this, but when I did it was a must read. Keeps you wondering what is next.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A killer book that I should definitely read over and over and over again for a lot of weeks and probably mesmerized it
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I liked this color so I won't wonder where I last left my Kindle. It keeps my Kindle protected and sits perfectly in either direction when I want to read...so nice for reading in bed when I don't feel so good. I am hoping it lasts a long time.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of the entire series.  I am hoping for a series 4.  Costuming, acting, scenery and story line wonderful.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This is a little bit cheaply made, with a cover over the screwdriver raising button that easily falls off. Also it is tough to switch between pen and &#34;magic&#34; pen. The magic pen works as advertised, as well as the overall product. Very realistic sounds. Just like the show! Just wish the plastic was a bit more durable...<br />I'd recommend this for ANYONE who loves the tenth doctor. I was siked when my son got this from Santa. Kind of jealous.
B007V65R54|5.0|I was particularly impressed with the range of examples and how Silver builds from one field to the next: predicting hurricanes, earthquakes, changes in the economy, elections, etc.  Most useful bit of information: weather predictions made by local media are significantly less successful than predictions made by either the government (weather.gov) or private companies such as the Weather Channel.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I really love the movie, and I did not have an issue with receiving this product. I would recommend for any action seekers.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Book 3 is so far the best of the series. It was very hard to put down. I highly recommend this series as it is well written and leaves you shocked and awed.<br /><br />Steve B, Sr.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I really love the movie, and I did not have an issue with receiving this product. I would recommend for any action seekers.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|the only thing I don't like about this app is doesn't. have the new update. of angry birds star wars there's new levels on the both _you can defeat the mynoc pigs
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I really love the movie, and I did not have an issue with receiving this product. I would recommend for any action seekers.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|There was something about this book that was creepy.  I like to be entertained and this didn't do it for me.  My Book Club is reading it and I think some did like it, but I wouldn't recommend it.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I really love the movie, and I did not have an issue with receiving this product. I would recommend for any movie watcher.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This author is a fantastic story teller.  You easily connect with the characters.  Can't wait to read other books by this author.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|I really love the movie, and I did not have an issue with receiving this product. I would recommend for any action seekers.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I thought this movie was just ok.  It did have some very funny parts in it.  I wouldn't purchase this movie because I just don't think I'd watch this movie more than once.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I really love the movie, and I did not have an issue with receiving this product. I would recommend for any movie watcher.
B005UD1D62|4.0|So far, I'm falling in love with the characters, and can't wait to see where the tangled story lines go!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I really love the movie, and I did not have an issue with receiving this product. I would recommend for any action seekers.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|It's totally EXCELLENT! All the greatset song you ever knew from Phil Collins.  Great buy and great price. You will not regret to buy it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|the ipad and ipod and all those others have updated to 0.7.1 and were just at 0.6.1 on the 0.7.1 update theres multiplayer and new blocks and chat and all that stuff WE NEED UPDATE
B009LRE040|3.0|So I tried and tried to buy this from my tablet, but kept getting an error telling me I couldn't watch it on my tablet because I didn't have flash.  I didn't want to watch it on my tablet, I wanted to watch it on my XBOX.  Finally I got it to go through from my laptop, and started the movie on XBOX and guess what, DVD quality at best.  Amazon, the extra features for PRIME is great, but get your technical crap down a little better will ya?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Refreshing, well-written, witty, fantastic cast, what is there to add. Finally, a good show that does not include pretty cops, doctors or lawyers.
B00979CS50|4.0|Heard mixed reports about this album, but I have to concede that it grows on you. The long melodic guitar solos and pulsating drum beat is mesmerising. The lyrics are complex and open to varied interpretations. This may become a classic Young/Crazy Horse must have album as people spend the time to listen. At the moment this album is best savored late at night accompanied by a good bottle of red, Australian shiraz of course, and 70% Belgian chocolate.
B00991TCOG|4.0|I had been seeing her performances off/on via my PC's Internet You Tube browsing.<br />I liked her music and listened to it so often that I finally felt that maybe she should get<br />paid a little bit for all the time she puts into her performances. The CD is composed of<br />her original compositions for the violin performances she had been doing all year<br />long while on tour and posted Internet music videos. Just listening to her music is  enjoyable,<br />but I have to say I seem to get more out of watching her perform her music.
B004THLR2K|5.0|Like all of the other books by Dennis JeHane which I have read, this<br />book is very difficult to put down once you have begun reading it.<br />The characters are well done.  When the story ends, you wish<br />that it was longer.  Dennis LeHane has a special knack at keeping<br />the reader interested.  His plots are logical and clear.
7799125829|5.0|This is the a presentation of the original version of Fantasia. The DVD was made overseas so<br />it was incompatible with my DVD player, but played ok on my PC with no problems. Even though<br />it is a Mandarin Chinese Edition, it turns out the default settings are for English. I have not tried<br />the Mandarin or Vietnamese settings, so I can only speak for the English language settings.<br />The movie looked better than the way I remembered it because I had originally saw it a long<br />time ago on a old tv broadcast.
1935597760|4.0|Not all story's are happy all the time.  This had it's uncomfortable moments;  I felt so badly for the protagonist at times.  But this book makes you feel and was so well written it was a joy to read.  The ending was not what you think might happen - but was the perfect ending!  I read it on Kindle and loved the book so much I ordered a hard copy for my library. Wonderful book!!!!
B0000VCZKW|4.0|A cute movie and maybe a little too corny now a days.<br />It's still an ok movie for little kids to watch though.
B005MMY5RK|5.0|I am a big fan of old movies.  Learn a tad bit of the history and it makes it even more enticing to watch.
B00170I7GG|5.0|This is a movie we as a family sit down and watch every February 2nd. It's funny and almost always remember a new quote that make us laugh. And the plus side is it doesn't even need to be Groundhog's Day to enjoy the movie!
B009NPA3MS|3.0|Bought it for my husband cause he likes to hear him on the radio, but he wasn't that impressed with th album!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have not received this set of DVDs yet since it won't be released until mid-February.  Am looking forward to viewing it.
145210655X|5.0|So, I bought this for my husband who is a major Star Wars fan.  It was for fathers day.  He really got a kick out of it.  Very funny and sweet book.
B00B99QTM4|5.0|This is a very funny comedy; the jokes are truly timeless. I will never get tired of watching this movie.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven - It was a good, easy read. I would recommend it. A quick read as well. Enjoy it.
0399160450|3.0|This is a good read well worth your time.  However, there is a serious disconnect if you consider it as part of a series.  As a stand alone novel I would rate it a B- or C+ to a large extent because of inaccuracies and improbabilities regarding computers, networks, and their security.  But also because of weird and improbable plot devices.  As part of a series I rate it no higher than a C for reasons other reviewers have already explained.  Get this one from the library or buy a used copy but don't waste your money on buying it new.
1400069289|4.0|The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do In Life and Business by Charles Duhigg<br /><br />\\"The Power of Habit\\" is a fantastic book about why habits exist and how they function.  Each chapter revolves around a central argument that a habit can be changed if we understand how they work.  Investigative reporter for The New York Times, Charles Duhigg takes us on an explanatory journey of habits.  Through a series of interesting stories, Duhigg intersperses intriguing tidbits about everyday habits in life and business. This enjoyable 400-page book is composed of nine chapters, broken out into the following three parts:  1. The Habits of Individuals, 2. The Habits of Successful Organizations, and 3. The Habits of Societies.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. A fun, accessible popular science book for all to enjoy.<br />2. Great storytelling.  The book has a great flow and rhythm about it. Good use of studies and facts interspersed into each story.<br />3. Many great stories illustrating a particular habit and how it can be changed.<br />4. Topical and thought provoking.  You will end up with many more interesting topics to talk about.<br />5. The science behind habits and the way patterns work within our lives, societies and organizations.<br />6. Great use of diagrams to illustrate key concepts.  The three-step loop process behind habits.<br />7. Understanding cravings.<br />8. The impact of identifying consumer habits to capitalize on.  Great stuff!<br />9. Great concepts, \\"That's the rule: If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit\\".<br />10. So many great examples that cover a wide variety of everyday living:  everyday products we use and take for granted, football philosophy, alcohol addiction, religion, corporate philosophy, to name a few.  There is bound to be an example or a multiple of examples that will resonate with you.<br />11. Keystone habits and the concept of \\"small wins\\".<br />12. The importance of willpower.  Many great examples to illustrate the force of willpower.<br />13. How a crisis can precipitate change.  \\"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,\\" Rahm Emanuel.<br />14. \\"Sticky songs\\".  What a cool new thing to learn. \\"There is evidence that a preference for things that sound `familiar' is a product of our neurology\\".  Making the unfamiliar seem familiar as a form of risk mitigation.<br />15. The story behind the Montgomery bus boycott.<br />16. Interesting chapter on neurology of free will and the ethics of behavior.  A couple of sad tales.<br />17. An excellent appendix.  The author provides a generic guide on how to change habits.<br />18. Links to Notes worked great.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. No formal bibliography.  Books referred to were addressed in the notes but readers must sort through the information to find them.<br />2. The storytelling is superior to the science shared.  An appendix with more depth regarding how brain science relates to habits would have been welcomed.  The author does talk briefly about the basal ganglia but just enough to whet your appetite for more.<br />3. The author should have done a better job of distinguishing between addiction and habit.<br />4. A sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vue. A lot of the material here may feel familiar to those of us who have read similar books.<br /><br />In summary, this book was an absolute treat to read.  It's popular science at its best, balanced storytelling with some good behavior science backing it up.  It's an enjoyable read that covers a wide-range of examples from everyday to corporate life as it pertains to habits.  My only complaint is that the book doesn't really offer anything new and may give you a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vue but what is here is well covered and a treat to read.  I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Further suggestions: \\"[[ASIN:1846145988 Subliminal]]\\" by Leonard Mlodinow, \\"[[ASIN:B006Z2VLO6 The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies]]\\" by Michael Shermer, \\"[[ASIN:0470376244 The Scientific American Brave New Brain]]\\" by Judith Horstman, \\"[[ASIN:0142003344 The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature]]\\" by Steven Pinker, \\"[[ASIN:B00AKQINGM Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0060892889 Human: The Science Behind What Makes Us Unique]]\\", by Michael S.

B004SKLD9A|5.0|I've become a Christian Bale fan so I've been going back and watching the movies of his that I hadn't seen.  Equilibrium was one of them.  It's a very intriguing concept of not being allowed to \\"feel\\" any emotion.  Without getting into a bunch of specifics, it's a good movie!  And Christian Bale is excellent as always.  If I had one complaint, it would be how unrealistic it is when Christian Bale's character can consistently take out 100 guys surroundng him with guns, without ever being so much as scratched.  It's WAY over the top.  But they're trying to convey that he is the cream of the crop, upper echelon cleric. Pretty much untouchable.  I'll let that slide and still give it 5 stars for an enjoyable movie.
B00005T30L|5.0|I'd love to be able to say I've seen this movie a million times, but I've been unable to locate my DVD for years. I must have loaned it to someone at my old job. I'd be very happy to get this on blu-ray. Come on, MGM, what's the hold up? If you're not going to do it, let Criterion have it. They'll have a better cover, better extras and who cares what it costs? I'll buy it. That's how good this movie is and it deserves far better than the old DVD that's been around since '01. Get off your feet and upgrade this already classic American film.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love the game but need a way to exit the game<br />good graphics and good new obstacles over all I really like it
B000VLE3IS|2.0|too many new Zepplelin compilations since the late 90s, none as good as the original boxed set (circa 1991),  I tried to appreciate their  uniqueness, but most don't impress me
B0054SMID0|3.0|The basic plotline, of what the killer does to his lawyer,<br />without giving details away, makes no sense!<br /><br />It's an extremely risky move to backstab your lawyer,<br />and count on a great defense, with no counter-<br />sabotage!<br /><br />Everything else about this film is great, top to bottom...<br />but if you analyze the script, it's really too big<br />of a hole, and should have been altered.<br /><br />Edgy, fast-paced and fun...just don't analyze this one!
1594202842|5.0|I love reading biographies of normal people.  Like all of us these people desire to achieve some greatness or be remembered as something special but the ordinariness of human life constantly humbles us and reminds us of our weaknesses.  I think this is Amy Chua's story.  the way she expresses it in her extended subtitle - \\"how I was humbled by a dog\\".<br />It's a great book, easy read.  Easy to read in one sitting.  If you've heard of it, it is worth a read; and I think it's totally unfair to criticize if you have not given it a chance.  Much of it can be found online for free.  I enjoyed it so much reading what I found online, I bought a copy for myself and a few more for some close friends.
B005Q184AG|3.0|excellent, good product. highly recommended -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has improved so much. They have added a better power-up system and better graphics. They have more obstacles to add variety. The side bar that fills.up now rewards you with a selected power-up. Great game.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|These series of books great and terrific read. Preston and child great together. I can not wait for the next one.
B001O03NCW|5.0|Great movie, and a great sound track. Another &#34;must have&#34; for those who enjoy the days of yesteryear. Nice mix of artists too
B000001DV2|1.0|Just bubblegum radio friendly garbage.  No talent, just poppy, polished turds aplenty.  I fail to see how this band got popular as the only somewhat decent album they ever made was Pyromania and even that only had like two good songs that weren't run of the mill pop garbage.  Funny thing is they are still playing effortless radio, pop crap today except it's much worse sounding.....they even play with taylor swift.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time! Storyline is great and the humor is hysterical!  It is great!
B000001E21|1.0|Just in case you didn't have enough Def LEppard songs with love in the title......this band cannot write music to save their lives, all they do is write radio friendly pop garbage about love, stiff love, soft love, high love, low love....my god get some writers to help you.  Believe it or not it gets even worse after this.....
1449410243|5.0|Check out the companion 2013 wall calendar too. Bought this as a Christmas gift for a couple friends who are cat lovers. They love it!
B000001FKY|1.0|I was a fan of Leppard during their Pyromania era but this album is just more of beating a tired, dead, not that great to begin with horse.  Not a whole lot to say other than this album sounds the same as every album from this era, not to good just popular.
1449417051|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for friends who are cat lovers. They were thrilled with it. Check out the companion book!
0307744434|5.0|I had seen the book everywhere. And my boyfriend mentioned that his mother was reading it.  Out of curiosity... I asked him what she thought.<br /><br />The next thing I knew, her copy of the book was in my possession. She hadn't even finished it. But, since her book club moved onto something else, she let me borrow it.<br /><br />I guess I should let you know that I hate borrowing books. I LOVE owning books. I have dreams of a Belle type library someday.<br /><br />When I borrow a book I feel pressured. Not only to like the book, but to finish it in a quick manner. And truth be told... I am not the fastest reader.<br /><br />Anyway, that is how [[ASIN:0307744434 The Night Circus]] landed on my reading list. And because it was borrowed, I finished it fairly soon after it ended up in my lap. It didn't sit on my shelf for the normal three years most of my books do.<br /><br />I didn't really know what to expect when I picked up the book and started reading. I had no idea what it was about prior to starting the first chapter.<br /><br />And, I don't quite remember the exact moment in the book that I got sucked in... but it happened.<br /><br />It was like nothing I had ever read before. The only thing I can compare it to was the movie The Prestige. (If you haven't seen The Prestige I highly recommend it. Really good movie, great concept.)<br /><br />Anyway-- I kept comparing it to The Prestige, but in reality, it was really nothing like it.<br /><br />And I actually fear that by telling you about the book-- I will ruin the whole thing for you.<br /><br />While I was reading the book people kept asking me what it was about and I kept responding-- I don't really know. I couldn't put Morgenstern's world into my own words.<br /><br />So what can I say?<br /><br />\\"Like stepping into a fairy tale under a curtain of stars.\\"  -The Night Circus<br /><br />It really was like a fairy tale. A magical, wonderful, even a little dark, fairy tale.<br /><br />The book centers around a mysterious circus. A circus that pops up out of nowhere.<br /><br />The Night Circus follows the whole story of the circus. From beginning to end. But, it isn't until the last few chapters it starts to all come together.<br /><br />This beautiful story jumps from character to character-- across years of time. At times it can be hard to follow, especially if like me you tend to put books down for a few days at a time. But this is my only complaint...<br /><br />Love, magic, and true beauty. Morgenstern's ability to paint a picture with words truly brings the imagination to life. You feel as you are right there with the circus goers, planners, and performers.<br /><br />\\"The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected ones.\\" -The Night Circus<br /><br />This review probably has the least amount of meat of any I have ever written. The Night Circus is also at the top of my list for books I read last year.<br /><br />As I said, I didn't know what to expect when I picked it up. I didn't even really understand how to tell people what it was about while I was reading it-- but the whole story, the whole experience, comes together so beautifully at the end that the journey was well worth it.<br /><br />I highly recommend [[ASIN:0307744434 The Night Circus]] to any reader.mysterious circus.

B000JQUZCI|5.0|It's a classic.  Mary Shelley was ahead of her time.  Unlike the movie, you can really have emphathy for the creature.  I read it in my teens and I enjoyed it again this time.
B000ZN802W|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. Hirsch is great as the star and supporting cast is really good too.

B00422LESO|5.0|This was a great, cute fun read. At times it became a little bit silly, but overall it was a very good read. It was enjoyable and quick, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen era type things or chick lit. Just a fun read!

B00004TDTO|4.0|When I saw this I knew I had to have it. Jaws remains one of my favorite books and movies of all time. This DVD has a lot of bonus materials including storyboards and outtakes. The movie is very clear and the music is nice and loud. I was happy with this version and glad I purchased it. If you want to add jaws to your collection I would recommend this DVD.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest keeps my creative juice flowing. It is easy to navigate and store my favorite sites to refer back too.
B00006JDSI|4.0|This movie comes packaged in a cardboard case with little snappy things that broke as soon as I opened the case. That part stinks, but otherwise, I enjoyed this version of the classic horror movie. I appreciated the soundtrack for the movie as it was all wonderfully creepy pipe organ music and it sounded really clear and nice and loud. The film wasn't as grainy as I was expecting it to be, even on a large screen TV. Overall I was happy with this purchase and thought it was a good addition to my collection.
0307916812|5.0|These are great stories by Rick Riordan. We enjoy all of his stories. The guy who reads this story is awesome. He can do every voice of each character differently and well. You always know who is speaking.Very entertaining!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read, ever!! It was soo touching. I can't even count the number times I cried. Some times for happiness, some times for sadness, some times for just a sense of trying to imagine what some people go thru in life, that I could only thank my lucky stars and God, that I nor my kids have ever had too. Amazing!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its awesome to play. you can play anytime or anywhere. I like it a lot. its fun and amazing. you should get it and have a lot of fun.
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|Ever wonder where super heros and thier sidekicks get trained.  Wonder no more Sky High is the place, Ron Wilson is the Bus driver..  Great Movie.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Wow - I probably could have written a better script when I was a sophmore in high school.  Didn't enjoy it at all.  Stopped the movie half way through and had no desire to watch the rest.  Goes to show that anyone can write a movie these days.
B00005PJ6M|5.0|Ya gotta love it, funny flick.  Bill and Ted beat death and win the girls.  Hell will never be the same since they were there.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game.I just cant put down if you love horses then this game is for you the only bad thing is it sometimes shuts down on its own and you have to reboot it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is such an amazing game. It really teaches you how to take care of. A horse. This game has taken my love of horses to a whole nother. Level
B0038W0OIK|5.0|The product is good 100% and was shipped in the same day and im fine with the service The product is good 100% and was shipped in the same day and im fine with the service. Love it
B009GESJH2|5.0|back to his roots but calmer,he can still rock them out and stay them with meaning and truth, buy it
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I was unaware lifeproof had so many imposters! This case is a terrible fake of the actual lifeproof cases. Not only was it not waterproof but the plastic is cheap and breaks easily. The switch on the side was also non-functional upon receiving this case.
B000SEI618|1.0|I really did not like this book.  There was no dialog at all, just a recital of what happened.  The main character kept going back and forth from youth to present day from one paragraph to another, very confusing.  Also, I am not a stupid person, yet I had to keep referring to the dictionary for so many words because I did not know their meaning. I see no purpose in using obscure words to describe events.  Do not bother reading this book it's not worth the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting and so much fun. I never thiught it would be fun but now my sister and i play it all the time
B001B51B9M|5.0|Nothing but fantastic.  This movie has got to be on the top seller list.  The color is great and the transfer to bluray is great.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love the whole series! I can't wait till the house of Hades comes out either! Read the books in order too bc they don't make sense if you don't.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Another great movie that has been remastered and it of good quality.  I would highly recommend this blu ray to all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very entertaining it makes me smile and the picture that we are looking at is the best possible way to get entertainment and the best way for you to get entertainment and the show was around the world.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This is a awesome movie i was so excited to see that they kept all the original actors and filmmakers on this movie. i will have to admit i thought that this one was better than 2. but i like all three of them. this was one of my top movies to see in theaters last year. but i didn't get around to it. i was very happy with the way they did the film. it had an excellent storyline. i will have to say this it would of not been a men in black movie without will smith or tommy lee jones. and i was impressed on how josh brolin played k hed did an excellent job portraying tommy lee jones. i hope they do another one. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B008QTVNUI|1.0|your server did not function. I never saw the show yet I was billed. How can you charge foe something not received?
B006C1DH92|4.0|Chose this game to improve my hand eye coordination.Need improvement at my age and its fun, too.Not very complicated.I enjoy it.
0062238868|1.0|Except for the intro and a paragraph here and there, I haven't read the book. Won't read the gory rest.<br /><br />But I know co-writer Chris Kyle (purported \\"author\\" of the ghost-written book) was shot to death today, at \\"a Texas gun range\\". He got his. That prompted this comment and \\"review\\".<br /><br />The man who boasted of killing 150 people as an assassin (a.k.a. \\"sniper\\") was himself killed by \\"a fellow war veteran with PTSD\\". Karma. Blowback. Poetical justice. \\"Those who live by the gun die by the gun\\". Etc. He had it coming.<br /><br />\\"The motive for the shooting [that killed Kyle] remains unclear\\" the report says. - Just like the motive for the Iraq-war remains unclear (except oil and US control is involved).<br /><br />The US marines went into Iraq \\"to liberate the country from Saddam Hussein\\", according to the book. A pure lie, and a reason tagged on after the \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" (remember that pretext?) reason became an obvious lie. And anyway, \\"to liberate\\" a country from its leader - of whatever quality - is in clear breach of the UN charter (article 2.1), mostly written by the USA's political elite. Rank hypocrisy. It was - and is - an illegal war (the US troops and \\"contractors\\" - a.k.a. mercenaries - are still there, reportedly some 20,000 in Dec. 2012). Iraq - the cradle of civilization (Sumer) - has been destroyed, at least 600,000 Iraqi people killed, and at least 2.2 million made refugees (UN numbers). There's still \\"low-frequency\\" war in Iraq.<br /><br />A state-sanctioned murderer is dead. We should all rejoice. He won't kill again.<br /><br />If you want to read a book of a man boasting of killing 150 people defending their country from illegal invasion, in simplistic, short sentences, ghost-written to profit from the corpses, go ahead. I admit, the concept of both this man and the book disgusts me.<br /><br />For anyone disliking the facts presented here, think of it the other way around: a superior power invades USA, with assassins killing those defending the country as it's being devastated, mostly to keep the foreign army occupied and the profits flowing to the weapons merchants. And then the biggest assassin boasting about it in a book published in the invading country. THINK.<br /><br />This book is a U.S. military propaganda stunt.
B008220B0C|1.0|I am giving the DVD 1 star as a reflection of Paramount and not for the quality of the film itself. I ordered this edition specifically for the digital copy and have not been able to download it. I have Silverlight installed but when I try to download it from the Paramount site I get nothing but a blank pop-up box. I tried contacting Paramount support twice and no response at all. Save your money. Very unhappy.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|I tried to read this book.  I kept trying to get into it but the main character was negative about herself and it spread to me and my enjoyment of the story.  Really dull.  Too bad.
0345308239|5.0|I must admit, Tuchman's detailed exploration of historical events was as fascinating as her interpretation of the follies these events revealed. From Troy to Montezuma, to the Founding Fathers, to the Popes, to the bombing of Vietnam, its all here in meticulous detail.  Barbara Tuchman is no slouch when it comes to doing her research.  Many consider her not just a historian but a historical detective, of sorts (see Tuchman,\\"The Historian as Detective\\")  Psychological inquiry is what I believe Tuchman does best in, \\"March of Folly\\". Her clever term, \\"Wooden-headedness\\", captures the essence of her overall thesis.  It is defined as the source of self-deception and of a pervasive refusal to benefit from experience.  Perversity is the antithesis of rational and wise decision making:judgements doomed to falter in large and catastrophic ways. Disturbed logic on a grand scale deserves the kind of analysis of events that Tuchman is renowned for. Folly, she tells us, is concerned with assessing events according to preconceived and fixed notions. Folly, as a manifestation of self-doubt, is as faulty as folly manifested by self-deception. I discovered that her psychological insights were personally relevant and I benefited from her careful analysis of events and people. Tuchman states, \\"People in power have acted unwisely, or foolishly, or perversely, as people in ordinary circumstances frequently do\\".  Not acting according to reason is inherent to human nature, she asserts.  The consequences are manifold when these delusions are perpetrated by governments. \\"Egocentrism\\" or \\"self-centredness\\" are  clinical terms referring to what Piaget calls, Pre-operational cognition.  Tuchman tells us that these are delusions or false beliefs. That is, beliefs that are maintained in the face of overwhelming and contradictory evidence. This is a worthwhile read  for your time and for your money. And, I believe, \\"The March of Folly\\" will never become outdated.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a very interesting book.  It is part history and part story - a very compelling Historical Fiction story.  I learned a lot about Cancer and cellular biology without feeling like I was reading a textbook.  A MUST read!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This sound machine surpasses any I have purchase in a store. It also has built in alarm clock with many settings for sleep timers,snooze, etc.GREAT APP

B008OJ291W|4.0|I cannot really tell much difference for this disc from the original works by ELO. I still like the music and enjoy having this collection of songs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun n when u get a tzt it pauses for u this is a amazayn piece of a game n i wish there was a second!!!!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Excellent read, I have followed Pendergast since Still Life with Crows, This is a compelling page turner. Many  question are answered and then some. Surprises are well placed with in the story
B002ZDOXLW|3.0|This music is slow, sleepy and lacks the lilting emotional adventure of other albums. Pleasant enough but nothing in particular seems to stand out which makes this collection very forgettable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|PERFECT for kindle fire... it is FUN,CHALLENGING,and a GREAT way to sit back and kill some time! I highly recommend this game to anyone :)
B0054SMID0|5.0|This movie had me saying \\"oh my gawd\\" about 3 dozen times throughout. The plot is incredibly solid and the acting is amazing. I was hesitant to watch a movie about the legal system, but I am FAR from disappointed.<br /><br />I apologize for the vague review, but this is the type of movie to be experienced to be truly appreciated.<br /><br />I will say this without a spoiler: the twists and turns will leave you breathless in some scenes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is crazy awesome. It's thrilling and once you play, you can't stop<br />Your addicted! Not to mention, Subway Surfers is involving many different things. Plus, the characters look awesome. If you agree, you should totally get this  game. Get it now!
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Not as good as the first two, the second one was the best, but worth watching, love the thought that goes into the creation of the movies.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really like this book. I like any book about nerds or dorks because I'm one! This book i recomend.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is great!!! I watched my friend play it on her iPad and she helped me find it on my kindle fire. I am now obsessed with it. And my brother was ahead of me. But I played and played and played.and I was Great. Now I am way ahead of him.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Thought this one of the Ice Age movies, loved the squirrel, going to rent it again when my grandchildren come to visit me, they too will love it. Thank you

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subwaysurfers is a very good at a lot of good attempt said Fred Thompson and i know it is a very good at a lot of people who are not the Christmas carols and i know
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I'm a little skeptical at shows like this because college humor has been overplayed for 3 decades already. I watched this with my family. Although there was a couple of curse words that I wasn't ready for, most of the adult content was not shown, only alluded to. My kids really enjoyed the musical aspect of the show, and my wife and I enjoyed the quick humor and dramatic characters. Great cast to watch, really brought the show to life. Good directing. Even though I knew where the show was going, it was such a wonderful adventure getting there, I didn't mind that there were no significant twists. I would definitely watch this again!
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|I'd forgotten how much I liked Rankin's Scottish cop. It's a bit sad, though, that the modern cop shop doesn't give Rebus the credit that's due. Or maybe they will: is Rebus really coming out of retirement? I look forward to the next installment. And hope that the younger detectives will figure out how much they can learn from the 'old guy'.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love Angry Birds. This one is not only challenging and fun, but Genius! I recommend this game to anyone, Angry Birds fans and Star Wars fans alike.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Interesting topic related to tolerance and inclusivity of a fifth grade boy with extreme cranial-facial abnormalities.<br />Good read for young person 10-15yrs
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It looked and sort-of felt cool, but as is didn't' make much sense.  The director's cut supposedly has over 40 minutes of material that didn't make it into the theatrical and initial DVD release we see here.  Perhaps when that extra 40 minutes is revealed, this movie will actually make sense.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|An English actor delivers fresh intrepration of New Orleans classics plus some classics performed by New Orleans musicians. Enjoyable listening.
1400168171|5.0|I am a guitarist and have been wanting to read this book for a long time.  I bought one for myself and two others as gifts to other musician friends.  I love this book!  It is all information I knew but was explained in a different way with visual examples that can be internalized.  My Musician friend who also loved the book is making it required reading for his students and found it to be a valuable tool to teach musicianship.  I also ordered the audio book so I can hear it all again!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I liked it just a couple on inconsistencies towards end... but good movie that I would encourage Batman lovers to check out
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I spent a whole day reading this book!!!! IT'S AMAZING I FELL IN LOVE WITH CONNOR!!!!!! Looking forward to read more books of this author
B004XZR63M|5.0|Kiyosaki opened my mind to a philosophy that at it's core, is about changing the way I think about money. I now realize that focusing on my day job is a trap that will never allow for financial independence.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|This app has good graphics and is easy to play if you play this game on a kindle or a phone I would use the setting go with gyro enjoy!!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I started playing and was pretty impressed. This app was fun and the graphics are stunning. After my first time playing the app quit working. It opens up to a blank screen or freezes.
B007ZFZI8C|3.0|was in good shape just very leery about the fact that it didn't come shrink wraped which more than likly means it was used when I thought that I was paying for a new never opened one. But none the less I do love the music....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining game. Much more to do than others I have played that are similar in style.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Such a fun and addictive movie!! My friends and I are obsessed!! Perfect balance of Acapella awesomeness and acknowledgment of the nerdiness!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is a classic Clancy novel with intregue that involves  world peace.  Not too much technology to comprehand !  His novels can look like tomes when you pick them up but they are page turners.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|Love it.  Really captures the Bruce concert energy.  Excellent production both sound and video.  Song selection is a great cross section spanning the spectrum of Bruce's writing talent.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is good for during any math question. I would recommend this app to have a fraction calculator because when I need help calculating it is very hard to do that in your head. This app helps me with my math home work. So if you need a free calculator this app will most likely help you. But if you need serious math help try looking for a better more updated calculator:)
B009A3NGF4|5.0|They really have a unique sound that is enjoyable to listen to. I find it rare when I can listen to an album from start to finish without wanting to skip a few tracks, but this one has the stuff. Get it and enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is great but after a while it gets a little bit boring but in the end it is really really fun
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I am a big fan of Katy Perry and her CD doesn't disappoint I love just about every single song on the CD. I always hate spending money on a CD because normally I only like 3 or 4 songs on it, but that is not the case here. I got my money's worth here. Katy Perry is fantastic!
B004GGTAQE|4.0|Good story from the German prospective on a part of the Russian front not normally covered. Not so much about the author as much as the company he served in. Good specific battle stories and the tactics used. Not much technical information or personal view about the Tiger tank. Surprising with such a title.
1426308469|5.0|My son LOVES the National Geographic Little kids First Big Books series. They are priced very well and have wonderful photos and information for growing little minds!
B00AIBZM40|5.0|The film starts out as a mystery. Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) crashes his car with his two daughters inside. They find refuge in an abandoned cabin. As Jeffrey prepares to murder his daughters we see an entity grab him.<br /><br />Five years later his brother (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is still searching for him. The searchers come across the now feral daughters (Megan Charpentier aka \\"The Red Queen\\", Isabelle N&eacute;lisse) who are reunited with their uncle and his goth rocker tattooed girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain). How did they survive for five years in the wild? The older girl tells a story about \\"Mama\\" who protected them and provided for them.<br /><br />The acting in this film was superior to most \\"B\\" horror films. The child actors did an excellent job. The special effects were decent. The scare factor was also fairly good and I found more chilling than the Paranormal series. Best seen in the dark with screaming tween girls.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb (Why did they do that?) No sex or nudity. 4 1/2 stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is a definite must read. I've enjoyed Colleen Hoover's Slammed series a lot, but found Hopeless to be even better. The content is a bit heavier, but definitely worth your while.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The movie keeps you interested the whole time and was very enjoyable to watch. Had to watch it twice to catch a couple of little things but overall it is not too bad to understand.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I dislike the ads.  Would rather just purchase it.  Please make candy crush available.  Would also like a guidebook of other bird uses.  Maybe suggestions when I give up
0977326403|2.0|I did not realize this was only the accompany to Good to Great. I was looking for the actual book which meant I had to make another purchase, I wasn't happy.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|My wife introduced me to the music of Diana Krall a few years ago and we got to see her in concert last year.  This CD is great.  I catch myself whistling the tunes days after I listened to the corresponding songs.  I would recommend it for anyone who likes the smoky voice of Diana Krall.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Another can't miss season of Downton Abbey. Very well acted with twists a plenty, who saw Sibel dieing. Love the way you hate a character one minute only to find them compelling (Tom)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put this down and was even glad that my 7 month old kept me up for two hours in the middle of the night because it was an excuse to read. An amazing set up and follow through, the details and writing really painted such a (bleak) picture of the silo life and what happened to those people. My only very minor complaint was that I occasionally felt like Juliette was this sort of super human Mary Sue. To say more would be a spoiler, but it hardly put a dent in how much I enjoyed this. Truthfully, I'd much rather read a sequel than a prequel...so I hope that author is still reading his reviews and takes this into consideration. Loved it. More more more!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is well written. But there's another great book about snipers in Afghanistan:<br />\\"Soviet Afghanistan Veterans Share Their Stories, Make Predictions. Comparison of Soviet (1979-1989) and American battlefield experience in Afghanistan (Warfare in Afghanistan: Now and Then)\\", available at Amazon http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B5YFS66<br />I just LOVED the story about how this Soviet sniper killed a whole column of mujahedeen with a single ACCIDENTAL shot! I guess those guys with Kalashnikovs were laughing their butts off when they saw there was nothing for them to do after that sniper from Moscow's shot!<br />The stories in this book, told by Soviet troops and intelligence agents, are a fascinating read. Clear assessments, inspired tactics and strategy in Afghanistan--these guys really knew how to do their job.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I wish there were subtitles  The volume on my  computer isn't always clear.  Love the series, acting and beautiful scenery
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Kept your attention..I fell in love with the relationship between will and lake. Makes you want something like that. Very good
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I have hundreds of CD's and believe me this is one of the most enjoyable CD's I have ever listened to in my life.  Very relaxing.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I read this book and gave it as a gift to a few friends, on both sides of the political party scene. Universally, it was proclaimed interesting and even-handed. It's well-researched, easy to read and a fascinating look behind the scenes in these relationships.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I find myself never being able to put this game down. I have it installed on my phone, tablet, kindle & computer.  I think I need Aa for bingo lol
B0012GMZ5E|5.0|This is an excellent album I can highly recommend. If you know Johnny you probably already know how good this album is and if you don't here a great a chance to own it at a bargain price.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|More fun and more challenging than the original! Love the addition of the mine! Works great on my 1st gen. Kindle Fire.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I thought it had a great story-line. I would recommend reading it.
1419701533|5.0|We gave these to our son for Christmas and now he can't but them down. I would recommend to anyone!!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Good Book, albeit far-fetched.  I enjoy Agent Pendergast books for their action plots and his eccentricity.  I also enjoy Douglas Preston's use of uncommon words that require me to pull out a dictionary from time to time.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie definitely isn't for everyone because it centers around college acapella singing teams, but my 13 year old daughter calls it her favorite movie and I laughed out loud when I watched it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An excellent account of the rigors of training and war in general and the raid that took down the head of the devil himself. Every American should read this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|LOVED IT!  Could not put it down. I love all the Nicholas Sparks books I have read and will definitely read more.
B009E3EYMY|4.0|It is hard to find good Zeppelin live concert material IMO and this is the best I've found.  Having been to 3 concerts in the 70s and always a bit disappointed that Page went off on a tangent, not often enough sticking to the original music that I loved.  Page's studio work  reveals his genius, which is hard to find live.  There just isn't much live footage availble (that I've been able to find) in the first place.  They did a lot of multi-tracking to make it all come together in the studio so without having a number of other performers/back-ups on stage, something has be sacrificed.  Yet still with this concert, Page manages to pull off some of the music I have always longed for in a live Zeppelin concert.  I don't know the other instruments as well as guitar but I believe everyone did well enough to make this a success.<br /><br />I was slightly amazed that they did &#34;Since I've Been Loving You&#34;.  While it was not exactly the beautiful studio version (which you could only pray for in a more quiet, night club environment), I enjoyed it very much and the fact that they did that and some unexpected others, made the entire disc well worth the cost.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Keeps the readers interest. I am glad I discovered this author on Amazon.<br />I plan to read many of Baldacci's books.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could not finish the book.  I am amazed that so many people could enjoy this type of writing.  Sick.
B000002UY3|5.0|i love this cd.It does not have fade into you which was her big hit but I enjoy all the songs on this cd
0765325950|5.0|... The subject says it all ... an epic ending ... now I just feel empty becuase it is over
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great for young children. My 7 year old loves it. I love how it teaches to take care of a horse, all the responsiblties for them. Really exciting game.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|25 dollars worth it to basically spend a weekend getting thru season as opposed to freebie off of PBS viewing
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I recommend this game to anyone who is thirteen years or younger. It takes practice to master, but it's fun. You may buy things with money, but you don't need to. Try it, it won't kill you. If you like it, try Temple Run.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|I found it nowhere near as gripping and as dynamic as others in the &#34;Reacher&#34;series. My Mother in law is also a &#34;Reacher&#34; fan and describes it as &#34;wishy washy&#34; and hard to follow.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I thoroughly loved this movie and want to watch it over and over.  Sandra Bullock never fails to bring a great performance and this was just one more of those excellent experiences.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|loved it diary of a wimpy kid is my favorite books its so funny and cool and awesome Best book ever
B00APUYWYA|5.0|this was very funny enjoyed this with my daughters, I would encourage you to take time and have a movie day
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game. Be nice if it had real multiplayer though. maybe even fishing or again more players or more mods like blaze.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|very interesting movie but if you are going to watch it no distraction plan to watch when quite and in the dark with surround sound oh yeah
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I like this app for selling it makes a cool cash register sound when you make a serious or get a bid , but  Limited on revise options,can't send invoices or adjust them, better buying app. Then selling, but works fir if your not hone on desk top or lap top to answer questions,see what you sold ,also to 're list ,
B0006AAS5G|2.0|The product is not as good as the pictures. They make it sound a great deal by showing the original price as 388 odd dollars. The fact is i would not pay more than $40.00...<br />Pros..<br />Package<br />Cons..<br />Everything else is a joke..
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World is a great book and well written.  I can't wait for the last book in the trilogy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this so much fun till you can't stop. ADDICTIVE exciting and fast pace. Please make something else.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|tastes good.<br /><br />Yea my laptop cooled down at least 5-10degrees C after applying a new coat. It really didn't have anything to do with AS5, but rather with the fact that some chinese worker decided to glob on a huge amount of grease on it during assembly. It's good for marketing because then the chips burn out faster.<br /><br />I'd give 5 stars if they would've just sent me like a crackball size amount instead of a whole eighth, as if I would need that much thermal grease in my lifetime. Like I said before, it's just good marketing. I only used like 0.1g, which is like a dabsworth. A 0.1g dab will take you really far out, man.<br /><br />I only give 1 out of 5 because I didn't even use 1/5th of 1/5th of 3.5g of robot smegma.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|When first reading this book I thought of Edward, I guess he's a hard act to follow but Holder holds his own very well and makes this book his own.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A surprising knowledge of medicine, quantum physics and spirituality, all presented in plain and seriously genuine, humble prose. As an engineer and scientist who minored in quantum physics, I have been puzzling over the spiritual implications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for decades......not to mention the whole question of what happens after we die.....this book gives us a much clearer insight into these questions. A must read if you have the slightest interest in these topics! Thank you, Eben, for sharing this experience with us.......
B005LAIISA|5.0|I have enjoyed the whole Ice Age series.  We think this one might be our favorite.  It shows loyalty to family no matter what.  It also makes light of older age problems in a light hearted way.  I do not see it as demeaning old age but  just taking what comes in the best of light.
0802473628|5.0|This is a quick read but has tons of great info on communicating in relationships.I'm going to try the others in the series
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Absolutely love this game.  It would be nice if the game could go a little faster.  The graphics are really nice.  The horse is really cute.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|A lot of fun with different settings than the usual.  Granddaughters luv it. Relax and the enjoy the game play.
B007SGM084|5.0|They kept me wondering what was going to happen at every turn of a page.  I was a bit shocked at first, but Ms James has a way with words.  I was sad when I finished Freed.  I'm hoping she will put pen to paper again & bring us further into Christian & Ana's world.  Or a brand new story!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|a classic but still timely. people never change much. clothing changes but the people inside stay pretty much the same
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is intriguing, hot but innocent at the same time. The characters grow on you. I could not put this book down. Very entertaining.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks did it again. Great reading. I loved this book!!  He never let's you down!  I highly recommend this book
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, it kept me busy for a while! Some of these games can be boring or silly, but this one kept me engaged.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is the perfect portrayal of Enso's emotions during his life.  I'm a dog lover, so this was an easy read and I enjoyed it very much! If you love auto racing, this would also be an great book for you!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Very good reading.  I enjoyed this book very much and will certainly read more from this author. He keeps you coming back for more.  You will not be disappointed purchasing this book.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Of course after watching the original 14 times there wasn't a question whether I'd get this pack. Couldn't use all of it though but I had friends who were willing to split the cost.  Worked out great.
B0072OFM28|5.0|All that I expected.  Great stories and great motivation to go to the gym!  I will tell all of my friends.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|There are a lot of reviews here for this movie, so there is not much more that I can add, that has not already been said.<br /><br />But I really enjoyed this movie, so I have to at least throw in my 2 cents or more :-)<br /><br />(Side Note:<br />The movie is based on a real family of  moon-shining  brothers, and a real incident that ends up in the papers. I believe there is a book out right now, about the real brothers behind the movie LAWLESS, written by the grandson of one of the brothers shown in this movie. I don't want to give away which brother that is.)<br /><br />I love period film pieces. And the era of the 20's and 30's has always appealed to me as well. So right off the bat, I knew from seeing the trailer, I was bound to rent this  movie sooner or later.<br /><br /> Funny how the period piece films bring a nostalgia to them, that you actually feel, even if you were not even born at the time the movie/story is taking place.<br /><br />This was well done as far as giving the viewer the feel for what the Prohibition Days were like down south and how MOONSHINE production was taken very seriously- not just for personal consumption, but for re-sale to others.<br /><br />Whether it was made and sold to locals or a bigger concern- like gangsters, who would often then re-sell it as well;for the time booze was illegal, moonshine was a big money maker for those creating it.<br /><br />In reality, and upon looking back at the proliferation of booze that still flowed across America despite the ban - Prohibition not only did not stop the use of alcohol- it drove up the demand.<br /><br />That was the lesson learned about trying to ban alcohol.<br /><br />You have to wonder, for the amount of years booze was illegal, how many people were getting rich off the illegality- as well as how many people got sick or died off bad moonshine.<br /><br />(Going blind or dropping dead were the risk you took, if you bought moonshine  made by someone who didn't know what they were doing.)<br /><br />But as always, when there is a demand for something- especially something hard to get and illicit- there is big money to be had.<br /><br />The three tightly knit brothers in LAWLESS jumped on this money making bandwagon early in the game, although the two older brothers try to keep the youngest( Shia Lebouf) from being *too* involved in the business, which he greatly resents.<br /><br />They definitely love him- and there is a deep thread of loyalty that hold all three together, but the two older brothers don't seem to think their little brother has what it takes to play by the rules in this game.<br /><br />They make it clear this is not a game one can screw up in.<br /><br />Mistakes get people shot and often killed. Mistakes can piss off people and stir up trouble.<br /><br />So, while the money they earn is shared amongst all of them,( they also run a restaurant as well) Shia Lebouf's youth and immaturity cause the brothers to shut him out of things; for his own sake and for the sake of their thriving business.<br /><br />In the very rural area  where the brothers reside, it is unspoken code that law enforcement looks the other way for local moonshiners - out of courtesy or for a little kickback.<br /><br />Nobody hassles anyone really. It is a peaceful, predictable life and the townsfolk all seem to get along.<br /><br />That is,until Guy Pearce's character comes to town.<br /><br />Pearce has slime ball written all over him.<br /><br /> A sadistic, city slicker, quirky in a sick & twisted way, he announces himself a federal arm of the law who will hunt down every moonshiner until there are none left.<br /><br />He has heard about the moonshine business being very lucrative in this area, but more importantly he has heard about the three brothers, in particularly the one brother who is deemed *immortal*( played by a scruffily handsome Tom Hardy).<br /><br /> This is the local lore and it more or less develops that Hardy is immortal because ofthe many trials and tribulations he has endured in his young life, particularly when it comes to fighting, particularly with guns.<br /><br />Guy Pearce is both intrigued and amused by the lore of this brother who can't be killed.<br /><br /> It should be noted that it is Tom Hardy's character who basically plays the head of the family to the other 2 brothers.  ( Their parents died earlier but that is not depicted in the film.)<br /><br />He is looked up to by his brothers with great awe, respect and admiration.<br /><br /> Also,it is always his word that is final in any matters regarding the family- particularly the business end of things.<br /><br />Guy Pearce  finally gets the chance to meet Hardy and the exchange is an unpleasant one.<br /><br />One which Hardy makes it clear, that Pearce's presence and  position of law enforcement, don't mean squat to him.<br /><br />Verbally, he gives Pearce the proverbial slap in the face, and in front of others, no less.<br /><br />Pearce walks away thinking it is time to take Tom Hardy and his almighty reputation down a notch.<br /><br />Developing an instant hatred for the man, Pearce is all too eager to be the man to see  the *immortal one* go down in flames.<br /><br />He becomes hellbent on destroying  not just  Tom Hardy 's character, but also, his moon-shining brothers and their business.<br /><br /> Kudos for Guy Pearce, for playing one of the creepiest, skin crawling characters to ever show up in story line,with such subtly.<br /><br />Accolades for Tom Hardy, playing the strong silent type, that tends to delivers cryptic words of wisdom.<br /><br />The guy who has been to hell and back and is still standing.<br /><br />This is a character, who never actually looks for a fight, but also never backs down from one.<br /><br />He always comports himself with confidence, not arrogance.<br /><br />Sometimes  he has a  certain look or gives off an affect at times, that says that under all that tough veneer, that ability to always seem steel strong, that there might be a layer of emotional vulnerability buried deep inside, underneath it all.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain is there as a  meaningful character but how meaningful is not realized right away.<br /><br />While her part is important, she doesn't get to do all that much talking.<br /><br />Regardless, it becomes obvious she is an integral part of the storyline as it moves along.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is a personification, a collage if you will,of any and all gangsters of that era, whose names were on the headlines of newspapers, or heard about on the radio, back in the day.<br /><br />His film time is brief- too brief really. (Especially if you are an Oldman fan.)<br /><br />Though his screen time is short, it is Oldman's  character's unusual meeting and  interaction with Shia Lebouf , that leaves an impact on Lebouf's character and gives him the guts and incentive to show his brothers he is definitely ready to join their ranks.<br /><br />He feels he can finally prove to them, he has what it it takes to finally work hands on, in the business, especially doing physical transactions of transporting moon-shine.<br /><br />Is this film violent?  Yes, it is, and the violence is up close and gritty, but it is not gratuitous violence in my opinion.<br /><br />It is there to show how ruthless things start to get, in this once sleepy little town, once Guy Pearce sticks his nose into things.<br /><br /> And trust me- moonshine might be illegal but you will hate Guy Pearce so much, it will just give you all the more reason to root for not just the 3 brothers, but anybody trying to get by, selling their home made moonshine.<br /><br />The whole movie takes on a new tone and a different pace, once Guy Pearce's character comes to town to make trouble, and a name for himself.<br /><br /> If you can handle violence and want to see how life in the South was during the prohibition( as opposed to often seeing it  depicted in the big cities)thisis a fast paced movie, with a definite amount of suspense, where all the key characters play their parts well and an ending that should satisfy all.<br /><br />I know that after  seeing this movie, I later went online to look up more about this trio, as well as reviewing articles on the Prohibition era in general.<br /><br />It might certainly look a lot more glamorous and macho in the movies  of Hollywood,as depicted in the past and present, but there is no doubt that the Prohibition days were colorful, interesting and, often daringly dangerous times indeed.o always seem steel strong, that there might be a layer of emotional vulnerability buried deep inside, underneath it all.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain is there as a  meaningful character but how meaningful is not realized right away.<br /><br />While her part is important, she doesn't get to do all that much talking.<br /><br />Regardless, it becomes obvious she is an integral part of the storyline as it moves along.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is a personification, a collage if you will,of any and all gangsters of that era, whose names were on the headlines of newspapers, or heard about on the radio, back in the day.<br /><br />His film time is brief- too brief really.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game love it good when your bored and can play with or without the internet great for when in doctors office
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A very well written story with interesting characters and an original story, this series has made it difficult to put my kindle down.  The story slowly unravels as well as the scope and scale of the silo but never ceases to keep you wondering what's going to happen next.  If you like post apocalyptic survival stories, or just enjoy the Fallout series, you'll enjoy Wool.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run was great but they have just over done themselves. Temple run 2 is really good. If you loved or still love temple run this is a great game for you.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|This was a favorite of our Book Club.  Had a great discussion about the story line and enjoyed how the author presented the characters.
0316228532|2.0|Did not like the story nor did I care about any of the characters, good or bad.<br />My bookclub read this book; 3  (out of 15) finished it, 5 wanted to finish it, 7 did not want to continue.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This CD brings back fond memories of times gone by.  I love the musical background and expert rendition by McCartney.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|I bought this from my son's Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy with the gift wrap I ordered.  It looked very classy, and my son was very pleased!
B003XREL98|4.0|This novel opens new vistas in a previously unknown landscape at a vantage point of another century.  I liked it.
B003R4ZMJU|2.0|When the mother began having sex with a cop who was prosecuting her daughter for stealing a pair of sunglasses, I knew it would be bad.  Would this really ever happen?  And she kept doing it.  BS meter went through the roof.  The girls are so hot that at times I turned off the dialogue; it interfered with my appreciation of 20 year olds playing high schoolers.  And I've never seen that much makeup on anyone in high school.<br /><br />I am not going to continue the series or buy any additional episodes.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|I only really liked 2 or 3 songs off of this CD, but that's just because I'm not too much into slower songs. For anyone who likes slow songs a lot, I think they would love it!
B0017JMOSE|5.0|Crystal clear recording with everything done right for an LP.  The music reminds the casual listener that these tunes have been used for everything, a lot of it commercial so it's accessible for the non-jazz listener.<br /><br />The crazy beat changes, the piano, the musicians are all exceptional; on every song.<br /><br />Jazz for the rock stars.
1400052173|5.0|This book arrived promptly, and in great condition. Though I had ordered it late, and needed it for a class, it still arrived before the first assignment was due from it. When I opened the cover, there was a handwritten note inside, which made my day because it was unexpected. Though it only took a few minutes, the seller made my day a little brighter, and I appreciate that a lot!
0470876417|2.0|I am starting a new business, very busy, and am frantically sucking up every available sliver of business advice. I must have read hundreds of business books and issues of Inc. So grateful when I can find something I can put into action.<br /><br />This book seemed to have a lot of promise, but while it's pretty to look it, I found the contents neither accurate (i.e. reporting on what people actually did), nor actionable/useful. Words and pictures on a page, giving the impression of substance while teaching nothing.<br /><br />It's just cute  - maybe interesting for people who want to imagine themselves being in business without actually doing the thing described - building a business model and starting a company.<br /><br />A much better book on startups that lacks pretty pictures but DOES provide a usable *process* is [[ASIN:1449305172 Running Lean: Iterate from Plan A to a Plan That Works (Lean Series)]]. If you're a busy businessperson or entrepreneur, read that instead.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I could play by the hours.  It makes me use my head, and my reflexes. It has a good variety of games and keeps your thoughts going.
B0036OS3E2|5.0|I bought to my friend as a gift and she looks nice and sexy. In order to protect her feet from rain, they're very nice.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like all kinds of solitaire.  another game that uses your thought machine.  Glad that I can still use it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I do not like the app. It freezes and force closes all the time!! waste of time, just use the one amazon provides its better than this!
B009VB9VKY|1.0|This movie was a disappointment.  The trailer gives the impression that this film has a love story sub plot, but that is far from reality.  The best scenes are actually in the trailer.  The quality of the film was very poor.  There was a yellow tint on all outdoor scenes.  There was very little quality dialog in this film.  Don't waste your time or money on this flop.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is super fun and very interesting and very addicting. Once u start u cancan't stop.the game is cool and super great.
1451695195|5.0|What he describes is what I have always believed and he confirmed.  He writes beautifully and makes you feel like you're on the journey with him.  There is a lot of medical language/technical explanations, but I don't know how he could simplify it further. I was able to follow it and didn't want it to end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the best series I have read. I recommend it for everyone. I just hate that's it's over. AWESOME.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I really had to struggle to finish this book.  The characters never really interested me.  I don't feel that I have to like the characters in a murder mystery, but I do have to find them interesting and in the end I just didn't care what happened to these people.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Excellent book with great descriptions of the President's and their life after the presidency.  I never realized how many took advantage of the experience of others and who totally ignored the experience.  Well written and very accurate.
B001AG52AG|2.0|This movie is visually beautiful and extremely well-cast. Those are the reasons for the two stars.<br /><br />Now for the reasons for the missing three.<br /><br />It's not unusual at all for a movie to leave out parts of the book on which it was based. It's not unusual for multiple characters to be composited into a single character. This movie, however, left out an additional - and very important component - the point.<br /><br />Book Spoiler - Don't worry if you're only going to watch the movie. It's not in there anyway.<br /><br />Throughout the movie we're told that the Gobblers are doing something dastardly to children, but we're NEVER told what. Oh yeah. They're ripping away their SOULS! And children die. From having their SOULS ripped away. Bet you didn't know that if you haven't read the book. And the ending? \\"We're going to find Father and everything will be alright.\\" Excuse me. What???? You're kidding, right?<br /><br />Try telling the story of Red Riding Hood without the \\"Wolf eats Granny\\" part. Forget this movie. Read the book -- but not to your kids.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I would recomend this series to most of my friends. The writing and the acting is first class. The best!
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Always, always, a book that talks of a non-western culture catches my interest....Though there is an interplay of the American culture here, most of the story tackled the good and bad of India, as a country,  a culture, a people.<br /><br />The author gave a very good account of how one fares in another's culture or country (Indian in America, American in India).  Further, she relates a story of a family with an Indian man, an American woman with an adopted Indian daughter.  It goes outside the bounds or perspective of a tourist in a foreign land.  A tourist only has to stay for a finite number of days in a foreign lad, while an adopted family member, though it was not her choice, has to embrace her adoptive family, race differences and all.<br /><br />As much as the story is about differing races, it is also about the adaptability of human beings.  How decisions made are not really borne out of racial differences, as sometimes we are made to believe; we decide based on our emotions and reasonings.  If only it is easy to do as to say or write it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very different and yet intriging.I recommend it to anyone. Can't wait to finish the book and  then I'll see the film.<br />ll see th

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it the only thing I DO when I get him  is come play subway surfers.I get so into the game every time I almost get caught I make a grunting sound an  I don't  even know I do (my mom told me ) I got every on  in my house to play it lol they love it........if you are reading this and don't have subway surfers then download it I am 100% you will LOVE IT like I do

B008HT4FUW|5.0|Everyone has been talking about Downton Abbey and numerous awards have been given to this series, so I decided to &#34;catch up.&#34;  Am I ever happy I did.  Now I can talk with my friends.  This is truly an absorbing story of the early 20th century life.
B0040GR01M|4.0|I love this album! There's nothing else to say really. If you like Three Days Grace you probably already have this album.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Important finale (of a sorts) on elements of the Clancy Jack Ryan and John Clark saga.  You can see the transition to the new guard to a certain extent.  Good plot elements and favorite characters with enough intrigue and challenge to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Curious where the series goes from here.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I really like it but when I am winning and about to lose I prush save me in ....it fall like completely shut down :-( when they fix that I would give them a 5
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just when I think nothing else could happen..... It keeps getting better and better!  Great job to the writer and production team!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Much fun for little girls, but has stuff on there that is not parent friendly. I absolutely do not like the scam side of the game though. Trying to sell the gems you need to buy virtual clothing. C'Mon, spending an extra $20 a pop to buy pretend stuff - get real...<br />Beware, your child can rack up a $100 bill real quick and they have other scams on there to get them to sign up for spam email junk.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|highly recommended, the selected songs are just expectacular, the quality of the show with its expectacular background and the beautiful audiences
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|I rally liked the look of this one, and it looked quite promising. However, as soon as Ihit the missile level I got really pissed. They refuse to be aimed, and the hitboxs on the cans are so small its near impossible to hit them with the practice the first levels give. Otherwise, 5 three levels I played before missiles I liked, but not after.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|highly recommended, just love  the old songs, the presentation, the quality the show was filmed inspite of the bad weather.
0765325950|1.0|Here I was, ready to spend money; and I find out there's a moronic delay for the eBook version.<br /><br />Sorry, I'll wait - or maybe if I can't there's always stuff to source from the 'Net.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!! It makes scream out loud and people look at me all crazy!<br />I love love love it!
B005JABSB6|5.0|These pair of Sharp proprietry glasses were actually bundled with my new flat screen. We used them and found them to work great.  They depend on a rechargable battery that does not get alot of use in our household, we didn't buy the set for 3D...
B00127RAJY|5.0|When I first did level 1, I thought I would die. I was new to exercise and out of shape. Each day I did the 30 Day Shred, I gained strength and endurance. Something I did not have. I also lost weight and inches. My clothes fit better, too. The shred is actually 27 minutes, but that's ok. It's still a short workout. Especially for those starting out. I like that the shred is based on Jillian's 3-2-1 system. 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs. The workouts go by really fast. Each level is hard when you first begin, but gets better the more you do it. Doing the 30 Day Shred for a month got me into the habit of daily exercise which is a good thing. Jillian is no nonsense, but she gets the job done.<br /><br />There are modified moves for those not as fit or new to exercise. Follow Anita, she does the modified moves whereas Natalie does the advanced moves.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love every minute of Downton Abbey. It's one of the best shows on T.V. at this time. Watch it<br />every Sunday night
B006LSZECO|5.0|Ms. Flynn's imagination is beyond amazing. The book is riveting, with astonishing characters and jaw-dropping plot twists. Delightfully sinister...read it!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love Taylor Swift, but not the new Taylor Swift. She is getting a little too adult  for me. No matter what she says everyone fell in love with the Taylor Swift who wrote about heartbreak in a country matter and wrote about her friends. I love all her albums, but I want to see the old Taylor Swift. I need a role model, Taylor Swift used to be my role model, but the way she acts isn't cool. I'm sure many other Taylor Swift fans agree with me, and agree that Taylor Swift hasn't her act together. If she goes back to the way she was, I'd like her more. And maybe its high time for me to pick another role model. :-( Maybe if she writes another song, one more country and Taylor Swift-ish, I'd like her more. I love her now, but who's to say what she will be like in afew years? No one knows, but I hope she gets no more adult-ish.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It works perfectly, no problems, thank you.  Thank you very much, Sean Dodson.<br /><br />I like my kindle much more than I would have ever expected.<br /><br />Love, Linda
B006LSZECO|2.0|Had promise with an early, interesting start to the novel. Unfortunately, it became disjointed and preposterous -- leaving the reader with no protagonist to really stay connected with. Also hated that it seemed to have 3 spots for an end-- I liked my own ending best!!  Read it for book club.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Normally I don't write reviews, but more people need to see this film. I could tell within the opening few shots that this would be one of the best films I have seen in decades. This film was obviously made with painstaking attention to detail that gives it a feeling of complete wholeness--there is nothing extraneous or out of place, everything fits and the music wonderfully compliments the action on screen without too pushily telling the viewer how to feel. The big names deliver the caliber of performance you would expect (you can't go wrong marrying Frances McDormand and Bill Murray), but you find yourself surprised by the quality of the child actors and their poignant performances. Moonrise Kingdom is intoxicating in its feeling of storybook-esque nostalgia without becoming cheesy or hackneyed as has unfortunately happened to Tim Burton's work. Perhaps there is something particularly moving about a love story between twelve year olds whose egos haven't yet become confused by the ordeal of adolescence and high school and whose relationship isn't complicated by sex, although the subject certainly is not skirted. Overall, it was wonderful and I could watch it again and again.
B003WJQ74E|4.0|Charlie knows both extremes of the IQ ladder. Reading of his changes, successes, misfortunes and battle to find himself is interesting yet sad. With knowledge Charlie becomes arrogant, losing his kind childlike qualities. Then his spiral back down the knowledge ladder breaks your heart. Good read
B006O3MU96|2.0|I could see how this game could be fun for other people.  I just found it frustrating and there wasn't enough to it.
B009E3EXMU|4.0|I only gave this 4 out of 5 stars because of some of the editing that Jimmy Page did to it. I've been listening to the bootleg of this show since it came out, & I can hear the differences. Nothing that takes away from the performance mind you, but when you're a purist like me, I like a live recording to be &#34;live,&#34; although I do love the Song Remains the Same, which had similar editing done to it. As far as the performance goes, it was great!!! Jason stepped right into his father's shoes and played the best performance of his life. Robert (whom I cannot stand, and whose voice was awful after 1972) even had a great night. Some of the songs are tuned down an octave or two to accomodate his vocals, but it still worked. Jonesy, of course, was right on, never missing a step as usual. Page, while a little rusty in a few spots was just unbelievable on the whole. First time they ever played &#34;For Your Life&#34; in public, and it was absolutely killer! Also, the best live performance of Kashmir to date. Dvd was great too (although there were too many close-ups on Robert's leathery, ugly face.  I would soooo recommend this to any Zeppelin fan in it for the music.
0765325950|5.0|I love this series.  I've read most of the 14 novels three times.  The world is detailed, the characters many and unique.  I care for all of them.  I hate the enemy.  I thrill at the victories ofthe heroes.  When I finished this book late after my self-imposed bedtime, I was pleased and upset.  Olver's ending alone had me in tears I was so touched.  It took me some time to calm down enough to fall asleep so sad was I that these people had left my life.<br /><br />I was saddened by the passing of Robert Jordan, but if anything good came out of it, it was the fact that it introduced me to Brandon Sanderson who is now my favorite author.  I feel he did a fantastic, though not flawless, job with all of the characters.  He did do a great job bringing back any character who was of any significance in the entire series who wasn't of course dead already.  My only complaint is that I would have loved some exposition on the state of the world something like 20 years after The Last Battle.  What happened with Rand in the end was a tad cliche as well, though perhaps Robert Jordan didn't flesh any of that out enough in his notes and Brandon may have been loathe to decide too much in a borrowed world.<br /><br />Read this book.  Of course read the first 13.  It will be worth it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this! Had to read in a day. No way could I put it down. I had to know what happened! It's gut wrenching and wonderful at the same time! I personally loved book 2 the most, so there was no way I was going to delay reading the final book. I'm heart broken its over
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|I was immediatly turned off.  It might be more fun if you are a child.  I could just have used more used of the drawing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because you can earn a lot of stuff throughout the game.It also changes the map like regular,Rio, and Christmas.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This game is a little whimsical and a little hard.  Both are big pluses.  While every level was different I wish this was a little more variety in gameplay.  Considering this is a physics game that's probably asking a bit much.  Very good game though.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator has big buttons and is very easy to use. Great App. I would highly recommend this app to anyone.
0345529057|5.0|I you like the show you'll love the books. I'm reading them along side the show so I'm only on the second. The only problem is that the box they all come in is a VERY tight fit and its hard to get them back in after reading.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was a good read overall, loved all the music references throughout as well.  It was written in the form of letters, which I wasn't expecting but that did not take away anything from flow of the story.  Pretty funny at parts and definitely a smart coming of age story.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|A good read.  Reinforces what I have believed for a long time...that death should be feared.  Very well written...even with all the medical terminology.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I expected this to not truly be free, but rather a free trial. I didn't realize it was like the Facebook games where you have to recruit/annoy to beg them to give you stuff you need to progress or constantly spend real money to advance in the levels. I really enjoy hidden object games, but not ones with endless cost.
B000YL98RG|5.0|worked fine & was a great gift for my mom, she loves this movie so had to get it for her.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|My family of five started watching LOST on DVD last Nov or Dec (2012) and only one of us had EVER seen Lost before. I never watched it EVER when it was on TV but my husband did (wasn't my husband then) and when we married in 2011 he BEGGED me to watch the LOST seasons with him but I didn't buy into all the hype back when it was on and didn't want to start now.<br /><br />But I gave it more thought and I decided to go ahead and \\"try\\" and see if I could \\"get through\\" the first few episodes before telling him \\"well I tried and it's just not that good\\". Well, I was WRONG!!!! I could not believe how HOOKED my girls and I got from the very first episode and we still are! We cannot get enough of LOST. My 17 year old loves it and my 13 year old is absolutely obsessed with it!!

She's on Season 3 on her \\"own time\\" while we all watch it together.<br /><br />We have watched Season 1-5 now with last night being the finale of season 5. We are VERY sad that season 6 is upon us already and will be very sad when we're all caught up and we're done. I bought season 3-6 on Amazon and I am SOOO glad I did!! I HOPE you will watch every single episode of LOST and give it a chance. We think it is the BEST show we have EVER seen!!<br /><br />Heck, I even dream about it pretty much every night. The only thing I don't like is that there aren't enough episodes in season 5 and 6!!!! I cannot recommend LOST highly enough! There just isn't enough \\"stars\\" available to rate this show!!! You will fall in LOVE with the characters (we LOVE to list our favorite characters IN ORDER and discuss why and what's going on during each episode), LOVE the plot, LOVE the scenery, LOVE the humor!!! LOVE the whole CONCEPT of the show and LOVE LOVE LOVE being engrossed in it!!!!! Thank God we can pause the Blu Ray player because we always have to pause it and go \\"no way!!! what!?!\\" and discuss what is going on!! It is SOOOO exciting!!!!!!discuss what is going on!!

B0027Z837S|5.0|Funny and engaging, the movie is so fast-paced and beautifully done that you don't even notice that there are subtitles
B005LAIIPS|2.0|This was a pure waste of talent. Bourne always had a personality and a mission. In this endless run, chase and never solve anything outing, it plays like an episode from the old TV series 'The Fugative', except Bourne doesn't solve any real problems for anyone else either. It's sad to spend so much time and money making a film that has no heart, no soul, no satisfactory ending.<br /><br />I wish Hollywood would wake up. Characters make even a poor plot interesting, while special effects, explosions and chase scenes do nothing but make the audience wish the show would end.

B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED is an inspiring conference.  I first learned about it from a professor.  The conference brings some of the most talented and inspiring speakers to the forefront of learning.  There was a lady who spoke about marketing to different cultures only to find out later that she was blind and yet so knowledgeable about people.  Another speaker taught me how to tie shoe laces that won't loosen even though I thought, and as the speaker thought, we already knew how to tie shoe laces.  I told my friends about how to tie shoe laces, they tried it out and kept thanking me about how their laces no longer come loose.  This app makes it easy to find these programs.  You just type in a word search such as tie shoe laces, and you'll find the program that will teach you.  Thanks TED for the programs and recorded videos.  TED makes it easy to want to learn new ideas.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game, it's my old stand-by for time wasting. I love the options for background and card backs and faces. It has never locked up or let me down yet and I've had it for over a year now.
B007SGM084|5.0|If I didn't want my wife to bother me for a couple of weeks, this would be the trilogy to provide her. As it stands, my wife has abandoned our family without packing a bag. She has the electronic edition on the kindle touch, so she uses it on the toilet, when she's driving to work (hey, at least she's not texting), when it's date night (sex night where I come from), when the kids need to be picked up, when dinner needs to be cooked, when I'm sick in bed with the flu & I need the damn light turned off because it's 3 am & she's still reading the 2nd book. The nipple clamps would be a good idea if I could just pry her away from the book for 2 minutes. Can she at least give ME a kiss before she leaves the house, instead of keeping her eyes glued to the pages of the book.<br />  *update. We took a parenting class when she started the 3rd book. The kids now look like feral children, I haven't had sex in weeks & get horny when the wind blows, there are no more clean dishes in the house & this is the 3rd week I'm wearing the same clothes. I feel this is a turning point. We are sitting in the class & my wife is taking notes on her...wait!!! She's reading that damn book again!

B003EYVXTG|5.0|This was a hard movie for me because I related so much with Ree Jennifer Laurence's character. I have not lived in that area, but I have met people like those in the film. I have had to scramble for my life at times, but it does make you fight harder for what you want. John Hawkes is superb as always. I can't think of any time I have seen him and thought he did a crap job. He is my favorite character actor of today. I say character actor even though I believe he could carry a leading role in a film on his own merit. If they ever gave him a chance. Please see this movie or buy it so you can see what real acting is all about..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Thanks so much, really great service and item in perfect condition, I really appreciate it a lot, thanks so much!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I feel lucky to have been around to see this film. It is a lovely, heartbreaking, and yet joyful movie. Everyone is so amazing in their roles. I have never seen John Hawkes like this and he blows me away with each new role he tackles. Just having seen him in martha marcy may marlene as the intriguing yet menacing Patrick. I was so surprised to see him play this sweet and creative man. Helen Hunt and Bill Macy are also fabulous in their roles. Helen was so brave and beautiful in her surrogate role. She shows such depth of feeling for Mark in the movie. I fell for him myself. I am telling everyone I know to see this movie. And I am so disappointed that the Academy ignored this indie gem. Shame on them..
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|This is a great follow up to Phantom.  I love the songs and the lyrics done and the story line.  The range of notes both Christine and the Phantom does in this musical is just great.  Very good and highly recommend it.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|I watched this movie with no expectations at all. In the end I really enjoyed it and felt Daniel did a great job in this movie. Can't wait to see what else he will do in the future. Janet McTeer is also amazing in this movie. I was actually creeped out while watching this movie and ended up turning on some lights. The landscape is perfect for this film and adds much to the feel of the movie. Watch it, it is a good movie.
B0018OFN4U|5.0|I love this movie - Simon Pegg is Hilarious!  Nice spin to the whole zombie apocalypse mood, and the music is perfect :)
B004QX07G4|5.0|It's hard not to read this book with Ellen's voice in your head. It's amazingly funny and very helpful in a lot of ways. She gives tips on how to live life to its fullest and, of course, her main advice for doing so is by laughing, dancing, and showing care to others. Another hit by my hero, Ellen Degeneres!
B003QCCS36|5.0|Oh my - now THIS CD is without a doubt, one of my favorites. Reminiscent of early Dan Fogelberg, these songs are so heart-felt and delivered with pure emotion, that they get stuck in your head, for an entire day.  Incredible CD!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I wake up in a better mood because of the music I have the power to choose to play. It makes me enjoy waking up :)
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|Engaging tale about Nev who is a New York City dweller/photographer.  A picture of his is published and he receives a painting of the picture in the mail.  Thus begins a 'relationship' as he is told a young girl by the name of Abby made the painting from his published photo. Young Abby lives with her family in Michigan. The relationship is mostly on Facebook with some occasional phone calls.  More paintings are sent.  Nev makes contact with other members of Abby's family, including her mom (Angie) and a 19-year-old sister (Megan) whom Nev falls in love with.  There is always some strange happenings with Abby's family.<br /><br />Nev's brother decides to record the relationship.  Nev, his bro, and a friend go to Colorado to shot some pictures and are in contact with Megan on the computer, she says she will sing a song and will take requests.  Since Megan is involved with horses they request 'Tenn. Stud'<br /><br />After half an hour she has the song for them.  Then, they decide to see if they can find the song on utube and they find the exact song that she said was hers.  He is not happy, she explains that it is a cover song.  By now Nev is curious, they have had a 'relationship' for months.<br /><br />They decide to travel from Colorado to Michigan to check things out.  From there the whole thing begins to unravel as they become detectives. It is alsmost like watching a slow motion car wreck, like the transformation from Buddy Love in [[ASIN:B001K3GASM The Nutty Professor (1963)]] as we see the whole thing self distruct, a pitiful sight. Unreal, hard to believe.<br /><br />At the end a character explains that when Cod fish were transported to China, the fish's skin became like mush, so, they put a Catfish in with the Cod to \\"keep them fresh\\". She was keeping him fresh.<br /><br />In the special features they interview themselves and aspire to explain that yes, the documentary is real, though they did not say it, I guess they were trying to say it was not like [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]].  Memerable little music riff.<br /><br />So popular that a TV show has been made of it, [[ASIN:B00B19FDFG Tyler & Amanda]].
1401223176|5.0|A Great story, it kept me guessing until the very end.  Even more amazing illustrations! Jim Lee is a perfectionist!!
B008476HBM|5.0|I was surprised in myself that I had never read such a good classic.  I have seen the movir, etc, but that never compares with reading the book.. I am so glad I read it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy watching this show. The characters in the series feel like they are family. There is also lots of intrigue,
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great movie, no problems at all with anything that has been ordered from you.  Will continue to purchase from you.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have been looking for a book to get me out of a slump for over a year. I want a book to clench onto my attention and keep me wanting to read and this one did the trick. This dangerous love-affair plot isn't all that gushy romantic as most teen books. It is more of a curiosity as to what could possibly be brought up next. I recommend that anyone who is compelled to smart wit and maybe a little bit of love should read this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting! Any horse lover should try it out! It is easy to learn and hard to put down!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read a Stephen King book in ages and the premise of this one intrigued me.  I promise, it does not disappoint!  It was hard to put down, but I had to get some sleep!  It doesn't have the terror of some of the past books I've read, but the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I recommend this for everyone who loves Stephen King!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book brings the reality of war front and center. Well written and honest, every American should read this to understand what our soldiers have done for us. Five stars
B005I6EVUG|5.0|It's a joy to pick up my kindle with this cover!s The luxurious feel, the print; it's so very beautiful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is great game to play on a kindle fire. If only Amazon would get the update we can get the new items! But I can wait for the update!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I haven't been doing the video long enough to feel like I have a lot of results, but I can already feel a difference. It's a fantastic workout and my stamina is improving, as well as my ability to complete the exercise sets. I would recommend this to anyone to wants to get into shape and tone and work muscles at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers! Excellent quality and graphics... and lots of fun!  I love the \\"World Tour\\" thing. Makes it even more fun! Subway Surfers is a must buy!
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|This app is huge. Been trying to download it for several hours. I had to move other apps to my cloud to &quot; make room&quot; for this. I rebooted my kindle and its been downloading @ 22% for about an hour. So if it ever installs and I can actually play it I'll be glad to revise my review!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is amazing. It is adventurous and keeps you wanting more. I also like the world tour part of NYC to Rio. It looks great on my [[ASIN:B0083PWAPW Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers]]Kindle fire hd and it never freezes, crashes, or lag during the game. I enjoy a really competitive game like this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! The audio is great, I read the words as the audio plays. A great help for my daily reading and devotion time!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story line and full of surprises! This story was heartwarming and made me repeatedly cry. Highly recommend this book!
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I really like this case.It is very pretty (LOVE the red)and functional too! The case is well made and looks like an expensive<br />leather accessory.
B004B63M1S|1.0|It really is a shame because I normally love to watch Danny Trejo and movies by Robert Roriguez. The movie was basically a ridiculous pro illegal alien propaganda piece. The American patriots and law worked for drug lords. Give me a break! The illegals fought our patriots ON AMERICAN SOIL for THEIR RIGHTS.....and won the battle. What rights? They are illegal. In other countries illegal Americans would be killed or imprisoned for doing what they do in this movie! This movie is really a big waste of talent and the viewers time.

B0070DOHQS|5.0|I purchased the app for testing my windows 8 apps (which i develop) in various resolution via RDP. This is the only app which transfers the multi touch point to the windows pc so that it feels like a native windows 8 tablet.<br /><br />Perfect win8 touch on an android device!

B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a perfect Blu-Ray package for the Dark Knight Trilogy.  I couldn't wait it to be released and pre-ordered it immediately back in Dec'12.  A great collector's item.
1451620829|2.0|This book would have been significantly better had Mr. Criss taken more responsibility for his own errors. Everybody makes mistakes; they're a part of life. However, Mr. Criss chose to blame everyone else for his own terrible decision-making. This book could have been an example of how a man takes responsibility for his life and inevitable mistakes; instead, Peter blames everybody else for his own short-comings and missed opportunities.
030758836X|4.0|Action is continuous, underlined by a very light writing. Things happen firstly in a more or less foreseable way, and then expand in all directions
B002CGLX3S|5.0|When I first heard this song when I was a kid on the oldies station it immediately grabbed my imagination with it's vivid storytelling, and catchy refrain. This song alone introduced me to several bands that I never heard of.<br /><br />This should be a required song for anyone who loves popular music.
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|I rented this video for two reasons: 1) I like Batman, 2) I read from another reviewer that it is more kid friendly than the first part. While I did not see the first part I did watch this second part. The reason this video is not kid friendly, besides the obvious violence (more extreme than usual), is because of the language. In the opening scene and the first line a character takes the Lord's name in vein. Additionally, there are a few more foul words sprinkled throughout the video. A &#34;B&#34; word being one of the more memorable.<br /><br />The story is quite strong and artwork are strong enough. There is no need for the distasteful shock value of curse words. In fact, they seem quite out of place. It seems like an agenda to desensitize a younger audience to such language. The profanity actually takes away from the story by serving to focus the viewer's attention on that word rather than the plot. I hope this review has been helpful.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|I am reading the series in order and have not been disappointed yet...looking forward to reading number 14, and soon as I finish the book I'm reading now.
B008220DGE|5.0|PT Anderson's newest film, The Master, is nothing short of a masterpiece. After seeing it the first time, I figured it would be as polarizing a film as it could possibly be. Yes, there is no coherent plot. Yet what I find to be most intriguing is that this film operates moreso as a \\"stream of consciousness,\\" not only for Quell (Phoenix), but also Dodd (Hoffman). The film identifies that flaws of human existence and delves deep into concepts of delusion, fantasy, power, manipulation, existentialism, sexuality, I could go on. Based on these points, the film is not for everyone. The characters are severely demented and to an extent, perverse. However, I believe what makes this film remarkable is the ability of Anderson to portray this vulnerability. Not everyone gets a happy fairy tale ending. Therefore, this is not your typical Hollywood film. I left feeling kind of grim and with that \\"ugly taste in my mouth\\" sensation but also fulfilled. Inspired. If you're a serious film viewer with the ability to delve into higher levels of thought, give this film a chance. If you like basic, structured, happy-ending (not that way) Hollywood nonsense then do yourself and the rest of the intelligent film community a favor and skip this.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|The script is a little awkward in places but overall a very entertaining film with some good plot twists. Best of the MIBs, imo
B00B6SI7TG|5.0|\\"Heaven\\" by Depeche Mode appears to be a song that appears to communicate how personal beliefs can be very subjective (especially in regards to how one views life).  \\"Heaven\\" does appear to be slightly on the more serious side, but it also conveys vulnerable and genuine emotion.  I enjoyed the multiple versions available on the remixes and liked the Owlle remix of \\"Heaven\\" the most.  \\"Heaven\\" by Depeche Mode is good for those who like songs mixed with alternative rock and electronic elements that express unfiltered emotion.
B002ZG97EC|1.0|Just played the movie today, it skips and pauses, i looked at the back of all the discs, yes in deed they are all scratched up, will never buy from this seller again.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I downloaded this so we could read it aloud to eachother on camping trips, ended up reading alone during book time at home, long before our camping trip.
B000063V8U|5.0|We waited a long time to get this. So glad we did. It has some of our favorite episodes in it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Currently reading this for book club and absolutely love it!  May be my new favorite book. Not finished just yet but I'm enthrall end with my new friends Hazel and Gus.
B005LAIHE0|4.0|Can't believe this movie only averages 3 stars. I'm not much of a \\"rom-com\\" guy but my wife & I both enjoyed this film that has really good performances by all involved and found it to be LOL funny all the way through. I did feel it was a little longer than it probably could have been but that's my only nitpick. Jason Siegel, Emily Blunt and the lesser known supporting actors (Dakota Johnson, Kevin Hart among them) were all great in this. Highly recommended if you want to enjoy a good \\"date movie\\".
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I'm not usually into JRPG's like this, but it's got me hooked. I've never played any of the previous persona games so this is my first entry into the universe.<br /><br />Would recommend for any RPG enthusiast.
0061808121|5.0|It was a great way to get my grandson to enjoy To Kill a Mockingbird and to understand what life was like at that time in history.  It shows the gentelity of the South.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this book and then later, saw the movie. I found both quite interesting - the book had the sort of 'side&#34; information that the movie did not have.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|I always enjoy novels by Jeffrey Archer and was not disappointed with this one.  The story is a compelling sequel to Only Time Will Tell and I am looking forward to the 3rd book in the series (due for release on Kindle 19 Feb).
B00003CXA6|2.0|&#34;Gods and Generals&#34; was produced after &#34;Gettysburgh&#34;, yet depicts events that occurred historically before the events in &#34;Gettysburg&#34;.  &#34;Gods and Generals&#34;, despite the critics, did a fine job of interweaving character development with complex historical-battle timelines.  You CARED for the characters.  One of the finest moments is when Stonewall Jackson, superbly cast and played by Stephen Lang, breaks down at the news that a child he befriended died.  No words--just presence.  Another superbly cast role in &#34;Gods and Generals&#34; is Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee.<br /><br />Juxtapose just these two roles from &#34;Gods and Generals&#34; with &#34;Gettysburgh&#34;:  Stephen Lang appears in &#34;Gettyburgh&#34;--but as a different character!  And Martin Sheen plays Lee.  Martin Sheen is a fine actor, but a convincing general not is he.  Sheen is a pretty boy, not a man.  Sheen got away with his soft demeanor in &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34; because the story occurred during the Vietnam &#34;War&#34;--a time when manhood was looked upon as a negative and aggression in battle as politically incorrect (it still is to this day).  But the Civil War era had no such pretenses.  Men were men, as Archie Bunker swined out, and the women loved them for it.  And  yet Duvall renders a General Lee that is sensitive, thoughtful and moral, as well as firm and authoritative.  This is something that Sheen can not deliver.<br /><br />And these form a microcosm of what went wrong with &#34;Gettysburgh&#34;.  Anyone who casts Sheen as General Lee fails to grasp the story that is Gettyburg.  Sadly, an epic story wasted on poor writing and casting.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book was a sad excuse for a story. The main characters are very emotionally sick people. I would not recommend this for anyone.
B0068ZZ6CI|5.0|These guys make heavy metal sound and feel very beautiful. I can feel holy energy when i listen to Ohne Dich. In short, it is very much worth checking out.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Well done story set to great music from an artist previously unknown to us. Liked his music so much, we've ordered the movie soundtrack.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Overall I really like this and there isn't too much bad to say about it. I'll shed some light on a few minor details, though, for the sake of an argument.<br />1) The lever which you move to extend your sonic screwdriver falls down really easily. At first it's hard to extend, but eventually it falls back and forth. Extend sparingly! It wears out easily!<br />2) The piece of plastic covering the aforementioned lever falls off rather easily. And it is VERY easy to lose.<br />3) The pen nubs at the bottom of the sonic also fall off very easily, and the caps on them are easy to lose.<br />Now, to shed some light on the good;<br />1) It sounds, and looks pretty realistic.<br />2) The UV light and pen set are REALLY cool. I already have BAD WOLF written on just about everything I own, and nobody can see it.<br />3) It's a good product for the price. And a must have for all Tennant fans.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Florence continues to impress. As compared to Lungs, this album has more loud, in-your-face tracks. You won't hear any complaints from me, because that's what I came for. However, if you were hoping for more of the contentedness of Dog Days or the levity or Bird Song, you might be a little disappointed. If you wanted to hear Florence shake the rafters, you're in luck. Lover to Lover, What the Water Gave Me, Never Let Me Go, and No Light, No Light are particularly epic.<br /><br />I wouldn't advise buying the deluxe edition. It costs like $6 more than the normal version, but the extra songs can be purchased for $4 a la carte. $3 if you don't care about the demo of a song that's already on the album in its full glory.
0061537969|5.0|Truly a hearfelt story told from the Dog's point of view. Maybe from now on, some \\"hindsight\\" can be transformed into \\"foresight\\". Taking life and those in our lives, including our animal friends, for granted is not an option..Life is too short. Thank you Mr. Stein for a beautiful read that I just didn't want to put down.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I love Florence's voice, and her lyrics are very poetic. I especially enjoy all of the nature and animal imagery. The instrumental parts are well-composed and flow with the vocals without overpowering them. That would be hard to do, anyway. She really doesn't hold anything back. Although I gravitate toward the more powerfully sung tracks, there are also lighthearted songs. I have no complaints.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I'm glad that I'm done with the series and sad as well.  It was a nice twist at the end...Real or not real?
0670026603|2.0|First of all, I found the writing very pedestrian - there's too much \\"what we did every day\\",almost like a diary as most of the book is from the main character's point of view in the first person.  I didn't develop any depth of feeling for any of the characters as they are superficially drawn - Louise's eccentric British family, selfish boyfriend, Will's cold mother and  philandering father. And Will, the quadriplegic, as sorry as his state is, is an unattractive whiner.  Even  Louise, the care-giver who falls in love with her charge [this is predictable from the first pages] and who is supposed to put my tear ducts to work,  never got my sympathy. This is too bad, as the story is pretty unique and, well written, would have been quite moving.<br />I bought this after reading a rave review in the NYT by a respected writer,so I was surprised at its failure for me.  The book is also too long winded and the  ending overly contrived.  I cannot recommend, sorry.  But a good screenplay could make this into a really good tear-jerker movie, maybe!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Well worth watching.  Enjoyed the story line, not too racy but plenty of drama.  Puke scene was nasty.  A good choice to watch with teenage kids.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I gave 5 stars because this game is so much fun and I dont have problems with it on my phone or kindle.

B00A12VJZM|5.0|From some of the earliest old juke box favorites to some of the unforgetable, this is one Stones album that puts a musical history together. You don't have to fall out of a coconut tree to know that this one is a must have for anyone who likes the Rolling Stones.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle is fantastic. Love her works. Very imaginative. In fact read all of the Howl Series and am finally getting them on Kindle. Another great series is the Chrestomanci Series. Highly recommend her works.
0446547573|2.0|I'm wondering if anyone remembers a little movie starring Julia Roberts, \\"Sleeping With the Enemy\\"? It was also based on a novel but not one written by Nicholas Sparks. When I started seeing commericials for Safe Haven I thought it was a re-make of Sleeping with The Enemy. I haven't read either novel so no h8ters. Just saying ... Safe Haven ads look awfully similiar to what I remember from Sleeping (Though I didn't read that novel I did see the movie). C'mon, I can't be the only one who got that deja vu feeling?
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This movie can be creepy, but it can be a lot of fun! We've watched it several times. Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing is great. I've seen him as Wolverine and the voice of Roddy (Flushed Away). He is such a fun versatile actor.

B008220BLG|4.0|We've all heard that classic story about the star-crossed lovers. You know, the one where that guy falls in love with the girl and they must overcome impossible odds in order to be together. Warm Bodies is exactly that story, only with a twist; cause, well, he happens to be a zombie and she's still human. R (Nicholas Hoult) isn't your average zombie. Sure, he'll eat your brains and all, but at least he feels bad about it. Julie (Teresa Palmer) kills zombies and when her boyfriend is eaten by one, she's forced to put her life into his hands. Lucky for her, it's R. After saving her life, R and Julie form a special bond as she struggles to survive and he learns what it is to be human again. Slowly, they fall in love and manage to exhume hope for all humanity --- both alive and dead.<br /><br />Since first seeing the trailer for Warm Bodies, I knew it was a movie I had to watch. The fact that it's based off a popular book of the same name is just a sweet bonus. Warm Bodies is sort of a cross between Romeo & Juliet and Zombieland. Not quite a comedy and not quite a romance, it's a story that's about the power of human connections in a dead, desolate world. Levine has demonstrated an uncanny ability to bring poignancy and warmth to the most unlikely genre fusing zombies, humour and intelligence in to one satiating 97 minute showing. And though it is a zombie film, it's important to note that few of the a-typical zombie tropes stand. But fear not, because the deviations work and help to make the movie a big success.<br /><br />The best thing about Warm Bodies, though, is the cast. Hoult charms as the undead, love sick R and Palmer is radiant as the curiously bold Julie. Together they have a flirtatious chemistry that makes you believe the impossibility of their precarious relationship. Palmer reminds me of a young Natalie Portman both in looks and in spirit. She exudes that naive innocence and hopefulness that is so characteristic of Shakespeare's Juliet, while updating the performance with a bad-assery and curiosity that keeps you rooting for her. Hoult, on the other hand, is uber talented. I have a feeling he'll end up one of those underrated actors, much like Jesse Eisenberg --- so much potential and not enough credit but perhaps this movie will change all that. It's Hoult's charisma and the subtle nuances of his physical performance that make him the one to watch. He's engaging and funny and compassionate, everything you want in a modern-day Romeo.<br /><br />Warm Bodies also has a strong supporting cast, consisting of the funny Rob Corddry,  Analeigh Tipton of Top Model fame and the notorious John Malkovich. They each hold their own and do a decent job but it's clear why they're the supporting cast. They along with the Bonies sub-plot serve solely to move the storyline forward. Here Hoult is the star, carrying the picture from start to finish. It's hard to be original in the zombie genre, but Levine with help from Marion's witty screenplay, manages to keep it fresh, despite the masses of undead. The comedy is more of the observational kind, delivered mostly through R's inner monologue. Also, the use of music in the movie is incredibly ironic and perfectly timed, earning many a laugh from myself and the rest of the audience. All in all, I can sufficiently say that I adored this movie. There's no doubt about it, Warm Bodies is a zombie flick with brains and heart.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Warm Bodies is a quirky and unconventional zombie flick that will bring a beat to even the deadest of hearts. Rich with potential, this movie takes a tragic classic and turns it into a warm and hopeful rom-com, sans the traditional sap. Warm Bodies is funny, earnest and sweet with all the addictiveness of Twilight, only it's so much more well-executed. If the on-screen version is this good, I can't wait to see what the novelisation has in store for me next!e performance with a bad-assery and curiosity that keeps you rooting for her.

There's no doubt about it, Warm Bodies is a zombie flick with brains and heart.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Warm Bodies is a quirky and unconventional zombie flick that will bring a beat to even the deadest of hearts. Rich with potential, this movie takes a tragic classic and turns it into a warm and hopeful rom-com, sans the traditional sap. Warm Bodies is funny, earnest and sweet with all the addictiveness of Twilight, only it's so much more well-executed. If the on-screen version is this good, I can't wait to see what the novelisation has in store for me next!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I highly recommend The Last man; it is an excellent spy novel full of tense moments, voluminous detail, and fully developed characters,  including many villains. It is hard to put down because of surprises and a never ending stream of twists and unexpected turns.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|not as good a first one not enough of a story, just fighting. Need to have again more of a story line,
B00B99QTM4|5.0|It's a fun movie to watch on February 2.  It has some funny spots, a nice love story -- what's not to like?
B009MF5BXK|1.0|If I could give this movie 0 stars I would. What a piece of crap!<br /><br />Horrible acting by actors that used to be the S*** back in the day but that was back in the day. When you're in your late 50s early 60s trying to play an action hero today, it's kind of silly not to mention rather stupid.<br /><br />This movie sucked on so many levels.<br /><br />Do not even waste your money on this movie. So so not worth it.
B00371XIJE|5.0|this movie is my favorite dog movie since Benji!!! if you want to use just about all your emotions, this is a must see!!! it will steal your heart.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The only reason I even read this one was because they made a movie about it.<br />A little too cheesy for me. Definitely have enoyed a lot of his books over the years though.
B006QKKMBA|5.0|this movie is awesome!!! if you loved the other 4, you definitely have to see this one! i don't want to give it away but there is a surprise to this one I THINK!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I liked this game. It was worth buying. The puzzles were not too hard and not too easy either. Great graphics and. No freezing up.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Smith writes with an earthy, graphic realism laced with the pacing and intrigue of early Ludlum or Follett. That this is a debut novel just blows one's mind at the subtle craft, plot twists and thematic character development. If you are hesitating in any way, just buy the book. You WILL be moved.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|Unlike her shopoholic series, the heroine learns in this one tome the power of truth and discretion. I read it in one day.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a great read.  I would recommend this book (and have) to anyone who likes a little surprise
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent book. What makes it even more interesting is the attitude of the doctor before his NDE. He changed quite a bit after that experience. It really is a book you can't put down. I hear about it from a friend who saw his interview on TV. I don't generally read a book that quickly, but I finished this in two days. He certainly has quite a story to tell. I really liked his description of the other world. I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost a friend or relative. It will make them feel better.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|The special effects are top notch, the story is a little slow in the beginning, but with a surprise result in the end.  I know it's Si-Fi, but my only gripe about the movie is that it's only set 100 years in the future, and the technology that is introduced to the viewer is absurd for a 100 year advancement from now.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Love the movie! RDJ is the man.<br /><br />The special features are great, especially the gag reel and the picture looks amazing in HD.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I'm not a fan of CG animated movies anymore, there are just too many released too often with not much thought going into the story to captivate the viewer..  With the exception of this wonderfully witted movie.  My nephew was staying the weekend and wanted to see it.  I had nothing else to do so I watched it with the kids.  I was laughing in no time. You won't regret watching this movie!  The storyline is good, and the characters are hilariously portrayed!  I Never thought I would look at Dracula as a role model. Bla bla blaaa.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|this was a childhood favourite . and now its all mine.. if you love Elvis youll love this . buy it now.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I enjoyed the speed of the action on page after page.<br />I would consider reading other books by Richard Castle.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Love hidden object games.This one has a great and unique story line.it kept me interested..only played the trial version but will definitely be buying real soon .
B000ZECQ08|4.0|I would recommend this to girls and boys and adults as well.  The show was great even though it really veered from the book.
B008602KQI|3.0|The Hunger Games movie was just so so for me but I am 66 years old so more for the younger crowd.  My graddaughter (age 14) loved it.  Amazon is so great to work with.  Delivery is always on time and they make it so easy if you have to return anything.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Heart touching, story line really sucks you in.  I have laughed and cried.  I totally recommend this series to both male and female.  I love how they show not only the lives of the rich but the peoples who live there hopes, dreams and passions as well.  I also love shows that include time and history in them as well and what life was like dealing with the war.<br /><br />Love Maggie Smith, watched her for years, she is amazing, clever and sharped tongue but handles her characters life difficulties with grace, empathys of others and her position in life, not one to be bullied nor played with.<br /><br />I shared this story with my family and friends as well and both enjoyed the show.
0060531053|5.0|I have made beer for years and now will take the show on the road to Italy. Look for Cane Morte birra in stores and restaurants near Rome Italy
B00008DDXL|4.0|I would recommend this movie, I like that it kept along the lines of the book as well.  Great show for girls and boys alike.
B007SGM084|2.0|My friend read these books and was raving about them.  I thought if she did I'd like them too but I did not even read them until the end of the second book.
B001C3I4UM|5.0|I had forgotten just how good this album is. I bought it when it was first released in 1967-what an incredible experience that first listen was! There have been some negative comments about this remaster-but having not heard the album in many years, I really can't notice any major differences. It is a fantastic blend of poetry, rock and symphony. The added tracks are interesting, but will take several listenings to grow on me.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|This was a real let down. The characters were out of character, especially Pendergast.  I did not enjoy nor did I find it believable that he is or would be so weak. Reading fiction sometimes does require a willing suspension of disbelief, however I couldn't suspend it quite this far.
B00422LESO|5.0|I love this book it is witty, light hearted, and fun. It is an enjoyable quick read. This is a great book club book.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was not only peculiar but takes you on an incredible journey of wonder, eagerness, and gives a different perspective on the lives people live! Definitely a great read.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Points for uniqueness but it was a bit of a battle to get through. Guess it wasn't quite for me!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest<br />Is the best, I just love it.  Find all types of ideas from crafts, gadgets, receipes and much more.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Best bang for your the buck !!!!!<br /> It comes sharp, but can be made scary sharp (scalpel keen) .  It takes a bit to get it there due to curved blade, but worth it.  I doubt you could break it if you wanted. I have big hands and love the handle.  The sheith is adequate but nothing special , but that is notwhat you buy a knife for.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Loved this Album. Its like 1980s dance music. The songs are more than just a one word. Nothing like Kesha or Rihana or Lady GAga.
B00633W614|4.0|I had read Only Time Will Tell and was anxious to read the next novel.  It was worth the wait!!  Well-written.  The characters remained true to their characterizations in the first book.  I liked the way Archer keeps all the people moving toward their just reward (or punishments!).  Now I will wait once again to see what the court decides in the next book.  Surely, there is a &#34;Next Book&#34;, though I've seen no name for it yet.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|for me every time I  play for hours then when I turn off my kindle fire and when I turn on temple run 2 it starts then it takes me to the home of my kindle fire
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I recently purchased a 3D plasma, the Samsung PN51E8000. Avatar was the must-watch movie to test out the 3D capabilities of my new TV... and I am absolutely blown away by the 3D of both the movie and the TV! Awesome!
B004HYDM0A|4.0|Even if you know the background to the movie/tv show, it is still worth a view.  Surprised how I felt about all of the players at the end of the movie.
B009A87Z6U|3.0|I was disappointed with this movie. Not too much of a story line. Too much shooting and explosions. Please bring back Sean Connery!
B0001Z37HM|4.0|It's a classic with the power of women and tenderness with a child. The adventure and romance between the sexes.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Excellent performances from Dames Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. Good story line, sad, believeable, sensitive, and amusing. Nice to see a movie without sex and violence for a change!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another Mitch Rapp classic. Loved it from beginning to end. Just the right amount of political frustration mixed in with hard core Americans doing what's best for the country regardless of what the liberals think.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Trendy sure,  but overall a good listen and sing along.  Good tunes for the family to jam to without being too much on the pop side.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I haven't had a single problem with this game. Its very fun and its a great time waster. Its fun for most ages and the second you get it I'm sure you'll wont want to stop!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have been playing this game for a while and it is my go to game when I want to relax and give my brain a break from other activities.  The game is fun and if you like crosswords and other logic kinds of games this one is for you.  The game has differnt levels that get harder as you progress.  I feel like I have really accomplished something when I complete a puzzle.  The only thing that would make it better would be perhaps a hint when you get stuck on a puzzle or a way to \\"give up\\" and let the game show you the picture.  However the way the game is makes you perservere to complete the puzzle.  You cannot go wrong with this game it is worth the money.
B009K0P10K|5.0|The cast give a great performance.  I like that the ending of each shoe leaves me wanting to see the next.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Not funny. Kept waiting to laugh. Waste of our money and date night at home! Can't believe mila kunis did this film and they are trying to make another one. So over the top obnoxious and dumb. Guess am too old for this crap.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|After hearing all the buzz and the awards up for this fantastic show I had to watch it. I watched first episode and was hooked.  I finished the first season in 4 days.  Claire Danes performance is implacable.  Carrie keeps you wanting to see what is next with her unpredictable actions and wanting you  believe also in her predictions.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is an epic tale that doesn't sugar coat the difficulties of living in pre-aboltion America. It is well worth the read.
0553805460|1.0|Please take this review with a grain salt since I was unable to<br /><br />read the book in its entirety.  After reading the first fifty pages<br /><br />or so, I had the preliminary assessment emailed to my daughter<br /><br />(please disregard couple of hardly relevant references at the end<br /><br />to other books).<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />Started reading this new book 'The Wolf of Wall Street' at the<br /><br />suggestion of a friend of relative.  It is supposed to be a<br /><br />fictionalized version of an autobiographical by a successful<br /><br />stockbroker; a Gordon Gekko type of fellow on an ego trip... etc.<br /><br />Actually, it is pretty rough going, very verbose and overly<br /><br />descriptive in places.  Basically, it's kind of like someone who<br /><br />confesses and glorifies his sins at the same time; always wanting<br /><br />to hang around in limelight.  That 'limelight' must be such a<br /><br />powerful state of being you or I have no clue of.. At any rate, as<br /><br />difficult as it may be, your reading of 'debt' will flow better (I<br /><br />am guessing).  Recently, I also dabbled in and gave up upon another<br /><br />book 'You Must Change Your Life';' an overly-scholarly work<br /><br />translated meticulously from German!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Next, I pushed on, reading twenty more pages.. And then could not<br /><br />go on. Started feeling sorry for the eye-retinal energies expended;<br /><br />but, still, hoping for some insight into machinations and trading<br /><br />practices of the Wall Street firms, I kept spot-reading randomly<br /><br />selected pages.  All that came through was a narcissistic ego trip<br /><br />of a guy who reminds of evangelists crying out loud on television<br /><br />for pity and sympathy without truly atoning for their sins by<br /><br />simply shutting up and disappearing from the lime light. I did<br /><br />read, and liked, the epilogue, though. What of the back page<br /><br />review: \\"[A] riveting page-turning memoir\\" by Player? Well, as<br /><br />Einstein is thought to have remarked: Either the world is crazy or<br /><br />I am!<br /><br />Sorry you guys, I stand corrected:  now there is an exciting movie version of the same book.<br />Can't wait to see the sexy wife in exciting positions as described in the book.  Live and learn, live and learn!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a rilly good game for sure. I love this so much I would recommend this game I would have to give it 5 stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was great I couldn't stop reading it is the most exciting book I have ever read and this book is my new favorite.I give this book 5 stars it is a great book and I am now a mocking Jay!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Woww ... Awesome book, i could not put it down once i started - cant wait for the next one!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the game.  Sometimes it is easy to solve and other times I have to solve it by  trial and error.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Really good read - thought it was very fifty in the beginning but once i got into the book i really enjoyed it!
B006TLF5WM|5.0|Jason Statham is awesome, the movie defines the genre action/adventure. I am a huge fan of all his films anyway.
B004HYDM0A|4.0|Because of all the hype surrounding this film, I was anticipating a disappointment.  I was wrong.<br /><br />Produced and edited very well, the film was engaging and entertaining.  I have a lot of respect for Nev Schulman for handling the final discovery with sensitivity.  Even though I knew what this film was about, thanks to the current MTV TV Show based on the same, I was still surprised at the results.  I definitely recommend this movie.  It's an easy watch, and even though I do not love shaky camera documentaries, it went by quickly and I found myself wanting more.  Enjoy!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love the show and ordered the soundtrack.  Fade Into You not included and the $1 credit never showed up as advertised.  So if you order the CD for that song you are better off just downloading the single.  Very disappointed in the false advertising but still love the tunes.  Songs are not the exact recordings I heard on TV but at least they are the same songs.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie surpassed my expectations.  I thought it would be cheesy, generic, and go for the cheap laugh with the very un-original love plot.  In actuality, it was clever and very funny. For the most part, you will not be surprised at the outcome, but I anticipate you will find yourself smiling, laughing, and enjoying the characters all the way through.  Let me make clear that this is not a Glee movie, particularly in that they do not break into song randomly nor do you have to like Glee to like this movie.  I think a wide audience could enjoy Pitch Perfect for its common elements.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its angoodngame if you like horses but it is a bit glitchy at times. other than that I can honestly say its a pretty good game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it. Its my favorite game in the would. my brother likes it too..its better than the regular temple run..!!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This movie is one of our all-time favorites.  The color-edition in this set is excellent.  We love having both the color and original black-and-white version.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can tell you the start to the present. My DVR recorded all the eposides especially Season 3, which I have shed many tears on this season. I love it 100%
B003TH14H4|5.0|This show has it all. Action. Mystery. Smart characters. Sexual tension.<br />I stumbled on a Castle marathon a few weeks back and now I'm hooked!!!<br />I love the cast chemistry and writing so much I am buying all the seasons so I can catch up!!! Every episode is great!
B005HP2J66|5.0|Just as described. We enjoyed the tv version so much. It isn't that easy to find. Like it a lot. Thanks
B003THHIEM|5.0|This show has it all. Action. Mystery. Smart characters. Sexual tension.<br />The casting is perfect! I can't imagine it working better with any other actors! I'm hooked!!!
B002VWNIAY|5.0|What's not to love about Casablanca? Nothing!! And this DVD is the perfect addition to any movie collection. Recommend for all!
B0020PJJHS|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, the only valid James Bonds' in the world are Sean Connery; Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan.<br /><br />This movie holds it's own compared to best of the James Bonds' movies in earlier times.<br /><br />And what a great flick to launch Pierce's introduction to the role!<br /><br />Although the follow up movies & 'new Bond' don't compare to this movie & Pierce, this movie exemplifies how a great cast & great script was able to continue the Bond tradition!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Just got into settlers, and started have game nights for it.  Settlers is very fun, pretty easy to learn.  The game may be a bit outdated, but a good entry point into this type of board game.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|MIB can hardly do any wrong, but they really hit the ball out of the field on this one. Tommy Lee Jones is his usual, awesome self. Will Smith is fabulous and charming and funny--as always--and Josh Brolin is completely amazing as a younger K! Talk about channeling TLJ and K! Wow!<br />The story was clever, the character development and furthering of J and K's characters and their relationship was sweet and satisfying, and it was just an all around great movie!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|I can't get enough of this movie. Every time I'm reminded of it, I want to watch it again. If you love silly, self-aware movies, you'll love this. If you love movies that are appropriate for everyone, but have plenty of humor for the adults, you'll love this. If you love the Muppets, you'll love The Muppets.
B005I6EU48|4.0|I like this cover, it's very nice. The only negative is that there is a gap when shut. I am hoping it gets less with use.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great story of learning to love and the lessons you learn along the way. The kind of book you just can't put down.<br />Awesome read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun. works good on kindle. wish like every game gems were cheaper. but what you gonna do. lol. try it out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Tried, but can't beat my grandkids and they love this game.  It's on my kindle, so bigger is better for them.
B007SGM084|5.0|This story is the best I've read in a long time. Will be reading this over and over again! Love it!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Crashes more than any game of this type should. I finished temple run and loved it. Disappointed in this one. Droid bionic.
B008NA3I30|4.0|Michelle Williams plays Margot married to Lou(Seth Rogen)a nice but dull chicken only cook. He can't talk about their problems as a couple and does everything to avoid talking.The couple have a strange way of communicating in baby talk,which is almost embarrassing,the sort of things some couples do privately.They are 5 years married and still in love,but something is not right.The gap is filled by Daniel(Luke Kirby),a boho artist who makes a living by running a rickshaw service near the beach area of Toronto.He happens to live just across the road from Margot and has recently moved in.As they met on a plane they are both surprised to find out they live a stone's throw from each other.Margot and Daniel have intense chemistry with each other. Margot has to decide whether she's going to go on with her marriage or give in to this very handsome man's attentions.The film is set in an unbelievablycolourful, sun-kissed suburban setting.Michelle Williams is beautifully sensitive in her portrayal of a vague,whimsical, rainbow-child.The film is neutral in its sympathies.Should Margot stay with this lump who is going nowhere,he loves her,she's loyal to him,or should she court mystery and danger,explore the unknown?Can she reinvent herself through this relationship?The title is named after a Leonard Cohen song which comes towards the end.However another song that is prominently played to good effect is Video Killed the Radio Star,when they are on a carousel car,which seems to be saying things change,new things kill old things.The film has a quirkiness which highlights the couple's endearing/irritating behaviour that married couples use to keep the world at bay.This is an indie film so the characters are all real and believable,the rom.com is not cliché.Written/directed by actor/director Sarah Polley(Sweet Hereafter) brilliantly.Williams is luminous in the central performance.Will she find contentment?One doubts it,even if she is being seen by Daniel and talked to and desired.The wheel of fate delivers us to the point at which we started,whoever we love we are always alone.One should first love oneself.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Having seen the film in the theatre I was looking forward to its release so that I could enjoy it again...it STILL gets me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like animals especially horses and this game lets me interact with a virtual horse. I love it very much.
B0071R43MG|5.0|With all the releases Joe already has, I ignored  this one for a long time. Glad I saw a good review here on Amazon and made the purchase. Highlight: &#34;Andalusia&#34;.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Our daughter likes this game a lot. She enjoys the graphics and challenges. We limit how much she plays it to fifteen minutes per session.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|This is a great classic and being able to read on the Kindle is awesome !!! Highly recommend to get reaquainted with a famous book by a famous author!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read......couldn't put it down.  Looking forward to reading more of Colleen Hoover books.  Already recommended book to several others.
1609611543|5.0|What I did not know. Very informative. For health and weight I feel this hits the problem right on the head!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the first. So much action and ache to keep reading it's hard to put the book down.
030758836X|3.0|Part Scott & Laci Peterson, Nancy Grace, and Mean Girls.<br /><br />This book has it's own momentum, it gets you hooked and moving along and the plot continues to evolve and unfold itself.<br /><br />Finished the book in 10+ hours.  During I had to know what happened next, but after reading it. I feel like I watched a Lifetime movie.  No substance, just another way to pass the time.<br /><br />Great book for an airplane ride, or to kill time.<br /><br />Heard Director David Fincher is making a film about it. Piqued my interest.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great. my 11 year old loves it. if you love horses you will love this game. bye.
B00ALKO9WE|5.0|Really great read. Very different and engaging. While parts are confronting the story helps you to appreciate love, choice and life. Couldn't put it down!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game if super fun.its one of the best games I have ever played I love this game its awsome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game.the graphics are amazing.since I got it,I haven't put it down. One of the best games I have played!!!!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As a self proclaimed introvert myself. This book spoke volumes to me and about me. I have learned to embrace who and what I am without apologies. Both introverts and extroverts should read; this books helps to dispel the myth that introverts are somehow abnormal. Thank you Susan Cain.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is so beautiful! I love how it makes you think. It's a great time eater for those times u are bored out of your mind
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book challenges the reader to get out of the box. While it presents two differing ideologies in regards to money and wealth, it makes a great argument for the unconventional approach/view towards becoming successful.  The content seems more like an honest representation of the author's real life experience or interpretation of it. This should be necessary for first year students in finance as it flies in the face on convention yet makes practical sense.
B008476HBM|3.0|It's okay!!!!!!!!fine to me not the best in the world but it's okay I'm fine with it it's okay thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played. I like when you go faster and faster when you go farther. The special limited edition characters are fun.
B0093X805W|4.0|Interesting story. Good characters. Well organized. Never boring. Attractive structure. Hope to read more Roald Dahl books!inlike it v much
B008M34INW|4.0|Mel plays a gringo locked up in a Mexican prison and has to survive and make plans to escape. It is an earthy but violent movie yet it does have tender moments. You will not check your watch during this movie and you will probably not be able to figure it out before the ending comes. I rate it a two bagger on the popcorn scale.
B0096HFOZO|4.0|Good details , funny pics<br />Amazing story, good vocabulary . I hope to read it again and again.<br />Will recommend my friends to read it
B008M34CSI|3.0|This is about a space prison where really hard cases are sent. There is some under the table stuff going on there and Pearce is to find out about it. It really has no good plot and I simply cannot even remeber much about it. If you like sci-fi and prison movies you might find this mildly entertaining.
B0090YHSFC|3.0|I picked this one up when it was the Free Game of the Day. It was fun for a little while, but quickly got repetitive.
B002IE2JF0|4.0|This is s good movie of a stranded travler from another planet who lands on earth during the Viking era. It is a good story worthy of the genre. It mixes good old fashion warrior theme and man woman love. Think of the movie &#34;The Thirteeth Warrior&#34; and throw in some sci-fi with dragons and you have a good idea what's in store for you.
B009POCG0Y|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  Probably the most shocking thing about 'Killer Joe' is not its over-the-top violence (particularly toward women) but the fact that the film is based on playwright Tracy Letts' play of the same name and that he is ALSO the author of the excellent Pulitzer Prize winning drama, 'August: Osage County'. How could Letts be the author of such a superb work as 'Osage County' and also churn out such sensationalistic 'pulp fiction' as 'Killer Joe'? The gap in time probably explains it: 'Killer Joe', the stage drama was originally written in 1991 and 'Osage County' came out first in 2007. Obviously Letts has matured tremendously since the early 90s.<br /><br />  'Killer Joe' is not without its good points. I would have to agree with critic Rex Reed's assessment that the \\"uncompromising trashiness\\" was \\"perversely riveting, until the ending, which pours on the gore like barbecue sauce.\\" It's a story about a Texas 'trailer trash' family, whose amorality is unwavering. One is riveted by just how far these clueless nitwits will go as they plot the murder of one of their own.<br /><br />  The murder plot is set in motion by Chris, who plans to pay a debt to loan shocks, by murdering his mother for her insurance money. He comes to believe, after speaking with his mother's boyfriend, Rex, that his virginal teenage sister, Dottie, will inherit the money. Joining in on the scheme is Chris' real dad, Ansel, along with his new wife, Sharla, as well as Dottie, who was abused by their mother as a child.<br /><br />  After Chris hires a Dallas police detective, Joe Cooper (who moonlights as a contract killer), he makes it clear that he won't commit the murder without being paid first. When Chris indicates he won't be able to collect the insurance money after his mother is dead, Joe agrees to accept a 'retainer'--which happens to be Dottie. As a result Joe enters into a sexual relationship with the alluring teenager. It's perhaps at this point in the film that I began to suspect that one of director Friedkin's motives in story-telling was decidedly prurient in nature (cases in point: the obsession with Dottie's nude body and the unpleasant way in which Joe seduces Dottie; scenes in which little is done to advance the plot).<br /><br />  After Chris has a change of heart and wants to call off the murder, Joe makes it clear that the killing has already taken place (he matter of factly shows Chris his mother's dead body in the trunk of a car, and then sets it on fire!). The plot becomes even more dark when the family realizes that gullible Chris was duped by Rex, who is the actual beneficiary of the insurance money, not Dottie.<br /><br />  The final twist has Joe revealing that Sharla knew all along that the insurance policy was actually double ($100,000 and not $50,000, as Chris previously believed) and that Sharla was having sex with Rex and was set to share in the settlement. Friedkin, unfortunately, is not set to leave things at that. The dark comic mood of the film is lost when Joe beats Sharla to a pulp. Wait there's more! Joe simulates a scene of forced oral sex utilizing a piece of Kentucky Fried Chicken (ugh!).<br /><br />  Without the extremely dubious scene where Joe beats up Sharla and simulates oral sex, the denouement may have been more palatable. Dottie turns the tables on both her brother and her father by shooting them. And the final scene has her finger on the trigger, ready to blast Joe to smithereens as well. It seems a fitting end to these lowlifes but what exactly is the point of all of this?<br /><br />  'Killer Joe' is worthwhile for its shock value; however Mr. Friedkin provides us no explication for his character's actions. He's saying, enjoy the ride as I reveal just how low these amoral lowlifes will sink. Unfortunately, at times, he reveals an unnecessary and excessively nasty side to his characters, that have no place in a narrative which is designed strictly to amuse andentertain.entertain.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I think that this is the best Woody Allen movie that I have seen. It is funny without the neuroticism, entertaining without vulgarity or exploitative sex and intelligent without pandering.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I read the free teaser sample from Amazon, and thought it had potential. However once I read further into the book, I kept finding my eyes rolling into the back of my head. Apparently the only editing done on this book was spell check, and even then the wrong words were often used or misused. The author has a penchant for using the same descriptive word in consecutive sentences, demonstrating a poor vocabulary. She has no concept of a time line. Things happen sequentially that make no sense. The hero has a Pollyanna quality, where the bad guys hate him, and everyone else loves him for no particular reason. The hero has &#34;powers&#34; that simply manifest themselves when convenient. He has no need to train, or work to develop them. The creatures she creates for the hero to slay are not simply absurd, (a boar with 3 foot long, razor sharp tusks), they are each &#34;the largest creature&#34; the hero had ever seen. I am a fan of fantasy genre, but any good writer has an internal logic, even in the most &#34;fantastic&#34; creative work. There is no consistent logic here. I would rate this &#34;fuggeddaboudit&#34;.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|this is a story of teenagers suffering from various forms of incurable cancer so you know there wont be a happy ending.  but along the way they are fatalistic and realistic about their situation and determined to  make the best of what life they have.  it was very, very sad in many places, but also inspiring in many others.  this is a story that has been around for years but has never  been told before and I for one am glad it if finally out there.
0060775858|5.0|One of the real classics in the subject. I read it to my children and have now given a copy to my grandchildren
B006O6F932|4.0|My daughter received this for Christmas. She loves it and that's what matters. Me personally I think it's cute for kids.  I don't understand why the sticker wall as the bathrooms in even on the play set when it is open fully they are not shown. Other than that it was extremely easy to put together I would have liked a small bag to at least hold the extra pieces when it is closed up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series hardly needs another raving positive 5-star review, but I'll write it anyway. This is a fantastically well-written series--rarely have I seen a science fiction writer do so well at creating believable characters. Orson Scott Card has written about how difficult this is to achieve as a writer, that adding one more character means that the writer must understand how that one character interacts with all other characters, because we do act differently towards different people.<br /><br />I agree with others that this series is destined to become a science fiction classic, it is as good as many Hugo-winning books by major authors, and I wish the best of luck to Hugh Howey in getting the recognition he deserves for this work.<br /><br />I only found one very very minor error in physics in the book--that was when the main character is in a pressure suit with a clear dome to see through, and is underwater. The author says that she sees things as \\"magnified\\", but it would be the opposite, things would appear smaller, as if looking through a wide-angle lens. This is incredibly minor, though, since only optics experts are likely to catch this as an actual error.
B0063B2BNE|4.0|Awesome series can't wait to watch season 8.  All the characters have very good chemistry and the stories are always intriging.
B00005UWMX|5.0|Great movie. I recommend it highly. Beautiful horse, trained red-tailed hawk and a great cast, they all make for a wonderful movie. Boo hiss hiss to the wicked Bishop, lol. You will enjoy seeing Matt Broderick as a small, skinny boy, too.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This my favorite comedy on TV.  The writers and cast have done a great job of bringing something new to TV.<br />I do not recommend this series for kids due to some content.
B00005JLO2|5.0|Silly me. I bought this movie not realizing it was a remake of the original film. But, boy, am I glad I did. I miss Heath Ledger, and his performance in this movie is up to par with his other great acting performances. If you are a history buff, don't hold it too much again the Brits for being so &#34;pushy&#34;, you will enjoy it.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Believe this is one of the best drama's on TV at this time.<br />Great cast and story lines.<br />Due to some subject matters I do not recommend for teenagers.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|No really liking face book on my kindle, does not seem to be up to date with posts or features from friends and family
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it. Really great story! Their interactions gave me butterflies as if I was experiencing life with them. I can't remember the last time I was  so trapped in a book.
B005HSL626|1.0|Do not like this, find it boring.  Have removed this from my carousel, will not play this any more . Would not  recommend.
1451613512|3.0|Bought this for my husband.  He is an avid history buff and saw the TV show by the same name and asked for the book.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Like being able to view my mail at any time, work, break time.  Easy to add to kindle to view.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I had a lot of fun with the game.  Hints were very helpful.  A lot of levels and price was not to bad.  Would recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing! It is one of my favorite games on my kindle! I love how realistic everything is, the graphics are fantastic! I recommend this game to everyone!! &lt;3

B0038P59A0|5.0|Brilliant acting - wonderful effects!  I missed seeing this one at the theater - so I ordered this one before I went to see the second movie, and I'm so glad I did!  Very good film!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was difficult to put down!  While the story line kept my interest, I was very disappointed with the ending, or I didn't &#34;get it&#34;.  Even with the intent of a sequel, the ending was flat and might have just as well ended in the middle of a sentence.  Otherwise, thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B0007RT9LW|5.0|I saw the original and had to have the remake!  They expanded on the story and made it more than just a car chase.  Well done, very enjoyable - and the car chase was still phenomenal!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it....but sometimes it is frustrating because when you do the right thing it will just roll instead of what you do,and the fact that it stutters and by the time your able to comprehend what's happening you already died.4 stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game ever I love the way you can buy people and how you run and dodge moving trains IT IS SO FUN!!!
B00B7ERH04|5.0|This app is a must get, for your kindle fire hd.  On the kindle fire HD there is NO free video camera app, this one lets you video tape in a fun way. It has adds that you look at and complete for camcoins! For example get to levle 4 on coin doser. Love it! I am very picky but this app scores high.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|very exciting. didn't figure out who lambert was into the end. this book kept me from putting it down. great book
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like subway surfes but, sometimes it it frustrating when you die and don't have enough coins. If you had to pay for it it is not worth it, luckly it's free:).  This app has been popluar for a lomg time but people are starting to get bord.  The company should make the game more special by adding more opsicals to go through. Over all you should get it because it is just fun and an addicting game
B004V9MU86|5.0|Very interesting story and well written. Captures the reader and hard to put down.  Would like to read more by this author.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is great for a quick look at the weather, whenever and wherever you like.  Also like the 10 day forcast and any warnings posted.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I never saw it at the theater. I waited for it to come out on Blue Ray because I knew it would be a good movie and I would want to see it more than once in the future. It doesn't disappoint. I won't review the movie here though, but I will say that if you are going to own a Marvel movie, this is the one to own.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this site! The app works almost every time! Sometimes pictures take longer to load than usual, but I don't mind. I'm able to do everything on my Kindle that I can do on my laptop.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I have used this app more than any other. It's perfect to pass time in the gym while you are on the treadmill. Works great with the Kindle Fire.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Good story, involved character development, pretty serious social issues discussed.<br />Worth reading especially if you are a fan of this author.
B005BGBPBG|2.0|The plot was lacking and the story wasn't all that touching.  I should not have ignored its poor ratings on other websites.  On the plus side, the acting was good even though the story wasn't.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You won't be able to put this down. Like, ever! I haven't been this interested in a game in a long time! And I am a grown man, mind you...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is fun and I played this games and I can not what to play it lol love me
0307592731|4.0|This book got better and better the farther I got into it. Strayed is definitely a very good writer. I'm still puzzled about how she made it all the way to the end of the PCT if her feet were in as bad a condition as she described them--seems like they just would not have held up under the incredible stress, especially since the foot problems started almost at the beginning of the trip. Also, the sores she got from her backpack, and the fact that she just kept on rubbing the same sores raw every day, would seem to have gotten infected or something if they were as bad as she said. Maybe that \\"second skin\\" stuff that she used was really miraculous.<br /><br />I noticed that some reviewers who did not like this book were critical of Strayed for her personal problems and were even quite judgmental about her indiscretions and infidelities. Actually, these were the parts of the story that made her seem so human to me. If her story of how she grew up is true, then I think she's truly a person of amazing intestinal fortitude.<br /><br />Reading about how much she loved her mother and how devastated she was to lose her at such a young age (Strayed was 22 and her mother was only in her forties) made me personally feel kind of envious of such a close mother-daughter relationship, which is something my mother and I never quite accomplished. It brings into stark relief the many ways in which people hurt in life, whether from losing someone they love deeply or somehow never really having a comfortable relationship with someone they love but don't know how to really connect with.<br /><br />I hope this story is true. I hate to be such a skeptic, but because some people lately have published such phony memoirs, it makes it a little hard for me not to be skeptical of all memoirs now. Sad that it's that way.  That said, this story is all perfectly believable, when you come right down to it, and by the end I was pretty much convinced that she was on the level, and I was really moved by her catharsis. I know that people really can and do recover from life's traumas through amazing and challenging experiences in nature.<br /><br />Part of me would really like to give this book five stars, but I'm holding back because a little part of me suspects that some of her physical maladies on the trail were somewhat exaggerated. Oh, and let me not forget what drove me absolutely crazy in the early part of the book, and that is why in God's name someone clearly as smart and capable as she was did not have sense enough to lighten her backpack, and why it took so long before one of the folks she met on the trail had sense enough to do that for her. This part just didn't make sense. Maybe that's why I can't give this book 5 stars.<br /><br />I read this book because it was the selection for the month in my book club. It was a really good read, and I'm glad I read it.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I was 12 when this movie came out, so how could I not love it?  Such a wonderful movie with a great cast!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As usual, DeMille kept me reading with all the twists and turns in this book.<br />I can't wait til the next book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Haven't EVER enjoyed a series more! The setting is beautiful. The actors are wonderful. The writing is superb. The time period is interesting and has been under represented in film and TV--- a very intriguing and entertaining combination.
B008MZPVP4|4.0|Say what you will - these guys are some of the best at what they do. Based on their other works, I'd give this one 3 stars. Based on the buckets of other artists out there, it is easily a 4 or 5 star effort. Lucky that they like coming to Colorado - seeing them live is always a good time. Additionally, you will hear some of their better stuff... this little EP can wait until you get tired of the other albums first. In fact, would suggest getting more COC, Pantera and Crowbar before indulging on this one.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I haven't completely completed the book however I am enjoying it and am excited to have it on my kindle for future reference from now on.
B0083B3KOQ|1.0|This app is so slow, especially uploading to the server, that it might as well not work at all. Are its conversions any good? Who knows, I've tried three files and cancelled the transfers each time after more than two hours (once was a 500 MB file that didn't finish uploading even though I left it running - on a solid WiFi connection - overnight). Don't waste your time or money.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I thought this movie delivered exactly what I wanted.......a cute little story showcasing the over bearing love and complicated of a father with his only daughter. The dance scenes were a toot and the pool scene was a holler!<br /><br />I got what I was looking for in this comedy, it was a satisfying delight after a long stressful week.
B003UYUP58|4.0|The book is very good (I'm only half way through) but the Kindle edition has WAY TOO MANY REFERENCES, each underlined that are a bit hard to see. This becomes a problem as you are just reading along on the Kindle, tapping for the next page, and you inadvertently tap on a reference which takes you to the reference to the source material rather than the next page.<br /><br />Sure would be nice if there was a way to turn that off. Either provide a version without all the footnotes or support a setting to turn them off.
B008SOS63S|5.0|We have the DVD of this.  We wanted to be able to listen to it in the car.  It is AWESOME!  Joe Bonamassa is truely AWESOME!  Get this CD.  You will be SO HAPPY you did!  I really can't say enough good about it!  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  :)
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I watched the movie and then went home and bought the kindle version. It is an interesting view on human kindness and responsibility holding out from greed and brutality. The book moves slower and of course the slang is easier to follow. I especially was interested in the extended interview of the fabricant. I viewed the movie a second time and will buy it in DVD, but perhaps my not read the book again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I have it on my I pod and it's really cool but all the horses have the same name.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I was skeptical at first but after reading most of the reviews I gave it a shot. This is exactly what I was looking for. Scary stuff
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is honestly my favorite game. I play it everyday. I don't know how you would improve it because the way it is is honestly fine. Its so much fun!
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Saw the band live on Saturday in Nashville and bought the CD right after. Many will be drawn by the Kenny Loggins name but this is a great combination of talent and many of these tracks are standouts- especialy \\"Dream\\" and \\"I'm a Rider\\". Gary Burr has a strong voice and Georgia can belt it out but the voices are best together. They are all talented songwriters and there is nary a filler track on the album  - a great treat from a \\"new\\" band with a big future
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Excellent and the music is perfect.  The Play is wonderful as well.  A must see for all ages.  Don't miss it while on Broadway.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is better than the original. Before, I didn't know this game existed unroll my big brother showed me. You never know if they will ever make a temple run 3.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Some shows have short seasons.  Not Big Bang Theory.  So many episodes to enjoy and the show is well written and extremely funny.  The characters quirks are what keep you coming back for more.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I personally LOVE it like if I have something on a certain day it will pop up or be in my notifications. I think that if you are forgetful or that you sometimes need a reminder than this is the PERFECT app for you!
1612130283|5.0|I knew it would be great, and was not disappointed!  I heard a lot of reviews about it first, then decided to check it out for myself!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|really really really really really really really really really really really fun. I love this app!!!  really cool and there is unicorns!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome book !  I didn't want to put it down till I finished it.  I had the narrative reader also and enjoyed that also.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A very easy read that keeps you confused and on edge!<br />There is just brought mystery and romance to keep the book light hearted but still hold a good story line
B0084HJE0S|1.0|This books offers NOTHING. Just a scam to get you to buy this authors other books, watch out, this is a scam and pollutes your brain with mis-information
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is one of the best shows on T.V. right now.  Engaging, entertaining, and not at all cheesy like a lot of other Zombie shows and movies.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Terrible game, so un-creative and zero fun factor, this is the worst game I have ever played, I am done buying games from Rovio now because of this
B006BG7RI0|4.0|....it's considered one of the best films of all time.  Can it compare to the acting of today?  I don't know...but when you take into account the &#34;limitations&#34; of film and acting back in the golden age of Hollywood it's easy to see why this film is one of the top five on most critics' lists.  Bogart plays Rick quite welll, showing the change in the characters' ideals and motives.  There's so much going on in each scene, from the lost couple that is continuously hit with hurdles in their plight to leave Casablanca to the nuanced performances from Bogart and Bergman.  There's not much I could fing wrong with the movie and I tried as I watched it.<br />Now...as for the edition, the three discs you get (blu-ray, blu-ray Special Effects, and dvd) are worth getting.  I don't know that the poster or coasters are necessary.  I did love the &#34;behind-the-scenes&#34; booklet.  The four stars are for the movie, not much else.  If you already have seen the film, DON'T get this.  If you've never seen it, this might be a good (though expensive) place to start.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I really loved this movie.  Very vibrant, characters were adorable, and Johnny Depp is my all time favorite. Voice and expressions were on point.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this is a great thing to have on all of my devices. thank you so much. it's great
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I think it was ok, but not as good as his other books.  Would probably make a good movie though.
B0053YEM7U|3.0|Good music but it is not Yes without Jon and Rick. It's like Moody Blues without Mike Pinder and Ray Thomas.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|everything works well except it locks up every now and then when opening the program. alarm has never failed so I am really glad about that! I rely on this to remind me of important appointments.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Easily swept into the trials and tribulations of the Crawleys and staff.  Amazing casting, writing, etc,  I hope there's a season 4 in the plans!
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|A Mel Brooks classic. Give it a 10 on the laugh meter. The cast is great fun. John Candy stole the. Show as Barf the dog boy partner. All in all a great way to enjoy an evening with friends and family. \\"May the Schwartz be with you\\".
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I so enjoyed this book.  Cornwell can do no wrong in his books. A great read for history & people in it.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Fast paced, fun thrill ride with just enough callbacks to the original to kick some butt.  Worth your time.  Loved it!
B005DI8IX0|5.0|This book is the perfect example of what an art book should be. Quite frankly it's beautiful. I have but one complaint and that is that it is too tall, it doesn't fit on my bookshelf but complaining about that is like complaining about how your apples don't come peeled.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Great ending, I still like the books SO much more than any of the movies but this was well done in comparison.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As someone who has never seen the comic books and started after Season 1 was already out on DVD - I've got to say this movie has surpassed my True Blood love.  Rick's character is frighteningly altered with the death of his wife and their rift prior to that.  Carl is turning into a kid soldier which the likes of aren't usually found on American TV.  And Darryl - DAMN!  The man has it all.  I cannot wait until the return in February, but I will have the popcorn ready as they enter the Governor's world.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Great ending, I still like the books SO much more than any of the movies but this was well done in comparison.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show is one of my favorites.  Between movie clips, bromance extreme, intelligent arguments, and witty banter, I hardly notice the delightfully sexy men in their beautiful suits.  Truly this show has one of the most gorgeous actors and actresses, but it is not just beauty.  Intelligent discussions and byplay truly make this show a must see.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|As someone over 60 I found some of the songs unfamiliar and the language a bit rough, but as a vocalist myself I LOVED hearing the groups perform, the harmonies, blending and vocal rhythms that make acappella vocal group singing so unique and the appeal that the movie had for younger musicians.  We found ourselves wondering if the actors were actually doing the singing, and if they were, WOW!!!!  They all did a fantastic job!  If not, it was fabulous lip-syncing! We highly recommend the movie!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|A movie the whole family will enjoy! Very funny, great story line. The movie is long but you wont notice it since it keeps you engaged.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|had this book for xmas which was an ideal read just before the new year training regime kicked in<br /><br />this book completly blew my mind of how informative & detailed it was, the way in which the advice was put across made complete sense & was toatlly helpful in making me realise what i needed to change in my workouts to gain full benefit from them<br /><br />if your into training a feel stuck in the same routine without getting any major gains this book will inspire & excite you to try something new & at the same time putting it across in a way which completly realistic & achievable
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of our favorite shows to watch. We really enjoy this series. It was so easy to access.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|On the cable channel I saw a couple of the Firefly episodes a few months back. It caught my attention, and I learned that the show only lasted a season (all most) but this movie was like the final episode. So I purchased the Firefly DVDs and the Serenity Movie, and really enjoyed the adventures.<br /><br />I don't understand how the original show failed to make it, but I am glad to have discovered it, and it was right to bring closure to the series with this Serenity Movie.<br /><br />Well done.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|lots fo fun i wish that there were more levels though! the bonus material isnt as fun as the regular game levels.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Sound quality is excellent and installation is as easy as plugging in a phone charger I will probably buy another.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|Recall when my buddies and I would try to pound out these Beatles songs on our electric guitars and bass!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the book.  Fast paced, lots of twists and turns.  I also loved the style of writing.  Will definitely have to read more books by Gilliam Flynn
1416905014|5.0|I've bought 2 months ago. My 4 and half years old doughter still reading (try to read) and looking Cinderella. This is her concentration record :). It's not a book only, but İt's engineering work. I've ordered one more to collect.
B004RC8NUQ|4.0|both great actors with a ok script, it's the same kind of story as &#34;love and other drugs&#34;, which is also a good movie, but they both have hormones running wild, and jumping in the sack all the time.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Rowling's CASUAL VACANCY shows that she is capable of writing interesting adult fiction.<br />Her characters are well-developed, and as we get to know them, we realize that people<br />are similar to one another everywhere.
B006K3796E|5.0|i like the 3d effect, it's very hard which makes it so much fun, and there are a few places to start so it stays interesting
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun game...too many dumb adds for dating services between games. It would be better if they only had an add after 3-4 games.
B00275EGX8|1.0|I'm a veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan and while I don't expect movies to have to always be like the real thing (which would actually be horrible), you can't claim that a movie is the real thing and then get away with it.<br /><br />I heard an interview with the lead actor on NPR as this film was coming out. He was talking about the stress of filming it, how he would go to his hotel each night and shake, how when he got home, people didn't understand and I wanted to laugh. What an idiot. If he thinks that is tough, he should go and do it for real and see how he feels.<br /><br />The fact that this film won an Oscar speaks voulmes to how Hollywood sees war. A hollywood lens.<br /><br />This movie disrespects not only EOD, but veterans everywhere. It is a complete joke and isn't even a good film in its own right.<br /><br />Much better films have been made about war. It behooves you to find them. Avoid this and all the hype.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for!  I never get bored of it, works out all your muscles in all your body, I just love it!!!  Just finished one month will now go for another with extra cardio but this is a must try people!
B005LAII1C|5.0|Love this movie!  Love Mark Wahlberg!  Of course there is always the crowd that didn't live this part of life so they probably don't think of it as funny.
B00ASVX1BQ|5.0|After ordering the original blu ray it was shipped late and then I had to return it as it did not work in my player.  When I say that they were releasing it again, I preordered it once more.  Of course it was delayed again but it finally came today.  I put it into my Panasonic blu ray player and it worked.  The picture and sound are great.  After 3 months I guess you can say it was worth the wait.  I'm still a little annoyed by the ordeal though.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The pace of the book is slow. I wonder if Martin knows anymore where he wants his series to go and if he is just dragging it out for more money at the expense of the writing.  Nevertheless,  I did read it, I did like it, and I will probably read the next one.  It's kind of like when a tv show you really love has started to have crappy writing but you keep watching it anyway because you care about the characters.  ...which is kind of funny since the series IS a tv show now.  I really hope the next book goes somewhere without leaving the reader annoyed at the end.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My kids watch it every night!! Bedtimes are all about the Gruffalo and \\"Gruffalo's Child\\" as well!<br />We highly recommend it!
B007N85POS|5.0|Love this game.  Between this one and Seasons, I like Rio the best.  Playing the other versions has made it easier to play Rio.
B00B0NDF26|3.0|This album is fine to listen to but it's really nothing special. I loved Tegan and Sara. The Con was the soundtrack to my summer the year it was released. Sainthood eventually grew on me but it didn't get nearly as much play as the other albums did. I feel like my musical tastes have grown in the opposite direction of the creative decisions T&S have made. If you like pop/dance music then this is a great album. It has a nice beat and is danceable. The lyrics are still good and the same kind of insight the other albums had. If you listen to music solely for quotable lyrics then you will like this. If you like to listen to music that has a challenging sound then this isn't it. The sound has just become so cookie cutter it could be any two bit trashmonster artist out there. There is really nothing special about the way this album plays.  This is total background music. Nothing really stands out to make you sit up and listen. you really have to put the effort in to hear the lyrics because the sound is so uninteresting it is easy to lose focus. I don't know, I'm giving it three stars because it is a good pop (is there such a thing?) album. That's just not to my taste. This album feels bland in comparison to their earlier works. I understand evolving and changing your sound as you grow as an artist but this album is like they threw out all of the good parts of their music and ramped up everything that is awful about pop music. If any of these songs popped up on my Pandora station I'd skip it and for some of these songs, I'd thumbs down them all together. Bland, uninteresting and a general disappointment.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I can't rate this game because it didn't download to my Kindle when I go it.  I'll have to try and download it again Sorry.
B0091VGAXK|1.0|\\"Rock of Ages,\\" based on a theatrical \\"jukebox musical\\" built on the songs of 1980s big-hair power-pop bands like Foreigner, Journey, Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, etc., is an appallingly bad movie. The plots (boy meets girl, boy loses girl due to a misunderstanding, etc.; beleaguered owners trying to save their Sunset Strip rock club from a back tax debt and religious culture warriors) are trite, the script is lame, and because you see the jokes coming a mile away, they're not funny.<br /><br />Although my feelings about the songs in \\"Rock of Ages\\" range from indifference to active dislike, I did not hate \\"Rock of Ages\\" because I hate the genre or the milieu. I adore \\"Almost Famous\\" and enjoyed \\"Get Him To the Greek.\\" This kind of music can make great kitschy fun when handled well. I like to lose myself in inspired silliness, having seen \\"The Spongebob SquarePants Movie\\" at least 12 times. On paper, I should have liked \\"Rock of Ages.\\"  In this shockingly unimaginative, bloated, overlong execution, a fun idea wastes the talent involved.<br /><br />The talent is considerable: Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Russell Brand. Julianne Hough and Diego Bioneta, the young leads, fit musical convention for ingenues with their sweetness and sincerity. Tom Cruise surprises as the wasted star Stacee Jaxx, whose performance is expected to save the struggling rock club. I don't think he's great--he's too compact, too bulked-up, too teeth-clenchingly Tom Cruise--to completely convince us that he's a Jim-Morrison-esque vocalist--but he throws himself into the role and, like the other actors, seems to enjoy himself. Unfortunately the cliche-ridden, limp script doesn't give any of these talented performers anything worthwhile to do.<br /><br />The only people I expect would like this movie would be those for whom the songs rise to \\"soundtrack of my life\\" significance. The actors all do their own singing, and the arrangements of the songs are pretty true to the originals.I knew Catherine Zeta-Jones could sing from \\"Chicago,\\" but who knew Tom Cruise could sing? He does, and very well. There are plenty of songs \\"Rock of Ages,\\"  many of them mash-ups, for example, Foreigner's \\"Juke Box Hero\\" mashed up with Joan Jett's \\"I Love Rock and Roll.\\" Whether the songs arise naturally from the action is another question.<br /><br />Infantile as \\"Rock of Ages,\\" may be, many parents will probably find the language and sexual suggestiveness inappropriate for their children.

B00992CF6W|5.0|so epicly wepicly EPIC!!!!!!!!!! kindle fire is perfect size for this. I had it for about a year now and my only complaint is that kindle fires get the updates later than other devices. p.s. the 7 bucks were worth it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched my first episode of Downton Abbey when the 3rd episode of season 3 aired in the US.  Within 2 weeks, I was caught up; had streamed and purchased every episode from the beginning.<br /><br />I love the historical perspective and the opportunity to peek into the 'proper' life they lived (both upstairs and down).  The cast of characters are endearing, lovable and sometimes despicable - but each personality is well defined.  I want them all to  live happily ever after: Robert with Cora, Mary with Matthew, Mr. Bates with Anna and what about Mr, Carson with Mrs. Hughes?  Sounds good to me!  Lots of parallels with our classic 'Gone with the Wind'. (i.e. Scarlet=Mary; Ashley=Matthew; Melanie=Lavinia)
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Solidly made and quite versatile, however, I found that the levels were not as pronounced when recording that I would have expected. Overall a versatile and handy thing to have when recording.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app comes in very handy at Bible classes, discussing with others outside of Bible classes, discussing a certain scripture and proving you're right at that moment, instead of having to get back to them. Everyone doesn't carry their Bible with them, having this on my Kindle is convenient because I am always bringing scripture up in my daily life with others outside of my home I love it.
0307949508|5.0|Even though I had seen the movie, both European and American, I had to read all three books in the trilogy in an attempt to completely understand the character of Lisbeth Salander.  Not to cast dispersion on Ms. Rooney but I feel that Ms. Rapace better captured the essence of our heroine.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|Special effects is all this movie has to offer. The story line has been told many many times before in different settings. Poor character development, predictable story line and relying on the special effects to create the excitement made this a very boring movie.
B007C4E1R0|5.0|Since I had seen the movie, both European and American versions, I had to read all three books (English version) to fully comprehend the character of Lisbeth Salander.  And what a complex character she is.  If only Mr. Larsson had live a bit longer.  I want more.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|I will not go into what the movie is about just watch it. The only thing I want to say is this... If you choose to eat meat, which is your right, then you should watch how meat is produced in this country. If you still choose to eat meat after that, then so be it. I for one have seen to much to be able to continue to eat meat without feeling guilty or flat out disgusted. Watch it!

1884883303|2.0|DISAPPOINTING to say the least. The section on guitars was quite good but, I'm not interested in guitars. I'm a bassist and needed information on electric basses. The section on Fender basses was good but there was no information at all on the majority of currently and previously available brands. The section on Warwick basses had NOTHING, with regard to values, on any models they produce. As Warwick is a very popular brand and has been around for over ten years, I found it surprising that nothing about them was included apart from telling you it was started by the son of the man responsible for bringing us Framus basses and that they also make amps. If I were looking for information on manufacturer's histories there are many other references available that contain more than a single paragraph. The section on amplifiers was as disappointing as the bass section. Go to a bookstore and peruse a volume of this &#34;guide&#34; for the information you seek (if it's there) and save yourself the cost. This guide was not worth the price in my opinion.

The base of the light gets hot, but nothing like a 60w incandescent would. The housing of the lamp stays cool enough to comfortably touch. No risk of burns or damaged lamp shades!

So glad I did! Not only am I now a fan of his music, I got a copy of this CD for myself too! Rod's version of these classic Christmas tunes is refreshing, and the duets between Rod and the other amazing vocalists make this a one-of-a-kind treasure in our Christmas collection.

0062082353|5.0|I have a collection of close to 300 books on military history... everything from philosophical treatises to historical accounts to personal perspective. American Sniper gives some real insight into the role of the sniper on the modern battlefield.<br /><br />While Kyle is unable to give some of the details of his missions (they are likely classified and will remain so), his book is a thorough personal history. To see the war through the eyes of someone who has the professional combat experience of a SEAL sniper is to see things in a different light than it would might have been seen through a combat infantryman. Chris Kyle is a character in the same league as Marcus Luttrell; someone who is a soldier by trade rather than a writer, who is nonetheless able to communicate the mindset of a warrior.<br /><br />An excellent read.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book was very interesting. I couldn't put the book down. I would highly recommend this book if you want a great book.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and so does everyone in my family bit y problem is I can't figure out how to download th  update once it's come out I have looked online an  there are no reviews on how. And every1 who hates the  ham  be quite tho  ham  o s good an  it's still in development so if u give it a while it will come out with whatever it was that you wanted that was on the Xbox an  pc version's.it will come out just play other games for  while and then u can play it once it's out.<br />. And all minecraft haters just try it before u hate it I just assumed it was stupid  for a while so I called it minecraft but now I'm addicted just give  it a try!plz comment as soon as possible!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent reading.  I can't wait to read the remainder of the trilogy. A truly unique look at government control of its people.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This truly is one of, if not the best game on your mobile device! It's totally balanced gameplay and constantly being updated. If your a Minecraft PC or Xbox fan your going to love this. And if your not sure about spending 7$ then you need to get your head strait. Minecraft on Xbox costs 20$ And it costs 27$ on PC! So paying 7$ to play it on the go is a steal! I love this game... And I assure you will too.  The only bad thing about this on amazon, is that it takes a long time for it to update (But this is only Amazon's fault, not MC).  I hope this helped. So go and support Mojang by giving them a measly 7$. This game should be even more than that...
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Hate it worst book I have read in my life nobody read it it is as boring as crap .
B002E66C6E|5.0|Anytime I can witness the true and Heroic acts that took place in the quest to maintain our freedom, no matter the liberties taken with factual happenings, I love them. Reading about or Seeing portraid, what other men are/were willing to accomplish,even at the cost required, lead me to wonder, How I would have measured up?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so addicting and very fun but kind of hard.  I like it more then temple run because it's more addicting.  Great game for people from ages 7 to 60. Lol.

1451648537|3.0|Isaacson has done an admirable piece of writing in setting before us the portrait of Steve Jobs. The first part annoyed me to the extent that I thought he was not giving the reader a fair description of this unique person we all know as Steve Jobs. But then past the middle of the book Steve comes across as a human and even as charitably pleasant. I've had the good fortune to have enjoyed a dinner and a lunch with Mr. Jobs. With me Steve was a delightfully engaging person. He was a human being who was interested in creating a holistic instrument that could be used by everybody and not merely by professionals. Cost was not so much his concern as quality. I must add that I was convinced when I spoke with Mr. Jobs that wealth was not his goal, he was not concerned in becoming a wealthy person but he wante to create a legacy in Apple that would be a trend setter for decades to come.I highly recommend the book by Mr. Isaacson and would hope that other books would surface that included a deeper historical perspective of what Steve Jobs has contributed to the world.

0307949486|5.0|THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO<br />Running like a set of parallel train tracks, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a classy, modern day thriller which not only entertains the reader but manages to educate him / her  in Swedish culture at the same time.  Larsson has produced an utterly compelling mystery thriller which sets the hero the Herculean task of solving an unsolvable 40 year old disappearance of a young woman.  On one track (plot line) of the story we have Michael Bloomkvist, the investigative reporter hired to find out what happened to Harriett Vanger, the great niece of the head of the massive Vanger Corporation.  On the next track (plot line) is Lisbeth Salamander, an apparently brilliant computer savvy \\"juvenile delinquent\\" who deals with issues of bullies, pigs, and injustices in her own unique manner.<br /><br />Two thirds into the book and the pair finally meet up and at this point, not only does the plot begin to show its brilliance but so does the entire structure of the story.  The book is not easy to read in one sense and yet when it begins to move, it flies, baby, it flies!  Revelation leads to revelation which will leave you thinking for yourself and naturally the more you get through the book the more theories you will come up with on your own, only to see them shot down in flames in the next chapter.  But this book is like the best sandwich you have ever had in your life - take one bite and your mouth is overcome with flavours and so you take another bite and then you think to yourself, \\"how can a sandwich have so many flavours- that is not possible.\\" But then you realise there is no point in trying to work it all out so you just keep on eating the sandwich.  (I like metaphors).  This is the hidden strength and quality of this novel.<br /><br />The ending, when it comes is a doozie.  Not only do we find out \\"whodunit\\" but like all classics of the genre we find out so much more.  I can't say more than this without ruining the book for the three people left on the planet who have not read it but it will be clear to you as you do that this book is special.  This is book one of the \\"Millennium\\" trilogy.  How fitting. I would be happy to call this \\"... (one of the)  books of the millennium...\\" with no qualms whatsoever.  Brilliant.  And to think the two sequels are even better!<br /><br />Greggorio. (LR)ee people left on the planet who have not read it but it will be clear to you as you do that this book is special.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I loved the original, and this sequel could be fantastic, but it's a little glitchy.  Sometimes upon launch on my Kindle Fire HD, the action will stop and start during the explorer's initial run out of the tunnel.  And after the first rope, there's a little \\"hitch\\" in the action during the transition from rope to path. But I love the new maps - especially the mine shafts.  Everything is more challenging and more fun.  I like how the power ups are separated from the abilities.  One more request:  please make the girls sound less girly!  It's embarrassing to hear that wimpy \\"Aaaaaaahhh\\" when they fall!
B0002XV30Q|5.0|This set of performances was recorded in the late 1980s when the discs were issued separately. The most attractive one for collectors at that time was the coupling of concertos 2 and 4. Those two concertos have always been considered the strongest with memorable tunes and interesting use of the orchestra and they inevitably made the strongest coupling. The other three make for pleasant but less memorable experiences. These preferences are similar to the way that Saint Saens' violin concerto 3 dwarfs the popularity of his others and the symphony 3 dwarfs the rest of his symphonies, in each case the preferences reflect the compositional strength of the preferred works.<br /><br />The current successfully re-mastered set of the Collard discs now offers the whole series of piano concertos priced at a lower level than either of the single discs which can still be bought separately from some suppliers. This is a very attractive proposition as, although there are obviously favoured works within the set, the less favoured works are still skilfully written and well worth the occasional airing which is now a more affordable option. The remastering has clarified textures and gives more sense of 'presence' with a good balance between the piano and orchestra.<br /><br />As regards comparative performances, the Collard set is undoubtedly the most exciting complete set yet available with a very fulsome and open-hearted approach to the music making both pianistically and orchestrally. This, to give an idea of alternative approaches to this music, is in direct contrast with Rubinstein's concerto 2, for example, which is altogether more gentlemanly and refined but less exciting. Thibaudet also goes for a similarly more elegant and slightly cool Gallic approach in his coupling of 2 and 5. Casadesus, in his recording of concerto 4 with Bernstein, is simply larger than life and thrilling but very difficult to acquire these days.<br /><br />Hough's approach falls somewhere in between all of these and is probably the main competitor with Collard for a boxed set. Hough's is a very virtuosic account with lots of speed but this is achieved without Collard's compensating dramatic weight. There is an arguable case that the music thus becomes a display of digital dexterity at the expense of musical satisfaction.<br /><br />Such an approach as Hough's might suit all the works as a whole but tends to under-sell the more symphonic nature of the concerto 4 especially and the exciting concerto 2 which is constructed in three movements of increasing speed and drive. The important word here is 'drive' which also implies some dramatic weight. Bearing in mind the relative greater popularity and possible importance of the dramatically weightier concertos 2 and 4, it seems more appropriate to ensure the maximum effect with those two works especially. It is this dramatic weight applied to even the least of these concertos that makes Collard's set stand out as being particularly successful and will give him the possible edge over Hough for many collectors.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that this re-mastered and bargain priced set should be considered very seriously by future purchasers especially if an exciting performance of concertos 2 and 4 is the main priority and there is an interest in dramatic weight rather than a display of digital dexterity throughout the set.of these and is probably the main competitor with Collard for a boxed set.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it.  It is definitely worth the money.  It reminds me of tamagatchi from when I was in elementary school.  I'm 29 and I enjoy it.  Great stress reliever.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|My grandkids are 9 and 7 years old.  They both really enjoys the movie.  I must confess, I enjoyed myself as well.  The movie tell the story of a Vampire who builds a hotel so all the monsters of the world can have somewhere to go to vacation safely away from humans. They all gather for the 118th birthday of the vampire's daughter.  Somehow a backpacking slacker finds his way to the hotel and falls in love with the vampire's daughter.  It's quite funny seeing the vampire trying to  keep the boy's real identity a secret from the monsters. There are really catchy songs and good dialogue.  I think your kids will thoroughly enjoy the movie and you might get a kick out of it as well.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|ready for more! very addictive. If you liked Lost, you most likely will love Walking Dead. Just switch out crazy island for crazy zombies

B007ZTLLMK|5.0|I've had an RC helo game for iPhone but this Android FAOTD is at least as good - and you have missions, not just free flight.<br />The graphic detail isn't too impressive but adequate.<br />You have an excellent tutorial.<br />You can choose to fly with gyro (I recommend it) or virtual joypad.<br />The controls are sensitive so easy does it.<br />A collision with a solid object will destroy the helicopter so be careful.<br />You can switch to first person camera view if you want to.<br />Some of the 30 missions for which you receive 1-3 stars, depending on your performance, even let you shoot missiles although this isn't easy - you have to be absolutely flush with the target.<br />Landing in front of it is an option.<br />A really well done RC helo sim.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|By now I hope you've seen this movie -- it's a magnificent comedy that doesn't fit into any particular genre. Is it a rom-com?  Is it a screwball comedy? Is it satire?<br /><br />It is all of the above.  There are a number of classic Bill Murray comedies -- Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddyshack -- the list makes for an impressive CV.  Groundhog Day is an equal to any of those and is worth your time.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I bought this as Christmas present this past year for my best friend. He is a huge Will Ferrell fan. I love this movie so much I might just buy a second copy for myself soon. Thanks, Amazon!

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This improves upon the original DVD a thousand fold. It is a must see. Don't pass this up. FFVII:AC complete is totally worth it.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|I have never played the Halo games or watched any of the animated movies, so this was my first time. I enjoyed the movie for the most part, I mean not knowing what was going on at first. I thought the acting was decent and the storyline was informative, but the ending left me wanting for more. It left me wanting to know who the big robot guys were and where the story would go from there. I hope they make another movie continuing from that point.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You can do things And it is cool things and cool people proof is the game it is cool twenty
1932100660|5.0|A brilliant book, evenly balanced and in-depth. I learnt more about nutrition in this book than everything I have ever read or heard about in the paper or from friends (i.e. rubbish). I look at life through a different lens now. Thank you!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|American Sniper: Great book by a great American. Best non fiction military book that I have ever read. He makes you feel like you are right there with him.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Overall a nice movie.  Nice singing.  Got my teens to watch a movie with me so it was good for family bonding.
B000ID37T0|5.0|I loved the movie. Never really heard of this movie till my teacher suggested it Al Pacino plays a good part.
0062071017|4.0|I look for a number of things in a business book, something genuinely new, excellent phrasing of tested material presented in a way that challenges my thinking and my ability to turn ideas into action and good entertainment.  I didn't find The Strategist to be genuinely revolutionary but it scores well enough on all the other criteria that I would recommend it highly.<br /><br />The point that will probably stay with me the longest is that many books and articles talk about and debate the importance of Strategy Vs. Execution whereas in truth there is often a blur between where one ends and the other begins.  Certainly a point which I will give further thought to.  I also liked the link between strategy and leadership earlier in the book.  Can you separate the two?<br /><br />Overall the book covers a lot of Michael Porter's theories and does this well - a key learning would be that it is not just understanding the competitive forces in your industry but how you react to them that is the essence of strategy creation.  Deeply understanding your industry and responding appropriately sets businesses apart.<br />Importance of core purpose is dealt with well and good questions are posed around if your company ceased to exist what would be the impact on the world. Would people miss you? How would they replace you, and how long would it take? I see purpose as being at the heart of strategy so got a lot out of this coverage.<br /><br />I enjoyed the case study approach to the material, some of the companies covered have been written about extensively, others not so much and these are the ones I got most out of.<br /><br />Overall it is a good read which does have a slightly different perspective which it benefits from and the material is covered well, I'd suggest most leaders and managers would benefit from reading The Strategist.
B0086DBE62|2.0|I give this movie credit for trying to put a different spin on the classic Snow White tale.  However, the humor came across as a little cheesy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app Its fun and challenging. Subway Suffers is not a game that ends in one week you have fun with it for a long time.You never get bored with it.I just love it...
B00000I0XW|3.0|Not quite what I expected.  Bought it for my mother and she didn't like it because high tones hurt her ears.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I only purchased and read this book because I read the first one and want to finish the series. After reading the first book I had to take a break from the story before starting the second because it's much more explicit then any other book I've read in the genre. I like romance novels but the Dom/Sub story is not romantic and the troubled Christian Gray is so annoying. He's angry, then jealous, then horny, then scared, and can't be touched and the list goes on... The rolling of the eyes and biting the lip is so repetitive and how the two characters can even be in a real relationship is not even realistic.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Beautifully acted.  Beautiful story.  Funny and charming' loveable and historically interesting.  Wish I had seen this movie sooner.  Highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|2.0|First, the book was really slow to start.  Then, in the middle it was ok and picked up a little, not much but a little.  THEN, the ending was horrible.  I am kind of sorry that I actually wasted time on this.  This was the first book I read by this author.  I heard how great she is but I don't think I will be buying anymore of her books.
0439023521|5.0|The movie buzz is what got me interested in the series, but I wanted to read the books as soon as possible. I read them the 1st time a few weeks after seeing the movie and read them a 2nd time several months later<br /><br />I was amused that Stephenie Meyer has a quote on the cover, since she's not one to talk about good writing. Twitter user UncleYo put it as follows - \\"Stephanie Meyers has a quoted review on The Hunger Games' cover. That's like Justin Bieber reviewing The White Album.\\"<br /><br />I felt the book and the movie were both good, just different, they were both effective in their storytelling medium.<br /><br />In both cases, I caught a lot more details the 2nd time.<br /><br />The big difference is that Peeta seemed a lot more impressive in the book.<br /><br />It makes sense that the would-be Mrs. Everdeen met him buying medicinal herbs, but I had remembered the Mellark story of falling for an Everdeen singing voice.<br />Mrs. Everdeen's old nice clothes was another cool reference to her past.<br />Peeta taking Haymitch to task in the morning on the train gave me more respect for Peeta. I liked how Katniss felt threatened rather than impressed by that.<br />Peeta and his father being so nice made it harder to hate them like I had wanted to.<br /><br />Peeta's behavior now seems like obvious foreshadowing of his interest in Katniss.<br />I noticed Peeta wondering if his father wanted daughters. I wondered about that for many parent characters, including Mr. Everdeen and sons. I hadn't remembered the concept was mentioned in canon.<br /><br />It seemed odd for Katniss to mention horse alongside beef and chicken as fancy meat Merchant Section people ate.<br /><br />Training seemed different, more of a struggle/challenge but also more productive.<br /><br />It seemed like a fighting challenge should be solely about fighting skill instead of ability to talk up sympathy. I had blamed tributes/staff for an underhanded tactic instead of the Capitol for setting it up that way. Also, part of me underestimating Peeta was his fighting skills.<br /><br />Because it's dystopic fiction, a lot of it besides the characters' personality traits doesn't seem personally relevant. I identified with Katniss' negative personality traits of excessive cynicism, not wanting any help and underestimating oneself. I had seen Peeta as a loser for being even worse at talking to women than I am, dismissing much of the rest of him.<br /><br />Evne though the setting is extreme, I identified with Katniss' habit of excessive cynicism, not wanting any help and underestimating oneself. Peeta seemed like a great counterpoint to all that. At first I thought he was kind of a loser for being even worse at talking to women than I am (is that possible?). That has caused me to overlook many of his strengths.<br /><br />The rooftop moral stand came off differently. In the movie, it seemed noble. Book Katniss saw it as holier-than-thou. I understood why Katniss was surprised at the crush reveal, but handn't understood why she was angry about it. Well, at first she had seen Peeta as competition, and it took her some time to lose that feeling. That seems why it took her a lot of tiem to fall in love with him and stop being in denial about that.<br /><br />The arena action moved fast, yet was still well described - the dehyradration, fireballs, Rue conversation, supplies destruction, all of it. Cato was reeling form the tracker jacker attack, which is why he couldn't manage to finish off Peeta - I thought that was a plot hole. Similarly, I'm not sure if Clove really waited too long to finish off Katniss.<br /><br />I noticed Katniss talking about her hearing gradually returning. I forgot there were two cave scenes, before and after the feast. It was clearer Katniss not wanting kids was about the Reaping as opposed to some other reason.<br /><br />At the end, it was clear Katniss was scared of Gale's reaction to the Peeta situation. I wasn't sure if the Capitolwould actually have two victors - Katniss and Peeta played that very well. It was a great setup for things really getting interesting in the sequel.would actually have two victors - Katniss and Peeta played that very well. It was a great setup for things really getting interesting in the sequel.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It makes you use your brain! I will buy the next one in this series.
006197806X|4.0|More wonderful writing in the Delirium sequel, although some of it not so much.<br /><br />Interesting ending twists, as with the previous book. I saw some of it coming and was glad to be vindicated, but much of it was still a surprise.<br />Most details seem quite plausible within the extreme situation<br />Some of it fell flat, particularly the big last page twist.<br /><br />There seemed to be two separate storylines - hiding out in the woods and undercover in NYC. I wondered how they were related to each other and if it was a hallucination/dream. Eventually I realized the NYC storyline came after the woods storyline, but Oliver mixed in the chapters earlier - an interesting choice.<br /><br />At worst, Lena seems like a bit of a generic everygirl. I don't begrudge Lauren Oliver too much for this - she's a smart girl doing serious things; the friendship with Hana and later some folks in the Wilds adds another dimension to her character.<br /><br />The first book mentioned homosexuals being considered \\"unnaturals\\" - this didn't seem particularly bothersome because the government also hated heterosexual love. However, like many other aspects of the setting, that feels more disturbing as the story goes along.<br /><br />I wondered if/when Lena was going to find another love interest after Alex.<br /><br />I'm reminded of my camping experience, especially the arduous task of fetching water, although they of course had to do it for real instead of for fun.<br />The bombing seemed like a realistic peril.<br /><br />I wasn't surprised that the Scavengers caused trouble. Also, their very existence was an interesting distinction in the anti-government community. The DFA was an interesting distinction in the pro-government community, a more extreme version of an already extreme idea.<br />I thought Julian would turn out to love Lena. It was interesting how electric their contact was even without kissing. That entailed him seeing the light and realizing how evil his father was (or announcing that to the reader), interesting in and of itself.<br />I eventually realized something odd was happening with the Scavengers, maybe the government setting them up as a false flag operation, and I was right.<br />The police raid seemed like a realistic peril, then it turned out it wasn't really a police raid. An interesting rebel tactic - confuse actual police, slip through the cracks of the bureaucracy. Rebels having their own issues seems realistic.<br />Alex being alive seems like a WTF cheap resurrection of a herowas (or announcing that to the reader), interesting in and of itself.<br />I eventually realized something odd was happening with the Scavengers, maybe the government setting them up as a false flag operation, and I was right.<br />The police raid seemed like a realistic peril, then it turned out it wasn't really a police raid.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I love this book, although it was obvious where the plot was headed. As usual Ms. Hoover writes witty female characters and classic male characters.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I heard about the series as the movie was about come out and saw it in a theater opening weekend. It instantly made me a huge fan of the series I rewatched it twice on home video, but did not watch any of the special features. I noticed a lot more the 2nd viewing and a bit more the 3rd time.<br /><br />Amazing. Among other things, it was great at being an action movie with a plot. Collins did an excellent job of putting deep themes in a youth-friendly context. Excellent setting and storyline. Riveting pacing. Most scenes were fast paced, telling a lot of story in minimal time. A few key scenes felt slower, which seemed like an appropriate use of contrast to highlight their importance to the story - the prime examples were the reaping, Katniss' private session and Rue's death. The characterization/acting was great - idealized, yet still imperfect and identifiable.<br /><br />I was happy with the movie and want more at the same time; it is a good thing when the worst you can say is that you want more. The movie seemed to be a very effective adaptation overall. Mostly, the movie changes seemed not bad just different, although Peeta seemed much more impressive in the book. Some third person scenes were a great way to do exposition in a movie format, as opposed to the book's strict first person - the prime examples were Crane's appearances and the District 11 riot. I was certainly able to follow the movie without the book. I've now read each of the books twice. I was able to follow the 2nd book based on the 1st movie without having read the 1st book yet.<br /><br />One of my few criticisms is how some of the violence was masked with shaky camera work. I at least wish that the censoring had been less obtrusive. That might be about getting a PG-13, aiming at teenage girls in general, or simply a moviemaking screwup. Shaky camera work did fit the hallucination plot point. I didn't care for the score; I thought it was overbearing in the emotional scenes.<br /><br />There were a few apparent plot holes<br />how did District 12 get away with lax Peacekeepers?<br />why didn't they continue shooting at Katniss? (Was Peeta that persuasive? Is Clove limited at throwing knives upwards?)<br />why didn't Cato finish off Peeta? (okay, maybe Cato was also reeling form the tracker jacker attack)<br />why did Clove delay in killing Katniss and thus lose her chance?<br /><br />Katniss' volunteering reminded me of Mulan.<br /><br />I was struck by how some, especially Peeta, kept their humanity.<br />I liked the alternating views, although I felt there could have been more from outside the arena at times.<br /><br />I liked Caesar and Effie. The interview scene emphasized Caesar's showmanship. Many of the non-12 interviews weren't shown at all or shown in short clips, an exampel of the fast pacing). Glimmer was so bubbly, the tribute parade was the main topic in Katniss' interview, and that Katniss was stunned for a bit before she hulks out. The president and gamemaker in particular were a subtle yet undeniable evil. How come their physical apperance that was relatively unmodified (by Capitol standards)?<br /><br />I figured there might be dramatic tension when the two from the same district face each other, and there was.<br /><br />District 12 clearly resembled Depression-era Appalachia. The garish colors and advanced technology of the Capitol seemed like intentional exaggerated contrast.<br /><br />When Katniss said she never wanted kids, it reminded me of \\"you're thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled, fear to bring children into the world\\" from Bob Dylan's \\"Masters Of War\\".<br /><br />To me, Haymitch came off as a sad drunk; it was obvious his experiences had driven him to drink.<br /><br />I wonder if the other tribute parade outfits were *caricatured* representations of each district. Also, that scene was the most obvious Roman/gladiator connection. For instance, I noticed some Roman salutes - right arm pointed upward, bent at the elbow, palm facing left (the Fascist version is locked elbow, palm facing down).<br /><br />I wondered why more districts didn't train volunteers (though Katniss had experience from all that bowhunting).<br /><br />I'm not sure what was real, what was done for the cameras and what became real because the characters acted that way. I'd say this is another one of Collins' artistic points. The Katniss/Peeta relationship (with her having to play along) is a prime example of that.<br /><br />Concern about Jen's weight seemed like usual Hollywood image BS, not to mention that the males weren't a target. Katniss and Gale are hunters anyway, and Peeta is from the relatively good part of town. Jen usually acted Katniss' age, but it occasionally showed that she's a few years older, particularly in the scenes with Rue. With fiction in general, many youth characters seem older, but many adult characters are idealized too.<br /><br />I figured something was up with the pile of stuff, but I first thought the dirt piles were makeshift burials for the tributes who died early. Rue's small size must have helped navigate the minefield before Katniss took her shots to set it off. It was a striking moment when the failed guard quickly got his neck snapped.<br /><br />Rue's scenes with Katniss were the most genuinely emotional part of the movie, including Katniss' funeral ritual and the District 11 riots after Rue's death.<br />Is the characters' race a point or a coincidence? District 11 _is_ poor, Southern, agricultural and black. I noticed Cinna's non-flamboyance more than his race. I can imagine readers overlooking a small section of the book, especially if it's _convenient_ for them to do so.<br /><br />Prop-wise, I was impressed by the camo jobs and the sleek weaponry. (I wonder why the arrows didn't have four-bladed broadheads)<br /><br />The Katniss/Rue hand gesture reminded me of the Boy Scout sign (that uses the three middle finders of the _right_ hand, with different arm/elbow positioning)<br /><br />At the time, I thought \\"What happened to District 13? Redistricting?\\" and \\"What became of the rioting in District 11?\\". This was explained later in the series.<br />First person narration limits exposition, which can be both good and bad. Collins created a new setting and only shows us a little bit of it.<br />I wish there was another scene during or after the credits.<br /><br />My favorite scene? Peeta's interview., palm facing left (the Fascist version is locked elbow, palm facing down).<br /><br />I wondered why more districts didn't train volunteers (though Katniss had experience from all that bowhunting).<br /><br />I'm not sure what was real, what was done for the cameras and what became real because the characters acted that way.

B0064NTZJO|4.0|Ryan Gosling is ridiculously handsome. Drive is the perfect action but sensitive movie for women and man. He nails it big time!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I live in a skilled nursing facility,  there is a couple of non-sleeping neighbors who yell all night long. I have found that with this app. and noise cancelling ear bud headphones I am sleeping like a newborn Baby every night. Thank You for a wonderful app.
B00138J234|4.0|Got some free songs from CDs I bought back way back when I listened to CDs...thanks cloud technology and thanks Amazon.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What can I say.  I absolutely love the show and Amazon was awesome in delivering it quickly to my computer for me to watch.  Very happy.  :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I found this game from my sister and it is great. No words can explain. It is<br />Great . Amazing. Addicting.  And want to play all day!!!
B009O2XY12|1.0|I loved the game when i first downloaded it, but after having to reset my kindle and redownload it, the game is not nearly as much fun. Used to have to wait 30 minutes for energy to refresh, now it takes an hour. I lose all interest having to wait so long between being able to play it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It has everything related to have an excellent relationship. It is very helpful and a great guide for wonderful relationships.
B001BANK32|5.0|I chose this rating because this book was just amazing. This is the fist Stephen king novel I've read, will not be the last. I don't think I've ever read a book this good. Stephen king is truly talented. I decided to read The Shining because I found the movie very good. Scratch that thought, the book makes the movie look like the producers didn't give a dank about the book. If only people didn't have to ruin amazing books with bad movies.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Could not get it to work on the Kindle. Sent the thing back and went out and got an new ipad, that works just like my MacBook pro.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Okay but I have seen better sometimes during the game I would forget what I had currently been doing so I think it needs more organization
1435107683|5.0|I have loved this book for decades. In fact, the only thing better than \\"Owl at Home\\" is the audiobook that was recorded by Arnold Lobel, complete with fantastic music. Find it, if you can! I am sure that the more recent version cannot hold a candle to the original audiobook, by the author, no less!
0847835073|5.0|It was a present for my husband, great photos, mostly black And white, beautiful book.big format. He enjoyed it too.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was such an interesting, insightful look into what goes on in the military that no one ever realizes as we live our day to day lives.  The first 50% of this book I have to say was boring and took me probably 2 months to get through.  It wasn't one of those \\"can't put down\\" types of books. You could tell the writer was not an author so it was a bit slow to develop.  All of a sudden halfway in, it became the most fascinating book I have read yet! As soon as the team hears they are going to be the chosen few to take down Osama Bin Laden, you can't stop reading it.  The mission is explained step by step and at the end there are diagrams showing their route through Osama's house to get to him.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested, however, you can skip the first half of it and not miss a thing.
1455519006|2.0|I was really looking forward to discovering the new author but there is something cardboard-like about the characters. Protagonist #1 is a hired killer for some government agency. He is confused about the latest assignment when the target doesn't seem to be compatible with his usual enemies. His path also crosses that of a runaway teenager who is set on finding out who killed her parents. The story takes its time to develop but the characters remain somewhat inscrutable and often naive. Bond-like but without the spectactular imagery we see in the movies.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was a little hesitant to get the new version because I liked the old one so much, but it is super fun and better than the first! the only hard patbto get used to is the caves, they can get a littke tricky!! but enjoy!! :)
B00003A9QI|5.0|This is yet another fine score from Rachel Portman, steeped in the idiom of many of her other cinematic efforts such as Emma and Nicholas Nickleby. The Main Title Theme is quite moving -- I rarely finish it with a dry eye -- and some of the remaining portions of the score are variations on that theme. The pieces actually have a reasonably nice flow to them, so that listening to the entire album is not an exercise in being jerked around musically to different styles and moods. By turns yearning, plaintive, pastoral, introspective and heartfelt, this is a disc highly recommended.
B008OOYALE|3.0|The dragons are very interesting. I play often! I have a few glitches that throw me away from the area I am working on,but I could be doing something wrong.
B00170I7GG|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The premise: Bill Murray is a meteorologist with dreams of moving to a bigger network, but who must do a fluff piece of reporting the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxatawny, PA. Andie MacDowell is his producer and Chris Elliott is his cameraman. It should just be a quick, though unpleasant job and then he is on his way to bigger things.<br /><br />He has no idea what he is in for.<br /><br />The idea of the time loop has been used on many occasions since this movie, but few (if any) have done it as well. In fact, I venture to say that this movie jump started the genre. For even if it was not the first (I am not sure of that point) it was certainly one of the best.<br /><br />Watching Bill Murray's frustration with the townspeople at the beginning was cute, but it does not really pick up until Bill begins to realize that he is living in a world without consequences ... and the depression that follows as he realizes what that means.<br /><br />Bill's journey is fantastic. And it holds up to repeated viewings. I enjoy not only the situational humor, but the way that Bill's character comes to love the town and its inhabitants.<br /><br />It is a fun movie. It is a funny movie.<br /><br />Parents, no nudity. Some profanity. Not excessive by my tastes but yours may vary. There are suicide scenes, but they are not graphic and due to the nature of the time loop they have no effect. Also, there is some mention of sex, but again it is not graphic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Masterpiece Theater, always have.  This series is amazing, with a richness of character development not seen in years.  It's wonderfully written, the actors are amazing, with the sets and characters giving us a glimpse into a bygone era.  When I was a little girl, we used to 'dress' for dinner and I never really understood why...now I do. My parents were just trying to uphold a 'standard'  one they were not able to uphold for long.  I've now lived long enough to see so many 'standards' and traditions leave for a more casual lifestyle befitting the trends of the day.  How interesting it is to watch a way of life ease away. Cannot wait for the next season...why do we have to wait a full year?  Really this is just too long.  What a story!
B008J34466|4.0|I love Pink and all of her attitude - this album delivers - busy rocking around town to the CD!
B00413QB5A|3.0|It was an easy read and enjoyable; not Ken Follett's best work but an enjoyable way to pass the time I would still recommend it.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This is definitely a fun game.  It can be little frustrating learning the controls, but I can assure you it can be fun.  Even my three year old daughter is hooked.  I have a lot of other preschooler games, but she always seems to gravitate to Edge.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was a great treat to receive the final few episodes even before they were broadcast.  It was a difficult trial to have to wait a week between chapters!  The quality is great, the story is fantastic, the acting is charming, and the Castle steals trhe show.  Thank you, my dearesr Amazon, (to mis-quote Anthony Strallen) for offering such a pleasure.  I ordered this for my grand daughter on dvd, and I got mine on my Kindle, and we are both very happy campers.
1449410243|4.0|I was expecting something totally different with this book, but I read it cover to cover and thought most of it was pretty well drawn.  Living with cats is an experience, and some of the stories in the book and caricatures of the felines seemed to be pretty accurate, if one looks closely at the different expressions on a cat's face.  I will be passing this on to a family member who has a cat for the first time...  should be interesting to get the feedback!
B00APJLFEG|1.0|this video is full of potty humor and at times is very gross.  I wish a children's video like this would contain a warning of this sort of thing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. Be warned though, it is addictive!!!! It is actually really fun though and it is worth getting.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I finally get to see the beginning !!  Started watching it and just couldnt quit... its addicting and entertaining. Yea !
B000VSBX34|5.0|I love this movie and of course the soundtrack is amazing. I know the movie was released when there was no such thing as PG13 so this movie is rated G. But there is enough violence that it would make since to be rated PG13
B001EO748M|5.0|I've seent the 2nd season, but watched it again... and will watch again and again.. very entertaining, I loved it!
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I'd heard the radio hits, and then previewed the whole album. Being a big Queen fan, the opening track was worth the price of the entire album.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is cute when I get to play it.  It doesn't open every time and I have to just give up on it.  I must say that that is rather frustrating and I am considering deleting it because of it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game! my kids love it. Fairly easy to understand and great graphics! you will enjoy it. download it today! !
B002M80918|1.0|Terrible sound quality. Super slow plot. Flat characters. Terrible acting. Super cliche. How in the world this makes everybody's Top Ten movies of all time lists is beyond me.<br /><br />It's very rare that we just turn a movie off half way through--particularly if we've paid to watch it. But this was so awful we did.
B009MO57H6|3.0|The newest edition in the Resident Evil saga was a big letdown to me. It didn't explain how some of the characters returned. I also found myself annoyed at good characters becoming evil and vice versa. There comes a time where the zombie apocalypse must either be stopped for good or the zombies need to win. Sadly it is getting too predictable with this &#34;I thought it was all over but I was wrong bit.&#34; The ending, instead of making me want to see more only made me want to laugh at the absurdity.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book of the series is great.  I loved the characters.  I could hardly put the book down.  This book, this series is a must read!  I highly recommend the whole series.  I will be reading them all again but this has to be my favorite one.
B0091QS88K|1.0|Unfortunately I was not able to check this app out until I either subscribe to I or review it. Must not be good.
0452285186|5.0|i love the bunny and the theme, this book is really funny and sarcastic, i love it, i hope theres more to buy
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is fun and easy to play! the only problem is the prices to get new things and upgrade are really high, and it is hard to make money
B000HZEPAE|5.0|This movie i've been searching for awhile to find. its so funny like family guy or american dad cartoon adult shows. these puppet/doll actors look so real that you forget they not really people actors once your drawn into the movies.a great movie for movie night,just a little something different to lighten the mood. can't wait to get it on dvd. i accidently purchased it for online streaming but it still had to buy the actual dvd for my movie collection.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Wonderfully abstract movie packed with action.  Shipping was fast and movie was in perfect condition. If you're an action fan this is a must watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and I don't know what I'll do without it your great!!! This game is the best!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put these books down. I found myself  incompletely enthralled with the cast of characters. Collins masterfully places the reader in Panem. From there we are horrified , heartbroken, and even overjoyed alongside of Catness.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a very nice game I mean it doesn't deserve the the spot it has taken on the grosser. It is a game for children that like the colors and theme. On my V-Log and Blog I give it 9 rating on thing kids would probably bye millions of dollars on coins then parents would be Frustrated. So a 9.
0783225849|5.0|We first tried to buy a used Psycho, but unfortunately was in terrible condition. Ended up returning it, and going with this new copy. So glad we did! No scratches, case in great shape, and he loved the movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I decided that I love this game. It is awesome.you have to get this game. And if you have, you done your part.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Bought as a gift for my daughter's boyfriend.  Had heard it was a game that people who like to think would enjoy.  It met with our expectations!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|If you intend to utilize you Kindle Fire or Kindle Tablet for anything other than reading ebooks, this app is a must.  It installs easily and it allows you to read pdf files and take pdf files with you.  Love this app and it's a free app too.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Amazon's on demand and video library are just excellent! I ordered the Walking Dead series and it is always available as soon as the next day and the playback on my 1080p flat screen is just excellent!
B008C20TDG|5.0|This is the first &#34;diet&#34; book I have read in a long time that actually makes sense about what to eat and why eat it.  The explanations are clear and concise, well-written in a helpful tone, and actually fun to read. I was headed toward Paleo, due to digestive and skin issues, and this book made it abundantly clear why this type of diet is such a good choice.  After a month of following the eating plan, my digestive issues are greatly improved, and my skin looks better than ever.  I haven't lost much weight, but they tell you to throw away your scale and concern yourself more with being healthy.  I agree wholeheartedly with that, and highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to improve their diet.
B00005J9PB|2.0|I love this movie so much but I spent 14 dollars on a movie I cant even watch because of the darn region code. Granted I should have paid more attention to that but its very frustrating.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I was told that I had to be a baseball fan to grasp the fine details of this film, but after watching it I learned that that was not the case.<br /><br />While our main character played fantastically by Clint Eastwood is a baseball scout, the story revolves more around his relationship with his daughter, played achingly well by Amy Adams, after the loss of Eastwood's wife in the film.<br /><br />It is about the choices we make so that the ones we love most will have the best chance at success based upon our point of view at the time those choices are made.<br /><br />*spoiler alert* After a near miss with a child predator when Eastwood's daughter is very young and on the road with him while he's scouting the next great thing in baseball, Eastwood decides that it is better for his daughter to go live with her aunt and uncle, giving her stability and security.  The problem is that he never explained that to his daughter, he just left her with the aunt and uncle and headed out onto the road, thinking that somehow she'd come to magically understand why he had done what he'd done.<br /><br />Think about it for a minute.  How many times in our lives do we look back on the choices and actions of our parents and think to ourselves, WTF?  How could they have possibly done what they did if they'd had a clue?  However, life doesn't come with a hindsight manual that allows us a glimpse of the future to see how our choices will pan our for ourselves and our loved ones.<br /><br />That's what makes this story so meaningful. Regardless of what profession a parent is in, especially when they have lost their partner in life and the other parent to their children, every single choice and decision that the remaining parent makes becomes proportionately more important.  That kind of pressure and the desire to do the right thing can sometimes result in choices that the children wished their parents had never made, and that is what we see play out in this movie.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, Justin Timberlake delivers a very funny and heartfelt performance as the love interest for Adams and the quasi-protege to Eastwood and his character acts as a bridge between the two in the film.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is a phenomenal actor, delivering powerful performances time and again, and this movie is no different.  The ensemble cast is crisp and clean and John Goodman provides a great performance in the role of longtime friend and co-worker of Eastwood's character.<br /><br />This was a truly enjoyable movie from start to finish and I couldn't recommend it more highly.  If you want good story telling and a well crafted film, you'll find it here, and with the feel good twists and turns that some might call a bit predictable, it provides a very satisfying ending to the film.<br /><br />Pop some popcorn, make sure the beers are cold and have a few hot dogs at the ready and settle in for a real treat!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  its definently a time killer its also a really fun game I play it litterally all the time!!!!!!! So I definently recomend this app for anyone!!!
B0015LBYMQ|5.0|I am a HUGE John Mayer fan! For Christmas I got a record player and had old albums from my parents' time, but when I found out that Continuim was on vinyl I was so excited! Awesome record and I love the vintage feel I get when I listen to it!
B005ZUR724|5.0|High quality World of Warcraft clone for your tablet. Worth the money now that there isnt a sub. Its as close to a mobile warcraft as you can get.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this program.  From beginning to end the programs is so great in story line, acting, to the important message that is brought that times are changing.  How they change is what pulls in each week.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|My husband and I both watched this movie and really enjoyed it. The actors are wonderful and the scenery is beautiful. It also displays that am individual with Aspergers can be successful in a career and in personal relationships.
1607066017|5.0|Brian K. Vaughan has long been my favorite comics writer.  I was overjoyed to find out he was returning to comics with Saga.  Then I wondered if I was building it up too much in my head and was expecting too much.  Well, after reading the first collection of Saga I realize it doesn't matter what I think, BKV is amazing.  Saga is pure unfettered imagination.  A truly original idea book that can literally go anywhere.  He creates a world(s) that is easy to understand by frighteningly odd.  This was a such a strange book, but in a good way.  Fiona Staples does a phenomenal job of crafting a weirdly beautiful world of aliens, robots, and so much more.  Overall, this is a fantastic book in which one of the best writers in the world is just letting loose.  Great book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an excellent psycho-pathological study of two main characters and their toxic symbiotic relationship. The plot had several twists and though I did not like either of the main characters they were fascinating.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Dr. Seuss does it again.  Fabulous!  Both the animation and the story line are great for adults and children  Thumbs up!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|This book made me reflect on how ones character develops throughout life and the impact of relationships, hope and lies.
B007SXB498|3.0|Wasn't quite what my wife was thinking about when she ordered it but will try again. Actually she found out that she had the wrong author.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is deff way better then the first! completely addicted! download this app if you liked the first one cause you will love this one!
B0039P1O4O|4.0|good battery life, but wish it had auto shut off feature.  I plan to buy another for my other vehicle
B009CPJHY4|4.0|cute movie, loved the cast and characters; Judi Dench is a favorite as well as Maggie Smith, really loved her character.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Still learning, but so far it is super fun, and I am sure the kids will love it once I allow them to play it lol
B000UBJYTC|5.0|Robben Ford is the complete package on this record...great vocal performances, very good tunes and the always sublime playing of a true master of American blues guitar...&#34;Indianola&#34; is an absolutely stunning guitar instrumental on the level of &#34;Hideaway&#34; and is worth the price of the record...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it always left you wanting more.  Great book to read.<br />In some ways the book seemed too real. Write more
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Eerie, creepy sound effects will spook you. Challenging levels will test your skill. You might experience sadness when it is over because it leaves you craving for more.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Absolutely love this game. I've played it over and over and still enjoy playing the same levels, although I do look forward to the new ones as well. Challenging, yet not overwhelming.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love my angry birds no matter what it's called. Each game adds a new challenge to it. If you like angry birds, you love this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought that the 1st half of this book was borderline great - and then the 2nd half - which was good, just not as strong - it will definitly be interesting to see this translated to film - I recommend the book for those that like their &#34;suspense&#34; wrapped around a bit of &#34;mystery&#34; and &#34;drama&#34;
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I happened upon this game by chance and became addicted instantly to the challenging levels. If you like challenges, this is the game for you.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I LOVE LOVE anything written by Patricia Cornwell! She always keeps you on your toes! Especially with this book! !!
B003Y5H5C4|5.0|Really awesome movie with one of my favorite young actors. Funny in a sober kind of way right from the start to the finish.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My first game ap and still my favorite. I used to enjoy the arcade game with quarters - this is all the fun but without the loss of money. The prizes that get pushed along and special coins that drop make it addictive. I would run out of coins alloted, but found that you could &#34;sell&#34; the prizes for more coins which has kept me playing long into the night.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Really creepy sound effects, really creepy scenery. Good fun challenging game. Leaves you hoping there will be another sequel. Enjoy
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Colorful, challenging, fun and completely addictive. It is absolutely the best game I've found.....but there is one problem....I showed it to my husband and he won't give me my Kindle Fire back!  He keeps saying &#34;one more game&#34; - or &#34;I'll stop at 10:00&#34;. He is obsessed!!!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\".  It was so CREATIVE and a novel that is able to hold your interest from the first to the last page.  A book for readers from 12 to 80.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is one pf those apps you'll use everyday! I love that it has more than one alarm set in one day! Irecomend this app to everybody that uses an alarm clock!
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game. but it does get costly. would be.better. just to by the game. it is fun. I would buy it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Challenging, frustrating, but fun!  I love it!  Can't wait for other versions of it to become available.  And it's free!
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|It is peppy and musical. The lyrics are a bit wild in two songs. He will be a major star . He sounds a bit like Michael Jackson, SJM
B0091LS07E|5.0|The Girl is on Fire.I really enjoy the album by Alicia Keyes.  She is a great performer and singer. Great
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|It took me about 10 pages to get into the novel, but after that.....I loved it.  Flawed characters, tragic storyline, but written in a unique and very descriptive and punchy style.  I am now reading another of her novels.  Gillian Flynn definitely has her own style.  If you like murder mysteries with a difference, give it a go.  I couldn't put it down.
B007B5EDEG|2.0|Whilst, I am usually a fan of a series, I found this series very strange in content and construction.<br /><br />The books are written as much as is possible in time sequence. Personally I think that this is a mistake as the wide range of events makes it difficult for the reader to keep track of the detail. I am a simple soul, but I would prefer that one or two of the story lines were to go from start to finish in a single book. Perhaps these books could then be brought together in a final volume.<br /><br />I found it very frustrating to get to the end of a \\"book\\" and find that it was essentially just a random point along the way. Having read Books 1 through 5, I still have no idea where the overall story may finally go.  Again, in my opinion, the books have no start and end but are mere continuation of the previous. I can't see how anyone could read any of these books (by itself) and come away with a good read.<br /><br />A matter of opinion, but I found that the lengthy descriptions of landscape, meals, etc. was just filler that added nothing but bulk to the volumes.  I understand that life is more complicated than Novels but I did find the author's ability to suddenly kill off main characters without explanation, somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />On the good side, it is a massive story with many twists and turns.<br />Despite this I am unlikely to read the following two books unless some conclusion is promised.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Not at all what I expected , but once your hooked, Its a great must see Movie. It makes us remember what Love is all about and how some will go to the ends of the earth for it...:)
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Great voice and very catchy songs. I have really enjoyed listening to this artist. I would highly recommend this album.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to my friends. There were parts that made me cry and mostly was a good book with lots of funny moments.
0553328255|4.0|Decided to read some classics and start off with Sherlock Holmes.  It's interesting and a good read.  I would recommend this book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book I would have to say was one of the best books Rick Riordan has ever written!!!! But he left a huge cliffhanger.  I Can't wait t  read house of Hades.....
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I always love chess and this is convenient for when there is no one to play against.  I like that you can also play two players.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun for everyone from my 4 yr old grandson to my 35 yr old son...and even me!  Very addictive :-)
B008YCMM2A|5.0|I always get just a bit irritated when I see negative reviews based on sound quality. This is not a problem for me, unless it's and unexpected problem, or just so bad that it can not be denied.<br /><br />In this case Bootleg Vol 2 has more than acceptable sound. I have listened to the music several ways, in the car, on the home system and through the lap top as I'm doing now while writing this review.<br /><br />Admittedly I only have access to 5 tracks thus far, \\"Paraphernalia\\" \\"Footprints\\" \\"Nefertiti\\" \\"No Blues\\" and \\"Bitches Brew\\", I did take at least one from each disc to get a sense of the sound quality.<br /><br />If you were wondering why I only have 5 tracks? Well, I am still waiting for the, whom I thought was a good third party seller to actually ship the item, as of February 4th, still no sign of shipment or a non canned response from the third party seller about what's going on?<br /><br />I can tell you the recordings I have, sound stellar, sonically and performance wise. Any complaints about sound are asinine.<br /><br />These are Bootleg performances, they weren't specifically intended for commercial release, you do have to take into consideration the context of the recordings, No! they are not perfect. but the sound is full and rich enough to my ears not to take away from the music.<br /><br />By the way, I can't tell you how cool it is to hear \\"Nefertiti\\" and \\"Footprint\\" in this context.<br /><br />If you thought Miles was completely electrified and head long into rock, you are in for a real surprise. this music is electric post bop.<br /><br />Disc 3's music was recorded in November of 69! Brew would be released 5 months later.<br /><br /> I have reassessed what I thought Miles was doing at this time, This doesn't sound much Sly and the family Stone you know? I have the DVD that was in the Brew 40th Anniversary set, it was from 69 (different DVD than the one in this set,) and I was surprised at the style on that too, so I was anxious to get this music.<br /><br />This is high quality, bordering on avant garde post bop jazz, electric piano just happens to be involved in most of it, actually Corea is on fire here, he cuts through the mix wonderfully.<br /><br />If you are lunatic for Miles of any period like I am, or the post bop and beyond, you must own this music.<br /><br /> I can't wait until mine actually arrives. you can bet I will be on phone crying some myself to Amazon about having to purchase 5 dollars worth of downloads just to hear some of the music.<br /><br />UPDATE: Finally arrived, 10 days! That crazy, took third party seller 6 days to ship.<br /><br />I have watched the DVD 2 times, the sound is well above average, not perfect but very good. the picture is pretty good too, the camera work is so so, but not bad.<br /><br />The Performance:<br /><br />Well, Wayne sure can play a mean soprano, I am telling you, if your down with the funk side of Miles only, you may be disappointed with this set, the music throughout the whole package is really just an extension of Post Bop, Chick is amplified most of the time, but he is playing free jazz, really I'm not kidding.<br /><br /> Eric Dolphy's ghost would have sounded great with his slightly off kilter alto sound. oh man could you imagine Dolphy's Bass Clarinet on this? It's sad, I just thought, man where would Dolphy have went style wise? I wonder if he would have funked out?<br /><br />It is ironic, Miles was not a big fan of Cecil Taylor, or Eric Dolphy, but this music would make them proud.sic.<br /><br />This is high quality, bordering on avant garde post bop jazz, electric piano just happens to be involved in most of it, actually Corea is on fire here, he cuts through the mix wonderfully.<br /><br />If you are lunatic for Miles of any period like I am, or the post bop and beyond, you must own this music.<br /><br /> I can't wait until mine actually arrives. you can bet I will be on phone crying some myself to Amazon about having to purchase 5 dollars worth of downloads just to hear some of the music.<br /><br />UPDATE: Finally arrived, 10 days!

B000022TSY|5.0|Dennis Hopper directed this early film about the hippies. It accurately shows what actually happened sometimes when you let your \\"freak flag\\" fly, in the words of Jimi Hendrix, out there in square America in 1968.<br /><br />Two young guys (played by Hopper and Peter Fonda) score a big drug sale, so they head across the country with their cash, towards Florida, on motorcycles, but this is not a biker movie! It's about the hippie attitude, lifestyle, and its backlash.<br /><br />Along the way they pick up their alcoholic hitchhiker (Jack Nicholson) who is murdered one night in an attack by country bumpkin locals as the guys were sleeping in the woods. The survivors proceed to New Orleans for Mardi gras as planned, and encounter two hookers (notably Karen Black for one), get mind blowingly high, where Hopper shows outstanding camera work and creativity in this masterpiece. Afterwards, moving on, the boys are fatally hasseled by a couple more rednecks, where the movie ends.<br /><br />Easy Rider was filmed in many locations in the desert southwest and deep south, and the scenery almost steals the show. Many local folks were hand picked by Hopper to act in this film along the way. The sound track album was a big hit in 1969 as well.<br /><br />As a special feature, Dennis Hopper's running commentary on the film brings special insight to one of the finest, most colorful period flicks ever made.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|Love John Cusack, awesome love story, great chic flick. Love the anticipation to see if they ever get together or not
0792838068|4.0|This Oscar winner works on two main levels. The first is Cage's portrayal of an unapologetic drunk who realizes that he is trying to kill himself with alcohol. He won the Academy Award that year and deservedly so. The prostitution angle is even more gruesome.<br /><br />I can watch this movie over and over. It is not for the faint of heart. I love the Las Vegas emphasis. But Nicolas Cage is making the best performance of his long career, and I say 'Thank You' to him and the film makers. Cage vaults to the level of Al Pacino on this one.
0765325950|3.0|Its as if an artist was writing WOT and then it was finished by an engineer.  The story was technically complete but the beauty leaked out of the story.  I would have cut a hundred pages of this attack and that attack and forces moving forward and backward across the battle field and put in 100 pages of who, why things are happening and what they are thinking.<br /><br />I think I wish Jim Butcher had finished up the series.  He paints the canvas really well.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|There are two young men, Harold and his best friend Tyrone, who do nothing but dope. Their dream is the same as all the dopers in all the major dope movies;  Take a big buy, in this case 'one pound of prime' heroin and cut it and sell it and be 'Set For Life'. That is their goal, and they are on their way but when they get a little too big, in their naivete encounter some ultraviolent competitors who deal the boys a serious setback.<br /><br />At the same time that this is going on in the young peoples' existence, Hal's mother Sarah, a widow, has a dream of appearing on an infomercial TV show wearing her red dress and becoming a celebrity (which is shown in flash forwards) but she'll have to slim down a lot, and she finally turns to diet pills. Ironically, her son warns her that she is becoming addicted.<br /><br />Meanwhile once more, Harold's girlfriend, the lovely Marion, turns to prostitution at private parties as a means to get her hands on the drugs that she has become addicted to and are in very short supply, just like the scenario in that finest of drug- addiction movies &#34;Panic in Needle Park&#34;, c1973 ish.<br /><br />Harold and Ty set out for Florida to find a drug supply, hoping to sniff out a source, sight unseen, as last resort. But Hal has gotten blood poisoning from all the injections and Ty has to try to get medical attention for his friend.  They both end up in jail.<br /><br />Tyrone, a young black who is in a county jail in the deep south for being 'disrespectful', may have the only chance for recovery, if not for redemption, of all the players in this story written by Hubert Selby, Jr. (Last Exit to Brooklyn).

B009G78EE2|5.0|I can hardly find the words to describe this incredible album. I typically don't listen to hip-hop or rap, but damn was this the heist incredible! Every song was packed with beautiful lyrics, genius hooks, and just, i don't know, its amazing. Just do yourself a favor and buy it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This was right up there with the past great Clancy reads...and particularly relevant considering China's clandestine operations against our country.  Loved it!
B0053O89KG|5.0|I recommend watching this series in order, starting at episode 1 in order t fully appreciate the giant story arcs, character development, and humor that builds on previous show scenarios.  Castle is one of the best written and acted and directed series I have seen.  It is a complete joy to watch.  And for Firefly/Serenity fans, this show is a must since Nathan Fillion is basically acting his Mel character but on Earth, which is amazing to watch!<br /><br />This series continues to get better and better, and the end of season 4 finally delivers the completion to the biggest story arc in the entire series-- don't miss it!
B000F3UAFC|5.0|The DVD featured fabulous actresses, and I particularly loved the &#34;twist&#34; of the plot. Scenery is exquisite also. very enjoyable
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have now had this bag for 2 years, and it has been a fantastic upgrade from my much smaller, much older camera bag. I would recommend this to anyone. The only thing I am a bit confused by is the bungie cord on the front of the pack. I cannot for the life of me figure out if it has some constructive use that I dont know about or if it is decoration. Anyone know?
1250006341|5.0|Marvelous background information on the phenomenal English country house and the &#34;hierarchy&#34; inherent in upstairs and downstairs. Excellent companion to the series.

B00B2V66VS|1.0|This app was quite a disappointment. Yes, the graphics are good, but the app is confusing and hard to navigate. Stick to the original Temple Run.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Just as enchanting as when I read it as a child. I hope to read it with my grandchildren soon..
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This is a lovely story beautifully crafted for children of all ages, but particularly alluring for little girls. The message is clear and non-controversial, and the cinematic art is wonderful. Young girls (and probably older as well) will enjoy this take of sisterly love.
B00A77II0U|5.0|if you are into mystery games,  this is the game for you. A little scary with a twisted plot. the doll helps you throughout the game. Not to hard either
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|We loved him on American Idol for staying true to himself, and we love him on this album! His sound is unique and his range is impressive. He has a musicality all his own. Some of these songs may be hits, but all of them are great, and we look forward to following his growth, both as a rising star and as a musician.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great characters. Well written. It reminds me of I Am Legend- only better. I was hungry for some science fiction, this satiated my appetite.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|This soundtrack from the opening season of the show doesn't disappoint. It contains almost all of the songs, including the version of 'Juliette's' song sung by the young girls. I only wish it had a little more of 'Deakin's&#34; songs as well, but it's great. If you love the show, you'll love this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love  horses they are my favorite! I love to also ride horses I have a horse named sunshine! I love horses!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I lost sleep over this book. There were tears shed and curse words thrown at walls. There was also excitement and elation. Reading this book was like dating a jerk who's just sweet and sensitive enough to be manipulative. I'm almost angry about it. I want to rant about it but I don't want to spoil it for future readers. My only criticism is that the closing romantic couple act a too awkward. Maybe I'm just biased because I have different favorite couple from earlier in the book and they're a hard act to follow.
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|If you for some reason don't have the comics or trade paperback, get this. Its like they converted the exact comic into these movies. The perfect conversion of artwork and story. This is how comics should be made into movies.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed is that people who did not read this when it came out or maybe even been old enough to know about when Dr. Ruth would go onto Late Night with David Letterman might not get this.
B00243FQFA|5.0|What can I say; the most fun you can have with the magic of Science Fiction.  Make sure you purchase the full DVD box set of Stargate SG1 first.  Watching SG1 first will set you up for the storyline flow into  Stargate Atlantis.  I've owned both for quite sometime now, and always go back to get entertained with such great acting and story.  This is as close you can get to the actual possibility of the US Military involvement with extraterrestrials.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is so much fun,  It is really addictive and some of the levels can be quite challenging. Thumbs up!
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|It's hard to put into word to describe this beautiful movie. I was in aha and speechless. It is very graphic and not appropriate for all ages.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|Not at all what I expected.  You can be in the middle of a game and it cuts you off.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood hits a home run in this baseball story of an over the hill scout, versus a computer guided Talent evaluator. Maybe the old guy is not over the hill yet. Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake are also excellent.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Its slow starting out, but it picks up half-way through. It has a fairly obvious plot twist. Great for the occasional novel reader.
1475972350|5.0|Read the whole book in 1 night. Tired, but couldn't put it down. Great reading. Good character match up with the police. Can hardly wait for the next one to come out.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|this was a terrific book and very informative. being a woman, it gave a lot of information that i am not familiar with and did not understand, re: equipment, for example, but that did not take away anything from the book. i highly recommend it .
0345525558|4.0|I'm Latinoamerican. I liked the way the author show us the life of a person who conquers her fears and overcome her weaknesses. All of us see a reflection of ourselves in some degree, in it. And I enjoyed learning about the wonderful world of flowers and their impact upon people's feelings.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|i liked it, i only read it because i want to see the movie but i think its worth the money and of course it sucked me in
B000PC6Z48|1.0|I saw the rave reviews about DJANGO and wondered if the current DJANGO UNCHAINED was based on this film. Apparently, DJANGO caused such a stir in its day that the name was used in countless films having nothing to do with the original. I hadn't heard of this film and was ready for a spaghetti western. These campy spaghetti westerns were made famous by Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci. Filmed in Spain to mimic the old west with a cast of Italians and Spaniards along with possibly a famous American actor or two (as in Clint Eastwood), spaghetti westerns had a strong fan base.<br /><br />A young up and coming actor whose long Italian name was shortened to Franco Nero stars as Django. Nero was only 23 at the time and was made to look older. Famously handsome, Nero seemed like a great choice as mystery man Django. One line from the DVDs cover art, tells it all, Django is a mysterious man \\"dragging a coffin filled with chaos towards a destiny ruled by vengeance.\\" That description was as bad as the awful dubbing. The dialogue on this dubbed version was almost unbearable with voices that didn't seem to match the actor voices of actors like Franco Nero. Of course, that can be the fun of a spaghetti western so it can be overlooked.<br /><br />As Django drags his coffin, he comes across a woman about to be tortured and killed by a gang of Americans. Next come the Mexicans. Everyone is out to kill Maria, but why?<br />Back in the near ghost town, we are introduced to the dismal saloon and its band of currently unemployed prostitutes. The war between the Mexicans and the Americans have turned the hamlet into a ghost town. It all gets confusing figuring out which Americans are bad and which are worse and it is the same with the Mexicans. DJANGO is filled with constant brutality and violence. A particularly unnerving scene has an American \\"general\\" using Mexican peasants as target practice. Absolutely awful. Now the Mexican peasants are obviously not affiliated with the Mexicans on horseback who want to get back to Mexico to fight the Mexican soldiers..or something like that. DJANGO seems to be willing to befriend the Mexican bad guys but is out to destroy the American bad guys.<br /><br />If this sounds confusing, it certainly is. The story seems to be just thrown together to have a total as much violence as possible. It's amazing to read that this film is a classic. Apparently, it was never released theatrically in the US but was a huge hit in Europe. The film extras help with the history of DJANGO but it still doesn't save a bad movie from being so terrible.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I think the battery HD pro is fantastic. It tells you exactly what percentage your battery is, and also tells you the weather, time, how much usage WiFi, games and videos left. I'm really impressed and I'm glad I installed the app.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Really enjoyed the extras. This is a movie I will watch again and again. I would recommend this dvd to anyone.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Adds more than enough volume to any piece of  equipment you want. Personally, I use it to up the volume of my TV while I'm using my noisy treadmill. Even with a good set of headphones, I was having difficulty hearing until I hooked up this little amp. Very happy with this purchase. The only drawback would be that even though it's rechargeable, eventually it will have to be replaced, because the lithium batteries can't be removed.  Though the product manual claims  that the batteries can be recharged \\"hundreds of times\\". So it should still last  quite a while.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever you can build anything but when is the update coming out it needs a hunger bar and an infinite world.
0307346617|5.0|The book is written as a series of vignettes, which is probably why I loved it so much. It's also a cool look at the human element of a zombie outbreak, which a lot of zombie stories miss.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Great holiday movie. It just makes me happy when it's on even if I don't sit down and watch. I just like to hear it while I'm cleaning or wrapping gifts.

0316056898|4.0|It's funny, there is zero doubt. Anyone who posts and says it was boring, didn't go anywhere and wasn't funny should be electroshocked back into consciousness. It was beyond funny.    It didn't give me a definite feeling of 'inside' the world of SNL or 30 Rock. It does have some of that, but I begin to see how Tina is as full of crap as anyone else...keep reading that's not a put down. Now we all KNOW everyone is full of it on some level...and I'm just saying I begin to see her brand of that trait. This is NOT a criticism, it's an observation. She doesn't really open up, instead she does what she paid to do most of the time, be funny. Disappointed? Not in the least, I wanted to laugh, and jeez is she an absolute nuclear arsenal of funny, I laughed so hard at the coffee shop that they were threatening to eject me! I had to stop reading (my coffee was still warm.)    The end of the book, where she speaks about being a mother, I felt was a waste of time, if not a surprise. Tina uses comedy to protect herself, why should I expect a genuine description of her deepest feelings...and given without the whiney, false-self-criticisms and funny discourse as if she just walked out of an est meeting? I didn't and she doesn't. But that's OK, she famous and she's funny, nobody said she's without the same crap that the rest of us have buried deep down.    The book is hilarious.  She doesn't open up.  Did I mention that the book is hilarious?
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Great book to read, Great story.  Excellent bonus that it is available for free download.  Look forward to reading more.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I've been told over the years that I would love this band, but I never followed up.  I randomly started with this album, and I'm glad I did!  I really enjoyed the progression of the songs, and the themes are timeless and relevant.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|Great series.  The movie was better to watch only because it is faster to watch the story than to read it.  Happy ending for all.
1616550414|5.0|I am so happy that this finally came out. The timeline is exactly how I had pictured it. The extra artwork and design sketches make this a must have for any Legend of Zelda fan.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. Hope the movie is as good. Can't wait to see it. Love all of Sparks books.  Just can't wait for the next book.
0765325950|5.0|I'm really sad to see the series come to an end. I wish that Robert Jordan was still alive to witness it. The series is amazing through and through. It should be a staple in any fantasy readers library.

1400069289|4.0|Enjoyed reading it thoroughly. Couldnt put it down.. learnt alot! Loved the references. I even recommended it to my boss!
B00936A0ZW|5.0|I love this Album. I'm a fan of all things guitar and have been following PG for years and years. He is one of my favorite guitarists, not only for his amazing guitar chops, but for his absolute love for his art and his enthusiasm for spreading it around.<br /><br />If you listen to his lyrics in general, they are rather silly, and I was never a huge fan of his lyrical side, but on this album, his lyrics are just plain guffaw inducing.<br /><br />\\"Enemies\\" sounds like an ode to Batman. His happiness stems from \\"riding in a race car\\" (Batmobile) and putting his \\"bad, bad enemies in jail\\" (Joker, Penguin...etc). Awesome.<br /><br />\\"Vibrato\\" is one of my most favorite songs of all time. It is truly a funky ode to, well...all things funky. From the 70's keyboard riff and tone, to the silly, silly, lyrics. Something about not realizing it was nap time until he saw someone (Mom?) was standing at the door. And the whole time he's listening and practicing his Vibe-rat-toe. The multiple solo breaks in that song are absolutely incredible.<br /><br />Vibrato is just so much FUN to listen to. I've literally been listening to this album non-stop for two weeks now. There is so much for a huge fan of great music to listen to on this album. Fun, fresh and oh so Paul Gilbert.<br /><br />If you've never listened to Paul Gilbert before, and love really great guitar work, with soul, feel and some jazz and blues, pick this album up. I promise you won't be disappointed!
B002GTZSZU|5.0|I'll start off by stating that this is my favorite movie. Has been my whole life since I was a little kid. I for one love the directors cut. Bought it on DVD when it was first released in 2003, and then bought the two disc edition on Blu Ray when released. The directors cut adds a number of different angles that were never more than slightly hinted at in the theatrical cut, and without having seen the added footage it's not like it felt like you had just missed something because it ran together seamlessly. I for one enjoy those added elements, but I'm also someone who likes directors cuts. I can honestly see and understand though why some prefer the theatrical cut. It could be seen the added footage is just superfluous unnecessary  extra story. I Still think it adds something though. I do think they should make the theatrical cut available for those who prefer it.<br /><br />It's a wonderful yarn about Mozart's' time in Vienna. There is very little historical fact in it so just take it as a wonderful ride of intrigue. It's also a sensational introduction to Mozart's amazing music. You'll want to seek out more after the movie. It truly is my favorite and I recommend it to everyone I  know. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We are TV Series aficionados and very picky what we watch.  Looking through IMBD I came across this one looking for a new series and am I glad I did.  This is now our new favorite show, along with Breaking Bad, Dexter, Homeland, House of Lies and Revenge. Purchasing on Amazon Instant could not have been easier and I was very impressed with the HD quality (first time use of the service (have Netflix and may get rid of it).

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|If you are into adventure puzzle games, this one is for you.  Stunning graphics, great puzzles, just too bad I have to go to bed!  Otherwise I'd keep going with the game in one go...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice game.  There are a surprising number of things to see and do, it can become addictive.  It is too hard to acquire gems though. I don't like having to pay for playing or having to jump through hoops completing surveys that only lead to serious clutter in my e-mail.
0441013597|5.0|I have read Dune fifty times and i still could read it another 50 times. This novel can be read by people who don't even like science fiction at all. Hubert's fantastic vision of mans far future is so real and profound that it could actually happen. The Characters are just superb and so real you could touch them. The Movie by lynch based on the novel is nothing like the book, but i've seen that movie a 100 times because i really love the Dune novel series. This novel is about Man's ultimate destiny in the cosmos in relation to the many archtypes of humanities various beliefs and the apothosis of those beliefs, which is the perpetual survival of the human species. This is a novel to be read and cherished as a true monument to human creativity.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I've always liked doing puzzles. Now I can do one whenever I'd like.  I like that you can pick how many peices make up the puzzle. That's good for younger people.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The first season of this show was often clumsy with its unfamiliar characters, and usually focused too much on the zombie/horror aspect, which we had all seen too many times before to be much affected by ... In other words, because we didn't know much about these characters, we didn't care too much about their efforts; whether they survived or not was a matter mostly of indifference. The presentation was amazing, yes, but still, the show only showed promise; it was not a good product.<br /><br />Season two is different, an amazing experience. The characters are developed in such a way, and the zombie world portrayed in such a dramatic light, that it transcends the horror genre and becomes more theater than anything. Wonderful stuff, almost Shakespearean. Some of the best writing I have ever seen for television. Brilliant acting and direction, with a superb cast. The Rick versus Shane subplot is amazing for several reasons: 1st, the anti-hero is portrayed as being superficially right, but morally wrong, so that we are led to question which is the more valuable trait in this world, the survivalist instincts Shane possesses, or the conscience of a moral man, which Rick maintains. Rick (the moralist) is consistently wrong in his decisions, yet has the favor of the group, whereas the villain of the season becomes Shane, who has nonetheless acted more heroically than any of the others. Yet in the end, who lives and who dies in this new world, and why? A wonderful paradox unfolding, very engaging to watch. The romantic triangle between Rick, Shane, and Laurie is deep in a way that puts most other television writers' efforts to shame. You have the fact that Shane is responsible for saving Rick's family again and again; without him, he would have no reason to continue on. And you have the nature of Laurie's love, a continual question. Did she love Shane or only find comfort with him? And you have Shane's love, continually disregarded throughout both seasons (as Rick declaresto him at one pivotal point in the story, \\"You think you love Laurie, but you don't.\\" The viewer, meanwhile, is not so sure.) It could even be argued in the last two episodes that the anti-hero becomes the hero only to be killed by the hero turned anti-hero. In any case, it's a very thoughtful underpinning to the whole.<br /><br />I found other plot developments nearly as engaging: the vain efforts to find Sophia, the \\"judge, jury, and executioner\\" episode, where Rick is called on (again) to decide which is more important: the safety of the group, or the preservation of his humanity, and the whole hope issue in a world where civilization has vanished and mankind faces its \\"extinction event.\\" This last was toyed with in the final episodes of the first season, but not nearly so well as here.<br /><br />A beautiful scene unfolds in a deserted bar between Rick and another survivor that I found striking: it is impossible to tell who is acting rightly and who in the gray or the black, who the villain. Everyone and everything is mixed up here, heroes and villains, friends and enemies.<br /><br />Shane soon proceeds down a path to murder Rick ostensibly \\"for the good of the group\\" yet does not do so, placing his weapon back in his belt at one point and raising his arms. We are given the feeling that he may not be capable of murdering his friend outright. A great scene.<br /><br />Not anything to complain about here, other than I wish there was more of it. The Walking Dead seasons are too short.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|I found this bbok very hard to read for the first few chapters. So much happening and very fast. Then I got to a point that I just counldn't put it down. Every page that turned was a surprise waiting to happen. I had been told to read this book ages ago. Why did I wait so long??
0061148512|2.0|Don't be fooled; this is not a classic book, just as Plath was not a novelist. She was a poet, and an amazing one. But a storyteller? A dramatist? Not really. So this book is of interest only biographically, as it applies to her life (because it was based in part on her experiences).<br /><br />Substandard, and don't be afraid to admit it after finishing it, despite her reputation. She wanted to be a novelist as well as a poet, yes; and she tried -- this being her best effort. But she wasn't a novelist. This is pulp work, frequently derivative, usually trite, even banal ... A lot like her short stories.<br /><br />The artist in development, but not the artist developed.<br /><br />That is has become a \\"classic\\" is due less to the work itself than to the death of the author, which is sad. The book is about a suicider, and the author committed suicide after writing a landmark book of poetry, and so many in consequence label this effort a classic. But it isn't. One does not have a lot to do with the other, really. If she hadn't died as she did, would \\"The Bell Jar\\" ever have been considered required reading? No, of course not. Nothing in it that indicates it should -- except again, as I said, the biographical import.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Plath, a real fan, and so I would urge readers away from this attempt and towards her real masterwork: Ariel.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Toy Story is one of the best Disney movies of all time for children and it is also so enjoyable for the whole family. The Toy Story legacy continues with this 2nd movie and I think it was great. I would recommend this movie and the first and third one as well to anyone! So good!
0756405890|5.0|If you have any doubt about whether you will enjoy this book, let me clear it up for you. Read it. It's the best book I've read in quite a while. Typically, I hate comparing authors, but allow me to put this book in the perspective of some other great reads. It is every bit as good as: Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin (though, this book is of a different style), Blood Song by Anthony Ryan (you may not have heard of it, but this is a great read as well), The Riyria Revelations (series) by Michael J. Sullivan, the Sovereign of the Seven Isles series by David A. Wells, and Joe Abercrombie's First Law series. And it is in the same league (even though they are different genres) as the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher.<br /><br />Yeah. That's how good this book is.<br /><br />Why is it so good? Well, you don't want to put it down as the story just draws you in. Not all in a whoosh, either. More like sinking into a soft cushioned chair. Before you know it, hours have passed. But you don't care, because the story is engrossing. The characters are vibrant and have a great deal of depth. Rothfuss has a way of telling a story that is masterful. He describes things and events and you feel like you're right there watching it happen. You can almost smell the smoke and chemicals in the Artificiery, the mildew in the sewers under the University, the horses as the troupe gathers their wagons for the road. Not once in the story did I find myself thinking \\"what the hell was that?\\" or \\"Nonsense! That's just nonsense.\\" You're just there, with the characters, and you don't realize your reading a book anymore.<br /><br />Yup. It's that good. Really. Just read it already. I'm tired of typing and I'm downloading the next book. :)
0547884591|5.0|T4HC uses cooking as the wrap for Ferriss' substrate of his learning method, but even if you're not interested in that he packs in a TON of useful cooking information, even if it is tailored towards his 4-hour body diet (and probably is intended to sell through T4HB).  The book starts from scratch for someone who has never (or barely) cooked before, but still has plenty of interesting information for a more experienced home cook such as myself.  The section on good cooking gear was especially interesting, as well as the more narrative sections on Wild and Science (though still full of practicable info).  I'm especially looking forward to some of the molecular gastronomy presented in Science which has always fascinated me, and Ferriss makes it accessible.<br /><br />The book itself is beautiful with gorgeous photos, and as an avid Kindle reader, I'd really recommend picking this one up in hardcopy form.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Don't own a &#34;real&#34; Kindle and never thought I would want one, but I love having this app on my phone.  I always have something with me to read in those odd moments we all face in doctors' offices and other places we are forced to wait.  It's easy to use and handy.  I still like &#34;real&#34; books for much of the time, but this app is a winner.  Downloading books works like a charm, and if you can find the free offers for the kind of writing you like, it's amazing!

B009AVCAJ4|1.0|One of my all time favorite animes ever made, animation is top notch, story is compelling, all around a MUST SEE!!!<br /><br />HOWEVER!!....the blu-ray's movie sound track and sound FX are messed up, the voices are fine, but the sound track sounds like your under water, very hollowed and slightly echoey, and most def distracting...<br /><br />...I own the VHS and the sound is fine, so I imagine that it is a manufacturer mistake when mastering it to blu-ray, I am regretfully returning it and not getting a replacement as I feel the sound issue would be the same...BUMMER!!<br /><br />But catch the movie if you can!!<br /><br />**EDIT: I have recieved a replacement and the sound is still messed up...BUT only in the English dubbed version, the Japanese dialog and soundtrack/FX version, sounds perfect...BUMMER!! but I love the movie so I kept it anyways.

B005FISC52|5.0|One tree hill has been my favorite show for a very long time, but after the characters of Peyton and Lucas were no longer in the series, the show lost my interest, of I wanted to see how it ended but trully missed the way the series used to be.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a good game to the pass the time away. It can be a little hard put it is fun.
B004HW7JMY|3.0|It was a good show, but it was way to short and the price was too expensive for what you get.

B0032KNA4I|4.0|This movie was good but not great, its that kind of movie that you would watch maybe every other year.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I looked at a lot of the styluses on Amazon, and I talked to the cheapest people I know, who'd bought the cheapest styluses and had them break quickly.  This is cute - it is a smooth black &#34;pen&#34; shape, and it has a pad at each end, and, then, there is another pad inside, on the other end of the non-cap end.  There is a clip so you can clip it onto your Kindle cover (if you have o one).  I love it because now I can touch little small things and have a result. I am so glad that I chose this one.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|This is a very good scary movie that gives you the chills and completely gives you the scare you were looking for.
0345803485|2.0|Let me get something out of the way, first. One: Yes, I'm a guy. Two: I DID NOT read this book for the sex scenes and other erotica. Ok? Ok. Lets get to the review.<br /><br />The basic plot of this book is about a English Lit. student named Annastasia (or \\"Anna\\" as most people call her) having to interview a billionaire philanthropist named Christian Grey. Upon arrival, sexual tension from both people is instantly ignited and Anna can't help but be attracted to him. Anna is a shy girl whose never found her guy in life and Christian is a controlling, moody over-protective, billionaire who at first tries to hide his feelings for her.<br /><br />If this sounds like Twilight to you, then your suspision would be valid. E.L James based this book as a fan fiction for Twilight. If this book didnt have so many \\"Twilight\\" allusions in it, I'd be softer in the next part of my reivew.<br /><br />The character of Anna annoyed me to no end. The things she does and thinks is just a re-hash of the Bella character from Twilight. She's supposed to be 21 but she acts like an immature 14 year old. She constantly goes on about how inhumanly beautiful Christian is whenever she's in the same room with him. I havn't read many love stories to be honest but I'm sure going on about how she blushes and how her \\"inner goddess\\" is marveling at Christian's godlike body in every other line gets dry after awhile.<br /><br />The character of Christian is (you guessed it!) the Edward in this teenage girl fantasy of a book. Christian is an icy billionare whose secretly a BDSM fan and has a near distrubing degree of control-freak issues. He wants Anna to be his Submissive and wants her to be her Dominant. In short, he's a horny sex addict. Let's move on.<br /><br />Now for the sex. The first scene was ok as it was the first time the two sleep toghether. But the preceeding ones just get trashy and to some degree comical (and not in a good comical kind of way). I pretty much groaned everytime a sex scene came up because it was initiated in such a stupid way. I've read erotic fan fiction of my favorite video games online and those are written better in regards to story and sex.<br /><br />In summary, its a cheap Twilight knock-off with sex. I will give it one positive note. One of the things that annoyed me about the Twilight series was the abstinance metaphors throughout the movie. I mean Bella WANTED to lay Edward. At least in this version Anna and Chris (I like that name better)get it out of the way since the sexual tension initiated since they met.<br /><br />I guess Twilight fans will like this since its basically Twilight with.....well sex. But its not for me.e came up because it was initiated in such a stupid way.

B0042MEQVG|5.0|I do not have to say much about the Twilight Saga, everyone knows what a big deal it was from the books and movies.
1609611543|5.0|This book has a lot of great ideas about why and how to change your diet. What to get rid of that will help the waist shrink down.
B005Z28M58|5.0|There is nothing better than Desperate Housewives, This show keeps you on your feet.  So sad that it has come to an end.
B005721W9O|4.0|This movie never got the credit it deserved. Truly enjoyable for all, viewing it the second time gave me the chance to catch the quick wit action that I was laughing thru the first time. A must have for any movie library!
B0053O89JM|5.0|Hands down one of the best shows ever. I work in the medical field so this shows keeps my interest as all times. I have recommended this show to almost everyone I know and work with.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Suspenseful and great. It is just what you would expect from a Nicholas Sparks book but with a twist. I liked it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|great app no issues except freezing and lagging futkng use and download I haven't had issues I download full movies n shows n videos
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This was a great film.  A little sports for the guys,  with a love story for the girls that didn't over power the whole movie.  The acting was great, and Clint Eastwood is always fun to watch.
B007HM2ZAC|1.0|The record was delivered promptly and packaging was good.  However, the record itself did not play correctly.  The voices and music were distorted.  It was almost like the album had been set out in the sun too long.  Not sure what the problem is but after playing the album for less than 5 minutes, I am returning it.
B0027REDK2|5.0|I forgot how amazing this album was.  It is a masterpiece.  I got this after reading John Taylor's book.  I had not listened to Rio for 10 or 20 years.  Wow, this is Duran's high mark even though much of their later work is very good.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I'm a real fan of these two stars.  But this movie was terrible.  Couldn't even finish watching it.  It was PAINFUL and generally BORING.  If you're 75 years old, having sexual problems, you 'may' find some value in this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|update on ios how about on kindle! but besides that treat app broskys! continue to make this app and all buy it on all my devices!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|My son love it so we bought the full game package and the demo.  he recommends this game to his online friends.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Really funny. I watched it twice and would watch it again and I never say that about kids movies. My teenaged daughter loved it too :)
0547848412|2.0|I am fascinated by the author's skill and his brain, and wonder where he acquired so much knowledge about zoo animals. But I found the book unedifying, depressing, and misguided. It does a great job of showing the depravity of man and the uselessness of religion, but nothing to point anyone to salvation and a solution for the depravity. This boy was so obsessed with religion and God that he practiced Hinduism, Islam, and Catholicism all at the same time, but he spent all those months on a life boat living like an animal in order to survive, without once asking God to help him. He praised Krishna and Allah alternately for the fantastic natural phenomenon he saw, but he never got beyond recognizing the creational power of God to experiencing a personal relationship with the God of creation. It's a great picture of the difference between religion and relationship. Religion doesn't give salvation. The secret to that lies in Acts 4:12. I just found it so depressing to see such a likeable character - whether or not the animal story was entirely fiction - who wanted salvation so much and never asked for it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Second book, better than the first.  Def not disapointed!  The first book left me hanging and the second is even better...

B005EGXTL2|4.0|I also downloaded Mockingjay as soon as I'd finished book 2 on my Kindle. The series really pulled me in and now I understand why it has such a following.<br /><br />However, I enjoyed this book a little less than the first two. I think it was partly because there was a sense of hopelessness in this one, a feeling that Katniss had been defeated at times.<br /><br />Also, I felt I wanted more at the end (small spoiler coming...). In particular, I would have liked more details about the relationship. It just seemed to finish too quickly!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great sci-fi with gratuitous smart ass humor throughout.  Occasionally predictable, but often not; the character are all likeable and you want to know what everyone is up to next.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I loved the first book in the trilogy and downloaded this second one the instant I finished The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Catching Fire was another great book, a fantastic follow-on to book 1.
