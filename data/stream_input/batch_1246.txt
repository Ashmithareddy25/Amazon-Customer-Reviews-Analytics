B004RR5HQO|5.0|The second album is a very distinctive statement in the annals of rock history. Only a few bands ever reached this type of distinctive sound. Like all their albums their  diversity and originality have far surpassed almost everyone. A great  Great band. To bad they never covered a version of the song \\"Kites\\" By Simon DuPree:) A very scary ,Gothic , and beautifully expression of original music and sound @ the height of the progressive scene in England in the early 1970's

1451648537|5.0|Another excellent biography by Isaacson. Very well written, a real page-turner that completely captured my attention for almost two weeks, until I finished with a sensation of wanting for more. Not only it is a very well researched biography, but Mr. Isaacson had access to Mr. Jobs and his close circle of family and friends, his foes, and most importantly, without any Steve Jobs  interference or previous censorship in content.<br /><br />As the typical biography, the story is told chronologically, but alone the way you will learn much more than about Mr. Jobs personality, genius, his successes (Apple and Pixar) and failures (Next). The story also tells the evolution of the computer industry from the inception of the PCs with the Apple II, through the Mac, to the revolution brought by the iPod, iPhone and the iPad, and the lessons for corporate America.<br /><br />The book presents quite a paradoxical business case, in which great successes were based on fostering creativity and innovation, plus Jobs almost neurotic micromanagement and endless search for perfection, but against the book, achieved in a hostile environment due to Steve Jobs' mercurial personality, his tantrums and his selfish and arrogant attitude toward his partners, employees and competitors. I would not be surprise if this book becomes a mandatory reading for MBA students. It is one of a kind example of the key role and importance of a solid organizational culture that nurtures creativity and innovation, and cares about the quality of its products and the customer. Also it is an example of how you should not treat your employees.<br /><br />For those readers that enjoy biographies, I recommend Isaacson's [[ASIN:0743264746 Einstein: His Life and Universe]] and [[ASIN:B001LNOONO Benjamin Franklin: An American Life]]. For those interested in the business side of this biography, I recommend the following books that also deal about successful firms that are more centered on the customer than short term profit [[ASIN:1605292885 Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul]] and [[ASIN:1591843758 One Click: Jeff Bezos and the Rise of Amazon.com]]. And for a remarkable example of what happens when short term profit and financial reward are put as the main priorities instead of the product and the customers, do not miss Bob Lutz' [[ASIN:1591844002 Car Guys vs. Bean Counters: The Battle for the Soul of American Business]]. For those readers more interested in the development of the information technology industry, the IBM story as told in [[ASIN:0132755106 Making the World Work Better: The Ideas That Shaped a Century and a Company]] is an excellent complementary reading.

1932100660|5.0|This is the best book on nutrition I've read.  Written by experts in a clear and compelling manner.  It clearly shows that the best route to go if you want to extend your life is to eat a plant-based diet.  It should be required reading for everyone.
B004P8JPS6|2.0|I am a long-time Jack Reacher fan, so naturally when the advance word came out about \\"The Affair\\", I pre-ordered it in record time. I held off reading it until this week, while I was on vacation, anticipating this book would be perfect to make the air travel fly by...(sorry.) Now I must confess that my standards for this sort of story may be higher than most readers', as I am a current US Army CID Special Agent, former Army combat arms officer (left as a Major, just like Jack Reacher), and a retired civilian law enforcement officer. I had noted serious inaccuracies in most of those subject matter areas in Lee Child's previous Reacher novels, but since they didn't detract from the story too much, I let 'em go. Unfortunately, \\"The Affair\\" is almost entirely based on CID, Army, and law enforcement activities, and so the story was completely implausible. (I don't mean things like when Reacher beats up pairs, or squads of local miscreants...that's why Reacher is such a cool character!)<br />I won't detail the long list of nits which I picked. I just wish Lee Child would have done a lot more research, or perhaps had a real Army officer and/or CID Agent actually read the draft before it was submitted for publication. It would have greatly improved the story, at least for me!

B003UYUP6M|5.0|Google came into being with lofty and ambitious goals to dominate the Internet as an artificial intelligence company; to make the world a better place. The founders' Montessori naiveté and hubris led them to challenge preconceived notions and \\"authority\\" that would have otherwise halted global-scale ambitions. They would eventually persevere as one of the most disruptive and profitable companies the world has ever seen. Google went big -- and they succeeded, albeit with some well-publicized missteps in both China and social.  This book is the definitive story of that journey. It covers the very earliest days as a garage operation right through to 2011. Levy is masterful at capturing the awe and ire that the founders' impactful vision has imparted on the world. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking the true inside story of Google from within the Googleplex.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Completely enthralling. Morgenstern has a delicious attention to detail, great characters, lush imagery, and a beautiful voice. I couldn't stop reading, yet didn't want the story to end because I enjoyed it so much. Smaller characters, who many would see as mere accessories to plot, get developed enough to draw the reader in and make her feel like an accomplice chasing the circus. Think Cirque du Soleil times 8 million, then cubed. I can't wait to re-read this...and I'm not much of a re-reader.
0553801473|3.0|In the first books the main characters were clashing every other chapter. In the last two books the main characters only interact with secondary charaters. I enjoyed the book, but kept waiting for an interesting conflict or plot twist. I was dissapointed.

1439170916|5.0|This book has become a gift from me to many friends. Artfully written, masterfully didactic, vastly academic, broad in scope but detailed, a book for many shelves. Readers even marginally interested in the subject will find it powerful and impossible to put down. Those whose interest is more pointed will study the roots of our knowledge of cancer, the details which are unforgetable and a moving story of the personalities involved. Probably my personal reading of the year for 2011.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Season One and now have finished Season Two. All the characters from the first season are back as Downton experiences the horrors of the great war, is transformed into a hospital for the wounded, then regains its footing following the war, only to fall victim to the Spanish Flu. Loyalties are tested, loves are gained and lost.<br /><br />The settings, costumes and acting are superb, and I eagerly await the Christmas special.
B001F0WXY0|4.0|As a piece of science fiction, Dune deserves its place among the best.  Even beyond the sci-fi world this piece of literature ranks among the best books ever written, in my opinion.  Frank Herbert has created a time and place that, while so alien also seems very familiar.  He certainly immerses his readers in the world of Dune and in the politics that surround it.  It's too bad that Dune has been categorized as a science fiction novel.  While it most certainly is that it will also appeal to those interested in many other forms of fiction, especially those interested in political intrigue.<br /><br />That said the kindle version is rather dissapointing from the standpoint of all the editorial errors in it.  Misspelled words, missing spaces between words, etc.  At $15 for this e-book, which is way too expensive in my opinion, I expect a book that is professionally edited just like any other edition.  I think Amazon owes everyone who has purchased this edition a newly editted version that fixes all the problems in the original download.
1594202710|3.0|There is no doubt that Dr Kissinger is or was a skillful diplomat.  And this book is a great introduction from him to the history of Sino-American foreign policy.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading Dr Kesssiger's accounts of his dealings with Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin.  However, I can't help but observed that either the author has a romanticised view of the Chinese regime and its leaders or is censoring himself when writing this book for he knows the Chinese leadership will probably read it.    I appreciate the reality of foreign policy and that the advancement of national interests often carries with it unavoidable costs vis-a-vis morality and human suffering.  But I agree with the assessment of Chris Patten (the last British govenor of Hong Kong)that Dr Kessinger let Mao off the hook too easily on what he did to the Chinese people by launching the Great Leap Forward (afterall only 20-40 million people died) and the Cultural Revolution, just like the author let Deng off the hook for ordering the PLA to crush the protesters at Tiananmen.    As someone who is ethinc Chinese working and living in China, working alongside Mainland Chinese including mid to high ranking officials, I can assure you the Chinese people themselves (officials included) are far harsher in their assessment of their current and past leaders.  Like Dr Kissinger himself noted foreign policy does not exist in the vaccum of advancement of national interest, there has to be some underlying value system.  To me, that underlying value system means respect for human rights and dignity.  The Chinese are no different in their aspiration for human rights and dignity and it would be misguided for anyone (including the author) to side step that in their assessment of Chinese leadership.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I was hoping to be surprised and wound up delighted.  Tom Hanks and his friends have done a masterful job of looking at the entire space program from John Kennedy's iconic speech committing the nation to landing a man on the moon within a decade to the end of the manned moon exploration program.  Apollo 1 and Apollo 13 are put into context as was the the public's flagging interest in the Apollo program.  The courage of those who dared to fly into the great unknown, the tenacity of those who figured out how to bring the dream of reaching the moon to fruition, the great toll on wives and families, and the emergence of science in the testosterone charged environment of manned space flight all receive dignified, if sometimes painfully raw treatment.  Could more have been covered?  Certainly.  Could more have been covered in the same format?  Doubtful.  For those who want to learn more about this crowning achievement of the 20th Century or to revel in a great chapter in the American Experience, From the Earth to the Moon is a must see.  For my part, I will watch it again and again.

B0052U59F4|4.0|When I first downloaded the sample, I thought this book sounded a little juevenile; however, I was very, very  wrong.  This book is not typical of the books I read.  I love the possessive, jealous H and I really liked the innocent h as well.  The story starts slow and has you wondering at first -Why is the H buying tape and cable ties at the hardware store h works at, and why is the H seducing the h with his eyes while she roles up some rope for him?- then you get it when the H goes all D/s on her.  Their emails were entertaining and the sex scenes were smoking.  The BDSM was out of my comfort zone but it was well written and you definitely get a feel for what the h is going through.  This is the first book in a trilogy, so it leaves you wanting/needing to read the second book.  I like the way this author writes.
B005DZMODI|5.0|I own hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of CDs and this one is in the Top Ten easily. If I want to get some hard work done outside, I hook it up outside. If I a bummed out for any reason and want to move into hope I put this one on. If I feel like moving, with this CD I am suddenly moving out onto the street and catching a neighborhood line in New Orleans. I find myself smiling, shouting and clapping, all by myself. And to have Taj Mahal doing his thing in the middle of it all is like the best butter-cream icing over a rich chocolate cake. It is music very close to the heart of the Universe.
0811879542|5.0|I bought the book for my 3 year old granddaughter who had to be on a 10 hour plane ride and then live in a hotel for about a month.  It is absolutely the best thing for her because she can \\"be active\\" with it, yet still remain in the same restricted location.  Though it is not a board book, it is very sturdy and can withstand the pressing, shaking, rubbing, and tapping that it asks her to do. I was a little worried that she might find it boring as she is quite gifted; however, she always wants to read it and definitely loves the interaction that is provides.  The illustrations are very simple and childlike.  It would be the ideal gift for a young child that is hospitalized or in some other way physically restricted because it is so very entertaining. I could write all day and not come up with a bad thing to say about it!!!
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid might not seem like a movie to end up on the AFI top 100, never mind plunk in the middle at #50. Starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, we skip right over the hey dey of the group and dive right into when they are on the run. Butch and Sundance are rousted during a train robbery and soon a group of lawmen are on their heels. They're both in love with the same woman, Etta Place, so they grab her up and run down to Bolivia.  The scene with them bicycling around to \\"Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head\\" is a little hokey, but it helps to get across the idea that these gun slingers can be sweet in their off time and that they really do care about the girl. The \\"ba ba da\\" singing during a horse chase scene is a little more silly. I could have done without some of that music.  I love how things begin in \\"brown and white\\" - as if we're watching an ancient photograph - and then they slowly ease into a more lush view of the landscapes. This is an old story, but it's a real story, in landscapes we can visit today. Etta Place was a real woman that both men did care for.   Etta makes a sad proclamation before she heads off with the outlaws. \\"I'm 26, and I'm single, and a school teacher, and that's the bottom of the pit.\\" Even though this is the early 1900s, it's still thought that a woman who turns 26 is beyond hope if she's not married.  Of course, we know things didn't turn out well for this dynamic duo, but it's like watching Romeo and Juliet - the beauty is in watching the relationships unfold, the interplay between the characters, their tragic descent that is completely of their own making.   Well recommended.

0316010669|4.0|Years ago, Legendary NBA Coach (recently retired) Phil Jackson started handing out books to his players, to rectify any flaws or hone any mental aspects of the game in the offseason. If a player had a problem with his jumpshot or defense, that could be rectified in practice, but if a player had an overarching attitude problem, or consistency problem, maybe that would have to be rectified with reading, and contemplation. And so, as far back as the Chicago Bulls era, Phil was handing out what he thought were great books, each one suited for each unique player's game, personality and weaknesses.<br /><br />A few years ago, I remember hearing he gave \\"Blink\\" to Kobe Bryant. Kobe, more than anything, has been known for these insane last second buzzer beater shots. He's taken tons of them. And if you factor in all the shots he missed, frankly, his hit/miss ratio isn't even that good. As the leader and captain on the team, he keeps finding himself with the ball in his hands at the end of games, and usually, he can get a shot off. Phil knew that Kobe was under incredible pressure late in games, in moments where every millisecond counts, and that's why he gave Kobe this book. If Kobe could just stop thinking altogether, he'd know exactly what to do. What could you improve if you could switch off your mind in the clutch?<br /><br />This review is going to sound like a Coda to the Steve Jobs book from last week. It just turned out that way. Steve, time and time again, relied on his intuition, laying waste to months and months of work, design, coding, budgets etc. What is our Intuition, really, and why is it so damn smart (at some things), if our senses and hunches seem, at first, so vague?<br /><br />First, let's go back to early stages of Man's evolution. We know that at some point, we were moving around, we were mobile, and we probably travelled in packs and tribes. How did early Man communicate? I can only speculate that there were a lot of visual signals (pointing, imitating large animals, etc), sniffing, tasting, yelling, whimpering, and so on. In other words, even if you toss the spoken word completely, you're still left with 5 senses, and those can still be employed to communicate (as a modern analogue, pro sports works, as does Improv Theatre, as Gladwell highlights in the book). Just look at a baby: the baby doesn't know what's going on, but instinctually does certain things to get what she wants. She's communicating at primitive levels. And we humans, in the modern era, do a weird thing: We teach ourselves to talk, to read, to study. We even learn thousands of very specific words to describe the world around us. Many of us even learn multiple languages. But if you really think about it, from Shakespeare to Stephen King, writing, at its best, is attempting to describe indescribable things. Writing and speaking, are, by their very nature, bastardizations, muddled, rough, approximations of pure thought and feeling. Verbal and written communication is inherently unclear and abstracted. So where am I going with this? Body language and instinctive forms of communication are pure, and it's that `language' we have to relearn, if we want to read systems and situations holistically. There is holistic communication going on, whether we like or not, it's just a matter of understanding the signals.<br /><br />Kobe Bryant dribbling up the floor with 11 seconds on the clock, down by three, isn't thinking (we hope) logically, but watching the floor for the tiniest of gaps, perhaps even noticing which of the opposing players is breathing heavily, or limping slightly. Where is the weak point?<br /><br />Why do some electronics companies spend so much time trying to design beautiful packaging, that seems to cradle the device like a precious jewel? Ultimately the packaging is going to be thrown out, right? The answer is that more companies are realizing that the whole experience of using a product contributes to the `Customer Satisfaction Rating`and if you push up that rating high enough, you get a sense of what kind of high price you can charge. That's perceived value. Visual, auditory, olifactory (eg. New Car Smell); it's obvious that all senses contribute, but perhaps those senses about a product, about a person, about a situation, are the most important of all.<br /><br />Over and over again, we chastize ourselves for `judging' people who dress like hoodlums, or look a little rough around the edges, but ultimately, aren't we just battling our own inner intuition? When we sit down to lunch with our high school friends, and one of them is wearing a beautiful gold watch, we subconsciously attribute positive traits to him, suddenly our minds start turning: \\"How did he afford that?\\", \\"What did he say he did for a living? Something financial?\\" We intuitively know everything we need to know about this person in just a few seconds, as long as we ignore everything we think we know, and listen to what our senses are telling us. Yes it's tricky. It's tricky because people often lie to us to improve their outward image/appearance. Toss out the company line, read the body, and the truth is right there, staring you in the face.<br /><br />More Reviews like this on 21tigert a sense of what kind of high price you can charge.

B0057R5XRG|2.0|O.K., I don't think there is anyone on the planet that is as picky as I am when it comes to Blu-ray picture quality. When my \\"favorites\\" finally hit Blu-ray, I have a tendency to snatch them up due to the wait on coming to Blu. This set DOES NOT warrant investing in due to a poor quality picture. My \\"Park\\" regular DVDs are far better than this so-called Blu-ray rip-off. Don't these studios even remotely look at the final product before they release them? Or is it just the ever lovin' dollar and cashing in on sales from customers that have waited far too long for their faves? I tend to think it's the ever lovin' dollar. I would not recommend spending the $50 bucks on this crappy version. Hopefully these sets will gather dust on store shelves and the studios will get their act together and clean these titles up where they can truthfully be advertised as Blu-ray copies. Presently... NOT SO!

Isaacson does a masterful job of telling us of the man, warts and all, and educating us along the way of the history of so many of the most important  personal technologies developed in the last twenty years.  I loved this book and am deeply grateful that Steve Jobs commissioned Isaacson to write it.
B004NSULHM|4.0|After listening to \\"The King of Limbs,\\" the first time,  I was a bit disappointed. Mostly because there aren't a lot of songs on the album and because it doesn't seem to add any new wrinkles in Radiohead's ability to write and record music. There just wasn't anything new there. Then, after spending some time away from it I listened again. I was surprised to see that I enjoyed it a lot more. The album is an experience to listen to. It puts you in a specific frame of mind, and you have to listen closely to really appreciate it. Radiohead is blazing their own path and what I respect is that they don't seem to mind what the critics want, or the fans. They're doing what they want to do. The issue I have with the album is that there aren't more songs. I really wish they had put more on the record. While The King of Limbs may be one of the weaker entries in the Radiohead canon, it's still a lot better than most of the music out there today.

B00003CWL6|5.0|... if it weren't so very very sad. It's a film that rubs the intolerable emptiness and shame of our thwarted little lives in our faces, and then tries to wipe away our tears with a posthumous paean to the beauty we failed to appreciate while we were living. It's the hollowness of that paean that perturbs me. A millisecond of epiphany after two hours of grief! Ah. \\"What does it all mean?\\" Are the screenwriter and director being viciously ironic/sardonic or are we in Kansas after all, Toto?<br /><br />Six characters in search of an Author? Great ensemble acting, let's acknowledge immediately! Lester Burnham, our narrator, announces his death in a voice-over in the first minute of the film, and in a sense the plot becomes a \\"who'll do it\\", with every other character a candidate emotionally and with images of guns omnipresent. Lester is your seriously depressed 42-year-old male, who snaps. There's a hate-triangle in the Burnham household, of Lester, his frantic wife, and their 'emo' daughter. Then a second hate-triangle moves in next door, a ramrod Marine colonel, his catatonic wife, and their vampire son. Whoops, he's not a vampire, just an evolving sociopathic stoner, but this is a film that 'looks' like it should involve a vampire at some point. The Burnham daughter, a sullen Plain Jane, has a would-be Lolita best friend. That makes a septet of seven emotionally dischordant (sic) principals in a sexually a-tonal double fugue. Hey, is all that Hate really Love? The only people in the neighborhood who aren't emotionally dystonic are the two guys -- partners -- who live contentedly on the other side of the Burnham household. But the 'genius' of this film is that all these grotesque human miscreants are somehow pitifully plausible. But wow, I hope I'm not one of them!<br /><br />So who kills Lester? Of course I'm not going to tell! But really, the big question is 'why is Lester so happy being dead?'
B000002GAF|5.0|\\"Brother To Brother,\\" while not a huge commercial success, is legendary among musicians for its impeccable execution.  \\"I Just Wanna Stop\\" was a hit single for Vannelli but the remaining tracks are not nearly as well known, which is unfortunate.    \\"Brother To Brother\\" reflected the continuing evolution of Vannelli as his music transitioned from one genre to the next.  \\"Storm At Sunup\\" ('75) was jazz-inflected; \\"A Pauper In Paradise\\" ('77) contained tracks recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. \\"Brother To Brother\\" was a move to a fusion-like approach, but was still accessible to a broad audience.   Much like Donald Fagen and Walter Becker (Steely Dan), Gino assembled a hand-picked cast of top notch studio musicians to put together an impressive achievement of musical craftsmanship: Sax-Ernie Watts; Drums-(the late) Mark Craney; Guitar-Carlos Rios; Bass-Jimmy Haslip.  Not household names to most of the listening public, but all well known and highly regarded in the musical community.    My two personal favorite tracks from the album are the title track and \\"Feel Like Flying.\\"  The former is an all out musical extravaganza featuring lightening fast guitar, bass and drum solos.  It's a show-off piece, but is still greater than the sum of its parts.  Craney's drumming on the track is nothing short of amazing, in my opinion. (Gino took up the drums as a youngster and thus was particularly demanding when it came to selecting drummers for his albums.) \\"Feel Like Flying\\" showcases Haslip's tremendous abilities (he's played with the noted fusion band The Yellowjackets) and an energetic sax solo by Watts.   Gino Vannelli is a classic example of an extremely talented singer/songwriter/producer who has languished in relative obscurity while far inferior musical \\"artists\\" have ascended to the heights of fame.  \\"Brother To Brother\\" represents Gino at the top of his game.  This album should be in every music lover's collection.

Lou Reeds voice does not go with Metallica's instruments at ALL. tried listening to it twice before made my judgement. Not being a Lou listener before, I'm not sure if the man could ever sing but this was just bad. On top of that it's mix makes ST. Anger sound like a masterpiece. Metallica fans (and I am a huge one)please consider Anthrax's new album instead. [[ASIN:B0058VA2U4 Worship Music]]It is great  , best Album by anybody in years.

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus is wonderful work with rich language and an involving story which, if you let yourself be taken by it, will confound and entertain.  The style of the book is very reminiscent of Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strage while at the same time the work is easier to read and more accessible.  I can appreciate that it has certain aspects which some readers will not like:  short chapters set in different chronological dates of the story, a mysterious and slow approach at releasing parts of the back story.  For me these aspects of the book were not a problem.  In fact, it became very much a mystery and captured my interest.  Definitely one of the best books that I have read since the Cloud Atlas.

B005KMX866|5.0|Those who insinuate that Chris Isaak's age is negatively impacting his music can simply (and, most eloquently), blow it out their ears!   Beyond the Sun is a fabulous, fun collection of great songs sung in the style and manner in which they were meant to be sung. Chris's voice is smooth, strong and radiates the Isaak charm in every track. He adds his own style to each of the old standards while maintaining respect for the original versions. In fact, I would love to see a second release with Johnny Cash's \\"Folsom Prison Blues,\\" Ray Charles's \\"Hit the Road Jack/Can't Stop Loving You,\\" Connie Francis's \\"Who's Sorry Now?\\" and The Everly Brothers \\"Crying in the Rain.\\"  I truly believe Mr. Presley himself would be proud of Chris's version of \\"Can't Help Falling in Love.\\"  That beautiful ballad has been butchered by various performers throughout the years.  Chris however, sings it with his soul and returns to that love song the passion and conviction it first had when Elvis sang it.    Chris is pure class and I for one am grateful for this most recent album.  As I am driving, I will proudly crank up the volume and roll the windows down. Play on Chris! And, play on Scottie Pippen, whose name was unintentionally omitted from the CD liner notes.  \\"If music be the food of love, play on!\\"

1878424505|4.0|It is an interesting small book that was recommended to me.  It is non-religious and therefore I decided to purchase it.  Although somewhat trivial for the intellectual and philosophically interested, it is never a waist of time to reemphasize the good.  Yes, there is undoubtedly something positive to repetition.  The words the author uses to phrase his \\"teaching\\" of sorts are a bit like a mantra, using multiple scenarios and angels to drive home the very same point.  Altogether nice - I liked it.

B000ICL3CO|4.0|Suddenly, after years of recording and touring in relative obscurity while all the while gradually building a modest but fervently devoted fanbase, The Cure became one of the most universally recognizable of the truly alternative bands (at a time when \\"Alternative\\" meant \\"way out of the mainstream\\") with the format of MTV making them widely accessible to an American audience. This culminated in a nearly ubiquitous presence on MTV during 1987, after the release of their double-length recording \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\", through the almost incessant airplay granted to \\"Just Like Heaven\\" and \\"Why Can't I Be You?\\" While stylistically this release displayed even more range than their previous one (\\"Head On The Door\\"), it isn't nearly as cohesive, with a tendency to push intros on several tracks anywhere from one to four minutes. Nevertheless, there are some cuts on this CD that are superior to the ones found on \\"HOTD\\" in melody and arrangement.   Some critics had negative remarks for the cuts with extended intros found on this CD; for me, these are some of my favorite tracks. Raw and churning and aggressive, \\"Torture\\"'s heavy, thrumming bassline and percussive flourishes augment the conveyor-belt effect of Smith's guitar and Tolhurst's/Thompson's keyboards, making this probably the most insistent track on the CD. \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\", recorded in what sounds like an oriental key, features sitar and some heavily modulated, interlocking guitar work. Now take that heavy bassline and percussion from \\"Torture\\", make the tempo much more deliberative, add in a chiming, twinned, elastic, heavily-processed guitar line and run everything though a menacing echo, and you've got \\"The Snakepit\\".   Again, while lacking the coherence of \\"Head On The Door\\", there are several singles that easily equal the tracks found on that release, and at least two- the bouncy, airy, string-driven \\"Catch\\", with a gently percolating bassline and interspersed wah-wah fade-outs  that make it downright compelling , and \\"Just Like Heaven\\", a ruminative masterpiece driven by a somewhat fluidly aggressive hook created by a heavily percolating bass, insistent, thump-heavy drumwork,  and descending guitar riff companioned by sobering, pensive keyboard runs, which continues to be the band's defining song - are superior to anything found on \\"Head\\" at least IMHO. Arguments could also be made for the saucy, energetic \\"Why Can't I Be You?\\",  the effervescent, faux-funk workout, \\"Hot Hot Hot!\\", or the gorgeously wistful \\"One More Time\\".    A handful of tracks on this CD feel almost superfluous, and could have either benefitted from editing (the assaultive \\"The Kiss\\" seems to be nearly all intro), more development (\\"Like Cockatoos and \\"Icing Sugar\\") or a less by-the-numbers approach to composition (\\"The Perfect Girl\\"). Although a little excessive, it also contains some of their most dynamic songs, and it should be a must-have for novice listeners (though not for rabid completists, as in all likelihood they own it already). I can highly recommend it.
B004G81XBW|5.0|If you love the idea of the sci fi and also like action adventure movies but realize that 99% of everything that falls into these genres is formulaic, commercialized crap, then this is for you.  Don't be put off by the fact that this is all animation: none of those phoney Disney style characters here.  Incredibly imaginative and in depth story telling with stunning visuals that transport you into the worlds of the films.  This is actually a compilation of several shorts and each one is better than just about any sci fi film I've ever seen (including The Matrix, Bladerunner and any of the Star Wars movies).  Watching it a second time is almost better than the first because of the level of visual and narrative detail.  Not for children as there is some intense violence and mild sexual content, but these scenes are just part of the narrative and not the main attraction as in so many action movies.  Good stuff!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I've seen both Joe Bonamasa and Beth Hart in concert more than once.  Every single concert was an incredible experience.  These two separately pour their heart and soul into their music and together take it to a whole new level.  Most people have never heard of Beth Hart so I'm sure they were surprised at what they heard when they got \\"Don't Explain\\". As soon as I saw the title and who was singing and playing the guitar I knew I had to have this CD for my collection.  I am not disappointed.  It is awesome!  My only complaint is that I feel this CD showcases Beth Hart's vocals way more than it does Joe Bonamasa's incredible guitar playing.  I think Joe should have stepped to the front a little more.  I certainly hope these two do a follow up CD.  I'll definately buy it as well!
B003Y5H5C4|4.0|30 MINUTES OR LESS is the story of a slacker pizza delivery guy named Nick (Jesse Eisenberg), his best friend Chet (an elementary school teacher played by Aziz Ansari), and two buffoons (Danny McBride and Nick Swardson) who are plotting a murder in order to collect an inheritance. Nick is captured and wired with a bomb before being given 10 hours to rob a bank and turn over $100,000 dollars in order to save his life. Almost mirroring the story of real-life pizza delivery bank robber bomb victim Brian Wells, the movie is a mixed bag of laughs and duds.<br /><br />This is a movie that people will either enjoy or hate. I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed it when I came out of the theater. It's definite crude and lewd, with jokes sometimes racially motivated for example and some nudity. From the director of Zombieland, the visuals follow much the same path as Fleischer's previous effort, but what failed him was a poor script. The actors make up for a lot of that, giving their performances the gusto needed. McBride especially put forth a great performance as a misfit son who is tired of his father. For a story chock full of stupid characters, there are some great performances from these actors playing total idiots, from the bumbling would-be crooks to the pizza delivery boy who has trouble keeping up his boss' 30 minutes or less promise.<br /><br />One acting letdown for me, though, was Aziz Ansari. I love him as Tom Haverford in the amazing Parks and Recreation, but in this movie I couldn't find him believable in his role. There was something off to me, but his chemistry with the other actors makes up for this slight lapse.<br /><br />Fleischer definitely has the directing gift when it comes to these type of movies. Excellent car chases, a great eye for style, and amazing at pulling interesting, energetic performances from his cast. While it isn't as good as the amazing Zombieland, 30 Minutes or Less, is still a solid movie that fans of crude humor will enjoy. It's a definite summer movie that will appeal to teenage boys and young men, but even some girls could find this movie and its crude humor to be appealing.<br /><br />3.5/5e that will appeal to teenage boys and young men, but even some girls could find this movie and its crude humor to be appealing.  3.5/5
1423140591|5.0|This entry in Riordan's continuing series about young demi-gods is possibly the best entry so far. I won't rehash the plot other than to say this book takes us to the San Francisco Bay Area to Camp Jupiter(for those who know the Bay Area,it's roughly situated where Orinda is located)the training camp for the children of Roman Gods. Although the explanation of the dual nature of most of the Gods of Rome might be a bit confusing to some younger readers, the non-stop action certainly won't be. We are introduced to an entirely new cast of heroes, and Percy Jackson plays an integral part in the story. The plot line is logical and straightforward, and the human villain is obvious, which is more a positive than a negative, because the reader is continually wondering what he will try to do next to thwart the heroes' efforts. The next book should pick up precisely where this one leaves off, and where the main characters go and what they are to do next is clear. All in all, a great addition to this inventive series.

B00511PTWM|3.0|I use this in my 2003 Toyota Camry.  The adapter works and offers angle adjustments, however, I am unhappy with how it fits and with the adpter's instability as it gets knocked to the side very easily.<br /><br />The adapter's plug is too long, and the contacts on the side are visible when the plug is inserted in the power socket.  There is a ring directly above the plug that has treads and its position can be adjusted up or down the plug.  I guess the intention behind this ring was to adjust it so it sits flush with the outer edge of the power socket, but the plug is so long that even at the lowest setting the ring does not touch the socket.  There were no instructions included with the adapter, so I could only guess what the intent behind the ring was.<br /><br />The adapter is unstable.  Once I inserted two power plugs into the adapter's sockets, it became very top heavy and even at a slight touch it falls over to the right.<br /><br />I like that the adapter brought power sockets closer to the front of the console, and I like that the angle could be adjusted, but I do not like the fit and wobbliness.  If I had to replace this adapter, I would replace it with an adapter that has a shorter plug design even if it does not swivel.<br /><br />UPDATE.  I spent more time understanding the adapter and discovered that the ring's purpose is to drive wedges under the side contacts.  This changes how deep side contacts retract into the sides of the plug and make for a tighter or a looser fit into the socket.  I've learned that the ring can go lower than I thought it could because before was getting stuck on a small manufacturing artifact stuck in the tread.  Once I cleaned the tread, the ring was able to move lower.  At the lowest setting the plug cannot be inserted into the socket in my car at all - it is too tight.  At about half way the fit is reasonably tight, but the adapter is still unstable, because now it turns together with the outlet.<br /><br />UPDATE 2.  I stopped using it.  Too unstable, looks messy.  The idea is good, but the product did not perform as expected in my case.is good, but the product did not perform as expected in my case.

0670022950|5.0|Pinker tells us we may be living in the most peaceful ear of man's existence. This conclusion is substantiated via six trends, five 'inner demons,' four 'better angels,' and five historical forces.<br /><br />The first of the six trends took place over millennia, and consisted of the transition from the anarchy of hunting and gathering societies to agricultural civilizations with cities and governments some 5,000 years ago. That change brought a reduction in chronic raiding and feuding, and an approximate 5X decrease in violent death rates. The second spanned more than half a millennium (between the late Middle Ages and the 20th century), and brought a 10 - 50+X decrease in European homicide rates. The reduction is attributed to consolidation from a patchwork of small territories into large kingdoms and an infrastructure of commerce. The third transition took centuries and began in the 17th and 18th centuries via movements to abolish socially sanctioned violence like despotism, slavery, dueling, judicial torture, superstitious killing, sadistic punishment, along with the beginnings of pacifism. The fourth took place after WWII, with the great powers and developed states ceasing to wage war on each other. The fifth trend, though more tenuous, is based on the further decline of civil wars, genocides, autocratic government, and terrorist attacks since the end of the Cold War. Pinker's final trends consists of the growing revulsion against aggression on smaller scales, including violence against minorities (civil rights), women (women's rights), children (children's rights), and homosexuals (gay rights).<br /><br />The five inner demons include predatory violence deployed as a means to an end, dominance(urge for authority, prestige, glory, and power, revenge (retribution, punishment, and justice, sadism (pleasure in another's suffering), and ideology (shared belief system that justifies unlimited violence in pursuit of unlimited good). The four better angels are motives orienting away from violence and towards cooperation and altruism. These include empathy, self-control, moral sense, and reason (allows us to reflect on ways to better live our lives). The five historical forces are comprised of a state with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force, commerce providing a positive-sum game in which everybody can win and technological progress, feminization involves increasingly respecting the interests and values of women, cosmopolitan forces such as literacy, mobility, and mass media prompt people to take the perspective of those unlike themselves, and reason can bring people to recognize the futility of trying to boosting their own interests over others.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: 'The Better Angels of Our Nature' reaches a somewhat surprising, though well-documented, well-reasoned, and welcome conclusion.violence and towards cooperation and altruism.

B00005MP58|5.0|I have read the Jane Austin Books and I particularly enjoy this BBC version with Colin Firth. The costumes and acting are wonderful. Firth in particular does a great job (probably his most famous role until the King's Speech) as does Ehle. The supporting cast is also great (Mr Collins is played by David Bamber who also has a small part in the King's Speech).  My only personal issue is with the story : it just seems too convenient for most young woman's romantic fantasies to have the very rich male character also be the virtuous Mr. Right. No guarantee of that in real life... but that, after all, is a part of Jane Austen's material. The subtleties of Mr Darcy's character are very well portrayed by Colin Firth.
B001HN6922|1.0|As many parents here, I have a son who probably watched Cars a billion and one times. He watched it so much that I can repeat most of the lines in the movie. We anxiously awaited for Cars 2 and because my son has a noise sensitivity issue, we did not see the movie in the theater but waited until it was released on DVD. Thank goodness we rented it from Redbox and only paid a $1.00 to rent it. The movie was awful, it was boring, and it was completely inappropriate for a G rating. My son? Well, he seemed to have enjoyed it (isn't that what its about anyway?), but he hasn't asked to see it again, which I find very interesting for a 6 year old. Now I loved the first one, I even got teary eyed watching it, but my husband and I felt that it was like the folks at Pixar wanted to shut up the fans about a sequel, \\"here! Stop complaining! and don't ask for a 3rd!\\" Don't worry Pixar, not asking for a 3rd Cars movie. If you're curious about the movie, rent it from Redbox, and make your own assessment. I was highly disappointed.
B000002G30|5.0|Dopes To Infinity was released in 1995 and was the third full-length studio album from the Red Bank, New Jersey based rock/metal band Monster Magnet, the album is somewhat of a cult classic within the Stoner Rock genre and is very popular among Monster Magnet fans.<br /><br />Dopes To Infinity contains the single `Negasonic Teenage Warhead' and the popular tracks `Dead Christmas' and `Look To Your Orb For The Warning.'<br /><br />In every way, this is a strong album from the band. The lyrics, production, performances and songwriting are all just on top form, with Dave's Vocals in particular really coming in to their own. Stylistically, the album maintains some of the psychedelic touches of its predecessors but overall relies more on riffs and grooves.<br /><br />Highlights include the memorable `King Of Mars,' as well as the aforementioned `Negasonic Teenage Warhead' and `Look To Your Orb For The Warning,' all of which demonstrate what Monster Magnet were capable of when at their best.<br /><br />In summary, Dopes To Infinity is a strong, confident and well written album that contains a lot of classic material and is more than worth a place in any Stoner Rock collection. If you are a fan then hands down you need a copy of Dopes To Infinity and it is indeed a good record to pick up even if you are a prospective fan.
0393338827|5.0|First off, let me just say that Michael Lewis is one of my favorite non-fiction writers. To me, that's a tough genre for an author. I read a lot, and the major reason I focus on fiction is that it's so tough to find readable non-fiction. There are a few reliable guys, Lewis, Bob Woodward, Bill Bryson, Paul Theroux, and Tracy Kidder come to mind, but otherwise you run the risk of starting a really long tome on what may be a fantastic subject and discovering midway through that you'll never finish it. As I've aged, I've become more interested in books that I can attack and get through in a relatively short time frame, which means they must be well written and interesting. Lewis' books, like Moneyball, The New New Thing, and The Big Short, fit that profile.  I really liked the book. It basically tried to explain what happened in the financial melt-down of 2007-2008 through the perceptions and activities of three people who were participants in the financial sector at that time. I came away with a much better understanding of what caused the crisis. However, I did not necessarily develop a comprehensive knowledge of the financial transactions (CDOs, credit swaps, etc.) that were so key to the story. I don't think that was because I'm thick, it was more a matter that the subject was so complex that you almost have to be 'in the business' to even come close to understanding it. In fact, the complexity was a key factor in almost bringing down the financial world and causing the loss of trillions of dollars in net worth from Americans. I still find it hard to believe that such a limited number of people in the entire world even had an inkling about what was happening during that period.  So, the book was well-written and the subject was interesting and familiar to anyone who was affected (most people in the US, for example). Another thing I really liked was the fact that I learned a bit about how something works (in this case, Big Finance), which is always an enjoyable partof the reading or movie experience for me. As much as I like the action in the movie Casino, for example, the thing I really liked the most about it was the 'behind the scenes' stuff about how Las Vegas really works. Same thing here: I was able to get a view of how the major financial institutions and the people who work in them function. It wasn't pretty, and I can't say I'm more confident about my investments now.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I've seen millions of praises for The Perks, so I decided to read the book and make my own judgement. Wow, was all I could say. I read this book slowly, mostly because I didn't want to believe that it was coming closer to an end with each page I turn. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those books that makes you think. Every so often I would stop in the middle of reading and just think. It is truly amazing. It brings up subjects that aren't usually brought up. Sexuality, love, drugs, depression, suicide. Things that some people are too scared to talk about, but things that NEED to be talked about. You become emotionally attatched to cute and adorable Charlie. I have had this book on my Kindle for quite some time, and I have read it over and over. It also has song suggestions from Charlie himself in the book, and thanks to him I find myself adoring the Smiths more and more each day. Every night after reading this book, I would lie in bed and just think. Think about times where I felt infinite.  Read this book, and fall deeply in love with the characters. The only downfall is you will become emotionally attatched and you will hate when the book ends.

B0001E7LMU|5.0|I purchased this game only to find it was the German version, and was not terribly pleased at first with that fact. I had played it in the past, but it had been so long that I didn't feel comfortable trying to remember the rules from scratch. Thankfully, with a little searching online and the abundant images in the rules, it was easy to get going again. The cards themselves have very little text, none of which is language-specific.  The game plays in three rounds, each lasting between 5 and 15 minutes, assuming people are familiar with the rules. Each round, players have the opportunity to earn gold, and the player with the most gold after three rounds wins the game. Saboteur pits two teams against each other: the gold miners and the saboteurs. The most interesting mechanic in the game is that no one knows the alliance of any other person! All players place mine shaft cards next to tunnels that have already been placed. As the mine expands, players can break and repair each other's equipment to prevent each other from expanding the mine shaft.   The gold miners are attempting to build a continuous tunnel from the entrance (where the game begins) to three reward cards at the end of the board. The entire game is played in a grid, so the amount of cards between the entrance and the gold is pre-determined. The reward cards are hidden (although can be examined with special cards). Only one of these cards actually contains gold; the rest are worthless. As the miners attempt to reach the gold, the saboteurs that are playing attempt to stop them. As I mentioned earlier, the no one is quite sure which team other players are on, which causes players to be cautious in achieving their goals. After all, you don't want to sit out for multiple rounds because someone broke your pick axe, believing you to be a saboteur.  I've found this game to be incredibly fun to play at parties and especially around people who don't like a lot of more modern card games. Of course, you have to getpeople to agree in the first place to give it a try. The game is simple, fun, and rewards players who talk with each other. It also combines some elements that normally do not mix well: secrecy and teamwork. Because the gameplay is so simple, I found that even those who had never played anything beyond Monopoly were still more focused on strategy and figuring out which team other players were on than on actual rules; even the first time they played!  This remains one of my favorite games even after so much time invested into it. I highly recommend it!

0553573403|4.0|the book it self its awesome! pretty good story but the this Book size its smaller than what you will think is a small size book probably because is made for mass market I will recommend you to pay couple bucks more for the other type of book which is bigger if you like bigger books like i do. I'm referring to book size not content, the content still the same.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Sorry to all the fans out there but this book is not worth all the hype.  The writing wasn't bad (I liked her writing style) and the grammatical errors/typos didn't bother me much, but the storyline totally went downhill fast.  Everything was just too 'good', for lack of a better way to put it.  Travis has all sorts of money from fighting in a basement.  He has the 'cool' motorcycle, the nice apartment, etc. Abby has money to shop and pamper herself but has no job.   Also, what guy only has sex on the couch in an apartment he shares with his cousin.  If I was the cousin, I'd put a stop to that fast.  I'm not even going to get into the violence.  I guess what really turned me off the most was the scene in the club after both girls broke up with the boys.  How did they not notice Travis and Shepley ripping guys off the dance floor in order to threaten them behind a curtain? And all the girls who constantly act like idiots around Travis? Wow.  The story had lots of potential and I remained hopeful until they went to Vegas.  The book sank after that.  The epilogue was so...I can't even describe it.  I think it could be a fantastic book if some important things were fixed.  Until then, no, not at all.
B001HN6922|3.0|We did not go and see Cars 2 in the theater because the previews did not make it seem like it was worth the $40+ dollars that we would have to spend.  Went out on a limb and bought it the day it came out on video.  The kids enjoyed most of it, but missed seeing the old characters.  Don't get me wrong, they are all in the movie (except Hudson Hornet) - but you see so very little of them.  The new character are okay, but not favorites.  We liked the movie as it was a lot better we expected, but most definitely is not the same quality storyline as Pixar's other pictures - especially Cars 1.

B000MNP2K8|5.0|This is by far the best Bond film ever made. That's right, I said ever. I am a huge Bond fan and I always go into the films with high expectations and either have them met or I am disappointed. This is the first time that the film exceeded my expectations. It is eveything a Bond film should be - action, wit, drama, romance, great locations, clothes and cars. Daniel Craig is the best and I hope he is James Bond for many more movies.
0553584537|4.0|Reason for Reading: I am reading this series but started with book #3, since my sister had the first book it was the perfect opportunity to catch up with the series.<br /><br />Having read books 3-5 of this series it was a little strange going back to the first book as D.D. Warren is only a very minor character who is only introduced halfway through the book.  Obviously, this book did not start out to be the \\"D.D. Warren\\" series.  Instead the main character is Bobby Dodge, police sniper, who in the later books is D.D.'s partner.  Bobby is called out to an intense domestic scene where shots fired have been reported and he makes his first on the job kill.  The woman whose life he has saved turns out to be not only a woman in trouble but trouble herself.  Bobby is investigated by Internal Affairs to see if his shot was righteous but the dead man's affluent parents file a civil suit against him for murder.  While they also file against the widow for custody of the one grandchild whom they've accused of being mistreated by his mother.  Bobby gets wrapped up in the widow's life and finds himself embroiled in the middle of a complicated case where people close to the widow start to be violently killed off, one after another.<br /><br />A very intricate plot with plenty of different angles from which to switch back and forth.  The character of Bobby is given a complete background and since having read other books in the series it was interesting to get to know him so much better.  A compelling story that deals with multiple themes: police procedural, SWAT teams, serial killer, child kidnapping and murder for hire.  All these rolled into one make for an entertaining, detailed plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It was quite strange to find D.D. hardly fleshed out as a character though and it will be interesting to see how the second book plays out the situation so that D.D. becomes the star of the series by book 3, leaving Bobby as the second fiddle.  I would have enjoyed this even more if I hadn't read it out of order, something I try not to do too often with series.his even more if I hadn't read it out of order, something I try not to do too often with series.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|Ok. Let me begin telling you that I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan. I love the band and I love their work. That's why I decided to jump and get this boxset. I couldn't care less about (yet) another remaster but the prospect of getting the Quad, 5.1 and stereo mixes in 24/96 high resolution was astonishing.  The package contains, as we all know, 3 CDs, 2 DVDs and a Bluray.  Speaking of the CDs, well, what can I say?... the new remaster is good, not a quantum leap from the prevoius Sax remaster (1992) but at least Guthrie didn't ruin the sound. Fact of the matter is this album already sounded very well, and the previous remaster (Sax's) was really great so there was not enough room for improvement. CD2, with the live tracks, is really nice. Even when I already had the Wembley concerts as bootlegs, this production sounds pristine, clear and almost perfect. A great addition. The third CD (Disc 6) is a nice listen too, with the early mix and some songs from the abandoned Household objects project. Cool.  So, for the CDs, 5 stars. Period.  The BluRay. ASTONISHING. The video is interesting, but the real deal here are the audio tracks. They sound brilliant. To me, this BluRay is the definitive version of Dark Side of the Moon. I won't need to buy any other remaster, ever. The 24/96 files are amazing.  5 stars for the BluRay also.  Now we begin to go down. 2 DVD. Their content is the same that we can finf on the Bluray. Ok, it's nice for those who don't have a BluRay player, but... 2 repeated versions of the audio tracks on one DVD? Only difference is one is more comppresed than the other. The video DVD has the same stuff than the BluRay also. Redundant, but well suited for people who doesn't have a BD player, again. The fact that they could have provided different versions (3 CDs + BD or 3 CDs + 2 DVDs) lowering the price is what makes me to put only 3 stars to the DVDs. Redundant and price-bulking only.  Now the rest...  Ok. Scarf, marbles, coasters... all crap. Disposable and useless. Nothing more than Storm Thorgerson's self-inflated \\"artistic\\" ideas of what Pink Floyd fans might like. The guy seems to think that we PF fans are also his fans. He is wrong. If I could put 0 stars on this useless crap, I would. 1 star for the \\"collectibles\\".  Memorabilia: useless. 1 star.  Books: Well crafted coffee-table books. Nice pictures but absolutely no liner notes and/or \\"behind the scenes\\" stories by any member of the band. Just OK. 2 stars.  Packaging: Ok, here EMI, PF and Storm forgot that the most important thing on this set is THE MUSIC. Not the marbles, not the scarf, BUT THE MUSIC. How'd they dare to put 4 of the discs in the bottom of the box, unprotected and so easy to dislodge??. Of course all the crap was above the discs, and well protected. But the discs tend to dislodge and swim freely in the bottom of the box, getting scratched. Well done Storm!! 1 star for packaging.  Considering I paid a lot of money for this box as a whole, I will rate it as a whole. Great music with lots of useless crap in lousy packaging. Just 3 stars. Music is 5 stars, all the rest is not.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I have been using this weather app for a few months now and hands down it is the best one out there.

B005IZLPMY|3.0|I thought that Joe Johnston was a good pick to direct Captain America. He's made two movies that I'm quite fond of that are full of action, scares and laughs ([[ASIN:B00003CXXS Jurassic Park III]] and [[ASIN:B000031EGV Jumanji]]), so I figured that with Johnston at the helm for Captain America, we might be in for more of the same. The trailer for Captain America sure made it seem like at least the action would be there, but ultimately I found Captain America to be very slow-moving and the weakest entry among the movies that have been introducing us to next year's Avengers.<br /><br />I admit that I had a preconceived notion about Captain America way before the pre-Avengers movies even started to get made, and my preconceived notion was that Captain America was outdated and quite frankly boring. That was until sometime back in 2008 when I read all 800 pages combined of Mark Millar's epic collections of [[ASIN:0785110828 The Ultimates]] & [[ASIN:0785121382 The Ultimates 2]]. Those books were nothing short of amazing, and those books introduced me to the Marvel gang in a whole new light, especially Captain America (and [[ASIN:B0034G4P8A Thor]]). Thor quickly became one of my favorite Marvel characters after reading Millar's books, and similarly I gained an entirely new respect for Captain America because of Millar's books. The integrity of Millar's delivery of Captain America is somewhat still in place with Johnston's Captain America; there's just something about Johnston's that made him into more of a campy, corny kind of character that left me unsatisfied by the end of the film.<br /><br />Captain America is a bizarro period piece mostly set in the early 40s that documents Captain America's making and rise. So I think that the campy, corny part of his personality that Johnston instilled was deliberate and meant to suggest it was sort of the natural disposition of a lot of people back then. But for me it just came across as rather droll. Surprisingly, with a cast that includes some other greats like Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving, you'd think that the drollness might be made up for by stellar acting. But if you ask me, those guys are gravely underused in Captain America.<br /><br />Look, if you want to see the birth of Captain America and keep the continuity of the introduction of the Avengers prior to next year's Avengers blockbuster, I certainly don't recommend skipping Captain America. But if you want to read a MUCH better story with Captain America in a key role read Millar's books.includes some other greats like Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving, you'd think that the drollness might be made up for by stellar acting.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|Seriously, I can't believe how bad this movie was.  I stuck up for Cameron with Titanic, which I thought had some redeeming qualities, and I loved his underwater documentaries, The Abyss, Terminator, and Terminator 2.  With Avatar, alas, no dice.  This movie was visually impressive, but still fake looking to me.  The plot was horrendous.  The dialogue pathetic.  I had high expectation and figured even worst case scenario, it would be entertaining and look cool.  Visually, it was decent, but that alone was not enough to keep me from bashing my forehead into the movie seat in front of me.  Have we advanced so little in movie writing that the best we can do is copy Dances with Wolves and Return of the Jedi (ewok war)?  Should have been called Dances with Smurfs.  Waterworld and Battlefield Earth are both worth watching more than this dreadful flick.  When Cameron takes the time to actually craft a decent story and dialogue to go along with special effects, he delivers.  This movie does not.  I wouldn't even pay a few dollars to rent it and watch it again.

B000068FUM|2.0|I'm a longtime fan of a couple of Jayhawks albums, one being \\"Hollywood Town Hall.\\"  I think a girlfriend may have had \\"Tomorrow the Green Grass\\" back in the day, so I recently purchased it used on Amazon to try to reconnect with some lost tunes.  I was disappointed.    This album sounds like leftovers and outtakes from \\"Hollywood Town Hall.\\"  The production is the same- it even sounds like Gary played with the same guitars and amps.  \\"Tomorrow the Green Grass\\" does nothing different, except IMO have less memorable songs.  Aesthetically here in 2011, listening back to this 1993 (?- or thereabouts) release, one is struck by its straightforwardness.  There is no trace of irony to be found- no blending of genres a la Wilco, no use of sounds or gadgetry.  This is pure, 1990s throwback roots rock, as if playing the same country licks on every song (albiet, playing them quite well) was sufficient to make a lasting musical statement.  I write this just to get my opinion out there, not to suggest whether or not others would agree with me, or want to buy the album.  Sorry if I offend.  I would love to hear what these guys are up to now, and whether they've evolved and tried to implement more creative sounds and textures.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Before watching this movie, I had already read the book and knew the story. However, let me say this: the movie is better than the book. The movie takes the basic premise of the book, and turns it into an action thriller.   Basic premise: Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives in Berlin for a biotechnology conference. As he and his wife Liz(January Jones) arrive at their hotel, Harris suddenly remembers that he accidentally left his suitcase at the airport. He jumps into a taxi driven by Gina (Kruger), but gets into an accident as the car crashes off a bridge and into the water. Gina saves him from drowning, and harris wakes up in the hospital with no recollection of what happened. He returns to the hotel to visit Liz, but finds her with another man who also claims to be Dr. Martin Harris. Liz does not recognize him, and Dr. Martin Harris is struggling to prove his identity to others and stop the impostor with her. Soon enough, Harris is chased by a killer, puts the lives of those around him in danger, and has to escape before it's too late.   At the crux of this movie is an Agatha Christie-type mystery. As both Martin harris and the viewers, struggle to figure out what is going on. The movie has some good chase scenes, and is filmed pretty vividly. Unlike the book, where Harris kind of goes from place to place trying to get some information (he visits the police station, stands outside of Liz's apartment building, goes to the American embassy, and is generally a passive character for three fourths of the book), the movie Martin Harris is much more interesting and active. Another interesting difference is that in the book the events take place in France, while in the movie events take place in Germany. Overall, though, this is a good action flick.
0439023521|4.0|This is quite a book. There are things I don't care for about it - the present tense, for example - but that doesn't matter much. Collins knows how to connect with readers. She does so quickly, pulls you right in, makes you care, and then starts upping the stakes chapter by chapter. Really well done.   I'm skeptical of people that claim to have found it predictable. Bit of hindsight that is, I imagine. A big part of what I liked about the book was that it was full of surprises. I never knew just what was going to happen, and that not knowing kept me turning the pages.
0385534639|5.0|This is one of my new favorite books. I loved ALL of the characters, especially Celia and Marco. The writing was so vivid that I could actually vision the circus and the people in it. I want to go the Le Cirque des Reves, smell the smells, see the black and white motif, the bonfire, and the clock. Just reading about it, I could envision myself spending days there. There is just so much excitement in the book. I could not put the book down because I had to see who would come out the victor, how they would do it, and what would happen to each other. I loved that it was romance with fantasy entwined (my favorite)!  There wasn't anything inappropriate or confusing. Even the flashbacks/flashfowards were great! LOVE THIS BOOK!

B004LWZW7E|4.0|this is a movie that i don't think too many people know about, because it wasn't well advertised. it's a shame, really, because the story is appealing and different. although it is set in the future, it has elements that we can all relate to. Will salas(justin timberlake) is a poor but tough guy from the ghetto with a good heart. the currency needed to survive is \\"time.\\" the wealthy have plenty of time and live relatively stress free, but live meaningless lives. the poor, like Will salas, have hardly enough time to survive the day, and as a result, must make the most of every minute they have. through a set of unusual circumstances, Will inherits a great deal of \\"time.\\" the police are called \\"timekeepers.\\" they are determined to arrest Will, thinking that he took his extra time by illegal means. Will gets out of town as quickly as possible, and the timekeepers are hot on his trail. eventually, Will makes it to a wealthier neighborhood(called zones). it is here that he meets a wealthy banker with a beautiful daughter, sylvia(amanda seyfried). unfortunately, it is shortly after he meets sylvia that the timekeepers catch up with him. in order to get away, he takes sylvia hostage, and makes tracks back to the ghetto where he grew up. during their time on the run, Will and sylvia develop a close relationship that sets them on a path that keeps them constantly on the run while they improve the lives of as many people as possible. .... without giving the rest of the story away, i would agree with what chris kennison wrote about elements of \\"robin hood\\", \\"bonnie and clyde\\", and \\"logan's run\\" in this movie. the one other element that i noticed was the famous alfred hitchcock premise of using the innocent man being chased by the cops, and plenty of other people for a crime he didn't commit. this movie was fun to watch, and a lot better than i anticipated, since it didn't get much publicity.

Extra points for how quick the developer answered a question I had about widgets right after install, less than 6 hours!

1451627289|4.0|I have a feeling that if Stephen King were to lose both of his arms and legs in a terrible accident, he would find a way to type using his nose. This man needs to write like most of us need to breathe. What's intereting is that he started out as a genre writer tapping into the most primal fears of the American public. Over time he has developed into one of the most gifted writers of our time, a man whose memory of a past world is so clear and vivid that it's nearly as frightening as the monsters in his books.   King has left behind the standard horror genre for many years now, some could even trace it back to just after he recovered from being hit by a car. Something shifted in him and his writing as never been better.  I personally don't like to read massive plot summaries in reviews, there are plenty of other places to get that information. So, I will keep this simple. This book is a massive time travel epic involving an attempt to prevent JFK from being killed by Lee Harvey Oswald. That King makes all of this seem plausible is a testament to his wonderful gifts as a storyteller.   In a book this big there would have to be a lot of filler right? Wrong. Writers take note - whether you like horror books or not, pick up several King books and read them, especially some of the larger ones like \\"Under The Dome,\\" or even \\"It\\" and watch how a talented novelists plots a book. 1,000 pages never seemed so small.   The writing doesn't draw attention to itself, rather it creates a very clear sense of time and place and allows the reader passage there. Maybe that's why the whole time travel plot didn't feel far fetched, because King's writing iteself is something of a time travel device transporting us back to the early 1960's.  Stephen King is a man who doesn't stop. I'm grateful for that.

B005HPY8LU|5.0|Kelly Clarkson's best in years, 5 stars!  This may very well be Kelly's most complete album in her entire career. Any Clarkson fan of any kind or anyone who has enjoyed one of her previous albums will love this!  \\"Thankful\\" her debut, was filled with a bountiful of ballads, she wrote very little.  \\"Breakaway\\" was her Grammy-winning, career-maker, and rock-oriented sophomore..she wrote about half the songs.  \\"My December\\" was a dark entry to her collection of albums, and one of her most personal. She wrote EVERY song.  \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" was a pop-infected, mainstream release. She wrote about half of it.  Now, her current album, \\"Stronger\\" combines elements from all of its four previous: dark, twisted tracks, pop-dance hooks, semi-ballads and sure hits. The only thing not here is that perfect love song or ballad, but we all know Kelly's long past that(and besides, her voice sounds so great when shes in pain and strained, not to be selfish)!  We all know hat shes struggled with artistic control throughout her musical career, and \\"Stronger\\" is an indeed strong record that, for one of the first times, sounds like it comes straight from HER...the CD contains that extra push of personal.  \\"Stronger\\" contains a strong variety and stretches the boundaries to all different types and genres:  First off, every track has that classic Kelly Clarkson sound;  they overall sound like that [acoustic and electric guitar, drums and bass, breake-up anthem, and of course, her amzing vocals].  Of course, and as usual, the album's main theme is, well, break-up and moving on. Thus, \\"Stronger\\" is a chock-full of kiss offs; her lead single \\"Mr. Know It All,\\" her confirmed second single, \\"What Doesnt Kill You (Stronger),\\" \\"Einstein,\\" and others.  Suffering and heart break; includes \\"Honestly,\\" \\"You Love Me\\" \\"War Is Over,\\" and \\"Dark Side.\\"  In-and-outs, include: \\"I Forgive You,\\" \\"Hello\\"and \\"Standing In Front of You.\\"  Anti-Love Stories, \\"Breaking Your Own Heart,\\" \\"Let Me Down, \\" etc.  I believe the only downside is that the songs, while sounding like classic Kelly, often overlap into each other...they sound too similar. Therefore, I recomend listening to this album in chunks. However, each track is a gem, showcasing the kind of things shes been made of throughout her career. The only other song missing is that love story, but that hardly matters; we we all know how good pain sounds in Clarkson's voice.  (Grade: A+)

B0057Q83SS|5.0|First of all I have to state that this review is for the Tenth Anniversary Edition of Iowa, not the standard edition. I have no idea why Amazon believes that the Tenth Anniversary Edition of Slipknot's self-titled LP deserves its own review page and Iowa doesn't, but until/if it gets one my review will remain here.  The first disk is just Iowa with the New Abuse Mix of My Plague that was on the Resident Evil soundtrack, which is basically a clean (and cleaned up) radio friendly version of My Plague.  Disk two is the audio from the live performance on the [[ASIN:B00007BHOE Slipknot - Disasterpieces]]. Personally this is something I've wanted for years... but I'm not stupid. If I wanted it bad enough I could have just ripped the audio from the DVD. It's nice to have and I'm glad to have it, but I have a feeling that most people who wanted it have the audio already.  The third disk (DVD) is called \\"Goat\\" and is a documentary of sorts about the tour in support of Iowa with commentary from some of the band about the making of Iowa along with all of the videos made for the album.      -For those familiar with Clown's previous Slipknot docs you'll know what I'm talking about when I say that it's less a documentary on the tour than it is just random, non cohesive video snippets from live shows, video shoots and backstage thrown together. It fails to inform, but for someone like me who is/was a huge fan of the band at this time it does entertain.   -Some of the interviews are more informative than others. Sid, Jim, and Mick share a little info about pressures the band faced at the time, their input as well as the influence Paul Gray had on the album while the band's hype machines Corey and Joey talk Iowa up as being the heaviest and darkest album of all time.   -During the interviews the band appear obscured by shadows, which to me is tribute to a time when the band said that they would never \\"pull a Kiss\\" and appear or perform without their masks... at that time (prior to appearing unmasked in various side projects) if they were filmed unmasked their faces were either blurred out completely or obscured in some way. Of course to most people doing this is probably laughable now, considering they have since performed/been in videos, etc. unmasked, but take it how you will.   -The saddest thing to me is that Paul Gray passed away months before the interviews were filmed. Iowa was Paul and Joey's baby, and the majority of the songs on the album (not including songs like Iowa which already existed in another form) were written by them before any of the other members even stepped foot into the studio. It would've been nice to hear his take on the album considering the massive effort he put into Iowa, and the fact that he was much more grounded and less inclined to hype things up than the other members.  If you have Iowa and Disasterpieces you'll find little new here, and if you're on a budget you might be better off passing on this.
B004RKXN44|5.0|Oh, how I dreaded reading the last book available in this series and having to wait until 2012 for another...but I couldn't leave Hawke and Sienna sitting on my Kindle unread anymore. I just couldn't wait to read their story, to wonder what wonderful thing Hawke was going to say next. He has been a favorite of mine since the first book. I love the way he is the heart of his pack. And while he still hates Psy, he has the ability to understand that not all Psy are the same, calling Sascha Sascha Darling. When he says \\"baby\\" in this book, I curled my toes and I got all warmed up...it was simply the best book I have read in 2011.<br /><br />Hawke is the alpha of the pack SnowDancer. Has been the alpha since the age of 15, when tragic events made him take on the mantle. Sienna is a 19-year-old Psy defector, who is also a Cardinal with starry eyes. Her skill though is the rare X that very few people actually know what it is. Not even Sienna knows the full extent of her powers, but she knows she can decimate the pack, the state and maybe even a continent if she can't control herself. These two have danced around each other through the entire series, but we needed to wait until Sienna was old enough to take on an alpha like Hawke. But Sienna never had a childhood, so growing up wasn't something she really had to do.<br /><br />Hawke knows there is a deep attraction between them, but he keeps avoiding it knowing he won't be able to give Sienna the mating bond she wants and deserves. At a young age, he found the child that someday would grow into the woman who would be his mate. Dying at the age of five, Hawke hasn't forgotten her and often talks to her at her grave. Even though he can't give her the mating bond she so deserves, he must come to terms with the deep passion he feels for Sienna. His struggle early on is deciding that he needs her despite not being able to give her what she needs. His wolf is close to the service and he either needs to find fun between the sheets with another wolf or give his heart to Sienna.<br /><br />Sienna is such a complex character. Her young life was spent being trained under Ming, a Psy Counselor. Ming intended to make her his private weapon, making her do horrible things just to survive. She never had the childhood that most changelings had, so this makes her even more grown up that her age says she is. While very mature, at times she did fall back to the personality fitting for the age.<br /><br />On the Psy front, they are now at war. Councilors are picking sides and alliances which are turning deadly very quickly. Pure Psy is taking on fanatic tendencies, stock piling weapons in hopes of taking down the DarkRiver, SnowDancer, Nikita and Anthony lands. The central theme under the book is that war is coming, and they plan to fight.<br /><br />The sexual tension in this book is so strong, you could have seen it even if you weren't Changeling. There are a lot of near misses on getting it on. In fact at times this went on too many times. One pet peeve I had was that you would have a scene, like them dancing in the forest and then it was over. You didn't see how they parted ways or feel the tension in the car when they drove back. There were a lot of scenes that just ended and went onto the next day not giving me an entire picture. Now I know if she had written in completions to each scene the book would have been big, but there were times I felt let down when you didn't see the tension continue.<br /><br />When Hawke and Sienna do come together I thought my Kindle would melt. It was so sweet, hard, enticing, lusty, hot, sweaty, orgasmic, high in the sky sex, that I thought I would need a cold shower to calm down. Nalini Singh knows how to write the most incredible love scenes.<br /><br />On the series...I like all the books, but lately the last few books have left me wanting more and not quite up to what I expected. The Psy part of the story didn't move forward much until this book, but still there is tons I wanted to know, or have move forward. Stories without Changelings just didn't do it for me. They were ok, just not the strong mating bond kind of love I wanted to see. I think that is why I put off reading Play of Passion and Kiss Of Snow for a month. I just didn't want the series to come to an end where I had to wait and because I just wasn't interested in books 7 and 8. I still want to know more about Kaleb. Being so mysterious, I almost want him to fall in love with a Changeling just so I can see his story. I was happy to read more in between the lines on Nikita. Nothing was outright said, but I feel she has emotions she is trying to hide at all costs. Really hoping that there is more Psy in the next books to explain the war that is taking place.<br /><br />Don't let me forget to tell  you about the side romance in this book. Walker and Lara. Walker is Sienna's uncle and the patriarch in the family. He of course spent more time in Silence than the other Laurens, but we learn he understood family and took care of them. Such a strong character that you respected and wanted to find love for. Lara is the healer in the pack and while not a lieutenant, she is high up on the hierarchy. The two both feel passion, deny it, find it again, deny it, and finally figure out they were made for each other.<br /><br />Kiss of Snow delivers on so many levels through love, sex, war, family love, and friendship. I highly recommend you read this series, but if you don't want to start there, this can be read alone, you just might have a hard time understanding some of the friendships and Psy story.ings just didn't do it for me.

1451627289|5.0|In Lisbon Falls, Maine, Al Templeton, owner of Al's Diner, discovers a temporal portal that enables a traveler to go back fifty-three years to September 9, 1958 at 11:58 a.m.  Each time a person enters the time hole, they go to that same moment, but no matter how long they remain in the past, they return to the present having lost only two minutes while history is altered.<br /><br />High school English teacher Jake Epping tests Jake's theory, but when he returns he finds his previously healthy friend dying from lung cancer and admitting he has gone back in time trying to prevent the JFK assassination.  With no family to speak of, a lonely Jake agrees to complete Al's mission though he assumes Oswald did not work alone.  Jake tests the concept by intervening in the family of a night student of his who faced a tragedy back in 1958.  He soon learns history prefers to return to the original reality though he tries to prevent 11/22/63 from happening.<br /><br />This is an engaging time travel thriller in which Stephen King makes a strong case that Oswald worked alone, a key element in the plot for conspiracy believer Jake to accept.  The story line is action-packed with the changes in history such as cigarette smoking attitudes cleverly devised.  Part of the fun is debating the possibility of the changes being reasonable as Mr. King provides an entertaining tale.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

0307949494|4.0|\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" sounds more like a kung-fu movie than a Swedish thriller.<br /><br />But a Swedish thriller it is. And while posthumous debuts rarely get the attention they deserve -- or any attention, really -- the first novel of the late Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium trilogy starts slow, and slowly winds itself up into a tight knot of unique mystery and thriller elements. Just give it a few chapters to unfold.<br /><br />Take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from an executive named Wennerstr&ouml;m. Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger, to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece. She vanished forty years ago from the family's isolated island, and her body -- alive or dead -- was never found.<br /><br />It's a pretty cold case, and not a very inviting one. But when Vanger offers Mikael rewards he cannot refuse -- evidence on the villainous Wennerstr&ouml;m -- he finds himself facing the bizarre, sinister Vanger family with few leads to go on. Then he meets Lisbeth Salander, an eccentric, abused computer hacker who serves as his counterpoint. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried.<br />Posthumous debuts are a rarity -- publishers always want a series, sequels, publicity signings, and books headed by \\"By the Author Of...\\" You don't get any of that if the person is dead. So it's a sign of how amazing \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is that Larsson's uniquely mystery-thriller is receiving such attention across the world.<br /><br />And Larsson's book is a unique blend of old and new -- he takes the Agatha Christie aesthetic of a locked-room murder with a dozen suspects, and enfolds it in a ruthless look at modern Swedish society and the study of sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"<br /><br />And though his prose is rather bleak and often quite gritty, a certain brand of understated passion shines through Larsson's thriller story. It's the kind that feels the need to express itself even though it takes place in fiction. The only problem with the book is that Larsson pays undue attention to the whole Mikael-against-the-exec story. Not interesting, compared to the mystery.<br /><br />But Mikael and Salander make an intriguing odd couple -- he's so world-weary and demoralized that he seems to care about nothing, while Salander is a mass of hurts and quirks -- while she sometimes seems cartoonish, she's also a vibrant little character with enough strength and power to lash back at attackers. The supporting characters are far darker fare, including a loopy Nazi weirdo.<br /><br />Take the works of Agatha Christie and smother them in a disillusioned, morally-bankrupt noir world -- and you'll have something like \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\" A hard read, but leaves you wondering what the next two books have in store.it's the missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"   And though his prose is rather bleak and often quite gritty, a certain brand of understated passion shines through Larsson's thriller story.

B0054YIQK8|5.0|This film production of Carmen was first seen by this reviewer back in the mid 1980s. I am not much of an opera \\"go-er\\" but I was very familiar with the opera's music.  My interest in seeing the opera was greatly piqued when I saw a small portion of this film back when it was released.  I had walked into the once famed Tower Records on Sunset Blvd. (south side) where they were spinning the then-new Laser Disc (LD) edition of Rosi's ambitious production. I saw about 15 minutes and it was very engaging. Unfortunately, this LD edition was very expensive.  It would be the only time I would get to see the film until I bought this new American-market Blu-ray edition wherein the film is finally presented in its original aspect ratio of 1:1.85.<br /><br />So, here is it at last and boy is the imaging gorgeous and the audio is superb. Carmen looks and sounds like it was filmed not in 1984 but last year. Filmed on locations around Spain makes Bizet's work a visual feast as well as an aural experience. It makes me wonder just how many other filmed operas would get and hold my attention if they were produced this way rather than on a stage. Recommended!
B005HV6Y84|4.0|There is only thing about the Twilight movies that I actually like -- the soundtracks.<br /><br />Overall, the soundtracks for these movies have been excellent, with some truly sublime songs by talented artists. And I don't have a lot to complain about with the \\"Breaking Dawn Part 1\\" soundtrack, which continues the tradition. A few of the choices are headscratchers (Bruno Mars? Really?) but the majority weave a delicate, bittersweet atmosphere over some very enjoyable pop tunes.<br /><br />It kicks off with The Joy Formidable's \\"Endtapes,\\" which is a pretty solid way to begin the album -- it's a sprightly song that seems to swing between marchlike beats and swirling pop melodies. Then we have Angus & Julia Stone's \\"Love Will Take You,\\" a wistful, mellow little folk-pop song that lifts you up and cradles you in a silken wash of violin.<br /><br />That feeling is carried over through most of the songs -- we have sorrowful, romantic piano ballads by Sleeping At Last, Aqualung & Lucy Schwartz, Mia Maestro and Iron & Wine;  the thumping smoky defiance of Belle Brigade's \\"I Didn't Mean It\\"; the gentle soaring acoustic guitars of Christina Perri and Imperial Mammoth; and the tinkling prettiness of Cider Sky's \\"Northern Lights.\\"<br /><br />But there were a few songs that stuck out like sore thumbs. Bruno Mars' \\"It Will Rain\\" just drips with over-the-top drama, and it feels clumsy compared to the subtler songs that surround it. Also, Theophilus London's \\"Neighbors\\" is... a rap. That REALLY doesn't fit with the other songs. Whose idea was that?<br /><br />However, the rest of the album feels oddly cohesive, despite being made by several different artists. There are misty layers of gentle piano and satiny strings, a rougher undercurrent of earthy acoustic guitar, and a sprinkling of starlit synth blips that pop up here and there. Occasionally you get a more robust, boisterous pop melody, keeping the album from getting monotonous -- the Features and the Noisettes particularly.<br /><br />And it has a very distinct atmosphere as well -- the songs seem to drift between bittersweet contemplation and romantic coziness, reflecting on the loss of love as well as how wonderful it can feel. One song can charm you with its romantic exuberance (\\"Northern Lights\\") and the very next can break your heart... and some manage to do both at the same time (Iron & Wine's contribution).<br /><br />I don't expect \\"Breaking Dawn Part 1\\" to be any better than the other Twilight movies, but it's undeniable that the soundtrack is exquisite, if flawed. Ignore Mars and Theophilus London, and this soundtrack ends up sublime.the songs seem to drift between bittersweet contemplation and romantic coziness, reflecting on the loss of love as well as how wonderful it can feel.

1451627289|5.0|The grandmaster of storytelling, the Dickens of modern times is back with another top read. He's back with no Here's Johnny! but certainly here's Lee Oswald! a brutal husband and a father.  The stage is set the focal time 22nd November 1963, enter the main protagonist Jake Epping soon to be known as George Amberson down the Alice in Wonderland Rabbit Hole, the mission to rewrite history. What Jake undertakes has deeper impact on himself than he could wish.  I got the feel from this novel that the 1960's was a lovely era a feel of innocence in the air, boys with flattop crew cuts, girls with ponytails and shin length poodle skirts. Jitterbugging and lindyhopping. There is fully flavored Root beer and Catcher in The Rye was banned from school libraries.  Jack travels to 1958 and starts his new life with taking up the position of an English teacher in a school that he finds he really loves teaching at and meets people that are to change his future. For a man who has in the past hardly shed a tear he is to learn many new emotions and he can't quite understand how to deal with those responsible for them, in the course of preventing the Kennedy assassination he finds himself with a few obstacles. He also tries to undo another history of a friend from his present one of the murderous kind. Feel immersed and enjoy a heart warming story of humanness.  The beauty and skill of Stephen Kings writing is he brings to the table ordinary individuals and pitches them against adversity, some are triumphant others not. The age old battle of good versus evil he does so well, the master conjurer of nightmares, the writer of redemption and darkness of the heart. He writes the character driven story well and don't think he's lost his swagger as he has plenty of steam in his tank and proves it year by year. This is not a king novel in the way as The Shining was a horror novel but is a King novel in that he writes so well with the darkness of heart as a key player. He keeps turning out goodstories. Its a hard market the short story category but King always seems to revive the art of Short story telling. Full Dark No Stars by King done so well in 2010 and this year I am sure 11.22.63 as a novel is to lead as the best of 2011.    \\"If you ever wanted to change the world, this is your chance. Save Kennedy, save his brother. Save Martin Luther King. Stop the race riots. Stop Vietnam, maybe' he leaned forward. 'Get rid of one wretched waif, buddy and you could save millions of lives.\\"    \\"Money comes back. It stays no matter how many times you use the rabbit-hole.\\"    \\"life turns on a dime, and when it does, it turns fast.\\"    \\"The Cullums were at one end of the seesaw; the Oswalds were at the other. And Jake Epping, also known as George Amberson? He was the tipping point.\\"    \\"there's an old saying: peek not through a knothole, lest ye be vexed.

B004TPJMXI|5.0|While some good directors never quite \\"get it,\\" it took Guillermo Del Toro only one misfire -- the icky, slow-paced \\"Blade 2\\" -- to get the whole comic-book adaptation thing right.<br /><br />In fact, just about everything is right with \\"Hellboy\\" -- Del Toro crafted an action blockbuster with a grimy, slimy cult-movie feel and a quirky sense of humor. It's graced with excellent acting, spectacular action scenes, and the trappings of clockpunk and Lovecraftian horror -- not to mention that it stars a six-foot-tall scarlet demon with a soft spot for kittens.<br /><br />In 1944, young Professor Broom accompanied an army regiment to a remote Scottish island, where the Nazis -- led by Rasputin -- were about to open a portal to another world, and allow the vast tentacled Ogru Jahad (Seven Gods of Chaos) to enter our world. Rasputin and the Nazis were destroyed, but something came through the portal -- a baby demon, whom Broom names Hellboy.<br /><br />Fast-forward sixty years -- a grown Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his fishy friend Abe (Doug Jones) are working at a paranormal government agency that specializes in policing the supernatural, with the weirded-out Agent Myers (Rupert Evans) just joining the team. Soon afterwards, Hellboy is called on to kill Sammael the Hellhound -- but it turns out that Sammael can replicate himself indefinitely.<br /><br />As Hellboy and his team try to hunt down the remaining Sammaels, the dying Professor Broom (John Hurt) finds that a revived Rasputin and his immortal Nazi followers have orchestrated all this. And Rasputin is continuing to pull the strings behind the scenes -- including using Hellboy's love Liz (Selma Blair), a depressed pyrokinetic. And when Hellboy suffers a devastating loss, his journey will take him right back to his roots -- and the potential destruction of the world.<br /><br />Watching \\"Hellboy,\\" it's easy to see how Guillermo Del Toro because world-famous for the exquisitely dark \\"Pan's Labyrinth,\\" and why he's been chosen to direct the forthcoming \\"Hobbit\\" movies. This adaptation could have just been another paint-by-numbers comic-book story, but Del Toro gives it the kind of grime, quirk, brains and heart that a lasting cult movie should have.<br /><br />Part of that cult appeal is \\"Hellboy's\\" distinctive look, with Lovecraftian tentacle-gods and some steampunky details. And the action scenes are pretty spectacular -- trains, slimy hellhounds, sword-swinging Nazis with chopped-up faces, giant clock cogs, and a fiery explosion in a mental asylum. And there are some truly spectacular action scenes in a vast underground labyrinth, full of ancient hammers and collapsing bridges. There's just enough action and grossness, without going overboard.<br /><br />But Del Toro is able to balance out the action with some truly touching moments, such as the aged Broom's final scenes in his firelit study. And there's a lot of dark humor here as well -- and not all of it is Hellboy's dry one-liners. The movie is liberally peppered with dark humor moments (\\"1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.\\" \\"DID he now?\\"), including some hilariously macabre scenes involving a bad-tempered Russian zombie (\\"This is Ivan Klimatovich. Say hi, Ivan.\\" \\"Go that way, Red Monkey!\\").<br /><br />Most importantly, Del Toro is able to give his characters little human quirks -- hair plugs, love of cats, and Hellboy sanding down his horns in the morning. Perlman is simply amazing as \\"Red,\\" whose gruff scarlet exterior hides a kindly, affectionate heart. Not many actors could emote through that many prosthetics (including a very lifelike tail), but Perlman makes it look natural.<br /><br />Though he's playing a ninetyish old professor, Hurt plays his role with a quiet, powerful sense of goodness. Jones and Evans also do excellent jobs, one as an erudite psychic fish-man (\\"We lead a charmed life,\\" he observes as cockroaches skitter around him) and an earnest young agent. Selma Blair is the one downside -- she sort of mumbles in a monotone most of the time.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy\\" is one of the best comic-book adaptations that Hollywood has turned out, primarily because of the darker, eerier aesthetic Guillermo Del Toro brings to it. Definitely a must-see.ations that Hollywood has turned out, primarily because of the darker, eerier aesthetic Guillermo Del Toro brings to it. Definitely a must-see.

It's actually been a motive for potty training, because we leave it in the bathroom and she can only read it when she is on the potty. :) She has also learned animal sounds and will give them before we read it.

B0029QRA1U|2.0|I dont think ANYTHING will help this turntable with digital conversion quality.  It has NO WEIGHT control. tone arm is pre set (kinda heavy) so it wears needle.  It had NO ANTI skate control (which keeps needle in center of groove and improves quality)  It has no CARTRIDGE!!! this is the biggest problem. tone arm is one big piece of plastic!  you can pull the needle out but i have never seen a needle so cheap in my life.  what other turntable uses a needle that plugs in to the tone arm via the actual metal back part of the needle! no wires? no head shell? wow ion.. way to go.. replacing it with a better needle (if you can find one that connects like that) wont do a thing. the hum and background noise will travel threw the NON ALUMINUM record platter (where the record goes) to the needle, BE AMPLIFIED threw the cheap hollow plastic ONE PIECE tone arm out the usb port Right into adobe audition (or what ever you're using) wonderfully.  It forced me to isolate the hum in the beginning of every track, sample it, do noise reduction filters with custom levels, and then its listenable. BUT after all that I'm loosing some frequencies and quality. I can tell the difference. most wouldnt but i can. thats why i have the vinyl in the 1st place.  if i wanted a tinny compressed missing high end mp3.. i coulda bought one on Itunes and saved myself the time!  someone said the RCA jacks would work better... with a Y cable? in a generic sound card??  why did i buy a usb turntable then?? not to mention i tried that YEARS AGO (from mixer and amp properly grounded) and got about the same result. hum and electric noise from generic sound card.  I cant say its the worst conversion turntable but the time put in to get anything decent is crazy. and not even that great.  sounds like a youtube video on a good day.. :(  and forget about using the program that comes with it. straight garbage with no click or noise reduction which you def. need with that joke of a one piece plastic tone arm withno weight or tracking or height control!!  not to mention the ion program MAKES YOU INSTALL Itunes. doesn't come with  Itunes. you have to go, hook up your internet cable, download Itunes (even if you dont have Itunes OR a MAC) BEFORE you can even witness what is about to be peddled to you as vinyl to digital conversion. Not to mention you paid 99.00 bucks for all this..  wish I could return it and put it towards a digi box or a real turntable. (I miss my stanton str8's)    the picture def. makes it look like it has a weight and a cartridge  DONT BE FOOLED !!!  dont buy if you actually want high quality back ups of your vinyl!    if you want some half *ss-ed midrange scooped, no high end, has to be filtered a million times mp3 to carry around, ok! good to go.  THIS IS THE TURNTABLE FOR YOU!!!    Guess the better option is if you have a decent turntable and needle already,  get a digi box to find a way to plug it into your computer without using s****y built in sound card.  usb2 supposed to be good? i dunno, we'll see.  can i convert my vinyl without spending 2,500.00 on all types of ****?  doesnt seem like it. going on year 10 now. can anyone help me?  every option seems to s0ck. why is that?

I had no idea what this movie was about, but as I LOVED the music in TRON (actually I loved the entire TRON movie), I thought to give this a try.  It is an engaging story, the music is great, the animation adequate (I'm now spoiled by TRON), and I like that there is no narration.  My only disappointment was that it is in the 4x3 aspect ratio. Otherwise, it's great.
1857885082|5.0|I am English married to an American. My wife is reading it on kindle and I have read snippets here and there, as she finds out more about how I tick. What Kate says is so true, and even though I have been in the US for some 30 plus years now, I still have the same mannerisms, sense of humour or ironies and privacy as I did when I was part of the British society. It doesn't leave us, we are born with it, and for some reason, others just don't get it.   One thing my wife noticed is we don't give a lot of hand gestures when we talk, seems I never thought about it, but I don't. Kate also talks about queues, as in 'waiting in line', and without thinking about it, I wait my turn, and instinctively know when the next person is 'in line' even if there isn't one, and we get pretty perturbed when someone 'jumps the queue', something we do not do, but if others do it, we mention something, usually ironic, to fellow people still waiting, and just loud enough for that person to hear. My wife said I have embarrassed her a few times before doing that, and now she knows why.  This is a great book, and can't wait to read more when she's done.
B004Z4LVZK|5.0|I'm going to say this right off the top, James Dashner is an amazing writer. The Maze Runner has an intense and intriguing opening that immediately pulls the reader right into the story, throwing them right in beside a lonely and confused Thomas in a creepy elevator shaft.<br /><br />\\"He began his new life standing up, surrounded by cold darkness and stale, dusty air.\\"<br /><br />Dashner's pacing is perfection. The story flows along so nicely you almost don't realize as you sneak up on the ending. I was so involved in Thomas's character, trying to figure out why he seems so familiar with everything, yet why most of his memories are missing. Trying to put all the clues together to find out what is happening so everyone can escape the horrors of the maze. The author doesn't give too much away too early, he lets the reader discover the important aspects of the plot as the characters do. I love this in a storyteller. It keeps you reading, turning every page one right after the other until you reach the mind-numbing conclusion.<br /><br />One of my favourite aspects of The Maze Runner is the new language the characters create during their time living with one another. Completely devoid of memories of their past they quickly develop their own entertaining slang. I love how this allows the boys in the book to \\"swear\\" as boys often do, but without having the book filled with profanity.<br /><br />\\"Klunk's another word for poo. Poo makes a klunk sound when it falls in our pee pots.\\"<br /><br />That quote seriously made me snicker out loud on the subway... embarrassing...<br /><br />The chapters were short, yet involved, which keeps the readers interested and coming back for more. The characters were alive and vivid, allowing the reader to become emotionally invested in them (which is not always a good thing!)<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone, male or female, old or young, I think there is something in it for everyone.

B004HW7JMY|4.0|I had great expectations after watching Season-1 but the level of fun is not the same in it.  The producers made it becuase they had to make somthing while Late Andy was not avaiable. The show focuses more on character development and background history of other charachters. Spartacus Blood and Sands raised the bar so high and this mini-series did not match it. Except for the last episode which was fun to watch.  Overall I like it but people who have not watched it will miss nothing if they donot watch these six episodes.

Keith's writing takes you inside the life of an amazing talent and personality. I have been a Rolling Stone fan for a long time, but even I sat with a music internet site on so I could play the song he was talking about to get every nuance. Made for a fascinating journey.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|This here is a beautiful and magically enchanting novel. Erin Morgenstern can definitely paint her vivid imagination with words, I highly recommend this novel.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Loved it!  Very intimate picture into Steve Jobs showing incredible contradictions into the ugly, the genius, the ego, the dictator, the manipulator, the charmer, the iconoclast, the failure, the success, the facts that let the reader judge what credit belongs to him and what might not.  His world impact successes cannot be ignored.  The route he took give lessons, but at the same time, it is obvious that mere observation cannot convey the force of nature he exuded on EXECUTING his visions time and time again in large corporate environments without significant consensus.  This kind of dictatorial management goes against every management rule in the book - and the fact he did it to create a multi-billion dollar most valuable public company in the world spits in the face of convention.  His character flaws are laid bare, and his flaws are also his strengths - they are traits the author shows you can both admire and abhor with neither opinion being wrong.  The author showed where his style was to take credit for the ideas and work of others as if it were his own, but also shows that without him creating a \\"reality distortion\\" that consistently pushed people to perform beyond what they believed they could do was integral to the execution from concept to reality.  If there is an overwhelming failure in American employees and business owners, its their failure to decisively execute on good ideas.  Steve Jobs was a rare bird in his ability to surround himself with \\"A\\" players, and get them to execute fast and at the highest levels.  The contradictions in the fact that he didn't spend like a billionaire on himself, but did so at every turn in every company he was involved with down to the most OCD perfection detail is pretty fascinating.  Money was not the goal, but the byproduct of constantly trying to achieve product perfection that he knew the public would love.  He didn't give in to commoditization, but insisted on every detail of maximizing the customer's experience -making decisions that were more right than wrong on most things.  It shows his humanity in being wrong and failing (NeXT), and his culpability in Apple's almost bankruptcy - but it was his maturity and experience of failing that laid the foundation for the wild success that came.  It is an incredible book, one that feels very honest overall.  Of course there is a bias, but it is minimal.  I highly recommend Steve jobs biography without reservation to everyone.  And, I had no preconceptions about it going in.  It stood out purely on the incredible merits of the author and the subject's willingness to not restrict the author to a puff piece.
1451648537|5.0|I just finished the book. Well written and easy to read, no techno jargon or acronyms that leave the reader wondering what he had missed - my hat's off to Isaacson. Narcissism is not a funny trait for anyone who has had to deal with a boss who gets away with treating people as pawns to be manipulated and denigrated at whim to further one's own self-aggrandizement. Steve Jobs, while brilliant as defined by Isaacson, is one of those people who also developed significant personal charisma  - charm that allowed him to get away with being often classless and offensive...and no matter the offense people would always come to his defense with the tiresome remark, \\"oh, but he is so brilliant!\\" How can you label someone brilliant who kills himself via his own diet and incredible self-denial? I suspect there are many people who work in Apple who slaved 80-90 hours a week only to see their \\"oh that is shxx\\" product be later claimed by SJ as the second coming; and, of course, credit reaped by the King. Jonathon Ive is particularly illustrative at making this point. It will be interesting to see what happens to Apple over the next decade. I highly recommend the book and I also praise SJ (may he rest in peace) for giving Isaacson such far reaching access and latitude to write a book that in the end is particularly critical of an individual who most of us have known only as a cult figure defined by slick PR and a fawning press.  Got to give Mr Jobs credit for that. Oh by the way, America is full of individuals who have made this country great - as just one example, read Stephen E. Ambrose, \\"Nothing Like It In the World\\" to get a feel for the spirit and indomitable will of the men who built the Transcontinental Railroad.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|The picture is fantastic, the special features worth the money. The item came unharmed and I am very pleased with everything to do with it.
1861085257|4.0|Bought this book for my daughter who is starting to make polymer clay charms.  I was absolutely amazed at what could be done with the clay.  And she has designed some charms based on the ideas from this book.  Great instructions on creating different food items with polymer clay.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I cannot recommend this movie enough. I had never heard of it before and saw it in a secondhand shop for a few dollars and decided to buy it to see if it was any good. It is a fantastic adaptation of \\"Treasure Island\\" filled to the brim with action, adventure and a lot of fun. The characters and story are compelling and I really cannot understand how it hasn't made more money. A charming movie for the entire family.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Two stars is the *most* this 'novel' deserves.<br /><br />It is nothing more that a sellout to the 'church'; an apology for lifting up her skirts and showing her clay feet in his two previous Langdon novels ('Da Vinci Code' and 'Angles and Demons'), even though they were works of fiction.<br /><br />The most interesting thing done is using 'magic squares' to randomize information (neat and worthy of Langdon's deciphering skills). Major dis-like of his trying to claim psudo-science as hard-science, but I would give him that if it was actually pertinent to the plot (not really in this case) since science isn't really his strong point (Digital Fortress, Deception Point, and Angles and Demons showed that in spades, but it was ok since it progressed the plot in those stories).<br /><br />Lots of running around with detailed descriptions of the landscape... but just fillers to add to the page count (in my opinion, but then I'm writing this review so this entire thing is my option :).<br /><br />As with most works of fiction, the recovery times for the characters is sooo unrealistic. I've personally lost a lot of blood (6 units from internal bleeding) and even with transfusions, it was days before I could walk (and barely at that); but it is FICTION and they are the HEROES, so some latitude is granted.<br /><br />The identity (and motives) of the villain was exceedingly transparent and the 'reveal' was yet another yawn.<br /><br />The ending was yet another letdown... very preachy (as others have noted); in essence saying that religions (the 'church') actually have it right and their 'holy' scriptures/books do contain mystical hidden knowledge. To that I say, if you want to 'spin it' and 'interpret it' enough, 'Winnie the Pooh' has just as much spiritual hidden knowledge (you just have to look really hard for it).<br /><br />So, wait for the sale rack before purchasing this book; not worth full price.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|The movie itself is fantastic; I have watched it countless times and still enjoy every second. The quality of the disc and case was as expected; nothing fancy but beautiful cover art and no blemishes. Everything arrived as expected!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|This is a strangely written book in my view. There is no question that Dan Brown is an outstanding writer and has great talent, yet he seems to miss some of the most obvious things.   About halfway through the book I was thinking this is one of the best books I've read in a long time, and yet by the end I had lost all enthusiasm. The writing is excellent in so many ways. The smoothness of the book, the interweaving of the plot, the movement, even glimpses of humour. The characters have potential.   What doesn't work in the final estimation is the implausibility of the plot, espcially the end. What doesn't work is that the characters stop being human. There is no emotional reality here. It's almost as if Brown is so taken up with the ideas in his mind that he forgets that characters are not robots that can just move at the author's will. If a book is to make sense, to be fulfilling, the characters must come alive and live a life that is flawed and imperfect, not beholden to the author as god.   This book is about ideas and concepts which are of some interest. This book is not about people, not about reality. People can have ideas and concepts but they don't tear away their bodies and their feelings and just become intellectual \\"things\\". Dan, please, don't rush next time. Come up with a plot that makes sense. Come up with a plot that humans can live. You have great talent, please see the bigger picture.

B0057VDGNK|5.0|I loved the original music in the movie, DRIVE.  I couldn't wait for the soundtrack to come out and then found it on Amazon.  Great buy!
B005HV6Y84|1.0|I absolutely LOVED the prior soundtracks- much to my surprise admittedly. This one is horrible- with the exception of a couple of the songs that are ok (but not tear worthy like Mia and several of the others).  The Bruno Mars song is so poppy and truly does not fit these movies- where is Muse?? I am actually worried about watching the movie now. I can not wait for the score though...Carter is phenomenal and I know he won't let me down.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|This is an amazing, almost-plausible, intense and refreshing series that I never thought I'd enjoy this much. But be forewarned: Start from the pilot episode to learn about each character, or you'll be lost and out-of-touch with them, and the story (which I feel is much more engaging than even \\"Lost\\"). If anyone ever spoils the episodes, punch them in the shoulder! I feel such wide-ranging emotions for the characters, and each new one that enters displays a great deal of talent. Everyone talks about the cinematography, and it is top-notch. The angles, composition and thought process of style is terrific and better than anything I've seen. One thing I truly admire is how the writing doesn't make it seem like some kind of glorified soap opera. While the emotions run high and plot truly thickens, the performers act in a drama that's based on the real-life drug world where this series - and life - imitate each other. You'll feel like you're watching a train wreck, but without the lame Bruckheimer-style production: when things play out, expect that natural sound is what you hear, not some kind of theatrical swell of an orchestra to \\"enhance\\" the drama. A shootout in season three is what completely blew me away. Realistic sounds of gunfire shattered the quiet tension that made my jaw drop in amazement.<br /><br />The realism seems to be what the crew want you to experience. They try to immerse the viewer into a plausible world of what one over-qualified chemist, Walter White (magnificently played by Bryan Cranston), working as an underpaid high school teacher, chooses when diagnosed with terminal cancer. He exploits his knowledge of chemistry to make quick cash and lots of cheddar by manufacturing a pristine crystal methamphetamine to provide a nest egg for his family and unborn child before he succumbs. But Walt's choices result in some dire consequences that grow more gloomy and dire as he continues to manufacture, forsaking those consequences - and everyone around him - to provide for his family by any means necessary. His blind ambition results in mounting collateral damages and human and emotional tragedies. The talents on screen were trained well in their field by experts off-screen. The police truly act like law enforcement, while drug users and pushers seemed all-too-authentic in front of the camera. Some bit actors even resembled real-life drug addicts. It's a well-scripted, thorough work whose story lines are intertwined thoughtfully. And yet there's always a character that provides some comic relief to keep the story from becoming too bleak. The only bone I can pick at, is that Walt hasn't switched from briefs to boxers as his character's mild manner transformed to a take-charge attitude.ide for his family by any means necessary.

1856697525|5.0|This book is pure joy- a sumptuous and fascinating look at one of the most important designers and filmmakers of the 20th century, chock-full of bold, beautiful images. If one reads past the first chapter, which is about Mr. Bass' early life and sets the stage for the rest of the book, there is a depth of writing about his creative process, woven throughout with personal stories and anecdotes about the work in his own voice. The gatefolds displaying his film work and extensive corporate identity designs are an added treat. This book is destined to become a classic.
067144901X|5.0|This book is good for my 10 month old daughter because it's short and sweet. It's short enough that she will sit there quietly watching each page turn and before you know it, we're done with 1 book. We have most of the Sandra Boynton books and this one is appropriate for her age group. This is one of our favorites along with  Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs and Hippos Go Berserk!
B005MW5CWW|3.0|Of all the Mastodon albums I own I'd rate Leviathon & Crack the Skye at 5 stars, Blood Mountain & Remission at 4 stars, and this album at 3.5 stars.  The songs are definitely simpler and more radio-friendly than their previous albums.  Most of the songs are pretty good still though, except I really can't stand Curl of the Burl, that song makes me angry and I need to skip over it.  Its very jarring that the 1st song on the album is so strong and more \\"classic mastodon\\" than the rest of the album and then it goes into Curl of the Burl.  Curl of the Burl makes me think of some generic pop-metal band trying to copy Mastodon, trading away ideas like \\"interesting riffs\\" and \\"complex songwriting\\" for that \\"strong simple groove\\" that more pop-oriented listeners tend to favor.  Aside from that song the other songs are pretty good, some sound like they are trying to incorporate more radio-friendly hooks in them, but there's still some interesting music and skilled musicianship going on underneath it.  Overall I personally favor the more complex songs of their previous work though, this just sounds too \\"typical\\" when I liked Mastodon so much because they were \\"unique\\".
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|In the 60s, The Velvet Underground made music people did not get. When their debut came out, almost nobody was interested. However, those that were formed bands and followed in their footsteps. It took years for the genius of this band to be appreciated (the debut went gold after nearly twenty years). In 1973, on the heels of Transformer's glam success, Reed disregarded audience expectation and made the dark concept album Berlin. Critics and fans panned it. Twenty years later the same critics and fans figured out that it was a masterpiece. Clearly, Reed has a track record of having his works dismissed initially. He's an artist before he's a crowd pleaser. When he gave the public what they wanted (Sally Can't Dance), he deliberately made it as bad as possible, perhaps to demonstrate the shallowness of their expectations. Then he made any remaining bandwagon types run with the jarring instrumental double album experiment Metal Machine Music.  Metallica fans have a problem here because they are generally not Lou's audience. If they do like anything he's done, it's probably Velvet Underground or Transformer. They've hardly been introduced to Lou Reed properly here. It takes time for Lou's style to grow on people. You'd be hard pressed to find a fan who hops onboard prior to adulthood. Lou has stated in the past that he's a grown up making music for other grown ups. Natually, his fan base probably contains no casual music listeners.  To Lou fans like me, he is not a has been at all. He continues to make music that challenges. The Raven, Magic and Loss, The Blue Mask, etc are brilliant but not accessible at all unless you've already been into the music for a while. Immediate approval is not Lou's goal. Most of his works require multiple listens to appreciate. He does not dumb anything down for easy consumption. Metallica's fans have presented challenges for their fans at times too, but they are ultimately an arena band. Also, the greater part of Metallica's core listenersseem to view the band as a franchise who is obligated to make a certain kind of music. Not to the cookie cutter extent of AC/DC, but close. Lou does whatever feels right to him as an artist. If the audience doesn't get it, that's not his problem.   Then there's the voice. Metallica fans writing reviews hear a rambling old man and they don't seem to get the lyrics so well. A Lou fan hears phrasing, personality, and feel. Pitch hardly enters the conversation because it's not really relevant to the experience. It's not a vocal delivery most of these reviewers have ever encountered and they probably lack the context necessary to process what they are hearing. A few may take the time to learn more about Lou's works and will be rewarded for their work. Most haven't neither the inclination nor the patience. Too bad for them. They're better off with the new Megadeth album because Mustaine will more likely satisfy their sense of entitlement as consumers.  Personally, I hear an intriguing fit between the songs and style of Reed and the epic churnings of Metallica. Not every track works equally, but the brilliant tracks carry the work and the failures do not go down without a fight. Metallica and Reed are two different types of edgy, yet it works to my ears.  Should Metallica not have included their band name on the disk, as at least one reviewer has suggested? Yes, if you're talking about Metallica the unit mover/ money generator. No, if you're talking about Metallica the artists. Whatever. I'm just happy that these five musicians and their guests released this fine disk.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I hate this album! Metallica tried to experiment with new sounds, as other classic bands, but this production is really poor and completely lost. Is the creativity of this excellent band dry? If the answer is \\"YES\\", so please die with the boots on and don't try to sell really bad productions for those fans that buy your records just to keep complete the collection. Even the art of the CD is horrible, more than the \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" albums.
0896762629|5.0|This is a must have book for late period Scadians or Rennies. The book is based on the existant pieces researched in debth by Ms. Arnold and then gives you the shapes and how tos on how to put the pieces together including the stitches used in the original pieces. The book is well laid out and easy to follow drawn instruction as well as photos of the actual pieces. I highly recommend this book in every tailor of the past's library.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|I went to 4 of her European shows and I was absolutely blown away. Every tour is more legendary, iconic and spectacular than ever. I couldn't imagine how she could possibly top \\"The Circus Starring Britney Spears\\", but as usual she exceeds even the highest expectations. This show is monumental, she performs many songs from her latest album (which was considered the avantgarde of pop by the most authoritative and prestigious critics in the world) and many classics get a completely new treatment. Her dancing is as usual well above the standards of music business and she clearly shows the technique and ability gained by someone who's been studying professional dancing seriously practically since she was born (along with singing, athletics and other disciplines). The vocals are 90% live and pitch-perfect, the rest of them relying on singing on top of a pre-recorded track. The sets, costumes and special effects are mesmerizing, plus this time you can definitely see she has fun and enjoys every minute of what she does on the stage. On many occasions she looks sweet and humble, while at the same time being sexy, fierce and in control throughout the show. It's definitely THE tour of the year and shows that the one and only queen of pop is Britney. Without having to put on ridiculous and trashy stuff that can attract only 10-year-old people and to fake exaggerated love for her fans, she still attracts millions of people through her music and passion and manages to genuinely express her love for her fans. She keeps on making music one step ahead of anybody else and topping the charts. She keeps on being a beacon for the industry even 13 years after she appeared on the scene and has gained the complete respect of the industry and of critics all over the world. And when she puts on a show, her music and her presence alone are enough to capture the audience. Nobody should miss such an epic event. I miss seeing her perform just inches from my nose. I can't wait for the Blu-ray tocome so that I can relive the memories and enjoy the epicness of the event over and over again.

B0051OJCUY|3.0|As \\"The Blue Note Story\\" makes clear, it was Jimmy Smith who, more than any other single musician or factor, encouraged Alfred Lion to keep his musician-friendly, mom-and-pop business going (with lots of help from Francis Wolff and Rudy Van Gelder) when the economics of running a record company seemed to call for stenting the flow of red ink.  Just as a love of traditional jazz and the soprano sax of Sidney Bechet had encouraged Lion to launch the label, the sound of Jimmy Smith's Hammond B3 kindled such an immediate love affair in Lion that he vowed to follow Jimmy to every one of his gigs if necessary to keep him in the Blue Note stable.<br /><br />Jimmy would make a number of profitable albums for Blue Note until in 1963 the lure of green called him away to Verve and, in effect, spelled the end of tiny (though prolific, productive and seminal) Blue Note Records.<br /><br />The present collection has the album that caught the ears not merely of Lion but followers of the music everywhere.  With Jimmy's torrid, uptempo version of Dizzy's \\"The Champ\\" he turned heads and won instantaneous converts to the previously neglected instrument, much as electric bassist Jaco Pastorius would do in 1975 with his performance of Bird's \\"Donna Lee.\\"<br /><br />But any collector of Jimmy Smith albums will want to obtain, above all, fresh copies of two albums that are not only essentials but synonymous with Jimmy Smith: \\"The Sermon\\" and \\"Midnight Special.\\"  (Neither is included in this composite of imports.)<br /><br />Jimmy could be erratic, and he'd sooner push a tempo than drag it (just ask one of his drummers, such as Grady Tate).  But that was his temperament--excitable, opinionated, always ready to speak his mind, and constantly in motion.  (All it required was riding a couple of floors with him in a hotel elevator to find out that he had no use for the rhythm section he'd been given to play with during one Chicago engagement.)  But to the minds of many, he was not merely the first of the \\"modern\\" B3 players: he was the best--no small statement in view  of the dozens of like-minded, talented B3 players Jimmy seemed to spawn practically over night.s the best--no small statement in view  of the dozens of like-minded, talented B3 players Jimmy seemed to spawn practically over night.

1423140591|5.0|Love it!!!..  Love Percy Jackson books and Heroes of Olympus books, WORTH TO BUY!!! Warning for Spoilers at the end. Read first then ideas at the end of the book Heroes of Olympus: Son of Neptune at the ending and arrival of Greek at Roman camp got me thinking of options (what ifs) between Jason and Reyna, Jason's reaction at Percy as a new Praetor (Jason old position), Percy and Annabeth relationship, Annabeth's reaction of Percy including new Praetor, Reyna reaction of Jason as Greek leader, sticky situation between Reyna and Piper attachment to Jason, How Percy brings all 7 demigods together or Greek and Roman together, Percy's thoughts of Annabeth as \\"Mark of Athena\\", Wondering if Annabeth already knew or didnt know she may be the one on Mark of Athena quest... ETC ETC ETC!!!!<br /><br />Remember in the book Heroes of Olympus: the Son of Neptune-- Juno(Hera) comments to Percy about the one closes to him will give him hard time (possible Annabeth). Remember readers Annabeth said to Percy on their first real kiss at the end of the book Percy Jackson and the Olympians: the Last Olympian.. Read that part!!!<br /><br />I do know that Jason, Piper, Leo, Percy, Hazel, Frank, and one more demigod to make it 7 demigods on the most important quest.. I m pretty sure one more demigod possible to be Annabeth... All of 6 demigods already completed the quests from Book 1 and Book 2 (Heroes of Olympus) except Annabeth.. Because next book 3 already titled \\"Mark of Athena\\" is more likely Annabeth's quest... IF Annabeth's quest is success then she becomes the 7th demigod...<br /><br />I cannot wait for the book 3 \\"Mark of Athena\\" to come out in the Fall 2012.. I m hoping my thoughts might be as close as Rick Riordan's ideas at the beginning of Greek arrival at Roman Camp.. the rest of the book, I would not guess that much..<br /><br />Enjoy reading!!! Worth it!!! but at the end makes me GROWL & HUNGRY TO READ NEXT!!<br /><br />SMILE!!! SMILE!!!
B0053VKP8S|3.0|For external analog amplifier with speakers the D3 works very good on non-HD channels,however if your audio out menu on your TV does not allow you to switch off DTS or Dolby signal, you may get a loud buzzing noise on your external speakers when watching HD channels. I get around it by watching the HD channels thru my DVD player which stops the noise.
B005FUTBWS|4.0|A somewhat believable movie about religious fanatics that take the Bible into their own hands. I found it to be suspenseful, entertaining, and thought-provoking. Makes you wonder what people are really capable of doing for their beliefs. I was worried that it was going to be too gory but it was just the right about of blood and guts, without going overboard. I liked it alot and thought it was a new spin on the thriller genre.
0446585025|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of Ellen DeGeneres, and this book didn't disappoint.  Her silly, random humor was entertaining and enjoyable- I could hear her voice in my head as if she were reading it to me- very much Ellen.  The only problem is that its such an easy read, I was done with it before I knew it.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|I had high expectations for this movie, and was sorely let-down. A mix of School of Rock and every other \\"teacher\\" movie out there, it was predictable and drawn out. I saw how the movie was going to end about 10 minutes into it and the rest was less-than-funny filler. Justin Timberlake's character was my least favorite of the movie, and the whole time his bad acting left a horrible taste in my mouth. Paired up with Cameron Diaz's equally awful acting, it was a waste of money to even rent this.
0307887898|5.0|With The Lean Startup , Eric Ries has produced a truly interesting, engaging book that is valuable for anyone seeking to drive innovation. In fact, given the intense scrutiny that venture capitalists purportedly have towards startups these days, this book might actually be more applicable to larger organizations and those who want to be better intrepreneurs.   The Lean Startup , as the title suggests, guides the reader in the application of Lean principles in a software startup. A startup, according to Ries, is \\"... a catalyst that transforms ideas into products.\\" And the products that a startup builds, \\"are really experiments; the learning about how to build a sustainable business is the outcome of those experiments.\\"  As part of this Ries advises us to avoid sub-optimizing individual functions, favoring working through what he calls the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop in a specific way. Ries' point is that, \\"... the goal is not to produce more stuff efficiently. It is to--as quickly as possible--learn how to build a sustainable business.\\" In the context of applying the principles of the Lean Startup, what matters is how quickly you can get through the entire Build-Measure-Learn loop.  The first step is to enter the Build phase as quickly as possible with a minimum viable product (MVP), a minimum viable product being a minimalist implementation, and most likely lacking in features that \\"may prove essential later on.\\" The goal is to generate feedback and data from real customers as quickly as possible in the form of validated learning.    Once you have completed one Build-Measure-Learn loop, The Lean Startup  tells us that we will face a choice: pivot the original strategy or persevere. A pivot can be essential to success, but it is not change for the sake of change. It is \\"...a special kind of structured change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth.\\"   Too often, companies stick with executing bad plans--doing the wrong thing well. As The Lean Startup  points out, \\"there is no bigger destroyer of creative potential than the misguided decision to persevere. Companies that cannot bring themselves to pivot to a new direction on the basis of feedback from the marketplace can get stuck in the land of the living dead, neither growing enough nor dying, consuming resources and commitment from employees and other stakeholders but not moving ahead.\\"   Overall, I found The Lean Startup  to be very well written, and it paints an excellent picture on the subject of applying the principles of Lean thinking to software product development.
0307593312|5.0|1Q84 starts out being a crime thriller, one of my favorite genres, and I was quite surprised by this. It then also became a love story between two people, Tengo and Aomame, and continued to be a love story to the end.   Fantastical and magical things and people appear in the novel - the Smurf-like Little People, for one, and the Air Chrysalis - devices that almost seem like children's fantasies. But this is no book for children. There is explicit sex and calculated murder, but also sympathetic looks into the hearts and minds of some of the main characters. Tengo in particular, is a very likable mathematician turned writer, whose relationship with his dying father adds a touch of pathos to the novel. His search for his grammar school classmate, Aomame, and her search for him, is the love story that fuels the novel.   In the plot, Tengo and Aomame both enter an alternate reality, 1Q84, when Tengo rewrites a book, Air Chrysalis, written by the enigmatic teenager Fuka-Eri, and when Aomame climbs down a long metal staircase from one level of the expressway to the next and from one reality to another. In this alternate world that declares itself by the two moons hanging in the sky, the two try to find each other, though they met since the third grade about 20 years before.  Religion is an important link between Tengo and Aomame, and 1Q84 takes aim at religious cults - those controlling Big Brother-like organizations in which children are sexually and mentally abused and members of the group restrained psychologically. The book also seems to focus on men who abuse women and children in general and about an elderly widow who exacts revenge on severely abusive men, sending them to \\"another world\\" in order to protect other women and children.  In such a long and complex book, there is a lot more to discuss. For instance, Murakami follows the idea that time does not flow in a straight line. In 1Q84, time twists around, reality shifts, and the past can sneak up unannounced behind you. These are just a very few of the interesting themes I found.   I liked how well the main characters were developed in the book, the careful and realistic descriptions of personality, physical features, and motives. Murakami's comments on writing are also interesting as are his mix of magic and fantasy into the novel.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|This is a terrific album from an incredibly talented songsmith.  Each of the 13 of Peter's songs here are reimagined as hauntingly beautiful, cinematic masterpieces.  Some are tender and comforting, others thrilling and heart-racing.  The bonus song, Blood of Eden, is also great, starting very simply, and then exploding at the finale with full orchestration.  I don't know if all of these versions are necessarily better than the originals, but they aren't worse - so that's pretty good.  Not only are they on par with the originals, but they really remind the listener of just how great a songwriter Peter Gabriel is, and how wonderful his melodies are.  The only song I didn't absolutely love was \\"Mercy Street,\\" because it is almost an exact replication of the original version.  That's the only song on the album that doesn't feel exciting and newly envisioned.  Also, while \\"Downside Up\\" is great, this version is missing the awesome, energetic ending that is featured in the live version.  Oh well, it's still pretty.  Overall, though, as an already big Peter Gabriel fan, this album confirms my beliefs that PG is one hell of a songwriter and performer.  His voice is still in fine shape and he really lets loose on most of the songs.  If you're a major or minor PG fan, you should really listen to this.  I play the CD whenever I'm driving and it remains great after many repeated listenings.  Thank you, Peter, for sharing this with us.  Now let's see if you can give us some new, original material!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I love fantastical stories. I love love love Stanek's Kingdoms and Dragons books. This seemed a dark fairy tale at first, but turned out differently than I expected. I couldn't get into it for a long time, not until about 120 pages in, then when it seemed to get going it started dragging. The author's very good at imagery and descriptions, just not on hooking the reader. If the finish wasn't so good, I wouldn't rate it so highly. Better in the second half for sure.
0525423656|3.0|\\"Matched\\" was good enough that I wanted to read the follow up \\"Crossed\\" right away.  But I was somewhat disappointed.  To start, I read a ton of books each year.  While I do a pretty good job of retaining what a read, after a year of more, the details can get a little fuzzy.  There was absolutely no recap of the first book in \\"Matched\\".  So I think I may have missed the impact of a lot of the revelations or self discoveries contained within the pages of \\"Crossed\\".  I don't need or want an entire play by play of the first books but some references to the first story would have been nice.<br /><br />Also, this story was slow.  I kept waiting for it to pick up but I never felt like it really did.  I didn't dislike the book at all.  I think the author has a great imagination and I firmly believe the events we witness in \\"Crossed\\" will be necessary for the series wrap up.  It just felt like nothing really happened.  There was definitely no climax and we never really know if there is a good side to take in \\"Crossed\\".  The reader, much like the characters, really doesn't know who is right or who to root for.  I am sure this was done on purpose but I am not completely sure what the point was.  There is little activity on the romance front as well.  Ky and Cassia are together only very briefly and Xander is in the story even less.<br /><br />On the positive side of things...we are introduced to a couple of new characters that I liked a lot.  I loved the stories found within the Carvings although I really wished there was less page count devoted to their travels through it. Condie doesn't shy away from the ugliest aspects of the Society and I think that is certainly a plus. She does a great job of contrasting the world we see in \\"Crossed\\" with the idealic world we saw in \\"Matched\\".<br /><br />I really didn't dislike this book but again it was somewhat disappointed. We get zero resolution to any of the plot points created in \\"Matched\\" and next to none of the romance. Of course with this much time invested in the trilogy I will go ahead and read the final book.  I just hope it really turns out to be something amazing to make up for this one.d in the trilogy I will go ahead and read the final book.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|I grew up in a culture of very health-conscious church people, mostly vegetarians, and grew to learn about health very early in life.  However, coming into a fitness lifestyle also came with its demons, because most of these books, recipes, ways of \\"replenishing\\" the body also come with a lot of GMO's, lots of proteins from animal products, canned protein shakes, the new way to lose weight.  I would not have known to question any of these recommended fitness techniques had I been formerly encouraged by family and culture to \\"eat vegetables to sweep the toxins away from your stomach.\\"  How much truer that statement is today.  I know that most people will say a documentary is one-sided, but it's probably because it just pulls its own weight.  Watch this movie and if it doesn't change the way you eat and view food, and become an active participant in advocating for the health of our future and our children's future, then you probably don't love yourself much.  And you ought to.<br /><br />Anyway, hard to change the polluted industry, but we can, one person at a time.  And if you need help with means to buy the better variety food, ask God for the means.  We have to help the farmers, too.

1439192812|4.0|I would like to second the reviewer who mentioned Isaac Asimov, whose many volumes of accessible, entertaining exciting prose opened so many eyes to the magic of the real world. As an older reader, I also remember Willy Ley and L. Sprague DeCamp, whose readable accounts of the natural world excited and informed my young mind.  Now I've bought multiple copies of The Magic of Reality in hopes that Dawkins can do the same for the minds of some young relatives. But I'd like to point out a few shortcomings. This book isn't perfect.  First, the organization puzzles me. Each chapter is a pretty much independent, but there is no clear pattern to the sequence of chapters. For example, why is the chapter on the existence of matter in the middle, rather than the beginning (or the end)? Why does the chapter on night and day and the seasons precede the chapter on the Sun? Why is an essay on such a relatively mundane subject as \\"Why are there earthquakes\\" sandwiched between the cosmic \\"Are we alone\\" and the philosophical \\"Why do bad things happen?\\" There's no flow, no build, no progression of ideas that I can perceive. Asimov would not approve!  Second, a single chapter is nowhere near enough space to get to grips with some of these subjects. Dawkins knows that, of course, but he doesn't seem to care. The reader who is excited by the ideas, the possibilities, of a chapter like Are We Alone? is left hanging, with nowhere to go to learn more. There are no references; no \\"for further reading\\"; and strangest of all in this age, no links! Take something as simple as the Earthquakes chapter. Suppose a budding geologist wants to know more about continental drift, or how rocks are dated. Dawkins offers no suggestions at all. Certainly, the reader can turn to those modern oracles, The Google and The Wiki, but Dawkins absolutely should not have left his readers to a blind, unstructured search. He ought to have provided a page of \\"where to learn more\\" at the end of every chapter, and it's abig failing that he didn't.  Finally, I wish I could see more concern in this prose for the reader. Dawkins has a fine, elegant, literary voice but he seems often to be talking to himself, not to me. I wonder if he tested any of this material on actual readers of the target age, and listened to their comments. Because there are many points at which I found myself thinking, this is too rich; whoa, slow down; that needs to be explained; this needs to be backed up with a reference; could we have an example here please? Obviously very much of that would make the book much longer; but perhaps it needs to be, or needs to tackle fewer subjects. Or just needs an occasional, explicit aside from the author to acknowledge the problem, \\"well, that's pretty dense, look at the [nonexistent] references for more.\\"
1451627289|5.0|This book means so much to me.  Thank you Mr. King.   ps    I wish all of you could relive that day with me.  It was our 9/11.  I was a college freshman at San Francisco State.  I walked out of a classroom, and students everywhere were crying.  He was shot.  Walter Cronkite had not yet announced he was dead.  I ran to the Communications Dept. and watched that announcement on a small screen tv set up in the hallway with dozens of crying students.    I'll never forget that moment.  You can't imagine how much young people loved him.  My room mate and I sat on the floor in front of the tv in our dorm for three days, mesmerized by every moment.  It was incredible.  In blazing black and white, we saw Jackie's pink suit stained with blood.  We watched Jack Ruby shoot Oswald, over and over again.  We saw the thousands pass by the casket.  We joined a nation in tears.  I never cried so much before or since.  Time stopped.  Television was born that week.  It was no longer Howdy Doody and Milton Berle.  It was immediate, emotional and real.  I can tell the author understands the impact of that.   So typical of young people, we hated LBJ, cursed our government for Viet Nam, marched in Berkeley.  We lost over 50 thousand young men because of stubborn, egotistical men.    I wonder now.  What if?  What if JFK  hadn't died that day?   Maybe that's why this amazing book touches me.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|I could not put down the first three books.  They were amazing.     Feast of Crows was a huge disappointment.  I HATED it.  Did someone else write it?  Does my Mr. Martin have a brain tumor?  And surprise, surprise, Dance of Dragons is also a bomb!  In both books, the author brings in dozens of characters that mean nothing, do nothing to advance the story  and then they vanish.  All at the expense of the characters we've come to know and care about.   What a waste of time.

B000P0J09M|4.0|There is a moment in Goodfellas when you realize how mad being a gangster is.    ---SPOILER ALERT--- (A tiny one, but always worth throwing that out there)  The scene where Lorraine Bracco is sitting on Ray Liotta's chest pointing a snub nose revolver at his face and demanding him to be faithful to her that you realize: Whoa, someone lived through this?  That about sums up Goodfellas.  The film is itself stunning, with a very unrelenting picture of mob life and the downward spiral it leads to.  To say Scorsese is a brilliant director is not giving him enough credit.  The way he can capture a story, present it in a unique fashion, in this case show the ups and downs of a life of crime, is stunning.  The cinematography is brilliant, the action sudden and violent, as this life must be.  The acting is perfect, and you really understand why someone would turn to crime, its the family and brotherhood of it all.  The film does take some hits as far as a slightly weird storytelling mechanic (the narration is cool, just a little bizarre), but otherwise it is an excellent film and deserves its place on AFI's list.

B005N0C0JQ|4.0|Noel has taken the solo plunge and his efforts will not go unnoticed. Obviously many people are looking for \\"What's The Story Morning Glory\\" part 2 and if that is the case you may be let down. The album is a collection of extremely well written songs, but not necessarily fully crafted as they would have been in Oasis. Not to say Noel's guitar chops are gone, but they are much more sparse on this album than say \\"Be Here Now.\\" The album hits high notes with \\"If I Had a Gun\\", \\"Death of You and Me\\", and \\"What a Life.\\" With this being said the other tracks on the album are still better than 95% of what you'll hear on the radio. As a fan of Noel's song writing it is easy to get spoiled when he wrote three straight albums without a throwaway track. I think it's fair to say that Noel definitely wanted to shoot down Beady Eye. With this album the music does the talking and the listener can be left to decipher which band is superior, but the decision is an easy one. Not one of the greatest albums of all time, but it is definitely one of the year's best albums.

014241543X|4.0|I read this book for an English class I was taking, and my first impression of the book is that is was good. This book is about a young girl who is in a car wreck with her family, and lands in a coma. While in a coma (to say the simplest,) she is a ghost. She can see and hear conversations, but people can't see and hear her. She goes on reminiscing on her past to make a decision to stay, or to go. This book doesn't take long to get to the core part of the story (some drag on until the actual story comes along,) which was nice. However, at some points it can be hard to follow, or make you go back and read a paragraph because things do happen quickly. Other than that, a great book.
B003Y5H574|5.0|You won't be disappointed with this movie.  It has a little bit of drama, a great amount of comedy and a hint of surprise.  This movie will not leave you bored, especially if you love Ryan Gosling.
B003L77GGU|5.0|This show has been great I have loved the past few seasons and while this season was not horrible it just did not seem to stack up to the quality of some other other seasons the story was a bit off when they came back from their break I just could not follow it that well and they killed Eve off so quickly it was not even funny at least the finale was great it was unexpected and shocking it really made up for some of the other episodes overall it was an okay season and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the series
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to admit that I initially was not a huge fan of Jillian Michaels. I am very self-motivated and do not enjoy, nor do I need, someone yelling at me to get results. However, this DVD is fantastic for getting you back into the swing of working out. I will occasionally take breaks from my regular routine and whenever I'm ready to seriously start working out again, I pop in this DVD. It's only 20-25 minutes long, works your whole body, gets your heart pumping and you definitely feel it the following day. I feel as if you do need to supplement it with 30 minutes of cardio and you shouldn't stay too long on the first level. Since purchasing this DVD I've purchased a number of other JM DVDs and there is no question that she definitely gives you a good workout and knows what she's talking about. If, like me, you don't like the constant 'motivating' that Jillian provides, you can always press the mute button once you get the workouts down. Highly recommend this DVD.

I am really looking forward to what will no doubt be a very descriptive and colorful historical depiction of living during the 60s.  The story is described as being one highlighting time travel so,  I know that the story line will be interesting in terms of retrospect, introspect, and foreshadowing.  King is so awesome at telling a story and developing his characters, so  I am sure that I will be in for a real treat as well as a pretty good refresher on American history.
B005JLNALG|5.0|I liked this album far better than Road Salt One. The first time I listened to it I thought hmm, this is just like Road Salt One. But then I started having parts of the songs get stuck in my head and I found myself wanting to listen to this album more and more. The lyrics are beautiful and Daniel Gildenlow's singing is perfect. The music is a lot more mellow than on Road Salt One which I found a bit rigid. I feel this album really exemplifies the concepts trying to get across on these two albums.  I would say this is the best PoS album since BE. A very emotional and thought provoking album that I could listen to everyday.  I would definitely recommend this album for any PoS fan or anyone that wants an album that really makes you feel the music and the thoughts behind the music.

B0055PMJMW|5.0|Each of the three short tales in this kindle version is excellent. We read how Harry doggedly uses his understanding of human nature generally and criminals in particular to solve crime cases.<br /><br />Suicide Run<br /> The first focuses on a time that Bosch was a night shift detective and hears about the third apparent suicide during his four days on night shift. But was it a suicide? The woman was a very pretty 24 year old who was trying to get into the film industry. Bosch discovers some inconsistencies, including an apparent suicide note, written in pencil, but no pencil nearby.<br /><br />Cielo Azul<br /> The second case is a first person account where Bosch expresses his anguish about a case that began ten years earlier. An approximately fifteen year old nude girl is found who was strangled. Bosch works with an FBI profiler, who appears in another novel, and discovers the killer. Now ten years later he is still trying to find out who the girl is. He visits the killer, a week before his execution, hoping that the killer will reveal her identity.<br /><br />One Dollar Jackpot<br /> This clever third tale is about a 38 year old female poker player who is shot outside her home after winning over six thousand dollars. Bosch is convinced that her husband committed the murder, but how can he prove it. He uses a trick.
B004Y6MU6S|3.0|Sanderson's MISTBORN trilogy was a breath of fresh air in the world of fantasy novels. I loved it. I approached this book with some apprehension, as I knew it was the first in a 10 volume series, and I'm not likely to live long enough to ever see that last volume. Also, I feared that Sanderson might have been influenced by whatever possessed Robert Jordan via Sanderson's contract to finish the Jordan WHEEL OF TIME series. After reading WAY OF KINGS (WoK), I'm convinced that he does want to emulate Jordan's business model: write an indefinitely long series (you don't believe 10 is the real limit, do you?), then accumulate a gaggle of fanatical followers who will buy every volume and defend him vociferously against all criticism. That's too bad, because Sanderson could do so much better.   The central problem with WoK is not only that it is the beginning of a very (very) long series, but Sanderson decided that it must be 1,000 pages long. Such a degree of planning is not bad per se, but in this case it is detrimental to the novel. There is a lot of filler that is not going to matter in the long run. More seriously, it means that the characters have to be dumb as rocks or blind to the obvious until the right moment comes along when it's OK for them to realize some critical truth that should have been obvious 600 pages earlier.   The most egregious example of this is Kaladin, who fails to realize that he has Powers until just before the end of the book. Kaladin encounters a multitude of perils, but survives them all. For example, he runs through storms of arrows carrying a wooden bridge as part of an assault. When he puts the thing down, there are arrows stuck everywhere, except where Kaladin was standing. And of course, he's untouched. Whenever one of these astronomically unlikely pieces of good luck happens, all the power crystals around him (which are, conveniently enough, used as money so there's always an excuse for somebody nearby to have a few in their pocket) are drained. You think maybe he used The Power to deflect the arrows? Nah, he's sure it's just good luck. Every single time it--or a similarly unlikely event--happens, he fails to Get It--until the author has written enough pages and is near his 1K goal. That's just plain bad writing.   The world Sanderson imagines is...well, weird. To me, it seems very vaguely imagined, and difficult to see in a consistent way. For example, there are these \\"spren\\" all around that manifest themselves at times when the author thinks they should. There are firespren, rotspren, and gloryspren, to name just three. They're sort of like primitive ideas about spirits that inhabit everything; this is called \\"animism\\" by anthropologists. But in Sanderson's world, spren are supposed to be real. The problem is that they don't behave in any logical or consistent way. It's not clear what their role in the world is. For example, do rotspren cause rot, or are they merely a sign of rot? If the former, then does Sanderson's world really not have bacteria and fungi that break down dead organic matter? If the latter, then rotspren are kind of redundant, aren't they? They're like the bad smell that accompanies rotting--a mere epiphenomenon. The same goes for the spren that make people sick. Do we have pathogens in Sanderson's world, or is all sickness magical? Why would \\"gloryspren\\" manifest around a man when he does something heroic? Do they help him be heroic, or are they like a halo to show he's a hero? That I'm even asking such questions shows that, for me at least, there's a serious problem with the coherence of Sanderson's world building. I'm not convinced. I should say that the world of MISTBORN caused me no such problems.   Why did I give WoK even three stars? Because it's not totally bad. Aside from the irritations I mentioned, it was readable. It just wasn't very enjoyable, and it was much worse than this author is capable of. I'm not going to be buying the second volume.   Some reviewers havecalled this book \\"epic\\". I call it a brick. In fact, it should have a warning label: \\"This book may cause serious injury under the influence of gravity.\\" In other words, don't put it on a bookshelf above your bed.
B00138J1Z8|5.0|One of Beck's best.  The opening of Loose Cannon is worth the price of the album alone.  But there is so much more.  Beck's style is just pure, earth-shattering insanity, with a hint of moderation.  Buy this album, you won't regret it.

1451648537|5.0|Capitalism and technology has been taking a toll in humanity. Although Einstein once said \\"It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity\\", this progression has not raised much awareness, let alone actions, even among the brightest thinkers: we either refused to admit it or simply feel powerless in front of the full speeding wheels of modern technology.<br /><br />Steve Jobs had his own opinion and took actions: he believed that humanity and technology are the best things of human race, and the integration of the two will yield the most beautiful fruit.<br /><br />He treated his products as incarnation of his ideology. He relentlessly strived to infuse art and humanity into his products at the DNA level. The products that he created have unprecedented user experience: users are informed or entertained effortlessly, constantly. With a move of your fingertip, anything on earth, from pure junk to the most beautiful intellectual creations of human beings, can be shipped to you in digital form at lightening speed, seamlessly, in a sense pleasing way. When you are holding this powerful and beautiful tool in your hand, you feel that you are connected, not lost, not abandoned.<br /><br />Apple's experience is everything but waking up human's imagination and aesthetic consciousness. Steve Jobs probably knew it better than everyone else:  art and creativity come from the lonely journey of a hungry soul, from the painful struggling in front of thousands of unknowns, from experiencing the imperfection; they don't come from the colorful images and texts in well-proportioned font at your fingertip.<br /><br />It would be unfair to label Steve Jobs as businessman, entrepreneur, innovator or even artist or poet, although he was all of the above and was outstanding in each of these fields. What makes Steve Jobs Steve Jobs is his faith in both humanity and technology, his courageous battle to intertwine the DNA of the two. It is too early to tell if Steve Jobs succeeded in this sense.<br /><br />100 years from now, if human beings still survive, maybe people can tell if Steve Jobs fulfilled his dream, or if anyone will ever be able to fulfill this dream.<br /><br />What I like best about this book is that the author, standing at a higher level, sees something more fundamental inside Steve Jobs behind his good and bad, his struggling and his success; but the author chose to simply convey the facts, and leave the conclusion open ended. On contrary to Apple products, this book left some blank space, which the readers and the future may fill.

It's simplicity is what makes it so easy to understand. It's not to my surprise this is a best seller. Enjoy your read and let your mind open to the world of a young boy.

0553801473|1.0|What started out as a seemingly great new epic fantasy more than 10 years ago now has become something akin to the Star Wars prequels. Just an unmitigated disaster. The series did have problems from the start but they were originally outweighed by the positives: GRR Martin's writing ability and his imagination. Sadly, slowly the problems have overcome anything that was once good about this story.<br /><br />The story has many different points of view that change, disappear, and reappear as the story churns ever on. There is plenty of smut and people can die in sudden twists (and then magically come back! yipee!). That is the same way a soap opera works. Grr Martin is a good writer though. By the middle of this book, Grr Martin's good writing is a dead horse and the soap opera has been beating it all night and all morning (imagine a morning that lasts several days - oh wow man). The horse is just basically a red smear on the ground. The Dany chapters literally vomit out a never ending list of bizarre names and forgettable characters. Does anyone truly feel like they know these characters beyond a sorta pikachu card like depth? While this list of characters scrolls through, instead of feeling as if this is part of some grand story we feel confined to a small and boring court. While on the other hand, every freaking meal is described in detail. The sex scenes are creepy smut from a man who is not experienced with women. Asha is so hollywood badgirrrl it makes me want to puke. What a boring and flat character. Not to mention completely useless. Some characters have shown some growth which is quite the feat for just a couple thousand pages! Sansa learned how to care about others and scheme. Oh but she disappeared a couple books ago I think... Oh well! Bring in the tough bad girrrls! Yeah, she's got a double bladed axe and knows how to use it! She acts like the women in Martin's favorite pornos! His dream come true. And talk about hollywood, how about the endless it's-a-small-world-after-all moments Tyrion has as he meets other characters by chance? And another 'did that character really die?' cliffhanger. Wow, really treading some new ground there. Maybe The Bold and The Beautiful is looking for new writers?<br /><br />Another battle of good vs evil within Grr Martin's story is between his colorful imagination and his stupid ideas. One of the original, oh-wow-man's was the seasons lasting several years. A year is really the time for one cycle through the seasons so this sorta inside out nonsensical idea where our year, which does not fit in this fantasy world, is applied to their passing of time is just kinda cross-eyed dumb and silly. But whatever, the way it affects the fantasy is interesting and the color of the imagined is more than the stupidity of the idea. But the ideas jumped the shark with the unsullied as has been pointed out by others. Super Darwin eunuch fighters that can't feel anything (sardaukar/spartan/janissaries smashed together sans manhoods plus numbness - just look at that and consider it). Wow, I dunno about you but I'm terrified. To be honest, I've always imagined these guys as comical so when the Sons of the Harpy get them... I. Don't. Care. But in this book, there aren't that many new ideas. Warging is when people can control animals and is explored more. I wonder where that is going? Hmmm. Tree humpers (aka greenseers) are very rare people that can hump trees and see the past. So kewl! What a climax to Bran's story! Like the Force coming from intracellular bacteria!<br /><br />Add to all this some thrown in lines from Monty Python's like \\"fart in your general direction\\" for good measure and you have a big time hit! Maybe Grr himself sees the whole series as a big stupid joke at this point? He doesn't really seem to care. Whatever, you'll buy it. Rated Arg for Pirate, f you.mall-world-after-all moments Tyrion has as he meets other characters by chance? And another 'did that character really die?' cliffhanger.

B0000D8HDF|5.0|Cyprien Katsaris spent considerable time getting the playing of the Liszt transcriptions of all 9 Beethoven Symphonies just right and the result is one of the finest most beautiful CD sets on the market.If you cannot imagine liking Beethoven's symphonies played ONLY by piano, well you owe yourself a treat that you will play over and over. I cannot imagine anyone playing these transcriptions better. Listening again to the 6th.,7th.,and 8th.this PM, I must say, Franz Liszt himself might have been pleased with this effort. And in the year of the 200 birth anniversary of Liszt, that is good. This set is worth a celebration of the Liszt birth this year!
B005FJ7DOM|2.0|I found this movie absolutely depressing from start to finish.  These characters are trying to make it to New Eden, but this movie isn't really all that much about vampires, as it is their treck to get to this New Eden, which they never show, and how they continue to cross paths with this religious fanatic self appointed leader, and his demented zealots.  I love how pathetic producers and movies end up writing in the same stereotypical bad guy religious leaders as the main enemy, it's like they can't help themselves, they're almost like the zombie vampires they portray in their movies, unable to quench their own thirst.  The only reason I upgraded it to two stars, because they got me to watch it at least once.  It wasn't 100% bad, \\"some\\" decent parts in it.  However, not enough.  I will never watch this movie again.  Even if I was left with only one movie on this planet, I'd burn this one, and create my own.

0439023513|2.0|I haven't been this disappointed in a book series since George R. R. Martin completely destroyed the Song of Fire and Ice series with the hot mess that is A Feast For Crows. Prior to this eye-burning slush-pile of word drool, I was on a personal crusade to convince everyone who came into ear shot that if there was only one book series they ever read, this should be it. Unlike a lot of hot young adult fiction (*cough* Twilight *cough*) Suzanne Collins can really write, and she managed to craft a story and a world that utterly sucked me in, with a protagonist I could actually relate to. It meant a lot to me that Katniss wasn't the typical heart-on-your-sleeve teen girl trolling for love, but someone with real problems and responsibilities thrust into a terrible, desperate situation. Collins also managed to give me two romantic love interests to root for, and like all good triangles, it was almost impossible for me to pick a side. The action was intense, the violence reasonable repulsive without being heavy handed, and while I felt confident that Katniss would live, beyond that I could never tell which direction she would pull me. And she did, in fact, pull me; I've read the first two books in this series at least three times a piece, and as a writer myself, I literally studied them to see what techniques Collins used to effectively build a world and allow her characters to slowly mature.<br /><br />Then she dropped the ball. Completely.<br /><br />I suspect that, like JK Rowling with Harry Potter, that Collins felt enormous pressure to churn out the final book in the series, and perhaps finished with greater haste as a result. Still, I wish she had pushed back, because this book is a mess: my favorite character (Peeta) is no longer likable; Katniss is no longer likable; Gale is no longer likable. Halfway through instead of being disgusted by violence I was hoping they'd all get infected with a disfiguring virus that would send them to the infirmary for the next hundred pages and give the reader a much-need break. Unlike the previous page turners, this both moved too fast and too slow, with many high action scenes demanding a second read to discern what happened (some things I didn't even get till I read them on these boards) and several high emotion scenes moving slower than an 80s-era soap opera without the Palmolive commercials. Even the things I should have had an emotional reaction to, like Prim's death, summoned the sort of reaction I might have if I were waiting too long in the pharmacy line: mild annoyance. Not what I expected, considering my reaction to the death of every character, large and small, in the first two books.<br /><br /> About 90 pages in I received an urgent email from a friend who had read the entire series with me with a capslock subject line that read: WHAT PAGE ARE YOU ON?

B005KDWUFA|3.0|I love Il Divo and have since they started recording having collected all their CD's and DVD's.  (As a passionate opera fan these are the only \\"pop, crossover\\" singers that I do collect. I have the 3 Michaels; Michael Feinstein, Michael Buble and Michael Ball, but all else are opera stars.  In comparison with previous albums, I'm just not as enamored with the songs on this album as some of the previous ones.  Of all the tracks, I think that \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" is probably my favorite. I can't stand Boccelli and Brightman and would not ever listen to their version unless hogtied.  I also wish they would furnish English translations in the album booklet for those of use not fluent in the languages in which they sing - a minor complaint, however. I'm also not usually familiar with the popular songs they record but they have enough that I know or at least learn to like very much.  If you like the songs on the album, you would probably grant the 5 star rating.   I take nothing away from their performance on this album, as the 3 stars was for the song quality NOT their performance which is, as usual, excellent.  I don't really care much for \\"Wicked Game\\" and had hoped they would perform some songs in a slightly more classical genre as they are so capable and Seb's voice and technique have improved so much.  Carlos, David and Urs, of course, can sing anything; but a little Puccini, Verdi, Bizet, even Gershwin, would be welcome. Their treatment would be interesting and who knows - the world may embrace such an album. The duets from Don Carlos and The Pearl Fishers come to mind - ummm - would like to hear them try those two numbers.  I'm also disappointed in the number of songs - 10 tracks is a lean album compared to many that I buy with as many as 17 - 20 tracks.  They are still improving the pop genre but I think they are so accomplished now that they could really take some classical or opera risks with their next album - that was what I hoped this one would be and wasn't.  I'll keep listening to my favorite previous albums more than this one but glad I have a complete collection.  Also, very happy they are still together and ready for another world tour; I hope to catch at least one live performance.  This may appeal more to younger fans than those of us who have so many years of great music in our heads.  I'd like to hear them perform some more challenging compositions next time is all.    I have seen them in person and can only say if you like their albums - see them in person as they are much, much more exciting live and in concert!  They will blow you away in person if you love their sound  - and I certainly do!
B004HW7JMY|4.0|This prequel blends well with the original series. If you like spartcus blood and sand you will like this. But there is defiently alot more sexual scenes, and its more to how Roman's culture was in that time period, so don't watch this with the kids. The graphics are well done, and the acting is spot on.
0307593312|5.0|I had not heard of Murakami until I read a short article about \\"1Q84\\" in \\"Esquire.\\" Due to the broadly mixed reviews on Amazon, I was skeptical whether I would like the book. But I read it anyway, and was enchanted. It's a long book, which is off-putting to some, but when a novel is as magnificent as this one, I just want it to go on and on. So much of \\"1Q84\\" is unforgettable. I was fascinated with the way in which Murakami gradually intertwined the many tentacles of the lives of the two principal characters and their acquaintances. The structure was brilliant.  Some reviewers have complained about Murakami's repetitive style, but I found the repetition to be a distinctly positive element of the novel. Each restatement of a previously-referenced incident or chain of thoughts was nuanced. The characters mulled events over in their minds repeatedly, gradually distilling them into their essential meanings in the manner in which people actually crystalize memories of their experiences. I also found the fantastical elements of the story to be charming and memorable. As some other reviewers have noted in so many words, certain ideas and images embedded in fiction should simply be absorbed. Interpreting a story rationally with the conscious mind is not always as enriching as bathing the subconscious mind in a pool of mythological and archetypal imagery. I won't stop thinking about this book for a long time, and I will definitely read more Murakami.
0316017922|3.0|I've been told by so many that this is a wonderful book, a \\"must read\\" even from a college professor.  however I found it too repetitive after a while. the point is made early in the book, and the rest are \\"only\\" very interesting details of outliers. starts out a fun read, but then it gets repetitive and long.   perhaps the disappointment came from my great expectations of it.  I'd much rather recommend blink.
0307389839|5.0|Employing his no-frills prose, Murakami weaves together narratives on running and writing and how the two feed each other. Consistency, not talent, seems to be the key to success in both endeavors, hopeful news to those of us who aren't exactly brimming over with the latter, but have a developed a  fairly decent work ethic.  Murakami is, of course, supremely talented as a writer and consistent in his running.  No surprise he's a success at both. Raymond Carver fans will recognize the title as a play on Carver's story collection \\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\\" which Murakami was translating at one time.   What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is an interesting glimpse into the world of one of today's most interesting writers.

1897299214|5.0|Very funny book about a serious subject, Guy Delisle's PYONGYANG is a small view of one of the World's most secretive and dangerous countries, done in a scale of black, white and grays and with a dry humour it made a very pleasant and amusing read!
0156027321|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is an amazing and unique story about Pi, a boy who grows up living at his father's zoo in India. When Pi is a teenager, his family decides to sell the zoo and sail to Canada in search of a better life. Their ship sinks mid-journey, and Pi finds himself alone on a boat with only the company of several zoo animals, including a 450-pound tiger. Lost at sea, Pi struggles to stay alive while drifting aimlessly across the ocean in a tiny lifeboat with a ferocious cat on board.<br /><br />This really is an incredible story; so original and engaging. It's definitely a story about survival, but that is not really the core of the novel. There are religious aspects explored throughout the book, and even a decent amount of humor, which is unexpected in these dire circumstances. However, this book is really about the strength of the individual, and the different ways people attempt to shape their own realities as a sort of coping mechanism to get through the most difficult of times.<br /><br />It really is a great book. I loved every page.

B002SRQ214|5.0|Found this on sale here and chose this model based on the cost benefit from the model/price.  The next model up (975) was $20-40 for  more and was finding the model lower (955) for roughly the same price, so went with this.    The benchmarks are right at where I've seen others reporting online (using Prime 95) on my Gigabyte ga-880ga-ud3h board.  One strange thing was that there was a smudge on the chip that could be seen through the packaging.  I took it out and the smudge was still there, I rubbed it off and it was fine.  The heat sink comes with stock thermal pad so no thermal grease was needed.  It runs 25c-40c (max) using website authoring tools (Adobe Suite) and general internet browsing with video and high quality audio.  I stressed it for 4+ hours at 53c with no errors.  Get it while the price is good!
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|i was so excited for this book to come out,but i was really quite dissapointed. while the book had some definite strong points (finding the tissue samples the Society had taken and the river ride of doom with indie towards the end), there was no climax to the book. both of the two prevously mentioned events would have made excellent climaxes, had they been eleborated on a bit, and had had more detail. And it seemed like every other paragraph was symbolic of something. symbolism is great, but when it was so overused as it was in this novel, it starts to get very boring. becuase of this, im giving Crossed 3 stars. hopefully the third book makes up fo this one.

B0045HCJR6|4.0|Who am I to presume to review one of the all time greats?  I'm giving it  just four stars solely on the basis of its being a little dated.  It's been twenty years since I last saw this marvel.  Three  things struck me that I'd not noticed earlier.  (1) How really small Debbie Reynolds's role is (2) Donald O'Connor's \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" is actually a brilliant introduction to break dancing; and (3) Gene Kelly's amazing knee flexibility.  Watch him in one of his Kelly-O'Connor duets.  He has a singular attribute there seen nowhere else.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|OK, so I'm a little embarrassed at how much I enjoy Il Divo--but honestly, what's not to love?  I am a sucker for over the top strings, epic vibrato, and vocal drama, and no one can deliver it like this foursome.  Have you ever dreamed of hearing Chris Isaak's \\"Wicked Game\\" performed with operatic intensity, backed by a full orchestra?  Well, here we have it, and it is as completely overwrought as you could ever imagine--but in a good way.  That segues directly into an a-capella reverb fest of the guys singing Roy Orbison's \\"Crying\\" as if it were a prayer.  \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" gets the English treatment; the Lloyd Weber touchstone was already a highly dramatized affair, so it doesn't seem as completely surprising an arrangement here.  \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\", made famous by Bocelli, is sung in both English and Italian, and is treated reverentially.  It manages to remind but not make one long for Bocelli's version--it is good enough to stand on its own highly decorated legs.  Is this great music?  No, and I know that I am going to make some people upset by saying this.  This is music which is perfect when you need drama, drama, drama.  It is perfect for crying your eyes out, for feeling overly emotional, for when you need something to listen to as you stand at the top of a very high tower and contemplate the mist shrouded valley far below, your ever approaching mortality, and the long lost love of your life.  I would never place this beside Verdi, or Puccini--they are simply different things.  But these guys all have beautiful voices, they sing passionately, and the results are great when you need something like this.   This disc is not for the tragically hip. It will probably not appeal to sk8ers, surfers or skydivers.  It is for rainy afternoons, for crisp dawns just touched by frost, and for those who cry at Charlotte's Web and Sounder.  Five stars for being true to what Il Divo has always set out to do--make beautiful, emotional operatically sung music that is not hard to understand, and is easy to give your heart to.  Embrace your need for this sort of music, go ahead, we won't judge, and give it a guilty little spin.  You might find yourself doing it more often than you thought.

B005EHNEDO|5.0|I bought this the week it came out. I have to admit that I listened to it once, didn't care for it, and didn't listen to it again for another week. And I WANTED to like it. This bothered me because I have been listening to Uncle Tupelo since No Depression was released and have been listening to Wilco since AM, liking both bands a great deal.  So I tried it again. Then again.  Some songs started to grow on me, but others didn't.  \\"Art of Almost\\" is pleasantly divergent from their previous work. It is almost haunting at times and I found that it kept popping into my head over and over again. \\"I Might\\" is probably the most upbeat song that Wilco has written to date. I love it. But having it near the beginning of the album, meant the rest was downhill for me. This does not happen often, but what I realized is that it is the alternation between fast and slow songs that doesn't work for me. I prefer it when the momentum builds over time, with each song being better than the last. As such, I re-sequenced the songs and found a song order that really works for me. I now like the album MUCH better.  MUCH !!! I started listening to the album daily. The more I listened, the more I liked it. Now, I actually think it's a great album, possibly being one of their best. If you want to try a different order, here's what worked for me:  Art Of Almost  Sunloathe  Black Moon  Open Mind  Born Alone  Dawned On Me  Standing O  I Might  Rising Red Lung  Whole Love  One Sunday Morning (.....)  Capitol City

B0054N73EY|5.0|Without John Frusciante (JF), I was skeptical. He was the major creative force that created BSSM after all, one of the greatest albums in rock history. JF is g-d, in my musical world. But I love Flea, Anthony Keidis and Chad Smith and i trusted them musically to create more good music even w/o JF.   Josh Klinghoffer (JK) does excellent work on \\"I'm With You\\". He spent lots of time with JF and did a few albums with JF prior to JF leaving the RHCPs. JK also toured with the RHCPs in 2006 as the rythym guitarist etc. So he's got creds to be a RHCP. And after hearing him on \\"I'm With You\\", I'm convinced there is no better guitarist in the universe to be the RHCP's guitar player after the departure of JF.  \\"I'm With You\\" is a great album start to finish. Its a great product from the evolution of the RHCPs. The RHCPs have really honed in on their funk/rock sound here, its so smooth. It has funky, rockin beats (Ethiopia, Adventures)...Rockin ballads (Brendan's, Police Station)...New territory for the RHCPs (Did I Let You Know)...And everything in between. I love the polished sound. If at first you don't like a song or two, give the rest of the album a chance. It's brilliant, my favorite album right now.
0385486804|5.0|Having read \\"Into the Wild\\" brought many questions on my mind. About searching for the purpose of my life, being true to myself and my ideals. What is more important: relationships with other people, or living up to my dreams? When studying the character of Chris through Krakauer's story and through the eyes of others who met him I see a unique personality. He disagrees with exploiting the Earth. He strives to live up to his ideals and not make compromises. Overall I find him to be a gentle, somewhat shy person deeply searching for the real meaning of life. Definitely I wouldn't describe Chris as aggressive. I could find most of Chris's character traits in my own personality. Probably that's why I couldn't break away from reading this book.  I could see how the character of Chris was formed and grew in the story. He was very close to settling down and even finding a true relationship, love and acceptance in Carthage, South Dakota where he worked hard at the grain elevator. His death in Alaska was the tragic part of the story.   But who of us knows the day and hour, when we'll leave this Earth and stand before the judgment of God? Is my lamp going to have oil, or is He going to say \\"I don't know you\\" as in the parable with the 10 virgins?  These deep thoughts made the book worth reading for me. After a long time, this was a book that deeply touched my heart, mind and soul.

Through real statistical analysis the authors dispel countless myths about who becomes and stays financial secure and why.  I read this book about 5 years before writing this review and it still affects my financial decisions. Really happy that I read this before the downturn in the economy!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This movie is tied with Pride and Prejudice BBC (1995) as my favorite movies of all time. There is so much emotion shown through these characters. The actors are brilliant. This is THE BEST adaptation of Jane Eyre!<br /><br />However, I was hoping for better film quality on this dvd. I watched this movie on YouTube and this dvd does not look much better. Oh well, perhaps one day they will put this on Blu-Ray.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|the music in this album is SO annoying, especially the lyrics! it's so random and doesn't make any sense. almost every song is the same thing. So disappointed. Especially run the world!
0439023521|5.0|I love dystopian stories, and that's why I wanted to read this, but I was surprised to discover that a large part of this book is a love story.  Well...love/friendship.  And I really enjoyed it because of this.  Of course, there is still suspense and action and mystery, which make this story extremely well-rounded.  Sometimes I am put off by a story told in the first person, but this one didn't bother me at all.  It actually makes it seem like the main character is in the room, relating this whole story to us in person.<br /><br />The main character is very believable.  I was sort of expecting a kick-butt type of girl, but there's more to her than that.  Yes, she has awesome aim and can definitely kill things, but she also feels fear and gets queasy around nasty wounds, and she's human...she doesn't want to kill anybody.  I both love and hate how she can't sort out her feelings for these two guys.  I mean, I WANT her to just love Peeta already, but she can't make herself do that, which is a lot like real life.  Sometimes there's a really great person who loves you, but you're just not feelin' it.  I really hope it works out in the end, but I'll still love the trilogy if it doesn't.  I'll love it because it makes me feel these things, and only a great book can do that.<br /><br />They've made a movie of this already, which will be out March of 2012 (as of now), and I have a feeling that people who haven't read the books are going to want to after they see the movie.  This trilogy could very well be the replacement for the Twilight series; I think it'll be extremely successful.  I read this book in 2 days!  (Which is impressive, since I work and have little kids.)
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|So, yeah, two spins through the new album and my impression is that it's just fine if we're going by the modern day Megadeth standard.  Better than ENDGAME but not as good as UNITED ABOMINATIONS.  Megadeth is far more genuine and relevant than Metallica at this point.  That's not exactly news.  But, really, this isn't strong enough to make me want to listen over, say, In Flames' latest, the amazing (don't believe the haters) SOUNDS OF A PLAYGROUND FADING.  And, you know, I'm getting too old to \\"work\\" at liking stuff.  Either it hits me quickly or it goes to the bookshelf.  This is probably going to the bookshelf.  Which is not to say there aren't some good songs here...\\"Black Swan\\" sticks out immediately as a really solid track.  But, come on, let's be honest.  This totally pales in comparison to the 1990-1994 heyday.  And, frankly, I'm guessing that I'll consider this vastly inferior to THE WORLD NEEDS A HERO when it's all said and done.  Dave, you're still The Man but it just kinda seems like you're trying *too* hard to stay relevant...to the point where you're second guessing yourself musically.  Trying to walk that line between What You Actually Like and What You Think People Want to Hear.  And that never works.  Or seldom.  Well, it never works for older bands.  Stop trying to defend your legacy vis-a-vis Metallica (seriously, nobody gives a you know what about Metallica...I don't care how many people go to their shows...musically they are a total joke now) and just record something totally honest.  When Dave is quoted as saying that he feels this is his best album ever...um, right.  It just reeks of insecurity.  This has NOTHING on RIP or CTE.  Just being honest.  Unlike Dave.  Look, nobody really believes Megadeth is capable of producing another RUST IN PEACE any more than Metallica is going to do another MASTER or JUSTICE...or even, heck, LOAD at this point.  But it's hard to believe Dave can do another UNITED ABOMINATIONS or CRYPTIC WRITINGS (totally grew on me btw).  So is it worth it?  Dunno.  Depends on how big a fan you are.  I'm a pretty big fan but I'd rather listen to YOUTHANASIA for the 100th time over this for a 3rd time...sorry.n me btw).  So is it worth it?  Dunno.  Depends on how big a fan you are.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I've been using the older SB-800 with my Nikon D3X for a couple of years and decided to add this SB-900. The upside is that the power and quality of light in the resulting images is noticeably better than the SB-800. The downside is that the SB-900 is a larger unit, making it less portable for travel, and even with lithium batteries recycle time takes noticeably longer. But neither of these reasons have caused me to switch back to the SB-800!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|If there was any justice in the world, this show would have drawn 30 million viewers every week and still be on the air.  That said, while season 2 might not be quite as incredible as season 1, that has more to do with season 1 being literally perfect than season 2 have weaknesses.

B005HJU7HA|4.0|I purchased this collection, which looks excellent, hoping to find a better-formatted Kindle edition than the free (and less complete) Sherlock Holmes collection also available in the Kindle Store, [[ASIN:B000JQU1VS The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]], and one with an active table of contents.  I've looked this new edition over a bit and, while it does have an active TOC for most of the stories, and the formatting is in general quite good (and generally better than the free edition), it is missing or has made changes to some formatting.  These are small things but do affect the reading experience.  For example, white space between sections in at least one story (The Five Orange Pips) is missing and so the natural \\"pause\\" between one section, which covers the events of an evening, and the one that follows the next morning, is lost.  Also, diacritical marks are either dropped or replaced with English \\"equivalents.\\"  For example, \\"née\\" becomes \\"nee\\" and \\"£14,000\\" becomes \\"14,000 pounds.\\"  It leaves me wondering what else may have been changed in this edition as well.  Admittedly, the free edition doesn't handle diacritical marks and special characters properly either but you can see they are there, if mis-rendered.  Certainly these are small things.  But they do detract something from the charm and character of an old work like this.  Otherwise, I appreciate the efforts of the editors of this edition and am happy to pay the very reasonable price they ask for it.

B006470HZ6|1.0|Man oh man, does this review contain spoilers!  On the plus side they did finally get around to weapons training. Good move, that. I'm not sure why it wasn't mandatory, or what everyone else was up to, but Shane took Andrea and Carol out to practice. Let's say that's worth about 5 good storytelling points. Of course, worth about a billion bad points are (in no particular order): using \\"live\\" bait... to noose a walker... in a poisoned well... after literally JUST showing everyone huddled around a topographic map of the area and commenting about offshoots of the freshwater creek. Removing a  contagion from a water supply doesn't magically cure that water; it's still had a dead body in it, regardless of the fact of it being a zombie. It's a coffin martini. I wouldn't drink that water after boiling it for a week straight.  Showing off your special effects skills for no good reason is just laughable (looking your way Michael Bay). If it doesn't fit in with a logical plot all you've done is make a joke to, and really about, the audience. It was stupid to risk Glenn in an effort to save the well; go to the creek for water, or to the stocked truck Shane found like two days ago, or start digging another well, but don't risk someone's life! This isn't the desert, it's Georgia. There is water to be had. I'd want these idiots to leave too if I was Herschel.  And that's just the lowpoint of the episode. Ransacking a pharmacy by passing perfectly good houses en route made no sense either, nor did leaving the horses (again, live bait) tethered outside without a guard, nor did having two people search instead of one guarding the other's back. I watch my buddy's back in a questionable 7-11. I like to think we'd be a little smarter than the average bear during the Apocalypse.  This one started cheesy, got dumb, and stayed stupid. So theoretically, it can only go back up from here, right?
B004WDRSO2|4.0|Watching this movie brought back so many memories of when I was younger and I was so happy that I bought this DVD/Blu Ray combo.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|A continuation of the previous format with little to no deterioration in the further developing plot. It seems as though you are turning a corner several times per episode. I do not watch the show religiously since I am working a rotating schedule, but I always buy the full season to watch it straight through when I have the time. This series is sure to maintain any viewer's interest since the format does not take too many zany moments but contains just enough humor to keep the show from becoming too monotonous. Excellent viewing and vigorously recommended by this viewer.

If you are a CCR fan but have only heard just their radio stuff you will not be disappointed in the rest of their music that usually receives no air play.  Great songs on every album.  Only stuff I don't listen too is their pre-CCR music which is 50 era sounding music that is included on disk with this set.  The sound quality is very good (relative to an average listener) for music recorded in the 60s and early 70s.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film start to finish. Easily the best low budget sci-fi horror comedy film I've ever watched.  As absurd as it looks on the surface, it quickly takes on a sense of believability as the very solid characters are introduced. They are three dimensional and evolve in the course of the film.  The neighborhood seems real, gritty and violent. The bad guys who become heroic are actually bad, not misunderstood.  The creatures are oddly believable, well designed and reasonably motivated. They are animals behaving like animals and able to die like animals, not super human aliens or zombies. Terry Notary (choreographer, movement coach: creature movement, etc.), who has been involved with many big budget movies, injects and extra degree of reality to these shark mouth, wolfy gorilla looking predators. Love the teeth.  The film is nicely spiced with a little social commentary, satire, stoner comedy, neighborhood dynamics and lots of fun.  For those who care, there is some gore but more often implied, as with splashes of blood from off camera.  While you may not love it like I did, you have to at least enjoy it.

B004A8ZWWO|5.0|Tower Heist is a funny movie. Ben Stiller plays a building manager named Josh Kovacs. He enlists the services of a thief named Slide.  He is played by Eddie Murphy.  Kovacs needs help to retrieve 20 million dollars in pension money.  This is money that collectively t belongs to every employee of the building.  This movie is stolen by a character played by Alan Alda. I like the way Stiller's characters gets everyone involved in the heist.  The cast includes Casey Affleck, Michael Pena, Matthew Broderick and Gabourey Sidibe. All of their performances are good here.  Each character posseses a trait that adds to the plot and humor of the movie.. My favorite part of the movie is when Eddie Murphy challenges everyone to steal something from a shopping mall to prove that they have what it takes to pull off a heist. Tower Heist features a  Ferrari 250 GT Lusso that once belonged to actor Steve McQueen.  This beautiful red car plays an important part in the film. This film is superbly scored by composer Christophe Beck. The Tower Heist theme is a groovy techno sound with a fantastic bass.  His music adds tension at the appropriate times in the film. Tower Heist is an entertaining film with a superb cast.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|Note:  This review also applies to [[ASIN:B005J29HCQ The Smile Sessions (2CD)]]  Other than The Beatles' GET BACK album, which still has not been released in its original form (the Spectorized [[ASIN:B0025KVLV0 Let It Be (Remastered)]] and the remixed, de-Spectorized [[ASIN:B0000DJZA5 Let It Be... Naked]] notwithstanding), The Beach Boys' SMiLE project is the most famous (and maybe infamous) unreleased album in rock history.  Originally planned as a follow-up to 1966's [[ASIN:B00005ASHM Pet Sounds]], Brian Wilson scrapped the project in mid-1967 after months of work, believing he had lost his competition with The Beatles, and the pressures from the other Beach Boys, plus legal problems with Capitol Records, finally wore him down.  A replacement album, [[ASIN:B000002TR9 Smiley Smile]], cobbled together by the group using only the \\"Good Vibrations\\" single and fragments from the original sessions - the rest of the album was rerecorded - was a critical and commercial flop.  Fragments of SMiLE were issued on later Beach Boys albums such as [[ASIN:B000002TRD 20/20]] and [[ASIN:B000008DA7 Surf's Up]].  In 1993, about an hour of lost SMiLE music was issued on the [[ASIN:B000002UR4 Good Vibrations: Thirty Years Of The Beach Boys]] boxed set.  Then, in 2004, Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks completed a new version of SMiLE and recorded it with Brian's new band, The Wondermints ([[ASIN:B0002LI11M Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]); a live concert version, recorded earlier that year in London, was also issued on DVD.  Now, with the impending 50th anniversary of The Beach Boys approaching, Capitol Records, along with Brian, has released two versions of THE SMiLE SESSIONS - a basic two-disc version, and a nine-disc box set (five CDs, two vinyl LPs, and two vinyl 45 RPM singles).  The first CD, which contains the same contents in both releases, contains a newly revised SMiLE album, using the same running order as the 2004 remake, giving us an idea of what the album would have sounded like in 1967.  Most of the tracks are mono, as Brian always preferred; he was deaf in one ear, and could not hear stereo sound properly, and as a producer, he believed that only mono mixes could present the music to the listener as he wanted it heard.  Stereo, Brian believed, left too much to the listener's equipment setup.  While I would have loved to have a stereo version of the album, as was done with [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]] box set in 1996, the producers explained that unlike Pet Sounds, most of the multi-track masters and many of the components were lost, so a stereo remix of SMiLE was impossible to produce.  The second CD of the first version contains session highlights from \\"Our Prayer\\" to \\"Good Vibrations\\" - more than enough to satisfy the casual Beach Boy fan.  The deluxe box set is aimed more at collectors and die-hards, and what a collection it is.  CD1 is identical to the first version, but CDs 2 through 5 contain a very comprehensive view of the SMiLE sessions.  So comprehensive, in fact, that the \\"Heroes and Villains\\" sections take up about 90 percent of CD2, and the \\"Good Vibrations\\" sessions take up all of CD5.  While somewhat repetitive, the session tapes offer fascinating listening, showing Brian's perfectionism and dedication to getting the right sound.  I'm sure he drove the other musicians and the other Beach Boys crazy, but it was obviously worth the effort.  The two-LP vinyl album in the deluxe edition follows tracks 1-19 of CD1 for the first three sides.  The fourth side contains rare stereo mixes that are not included on the CDs.  The two 45s are the singles that never were, the two-part \\"Heroes and Villains\\" single, and the \\"Vega-Tables\\"/\\"Surf's Up\\" single.  Packaging and amenities are impressive.  The two-disc set includes a colorful 36-page booklet, a SMiLE button, and a fold-out poster of the album artwork.  The deluxe edition is even more impressive; the artwork on the box cover has 3-D graphics; the inside of the boxlid has the original back cover of the Duophonic (fake stereo) release of the album, had it been issued.  Inside the box are a 60-page hardcover book with additional essays and a complete sessionography; a double-gatefold sleeve with slots for all five CDs and the two vinyl 45s; the two-record vinyl album in a mono jacket with a gatefold sleeve and a 10\\" photo album inside; and a giant-economy-size version of the album artwork poster.  The casual fan will probably make do with the two-disc set, but collectors will want both.  I'd love to see The Beatles and Apple do a similar box set for the GET BACK SESSIONS, not to mention the long-lost LET IT BE DVD.  Some additional observations:  1) The vinyl LP and singles sound fine.  I especially enjoyed the stereo mixes on Side 4, but wish that they had been on the CD releases.  Although I grew up with vinyl, after listening to CDs for over 20 years, vinyl just sounds flat.  2) The 45 versions of \\"Vega-Tables\\" and \\"Surf's Up\\" are the same as on the LP and CD.  3) If you have the big box set, \\"Heroes and Villains Part 1\\" and \\"Heroes and Villains Part 2\\" are only available on the vinyl 45, though the individual modules for these tracks are probably scattered throughout the four Sessions CDs.  The only way to get the full versions of \\"Heroes and Villains Part 1\\" and \\"Heroes and Villains Part 2\\" on CD is to buy the two-disc set (Tracks 2 and 3 on CD2).  All of the other tracks on that disc can be found on the session box set, although some of them are edited (particularly the \\"Good Vibrations\\" sessions).  4) I compared the 20/20 versions of \\"Cabin Essence\\" and \\"Our Prayer,\\" and the 1971 version of \\"Surf's Up,\\" to the SMiLE versions.  Save for stereo remixing and overdubs, the versions are almost identical.  It's amazing that the 1968 overdubbed vocals on \\"Our Prayer\\" are almost perfectly in sync with the 1966 originals - another tribute to Brian's production genius.

B003E6K1VK|4.0|I've been bought into the world of mid-range audio for a few years now. My eyes were really opened when I plugged my Sennheiser HD 558 into a Harman/Kardon receiver, and was greeted with the most awesome sound I have ever heard from a pair of headphones. The clarity and smoothness of the sound was incredible, and the power of the bass trashed anything that even the Beats could put out. Being that I can't be plugged into the receiver all the time, I decided to purchase this as a more mobile solution.  How does it perform? The DAC (essentially an external sound card) portion of the E7 does clean up the audio a lot, compared to coming straight out of my laptop, by cutting down on the hiss and high pitched whine from the electronic equipment. I found this most noticeable when using low-sensitivity headphones like the Etymotic HF3. The amp portion of the E7 does a decent job by giving a little more power to my headphones, increasing soundstage, smoothness, and clarity ever-so-slightly. However, the amp does not compare AT ALL to the power of the amp on the H/K receiver. So if you want a lot of power to your 'phones, definitely be prepared to splurge some more on an E9 as well, or just go for something else altogether. The bass boost is a nice feature. Level 1 is the cleanest boost as it only increases the volume of very low bass. Level 2 and 3 also boost the lower-midrange frequencies, causing some music to sound a bit \\"canned\\". For whatever reason, level 3 doubles the overall volume output. When using a sensitive headphone like the aforementioned Etymotic and level 3 bass boost, I literally have to turn the volume down to 1 (out of 60 levels) to be able to listen comfortably.  The E7 is well-designed. I'm positive that Fiio took design cues from the iPhone, as it looks and feels just like one. A lot of people seem to complain about the front cover scratching easily. People, that is not the actual front cover! There is a thin, plastic, very easy to scratch cover that isinitially placed over the front cover that you have to remove. Once that's done, you'll be left with the actual, very glossy front cover. It hasn't been scratched at all even when I lightly ran a key over it (don't try this though...). The side buttons are nice and clicky, and the interface is easy to navigate. The audio jacks on my E7 are a bit loose, and sometimes the audio will shift and cut if I wiggle the plug too much. Besides the somewhat misleading front cover, this thing is well designed and built, and should stand the test of time.  Overall, the most important metric is, is the E7 worth getting? I'd have to say, \\"it depends\\". Once I get lost in the music, I sometimes forget and have to check whether I'm actually plugged in to the E7 or not. Direct A/B tests will show slight improvements, but they are just that. If your music device (laptop, desktop, phonograph, etc) has a lot of electronic hiss and static, and you can't stand it, then by all means this is the item for you. This summer, I borrowed a Macbook Pro 17\\", and was greeted with the most horrendous crackling and hissing from the audio jack, such that listening to quiet passages in music was literally impossible. The E7 would have been very well suited for improving the audio-out from this laptop. On my regular laptop, a HP Envy 15, there is far less hiss and absolutely no crackling, so the E7 becomes only a marginal improvement. So in the end, it depends on your device, and whether you are already satisfied with the sound on your headphones or want that slight boost in sound quality.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|This album can be thought of as a sequel to DRAMA while still on a trajectory set by recent works such as MAGNIFICATION and THE LADDER.  It's all very nicely done with equal parts thoughtfulness and force.    Meaning no disrespect to Oliver Wakeman, the fact is that Geoff Downes is a master keyboard orchestrator - in that regard perhaps better than Rick; perhaps better than Emerson.  There's a deliberateness to what he does that suits Yes very well now as it did in the DRAMA era and as it has suited Asia all the years in between.    So how is the new guy?  I think he's just fine.  There's no question that he understands the context and his unforced gentle delivery is, dare I say it, a bit of a relief.  Freed of the trippy baggage, the band gets to work and a more producer-coordinated power shines from underneath.  I'm glad that Howe's writing gets good play and the album is slap full of his friendly but still striking guitars.    I would say, buy the CD Deluxe Edition and see them when they tour just as a way to support them and say thanks.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Is anyone convinced that the assemblage that Darius, et al., helped Brian put into some sort of order was what he had in mind back in 66-67?  Impossible.  It was the endless modular madness that kept Brian from ever getting it out in the first place.  So many ways to play with all the pieces, and each assemblage just as compelling as the next.  (A game that would be repeated for decades by the army of fanatical bootlegging devotees.)  Of course, what is truly heart wrenching is just how much of the album was near completion in a realistic sense.  If only Brian had had a strong nudge to prevent the perfect from being the enemy of, well, the already sublime.  The current edition has been assembled, mixed and mastered to such an unimpeachable prpduct.  Really, that was the only important deficit to Brian's 2004 recreation, the loss of the magnificent voices and peerless studio musicians from the original sessions that we are, at last, presented with.  I hope that students and amateur sleuths will continue to experiment with their own modular patchwork of source bits and pieces, but there is no denying that we are now in possession of a most worthy standard.

B002MU4NL8|5.0|Galaxy Quest is probably the most underrated comedies ever in entire history of movie business. It was never fully appreciated by audience and also not liked initially by film critics. The truth is that if you are fan of science-fiction or you know some of s-f classics you will find this movie incredibly funny.<br />Story focused on actors who were starring in TV series Galaxy Quest. That is obviously link to Star Trek. Cast is simply amazing: Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Allan Rickman are creating probably their best comedy performances. Big shock to everyone who knows Ms. Weaver as she plays typical blond bimbo who \\"does only one lazy job\\" in TV series (repeats computer's messages). They are fantastic team together.  Also all supportive cast of aliens is terrific, i.e: Enrico Colantoni as  Mathesar, Patrick Breen as Quellek and (especially) Missi Pyle as Laliari are extremely funny.<br />Special effects are on the highest level. It is comedy of course but all space ships, space itself, equipment etc. are really believable (even beryl sphere!).<br />Worth mentioning are extras on latest Blu-Ray edition. You get full bucket of super supplements and one of the funniest moment ever is to watch rap performed by Sigourney Weaver & the team.<br /><br />US Blu-Ray edition contains English, French, Portuguese, Spanish subtitles and disc is region-free that means you can play it everywhere outside US as well.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002MU4NL8 Galaxy Quest [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00003CXDV Galaxy Quest]]
B00127RAJY|5.0|this was the first dvd that I purchased of Jillian's... so I don't have too much to compare to.  But I've purchased other workout dvd's.  She really does kick your butt.  Your heart rate is constantly beating.  I started with 3 pound weights... but you can modify it to your workout.  Even after doing this for just a straight week, I felt better and stronger!
B001XITTHI|5.0|I love that Stephen King tries different forms of media and I was surprised when I saw this book as a pop-up!  I loved the book so thought I'd take a look. The detail of it is truly amazing. It's definitely an abridged version of the story, but it tells the story and the artwork and details make it fun. Love it!
0007111584|5.0|I ordered this new version of this book and my 3 yr old LOVES it! Some days I read it to him and some days he looks at the pictures and makes up his own stories. Every child big or small will love this book.    I had the orginial version of this book from the 1960's. It was a hand me down and looked like it went through awar. I kept it until I starting having my own babies. I threw it out and wanted to get a new copy. Unfortunately, the copy available now is missing many of the pages from the original. I am KICKING myself now! Some of the best stories are now missing. I still gave it 5 stars though b/c it is a favorite in my house.
B00003CXIP|1.0|I waited 3 weeks for the DVD, received the case but not the DVD.  Instead of Stand By Me, I got Notes On A Scandal (never heard of it).  Not happy!! I refuse to pay more money to return this item so in the trash it goes! Talk about throwing money away...I had to give a star in order for my comment to be posted. In my view one start is too many. It may sound harsh, but this is not Zoverstocks first sale, things like this should never happen.
B005HERKBG|5.0|Fermat's last theorem was proven in 1995. Just an update for those who want to know. It was a good episode, but lacked zest like many of the other episodes in this season.
B004SDSSFY|2.0|I purchased the full version a few weeks ago but then my phone wouldn't accept the 3.0 update. I therefore deleted the free version and the key for the full version to reinstall the software. Now my free version works but the key doesn't. Take care not to make the same mistake. Other than this problem the utility of the program was excellent.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Nope, not much of an action movie here folks. The longest chase scene isn't really even a chase, so action junkies can check out of this now.<br /><br />For those who like an intelligent, suspenseful character study, the movie is a feast. The acting talent is top notch, starring Ewan MacGregor as a ghost writer and Piers Brosnan as a retired British Prime Minister who may have some secrets surrounding his political past. Both give fascinating performances, though Brosnan is supplied to the camera only stingily. Kim Catrall is barely recognizable, so deeply does she disappear into her role. Jim Belushi has one scene, albeit a very good one. With extra weight and a bald head, you won't know its him if you don't recognize his voice. Timothy Hutton gets two scenes as a lawyer working behind the scenes for Brosnan.<br /><br />The entire picture is treated to a bleak look, supposedly set on a New England island in late winter. If the weather isn't overcast and windy, it is raining, setting the perfect mood for this very dark movie and the obscured circumstances of the plot.<br /><br />I won't give anything else away here, as it wouldn't take much info dangled here to spoil the fun. My wife and I were captivated for the entirety of the movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|I never tought that this film was so great. Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo played excelent parts. Good Director's job.
B00005RHF8|5.0|I've seen a lot of versions of Jane Eyre and loved most of them, though some rank higher than others on my list of all time favorite movies based on Charlotte Bronte's amazing book.  The George C. Scott version is way at the top not only because I like his acting, but because Miss Bronte was so specific in her descriptions of Rochester, the hero of the story.  He was not a handsome man.  He'd lived his life resenting those who'd tricked him into his first marriage and was a hardened individual.  In addition, he was bossy, grumpy, and sarcastic.  Mr. Scott is the perfect arrogant hero, and his chemistry with Ms York is the icing on their perfect gothic romance.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|I admit, I was expecting pure awesome from this album and to no dissapointment they delivered again 100%. Each song tackles a different concept and genre. My favs are: bedazzled fingernails, black tongue, octopus, dry bone valley and  thickening. The others as just as good and really there is not one track on here that I dislike or skip while I listen.
B005IZLPME|1.0|This is a truly dreadful portrayal by the studio of a Marvel Comics icon from my youth. The plot (if you can find one) is banal, but even worse is the 3D presentation. The 3D presentation is bizarre. Imagery: it's completely out of perspective. It's like characters are digitally 'pasted' on to backgrounds, apparently many feet apart, when the perspective should be a fraction of that. Weird and amateurish. Software gone mad, no human control or common sense. There are scenes with a long arm or other object pointing right out of the screen, for no reason. Its sepia colors, no doubt to  give the impression of the 1940s WWII, are odd. In comparison to other Blu Ray 3D releases recently, this doesn't hack it - at all.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|I've been a Beach Boys fan since 1964 and I heard most of this before but the first 19 on the first of 2 CDs is as close to what it was suppose to sound like as we may ever hear, and finally everything in the correct order. This, in my opinion, is way better than the one Brian and band did in 2004 for various reasons but mostly because here we have the original Beach Boys voices. There's always going to be someone that says I wish they would have put this or that version of Surf's Up or Wind Chimes or whatever. If you don't like the version they used here, rerecord it with the version you like best from some other albums.   This is like a musical journey or trip that keeps moving along. It has the main songs, and it has what I'm going to call interludes between some of the songs, sort of like musical mood transitions, sometimes even echoing what we just heard to some extent. What a great idea! Helps us to keep flowing from one musical mood to the next. There are many musical bits and pieces that for the most part fit together in a nice order sort of like ideas that make up a short story. This might be a little similar to what Bach or Batehovan were doing. It's very fun to listen to the first 19 as the SMiLE album now here at last. The rest of CD #1 and CD #2 are also good listening, have other versions of things and sessions.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Very happy with this app. Seems to respect formating very well. Cannot say the same about several others I have tried. Samsung Epic 4g and Asus Transformer.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|The advice in this book is spot on.  It works.  Many people who buy it won't take the time to follow the advice because it takes significant amounts of effort.<br /><br />There's no magic pill in the book.  However, if you're interested in investing time to make books successful, the advice in this book has true value.  How do I know?  As an example, there's a blog post that John Locke said changed his life.  It involves a concept called loyalty transfer.  I took nine hours to make an analogous blog post, and it had excellent results.  This is the URL of the blog post to which John referred:<br />[...]<br /><br />This is the URL of the loyalty transfer blog post that I did, based on John<br />Gagliardi, also a college football coach.[...]<br />I had excellent results.  I'm recommending John's book to several people who are in a mastermind marketing group with me.<br /><br />One more thing.  In his book, John says that he reads his comments and responds to them.  I wrote to him to advise him of my success, and from the type of response that I received, I feel that he really did read my comment and respond.<br /><br />By the way, I happen to have many books that are not focused on one area.  I'm an eclectic writer, and it will take some time for me to fully adapt John's methods for myself, but I'm doing that, and I prefer the advice that he gives to the junk that many gurus will provide.

0525423656|1.0|I really enjoyed the first book, Matched and expected Crossed to follow along the love story of Ky and Cassia.  I was completely disappointment...with every turn of the page I expected it to get better or SOMETHING TO HAPPEN, but it never did.  FAR TOO MUCH society, papers, climbing, running, hiding and not enough relationships between the characters and explanation of the reasons for each of the character's decisions throughout the book.  I doubt I'll read the 3rd book....this was a waste of my time and money.

B005C46PLW|5.0|After eighteen years of captivity you wondered why Jaycee didn't run away. In her book I understood how kidnapped children are manipulated to do what they have to do to survive. The horror Jaycee went through plus her family not knowing where she was, was pure hell. She was threatened her family would be killed or she would be killed.  These sick people played on the mind of an eleven year old.[[ASIN:1451629184 A Stolen Life: A Memoir]]  It is worth reading and hope no one ever has to experience what this child had to experience.

B0006GAO5Y|5.0|I remember seeing Rocky (1976) when it came out.  It was a movie that really gave an energy boost to the general public.  People became motivated to get in shape and conquer the world, if you will.  I like the characters and the overall feel of this movie.  It takes place in Philadelphia beginning in November 1975 and ends in 1976.  I like the portrayal of the city life of Philadelphia and how we see Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) emerge from being an underachieving local boxer to fighting for the heavyweight title only months later.  The best part of this movie for me is the fact that the first hour-plus was spent on character development.  During this time we get to know who Rocky Balboa is, his personality, what makes him tick, etc.  The same goes for the other characters - Adrian (Talia Shire), Paulie (Burt Young), Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Mickey (Burgess Meredith), and so forth.  A lot of young people think this movie is slow moving and are bored to tears.  Well, this movie was from a time when there was such thing as character development.  All the main characters gave great acting performances (four actors were nominated for Academy Awards), but the two best in my opinion were by Sylvester Stallone and Burgess Meredith.  One thing I notice about Adrian in this movie - she goes from being a shy, quiet, somewhat unattractive woman to really opening up and becoming talkative and more attractive all in a short period of time.  I know this had to be done in order to make the audience accept her as Rocky's girlfriend, but still it's something that's very noticeable (I don't mean this in a bad way).<br /><br />The musical score by Bill Conti is one of the strong points of the movie.  The music fits the scenes like a glove (no pun intended) throughout the movie.<br /><br />If you want to see a timeless classic, then see this movie.  It's my favorite out of all six of the Rocky movies.  Highly recommended.
031617615X|1.0|I spent years avoid Twilight, but finally with the release of the `beginning of the end' (Breaking Dawn: Part 1) looming, I caved.  I read all four books; it took me about a week because the first book was the most difficult, but the last, the most disappointing.    Book 1  Twilight is slow, it drags, one would think that the author was trying to \\"build\\", but no, it drags, so much so that once you get to the action, you feel rushed through it and even then, the ordeal with James feels almost `forced' like - okay I know SOMETHING had to happen in the end, so here ya go.   Book 2  I enjoyed New Moon; if anyone has ever experienced a significant loss in their life then they will truly understand Bella's deep psychotic depression.  I also really enjoyed the author's treatment of the werewolves.  I liked its originality, the tribal/shamanistic heritage, the idea of \\"spirit warriors\\", the humanity rather than immortality aspect and the fact that this not just another `virus', but instead passed through heritage.  I also liked that they were men (at the time it was an all-male pack) that turned into wolves - huge wolves yes, but wolves.  No `anthropomorphism', just human, then wolf - it really worked for me. It helps that I actually prefer werewolves to vampires (and no, I'm not a camp Jacob fiend).  Book 3  I enjoyed Eclipse, but I didn't enjoy the emotional crisis between the `triangle' (very Luke, Leia, Han, I might add) - I guess because to me, it wouldn't have even been a choice.  Fortunately, this one didn't drag, it did seem to build and there was a payoff in the end (the battle).  Book 4  And then there was one - book left.  I have to say it - I HATED Breaking Dawn.  Honestly, I kept reading because I was hoping redemption was coming, it didn't.  I understand that the author wanted to give you an intimate perspective of the wolves, but half of the story being told from Jacob's eyes did not work for me, this is Bella's story, it should have stayed that way.  Also, you're in Jacob mode through all of Bella's pregnancy, this causes the reader to be distant from Renesmee, after that, the whole mother-child bond seems fake.  This book builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds.....then NOTHING HAPPENS.  The conflict with the wolves AND the Voltari both resolve oh so peacefully.  Did the author become a pacifist?  Start listening to criticism about violence and its influence on youth?  WTH?    Ultimate Betrayal  All that aside - the author did one thing in the last book that I will never forgive her for - she undid the main thing in whole series that I thought she HAD DONE RIGHT.  I was never thrilled that I didn't find the vampires very threatening, honestly, they sparkle, c'mon.  But - I loved the treatment of the werewolves - I thought it was original, had a lot of thought and really put an interesting new twist on a legend that is as old as vampires.  BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY WEREWOLVES!!??  What? No - they're just shape-shifters.  \\"Real\\" werewolves exist, ya know - the kind that get infected with a bite, transform with the full moon and usually end up looking more like something out of Planet of the Apes than a wolf. That was the last straw for me.  So, now I'm waiting for the author to announce that Breaking Dawn was just bad fan-fiction and the real conclusion to this series is due out next year.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Not since the days of the REAL crooners, has there been a Christmas album that could even remotely stand with the likes of Bing Crosby, Dean Martin or Frank Sinatra.  Until now anyway (Sorry Harry, but your Christmas just doesn't do it for me).  In my opinion, this one stands proudly with the classic crooners.  The selections are timeless and Buble is charismatic as always.  One of my personal favorites on this album is Buble giving us a gentleman's take on a letter to Santa, \\"Santa Buddy\\" (\\"Santa Baby\\" when heard from the great ladies of song).  I also particularly enjoy the less bubbly rendition of Mariah Carey's \\"All I Want for Christmas is You.\\"  Two songs included on the new album are re-recordings of songs from his previous \\"Let it Snow\\" EP release.  \\"White Christmas\\" in an arrangement originally made popular by the Drifters, now pairs Buble with Shania Twain. \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" also a previous release on \\"Let it Snow\\" is different, but not dramatically so.  I'm still not sure what warranted a new recording.  The one and only original offering on this collection is \\"Cold December Night.\\"  A wonderful song and I have no doubt that it will be as \\"Christmas\\" as the classics are in no time at all.  I have been a fan of Michael Buble's from the beginning and am excited to have this as part of my collection.
030746363X|5.0|Reluctantly, I read the fat burning and damage control chapters of this book about 2 months ago.  I say reluctantly because my husband pretty much forced me to read it after reading Tim's 4 Hour Work Week Book.  He wanted to start the slow carb diet, and since I cook basically all of our meals, he wanted me on it too.  Since I wanted to lose the weight we've gained since we got married, I opened the book and read the appropriate chapters (you don't have to read the whole book - Tim even says this  -read the chapters that apply to your goals).  On Day 1, I was not happy about starting my day at 6am cooking eggs, chicken bacon, beans (!), and asparagus.  But I ate it, and continued to follow the diet all day.  Not once did I feel hungry like I did on other \\"fad\\" diets.  By the 3rd or 4th day, I actually noticed that my stomach was flatter - which has always been a problem area for me.  And this was without crunches!  After 30 days, I had lost 15 pounds without exercising and without doing the \\"ice\\" baths.  After the 30 days, we had some family visiting from out of town, so we went off the diet to enjoy meals out with them.  When Saturday came around, I was actually hugely disappointed that we didn't have our \\"cheat day\\".  I realized then how much I had looked forward to them.  It also made me realize that I hadn't missed the other stuff that you're supposed to avoid on the diet for the other 6 days.  So I went back on the diet, and since then I don't feel bad if I want to go out to an occasional cheat meal during the week, then get back on the right track.  I've actually been able to control my weight without being a slave to the gym, and without depriving myself.  That is what I think is great about this book.  It's not some miracle book, but it does teach you how to make smart choices in your diet.  If you do the cheat day right, it WORKS.  Every week, any weight I had gained after Saturday was gone by Tuesday, and then usually another pound or two by the next Saturday.  I would say to the people who gave this book 1 star:  Read the book, and do it right...because if you do, it works.  My husband and I have never felt better, and we get compliments all the time on our appearance.  In fact, I just put my wedding dress on the other day, and it looked just as good as the day I got married...maybe a little loose though :)
0800141849|4.0|The script here is uniquely insightful and heartwarming. A classic romance for these more modern times. The story focuses around two college professors looking for love. The twist is that one of them is fed up with falling for women he's overly attracted to. So he decides to find someone that doesn't drive him physically wild. The outcome is lovely to watch unfold. One of my favorite scenes in any film is Barbara's passionate speech on courtly love; which she gives to a class of hopeful and hungry hearts. This one's more than memorable and not something you'll find every time you go to the movies.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|Note: I saw the Theatrical Cut and the Director's Cut of SALT with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br /><br />Review Of SALT-Theatrical Cut<br /><br />The theatrical version of SALT is very good. Engaging from beginning to end. Angelina Jolie is as good here as she was in the TOMB RAIDER movies, which is very impressive. There's plenty of suspense and twists & turns. The ending will shock you. Sort of like a female version of MINORITY REPORT, starring Tom Cruise, who was originally attatched to star, but he withdrew saying that his the character was too much like Ethan Hunt from the MISSION: Impossible movies, and he was right. But Ms. Jolie manages to make the character her very own. Well-written script. Had I written it, though, I would have deleted the misuse of God's name (ie. God followed by a mild profanity), as I feel it is blasphemous. Plenty of action and suspense. I recommend it. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG. A sequel looks like F-U-N.<br /><br />Review Of SALT- Director's Cut<br /><br />The Director's Cut of SALT is a bit longer than the theatrical cut, with some additional flashback sequences cut from the Theatrical Version, some more violence, and an entirely different end for the President and Michael. Good fun, though I think that the added voiceover at the end implying Salt's death could just be a cover for a possible sequel. I prefer the open ending of the theatrical version. But see which version you like better. Unfortunately, the profaning of God's name is still present.<br /><br />Both versions of the film are rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I used to own Christmas Portrait on cassette, until my player ate the tape. I was really disappointed when I went to buy a copy of the cd and found that it didn't have a few of the songs I liked most on my old copy; such as O Come, O Come Emmanuel. This cd covers all of Christmas Portrait and more. I couldn't be more happy to have found this!
0790729628|2.0|This so-called classic movie is nowhere near a classic. Honestly, I didn't understand what the hell was going on in the movie half the time...and I didn't even finish watching it. I got through an hour and seven minutes of it before I finally gave up. I will say one thing in its favour, though: the director's vision of a futuristic L.A. was really good. Avoid this trash. Like Total Recall, this is one sack of garbage you'll be glad you didn't see.
0425220931|4.0|i've been a professional musician for a long time. i've always loved victors quirky bass-madness, and his approach to the instrument as well as his ability to create what the music calls for- weather that be unparalleled unaccompanied virtuoso electric bass solos, or straight 8ths under a funk groove. first and foremost, i feel compelled to say, with love, that victor as an author, is not too great. pretty bad actually. however, the content of the book is excellent, and i highly recommend it to every bass student i teach. (weather they're studying arco and are aspiring orchestral musicians, or jazz nerds, or rockers, ext ext). He addresses important musical concepts, and does so tastefully. this is NOT a runthrough of how to do his tricks, and even though i knew it wasn't and wanted nothing like that, i understand that some people did want and/or anticipate that from victor wooten writing a book about music. also i must note, he does try to make this book about MUSIC and not necessarily about the electric bass, however i don't know if a flutist would find it as useful as a bassist would, since it sort of does revolve around the electric bass being his instrument. that said, i do think that any instrumentalist would be able to use all of the information in here just as much as an electric bass player- after all, its concepts, not bass-specific etudes or anything like that.  his approach to using the character \\"michael\\" i thought was pretty cool, especially since he says that he's going to say what he wants through a fictional character so he does not need to defend any of his statements. i always viewed michael as sort of the personification of \\"music\\" itself, or perhaps the way we (or i atleast) viewed great musicians when we first had an interest in music- the way that what they could do with their instrument made them almost god like, and it was uncomprehendable how they could do it. creating the music-teacher superhero like figure was pretty tasteful, and workedfor his purposes of getting the points across.   to me, reading the book really did not provide me with any new information, because these are ideas i've been teaching and practicing for years- but i knew that going in. even for the professional musician, its still a worthwhile read. for the passionate hobbyist, this book can work wonders. if taken to heart it can make the difference in what i consider a hobbyist musician to a professional. thats basically what he's getting at, musical maturity, and the qualities that are desired in the highest musical environments, from well-paid wedding bands to orchestras to jazz quartets.   in short, victor wooten may not have ever studied literature all that much, but certainly he has studied music, and this book reflects that. highly recommended.

B003Y5H57E|5.0|Brief Overview:<br /><br />Cal Weaver (Carell) has the perfect life, good job, nice house, great kids and is married to his high school sweetheart and then he learns his wife cheated on him with a co-worker and wants a divorce. Now his life's been turned upside down and he has a lot to learn about being single, dating, women and style. Weaver begins frequenting a bar night after night talking about his divorce until he's noticed by Palmer (Ryan Gosling) and their friendship develops. Palmer's a womanizer and takes Cal under his wing teaching him how to seduce women, how to dress and what to drink.<br /><br />Cal and Emily aren't the only ones looking for love in what might be all the wrong places: Cal's 13-year-old son, Robbie (Bobo), is in love with his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica (Tipton), who harbors a major crush of her own... on Cal. And even Jacob's game is challenged when he tries his best lines on Hannah (Stone), a girl he just can't seem to get out of his mind, maybe because she's the first woman he's ever met not impressed with his advances.<br /><br />My boyfriend and I watched this movie last night and I have to say, its one of the few movies that we BOTH actually laughed out loud in.  Several times. We love Steve Carell and expected hilarity from him, but I was pleasantly surprised by how stinking funny (and handsome!) Ryan Gosling is.  The two play off each other really well and it's easy to get engrossed in the story.<br /><br />Without ruining anything for you guys that haven't seen it yet - there was a plot twist towards the end that *totally* caught me off guard. I was not expecting it in the slightest and I'm usually that person that will \\"call it\\" 10 minutes into the movie.  I normally don't watch too many movies more than once, but I'm definitely keeping this one in the line-up for when I need a good laugh!  If you've been wavering on whether or not you should buy/rent this - jump on in, you won't be sorry!

0062060554|4.0|I downloaded this after reading an Amazon email that enticed me. I read the 2nd half of the book in one sitting.<br /><br />I purposely do not try to figure out what's going to happen when I read books or watch movies, so for me ... this ending wasn't something I knew was coming. Each chapter brings another day in the life of Christine, and you can't help but keep reading and reading to find out what the next day brings.<br /><br />A solid read.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|[...] You'll get a much better deal ~ my total cost is £30.00 which is roughly $48  This is the closest comprable set *with no bonus discs.... I'll be getting 11 discs, the US version is 8.  As long as the Bluray or DVD is Region A or Region Free (as most Universal releases, including Potter, are) you can watch them in the US but the UK Amazon site is frequently much cheaper.  They will be UK packaging, so they'll have the UK age codes on the boxes instead of US (numbers instead of PG-13, for instance) and the first movie has the UK original name of Philosophers Stone instead of Sorcerer's Stone. Otherwise, you just save $30+ and all you have is a little bit of an extra wait for the shipping across the pond.
B001DE29SS|5.0|This film dedicated to Charlie Chaplin is very accurate and truly amazing. Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Chaplin and he portrays the kindness, dramatic, and hilariousness of Chaplin through the ages.

B005ZKYXZI|5.0|After I saw this movie in theaters I got hooked. I had to write a review. This movie has a great plot, but kinda nothing like the book written by Richard Mtheson(Writer of Duel and I am Legend.)The book was great and so was the movie, but none were the same. Both have different plots and different robots. Different everything. Even the title, but still both were great in there own way.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Ceremonials is about pushing through a new vision with the power of a locomotive. New found lyrics that punctuate the songs like Muhammad Ali floating like a feather and stinging like a bee. New depth and imagery transcending the entire album with the energized perfection of a rapidly maturing and confident artist who is coming into her full measure of power. Unlike previous work, Ceremonials is layered with heavier visions that stand alone and sound out a clarion call to attain a full measure of understanding independent and thoughtfully measured and beautifully considered. Florence Welch is a haunting soul that's so inescapable in her wonder once you've become wrapped in her spells you never want to leave her, and she never does. There is less heartbreak and vulnerability in Ceremonials, it's more of a celebration of discovery of growing into new layers of skin and textures of the soul and consciousness while being authentic and true to oneself unafraid. Bold and relevant, natural and effort laden with intensity that penetrates the listener through every atom of our being, becoming part of us and walking along side us long after the last note of the last song has been heard.

B006470HZ6|1.0|Just OK and I am being generous.  No need to check towns or stores anymore before deeming them safe. No need to take precautions of the most basic kind (see ending). No need for guns. This group would have been dead in a real war. Until the writing gets better this is my LAST episode. Get better writers!!!<br /><br />*** Update 11.9.11***<br />I think the new writers are giving this show 5 stars, so I have lowered my rating to compensate. This season blows!!! Folks, save your money.
B005XOPEOU|2.0|Coldplay is not a revoultionary music group. There's no new sound in this album. Like all of the Coldplay work it is just \\"ordinary. Even a large group do not want to accept it but this is the huge reality. And this album proves it again. People are waiting for an album which is an \\"incredible concept album\\". It seems Coldplay will never do it. Coldplay is definitely an overrated music group. They are not even close to the creativity of Radiohead, Arcade Fire, Kings of Leon... and so on..
0385512058|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Pay no attention to the nay-sayers and negative fault finders!  Have they written anything better?  The whole purpose of this book is to remind us of the infinite value of relationships and to provide strategies to build our world of connections.  Some of the critical comments about this book make me laugh.  It's always remarkable to see an intelligent, valuable, well written book, full of great suggestions and ideas.....torn apart with nit picking, small minded attitudes.  You will find a wealth of insights worth far more than the cost and a little time invested.    Ever considered assigning specific people to each of your goals?  This may seem like an obvious idea, but i've read countless books by all the greats in the field and have  never come across this one brilliant idea.  I think it's fairly common for people to think they're going to achieve goals on their own, while the reality is ......it rarely if ever happens that way.  We always get by with a little help from our friends, so it only makes sense to be conscious about this important step and match people with goals!  Also, the author places huge emphasis on the importance of GIVING to our network of connections.  This book is NOT about how to milk our friends for help!  If you're actually  spending most of your time, working on ways to better serve your network .....the only other book you'll need is how to manage your wealth!  \\"Never Eat Alone\\" is really about improving our service and the critical reviewers somehow manage to completely miss that point.  Notice the book has over 278 reviews!  Obviously the author is doing something very right to motivate that many readers!

0802473156|5.0|This book has been a real eye opener for me in my marriage. Once I realized my husband's love language (words of affirmation), I knew I had to change the way I was speaking to him in order to communicate love. And although he hasn't read the book, he now knows that my love language is gifts and has been amazing in treating me with what little we have. I love the way that this book hashes out the \\"in-love\\" feeling and teaches you how to deal with that transition and what to do when that period is over. Now, I am still very much in the \\"in-love\\" stage with my husband, but every once in awhile trouble comes our way. When it does, I have a lot more comfort these days re-affirming my love to him and receiving the same.  This is a really good book and I would recommend it to everyone. It's easy to read, easy to understand and highly relatable no matter what stage of relationship you are in.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|I've seen this movie dozens of times. It's hard to describe because it's different. It's a mash up of action, comedy and romance. Definitely a must see movie if your a Michael Cera fan.
B004O86JZ4|4.0|Why 4 stars and not 5? Not because of the music or the quality of the pressing, I can assure you of that.  If you're a Foo fan, this album is not going to disappoint you. It's not \\"In Your Honor\\", but it doesn't have to be in order to be great and that's what this album is: GREAT. If you're a fan of vinyl, you won't be disappointed, either. The multiple 45 RPM set is an excellent pressing; great mastering, well packaged and well recorded. The disks are inky-black clean, quiet and nice and flat. In short, if you're a fan of Foos on vinyl, you've gotta have it. It's not a hit singles album, though; it's an outstanding, complete from start-to-finish body of work, so don't be looking to frug yourself into a frenzy with it. It may be the best rock \\"album\\", in the purest sense of that word, recorded in the last 10 years. Well done, guys. 5 stars for the music.  On the disappointment front: I was really looking forward to being able to download, as was promised as \\"included\\" the hi-res version of the album for digital storage/playback. Alas, my copy arrived with none of the usual code-cards or the sort in order to get the promised files. I called Amazon and they had no idea what to do about it other than to allow me to download the MP3 version from Amazon itself for freebies (which is to their credit). Not really what I was after, though it was a solution of sorts. I was also given the option of returning the album altogether and hoping for better luck on the second set, but the vinyl copy I got was SO pristine, I opted to cut my losses, stick with the excellent pressing I had and live with the crappy MP3's for digital convenience.   So, the hi-res-included-but-not-on-my-copy fAiL gets 3 stars. If that issue with the digital D/L hadn't happened, this would have been a 5 star review. Sorry, Foos, but those are the breaks; you sell it, you bear the risk if it goes belly-up.  If anyone else had a problem with the digital download issue, I'd be interested in hearing about it.
0061365343|5.0|My boys -- ages 10, 8, 5 -- loved listening to this CD while on a lengthy road trip.  It was the first time for me and mother to hear the story too, and we enjoyed it just as much.  Highly recommended for the young boys you know, especially if you think it's less likely that they'll ever read the book.  We'll purchase the other CDs for future road trips.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|Look, I agree the packaging isn't up to par like the other re-issues. That being said it's still a nice presentation and the sound is great. You people need to stop complaining. You get a generous amount of B-sides as well. Overall, it out weighs the bad. Enjoy
0756655730|5.0|This is a fantastic book, even used, available for a low price. It appears to contain a comprehensive fossil record of the entire panorama of life on Earth. All of the major representative fossils are shown, along with computer-generated artists' renditions of the life forms and habitats represented by the fossils. Not only is the formation of the Earth about 4.56 billion years ago illustrated, but also the formation of our entire solar system. Visuals tell most of the story, but they are accompanied by brief but succinct verbal notes and comments along the way. At the end are a glossary, a thorough index, and an apparently comprehensive list of at least most of the dinosaurs. This book presents an understandable, mostly visual, fossil record of life on Earth, and as such it could be used to support the teaching of Darwinian evolution, even with modern modifications, such as \\"punctuated equilibrium.\\" I recommend it for anyone interested in biology, or as a gift for a student in high school or higher. One more thing: while presenting a thorough sampling of the empirical evidence, it also discusses competing theories about various phenomena, and acknowledges what is NOT known, as well as what is known.

B005VMVUAQ|1.0|This isn't even a movie you'd want playing in the background while you're sleeping; it's THAT BAD.  It is an absolute royal disappointment.  From the characters, plotline, dialogue and all other elements of this film you wonder if the creators were first year film students at the Guam Film Academy. Every single element of this film has been done 10,000,000 million times over.  I even think I recognized some of the set pieces from other mask-wearing criminal family-abduction films. Dear Nics (Kidman and Cage), you Nic'd an hour and a half from my life.  Thanks a lot!
B005SAP45I|1.0|When I watch a movie like Cars 2, I don't want to be hit with a lot of political messaging.  This entire movie felt like one big commercial for alternative fuel.  Regardless of where I stand on the issue (I support alternative fuels), I don't want my entertainment to be this political.  I can't remember ever being more disappointed with a Pixar effort.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I remember when I was a teenager and loved this TV Series. This is a must have and I remember the old good days. Video quality is good, plot is great and it is well maintained over the chapters. What else can you ask for in a TV Series?? Two thumbs-up!!
B003L20IHE|5.0|Luckily caught this film on HBO the other night, otherwise I doubt I would have ever seen it. I think the reason it was received so poorly is because it was marketed as a kind of teenie bopper summer flic, when really its an emotional story about loss.  Critics tore into the film as overly sentimental, but if you have lost anyone in your life, then you'll understand, and likely find the bond between the brothers very touching and realistic.  I have never seen Zac Efron in anything before, and I think he does a fine job.  Also Augustus Pew [sic], I recognized from About a Boy, and he provides fun comedic relief.  The thing that makes this movie great is the beautiful cinematography and the subtle story telling.  It has its cheesy moments but it always keeps it fun ie the geese.  I liked the story so much I went and checked out the book... meh the movie is much better.
0062011847|3.0|Another fantastic Sam Vimes installment in the Discworld series!  All the twists and turns and dark humor we have come to know and love.  The only problem I had was with the book it's self, it arrive in perfect condition, well packed and not a mark on it but it looks like the final cut was never made on the edges of the pages.  Top and bottom the pages are cut neat and square but the fore edge of each signature comes to a point as though it never made it to the guillotine for that final chop.  So 5/5 for the story and 2/5 for the book.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|\\"The Social Network\\" is based on the true-life story of Mark Zuckerberg, founder/creator of Facebook, the vast social-networking site.  I'm not sure how true-to-life the movie actually is but I'm going on the premise that most of it is correct.<br /><br />Mark Zuckerberg is not a nice person, not a friendly person, not a sociable person.  In fact, if he's at all like the movie, I would hazard a guess that he has the developmental disorder, Asperberger's.  He does not deal well with social interaction; he's brilliant at a narrowly focused field which allowed him to have Facebook up and running (and expanding) very quickly; he has a difficult time separating his actions from consequences.  If he doesn't have Asperger's, he definitely suffers from some developmental/social disorder.<br /><br />But over and above all that - I've had this DVD for months and put off watching it because I couldn't believe that it would be very entertaining.  I finally decided to take a chance and this is one compelling movie.  It's kind of like watching a train wreck and being unable to look away.  Amazing performances especially by Jesse Eisenberg playing Zuckerberg; Andrew Garfield as Wardo, Zuckerberg's ONLY friend; and Armie Hammer playing the Winklevoss twins.<br /><br />What a world we live in that Zuckerberg could become the youngest billionaire EVER!  Truth truly is stranger than fiction.

While you won't always agree with every thing \\"Uncle Bob\\" writes, the vast majority of the book offers excellent advice that we can all use to clean up our code.

0385732554|4.0|Review from class of 2017 and class of 2018 of the GISSV<br />Jannik<br />The book \\"The Giver\\" is a very well written novel. It has a very interesting futuristic setting. If you start reading the book you will probably find the story strange. Everything in this community is controlled and you have no free choice, because the community decides for you. For Example the Community decides you're job, you're wife and children. I think that it's a very interesting lifestyle. Also, once you start reading it's very hard to stop reading, because the book is so fascinating and the lifestyle is so different to ours that you just want to learn more about the lifestyle. When I finished reading a chapter I wanted to start reading the next, because each chapter has a very open ending. The end is also open and it's very easy to keep imagining the story in a lot of different ways. Like he dies freezing to death and hallucinates a lot or goes into a Christmas town and lives very happy.<br />Marcela<br />I thought \\"The Giver\\" was a good book. Jonas lives in a perfect world. There is no war, or pain. The people there don't have their own choice. Everything is in order and the choices are made by the Elders. Elders are elderly people who decide what job you get, who you marry, and a lot of other things. I liked it because it had a lot of fantasy and it is set in the future. There were a lot of different feelings. Sometimes the book was sad, sometimes it was happy or exciting. Also, you can follow the book very well. The chapters have open endings. So sometimes when you finish a chapter you just want to read on.<br />Tobi<br />The Giver-I like Jonas's community very much, because how Louis Lowry explained the town and the way how they live there. She made the book like it is a real story. Second thing that I liked was the trip of Jonas, because you could feel the suspense of the writing. I also loved Gabriel, because he was like a real child in our \\"community\\". I think the receiving memories by putting the hand on the back is very interesting, because you can't just put a hand on the back and give a memory away, but it makes the whole community more interesting, so you want to know more about special things that they do. I don't like the ending, because the author leaves it open, so we don't know what happens with Jonas and Gabe. Also I don't like how they get released, because I think that is not nice and it is also not very human.<br />Miriam<br />The Giver is a great book, because it is a fantasy book and I like those books. My favorite parts in this book are: When the apple changed from grey to red and Fiona's hair also changed. And when the Giver gave the memory of snow to Jonas. I liked this part, because the memory consisted over a lot of feelings and the writer described this part in more detail than others. What I think was exciting too, was when we found out that a release isn't nice and good. That the people are killed. It was really scary! I also like this book, since it depicts another idea for a world. They have strict rules and you can't choose your partner for life and they mustn't have kids. I don't want this to happen in our world, but it's a good idea for a book. It's also interesting that they don't have feelings and they can't see colors. And nobody is supposed to die in a natural way. In their community it is also different that the elders chose the jobs for you, which but fits to you. The Giver is good because, nobody has to starve and everybody has a home and a family. For all the people, who love fantasy and exciting books, the Giver is perfect. But to those people who want to have a real story it wait fit.<br />Eric<br />Overall I liked the book The Giver, although I didn't like the end. There are some points of tension, where something unexpected happens, which I like. Another reason why I liked the book, is because of its setting in the future, where people do everything a lot differently than we do; similar to a science-fiction book. I also like how Jonas and the Giver move in an act of rebellion against the communities, which adds suspense to the book. Although some parts of the book can be a bit confusing at times, through this you always want to know what is going to happen next, so you always want to keep reading. I didn't like the end though, because one of the main characters almost died. I am also not a fan of open endings; I don't like to speculate on what can happen. It was a good book, which I can recommend, but I would not read it again, like I do with my favorite books.<br />Max<br />I like the book \\"The Giver\\". I like it because it is exciting. I also like the book because it is very well described. It is also good to read. It is exciting especially when Jonas plans his escape. It is exciting because the author makes it suspenseful. Then when Jonas also takes Gabe I was totally surprised. It is very well described because Lois Lowry is a great author. She has written many books. It is fun to read. When the book got really exciting I could not put it down. In conclusion I think the book \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is a great book because it is exciting, very well described and fun to read.<br />Patrick<br />I like the book \\"the Giver \\" because it is interesting to read and it has a lot of fun parts, for example, when Jonas gets assigned \\"The Receiver of Memories\\" in that time everything is about him and he is not the same anymore. From that moment on he isn't the same and sameness doesn't count for him anymore. I also liked the part when Jonas and Gabe escaped from the community. It is very serious and exciting because Jonas just tries to get away from the community. The only thing that I didn't like was that the book had an open ending.<br />Frederik:<br />\\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is a story about a community, where everyone is the same, except for small differences. Every year they have ceremonies. At the ages 1-12 they have to go on a stage and at age 12 they get a job. This story starts when a boy is chosen for a special job. Most decisions are made by a group of people. It's an interesting utopian novel. It tells us of the twelfth's year of the boy's life. He is the only person who knows about us, and the past. The rest thinks only now exists. In it all people are about the same. The community, where the boy is born, can control almost the whole nature.  It is an interesting way of thinking about the future world, if we live on another planet, or control nature itself. He is alone except for \\"the Giver\\", who trains him. Enjoy reading this novel.<br />Sabrina:<br />Rating: 4 Stars out of 5<br />Overall, I think that this book was really great. I love books that make me need to think about it so if you love that too, this is a great book for you. Without telling you too much about the book, I'll try to tell you about some of my favorite parts. When you start reading, you will meet the community. It is an abnormal place to live with strange and strict rules. The most important rule is the rule of sameness. Same bikes, houses, clothes, and more. They don't want anyone who's different in their community. If you are born a twin, too bad. If you are the lighter one, you die (SPOILER). If you are born disabled, too bad. You die. If you get really sick, chances are, you die. So right now, this book probably sounds pretty spooky but let me just tell you it is extremely interesting! The main characters name is Jonas and he is a little different than everybody else. He has gray eyes but most people don't. He has a special ability to \\"see beyond\\". When you turn 12 in the community, you are given a lifelong job. If you don't like it, you might be able to get a new one but you're pretty much stuck with it. A group of old men and women, called the Elders, watch you for a year and pick the perfect job for you. Jonas gets a very powerful and highly honored job. He seems to like it but then again, because of the rule of sameness, you don't havefeelings so we'll never know. He \\"tolerates\\" the man he works for/with and becomes friends with him. They soon realize that the community is not the place for Jonas. He wants to change things. Lastly, he has an elaborate plan to get out. Read for yourself to see if it works out. The only thing I thought was not so great about this book was that I found some things a little confusing. After reading further into the book, I started to understand the concept more but some parts are definitely tough to understand.<br />Moritz:<br />I think that \\"The Giver\\" is an exciting book telling how other communities or countries may be organized. The book transferred me into a completely new world, which fascinated and frightened me. Specifically the relationship between children and parents interested me because children are assigned and not raised. Children and parents do not truly love each other, but still live well together. Furthermore some scenes just came out of the blue and startled me, for example discovering that Jonas's father was killing the small babies when releasing them. Some of the surprising scenes like where Jonas found out that Gabe was going to die, but his parents were still happy, made \\"The Giver\\" a great read. If I had to rate this book I would give it four and a half stars on one hand for the thought-provoking story and the open ending. I strongly recommend reading the book \\"The Giver\\".<br />Johannes<br />I think that \\"The Giver\\" was a good book. Why do I think so, you ask? Well, firstly, I enjoyed reading it as the Author was great at describing passages so that you go the feel of actually being there. Additionally, Lois Lowry put a lot of thought into the book. While this is hard to explain, it seemed to me how well thought out the community - and thus the book - was. Finally, I really liked the idea of the book - that there were people living by other standards somewhere out there.... Yes, I would recommend this book.<br /><br />Erin and Max:<br />In\\"The Giver'' by Lois Lowry a young child about 12 years old named Jonas is part of a society where there are no differences. He thinks this is normal until the day comes, where he becomes the \\"Receiver''. The Receiver is a very special person, because he is the apprentice of the \\"Giver''. The Giver is a person who lives in a world like you and I. He knows colors, snow, sleds, hills... And Jonas is supposed to become the Giver. While he is the Receiver he becomes several friends, Gabriel (Which is a little baby) and The Giver also becomes a close friend. Therefore Jonas becomes all the memories and the Giver loses all the memories. He can not see colors anymore, he doesn't remember snow!<br />Jonas does not like this. So he starts a journey to save the Memories of the Giver. At the end Jonas is on a sled riding down a hill.<br />We think that the story has a good outline, but it can be a bit better. It also makes sense how all the events are in order. The book has an open ending which can be positive and negative. The positive side is that it makes the reader eager to read the sequel or eager to read other books that are similar (Hunger Games; by Suzanne Collins)<br />Another positive Aspect about this book is, this book has very easy vocabulary and is easy to read. So it is great for school grades four to seven. The Giver is also very entertaining because it always brings excitement in the book, for example when Jonas becomes a twelve they skip him at the ceremony so you want to keep on reading the book.<br />What really was a bummer is that it had a open-ending, even though it was good in a way, it frustrated us that we couldn't know what happens to Jonas. And the sequel only slightly hints what happens to Jonas and Gabriel, which makes it very frustrating. Also what was negative is that some parts are inappropriate, for example when the Elders become released (killed) it can give children the wrong idea by making them think that violence is the way to punish someone. Also what was not so good a lot of parts where boring, e.g. there would be only a dialogue  between several people, which made it very boring. However, we definitely recommend this book! Even though it seems like this book has more negative aspects, this book is outstanding! You can never let go of this book when you start reading. We recommend this book for grades four to seven. Due to the bad talk, and the vocabulary is age appropriate for grades four to seven.<br />Max:<br />The Book the Giver by Lois Lowry is a book that takes place in a Utopian world where everyone is the same. This book is personally very exciting because it is about a boy named Jonas who thinks that he lives in a normal world but then when he gets his job as memory receiver he notices that everybody in his community is the same as everybody else (sameness) and that the people who are very different get \\"released\\" (death by a Shot). But in the End Jonas decides to change all of that by running away from the community with a Baby that is supposed to be released and therefore leaving all his memories that he collected in the past Year behind. If you like this book you should check out \\"The Hunger games\\" by Suzanne Collins.<br />Caroline:<br />The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a young boy who lives in a community where everyone is the same. The main character, called Jonas, learns how life can be difficult, even if other people choose a life for you. It shows how one can change completely and how bad sameness (sameness means that everything is the same)can be. The book is a fun learning experience for those who wish to know what it is like in a different world. I personally think that the book is horrible and good. It is horrible because people in the community get released (released = death by the needle). Everyone sees in black-and-white, another bad aspect about sameness. At the end, everyone is unsure of what happens next (I guess that's why Lois Lowry wrote three books). On the contrary,there are no homeless people because other people choose a job for you. People do not have to worry about money, because everyone has whatever they need.<br />Aryan:<br />I think the book was pretty good but weird because they for example have to wear tunics or they have to share their feelings every evening after dinner. It was very interesting but one negative thing I have is that there is not a real ending that's why I don't like the book as much . Something else that was very good was that there are many topics to discuss. What I have heard is that The Giver is not banned from schools; so many schools read it so that's what I also like because I would not have known this book to be banned from schools. What I also think is weird is because the giver can give his feelings to Jonas (main character)  another character in the book. I would recommend this book to people of all ages who like science fiction.<br />Julia:<br />I think the book is okay... I mean, it contains many topics to discuss both philosophically and in comparison with our normal life. The big negative aspect is that Lois Lowry unintentionally includes a horrible action that happened before in history (Euthanasia, which happened in Germany during World War II). Also, it has an open ending, which i find a bit confusing, but that's just my perspective. Aside from those facts, I would recommend it if you enjoy discussing things, especially for 7th or 8th graders or their teachers.
B005O30Y5Y|1.0|I need to add my voice here, after being screwed on the Green Lantern Blu-Ray. I tried to use the UV system with my Apple equipment, but...cant watch it without streaming, which means cant watch it mobile without paying my cell phone company for the overag (movie streams at 2 GB).  Now, i will no longer purchase any blu-ray with this digital content system. Theyve done this before, and it failed...and guess what, when they decide to close down Ultraviolet, do you think they will maintain your digital license? Or will your money disappear, along with your digital copies.
0823016714|3.0|With respect to the author (and the authors of similar books), this is the wrong place to look for facial expressions. If you want a truly valuable source, look at Paul Ekman's books. Even Darwin's book of expressions in people and animals is more useful. Most of the art instruction pose/expression books are heavy on over-the-top mugging expressions. Get a book with a scientific approach.
B001R60ESE|5.0|By far my favorite Blu-Ray in my collection. Since the official CD does not have some of my favorite tracks from the concert, I took the time to rip the full-quality audio from the blu-ray and split it out into tracks of the entire concert. That album now has more plays than anything else on my iPod.   [[ASIN:B001R60ESE Chris Botti in Boston [Blu-ray]]]

B005F96UNM|1.0|I sat through this at a film festival last year and everyone in the audience I spoke with afterward agreed that this may be the one of the worst films of all time.  It is boring, moronic, and clueless.  The only thing it has going for it is a nice visual flair... which gets you through about ten minutes.  Everyone involved in the making of this atrocity should be ashamed.  I can only believe the good reviews on here are from plants... and I don't mean studio plants, I mean potted plants, because even studio shills have standards.
0062011847|5.0|Mr. Pratchett has provided another fun frolic through the lands of Discworld with Snuff and the return of one of my favorite characters, Samuel Vimes.  Mr. Pratchett once again takes on social 'norms' and points out just how silly some of our preconceptions can be as Commander Vimes tries to get others to understand that 'different' doesn't equal 'less than'.  Murder is murder, regardless of species. Mr. Pratchett paints a very real picture of the every day struggle not to be lured into doing the wrong thing, especially when the doing right thing goes against everything you really want to do.
0061478784|4.0|Howl's Moving Castle is a sweet and humorous book about a girl who has a spell placed on her by an evil witch. The spell changed the eighteen year old girl into a ninety year old lady. The bespelled girl finds herself finding shelter in the Wizard Howl's magical moving castle. She ends up convincing him to let her stay as a cleaning lady while she tries to find the secret that will break her curse. I really enjoyed this fun book. It was a quick read and the characters were a lot of fun. Although there were some parts where I began to wonder where the story was going, the imaginative world more than made up for these. I really love the humor that Diana Wynne Jones puts in her novels. None of her characters seem to take themselves too seriously. I would definitely recommend this book to those who appreciate a little simple magic in their reads.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|Bought this watch, used it two or three times....dead.  I enjoyed using it, and then I had a busy week so the unit sat on my desk.  Went to charge it one evening and no response, would not charge.  I think you will find many other people have had the same problem.  Going through Garmin customer service was slow, and I had to pay to ship it back to them, and pay return shipping to me.  This is my second negative experience with this company.  I thought by buying a Garmin Forerunner I was getting top of the line from a major brand that would take care of its customers.<br />I will not be buying Garmin products anymore. These units clearly have issues and others have described them as \\"disposable\\".<br />If my replacement watch lasts for more than a few weeks , I will update this review.<br />UPDATE<br />Have had it back for about a month and it seems to be working ok.  I enjoy having it and use it frequently.  If it lives it will be a handy device. Adding one star to this review for a total of two.<br />*Update*<br />January 9th, 2012<br />So far so good! Its working and I use it all the time.  The handiest feature I find is being able to hook it up to the computer and have all my data uploaded automatically. I hope it keeps working!<br /><br />*Update*<br />April 17th, 2012<br />Still using it! However the light has not worked for a couple months now.  Everything else is still functional but can't see it in the dark.  Not a big issue for me , but a little disappointing.<br /><br />*Update*<br />August 24th, 2012<br />Still wokring without the backlight.  The only thing I have noticed is that if you put the watch near your ear you can hear electronic hisses, buzzing, and crackles...I and not sure how long this has been going on...but I noticed it a few days ago when the house was very quiet.  Hope it isn't a sign of anything bad to come. I have been using the unit for about a year.  I feel like perhaps I really shouldn't be having any problems with it at this point.  If it dies I will be certainly interested to see what Magellan has on offer.

0385344325|5.0|I have never been disappointed when reading a Jack Reacher book by Lee Child.  This one was no different, although the pacing was slightly slower than previous stories in the series it answers a lot of lingering questions about Reacher's past and how he became the person he is now.  Not as frenetic but just as engaging as other Reacher novels.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The main reason I like the Amazon MP3 player is that it has the best fast-forward/rewind controls for long tracks such as podcasts or audio books.

B004LWZW42|4.0|Here's a knotty problem for a studio to face. What happens when you decide to make a fourth film in one of your biggest franchises, but without any of the three major actors who made the first three films so watchable (particularly when your third movie was a bit of a dog and only saved by their performances)? The decision to make X-Men: First Class as a prequel to the existing movies that was fully open to newcomers was a canny one, allowing 20th Century Fox to effectively reboot the series without throwing away the continuity of the previous films, but the side-effect of losing Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen must have caused some consternation in the office. However, by bringing in director Matthew Vaughn, hot off the acclaimed Kick-Ass, and casting James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the younger Stewart and McKellen, the studio showed some good judgement (which they could have done with on the third movie).  First Class is set in 1962, roughly forty years before the events of the existing movie trilogy. Fassbender's Lehnsherr, a survivor of the concentration camps (the memorable first scene of X-Men is cleverly recreated and expanded on in the opening of First Class), is scouring the world for Nazi criminals and in particular Klaus Schmidt, the Nazi scientist who experimented on him to find a use for his mutation. Schmidt turns out to be a mutant himself, now going by the name Sebastian Shaw (a strong performance by Kevin Bacon), who has attracted the enmity of the CIA and their new mutant consultant Charles Xavier (McAvoy) by orchestrating the rising tensions between the USA and USSR. Lehnsherr agrees to join Xavier's team of 'X-Men' to help stop Shaw's plans, but in the process finds himself questioning whether mutants and humans can ever live together peacefully. Caught in the middle is Xavier's adopted shapeshifting sister, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) who is conflicted over whether she wants to be 'normal' or be true to her mutant nature.  The inner conflict within the primary characters gives the movie an unusual depth of character for a superhero flick and is true to the themes of tolerance and identity Bryan Singer raised in the first two movies in the series (and handled somewhat more ham-fistedly by Brett Ratner in the third). It also gives us the strongest scene in the movie, as the vengeance-obsessed Lehnsherr confronts two former Nazis in a bar in Argentina in a scene that Tarantino at his best would have been proud of (and the presence of Fassbender speaking German to Nazis in this scene gives viewers of Inglorious Basterds a sense of deja vu). Fassbender's performance throughout is excellent, and he has a great rapport with McAvoy which sells you completely these are the same people as Stewart and McKellen, just younger. That said, the later movies indicated that they were friends and allies for much longer than the few weeks this movie suggests was the case.  Elsewhere McAvoy plays the young Charles Xavier to perfection, respecting Stewart's performance but bringing youthful, idealism and a spark of mischief to the character that makes him sympathetic, even when he is appearing to be naive. Scenes where Xavier has to overcome the wearying cynicism of his team-mates are given weight by McAvoy making it clear that Xavier knows that his attempts to forge peace may be doomed, but the attempt must be made anyway. Lawrence's performance is solid, but her conflicted journey is not as handled as well as it could be, with her decision on what side to join not being sold completely successfully (and there are some continuity issues based on her character's behaviour in the first three films, though nothing too bad).  The film is well-paced, with a solid use of the old standbys of montages, voice-overs and exposition used to effectively a complicated storyline involving a relatively large cast of characters. A slight failure is the depiction of the bad guys: whilst Bacon's Shaw and January Jone's Emma Frost get plenty of screen-time and dialogue, Riptide and Azazel have little to do and nothing to say, and come across as flat as a result.  Elsewhere, the film has effective and impressive action sequences, a rather clever use of real history (though somewhat altered from our own) to enhance the narrative and some nice uses of 1960s imagery and visuals (particularly in the credits sequence). The action sequences are earned by good performances, strong direction and an enjoyable script that is a bit more complex and interesting than many superhero films. There's also a rather cool easter egg for fans of the other movies to watch out for.  X-Men: First Class (****) could have been a potential mess, but it emerges as the second-best movie in the franchise to date (after the splendid X2) and one of the best reboots of a superhero franchise to date.
1401219268|4.0|When someone appears to be murdering former masked adventurers (what we would call superheroes), Rorschach, an uncompromising masked vigilante, seeks to uncover who is responsible. Meanwhile, the world is on the brink of nuclear war and peace seems to rest on the shoulders of Dr. Manhattan, a former scientist that was turned into a super being after an accident in his lab. As I read this graphic novel, I was struck by the fact that the thing I liked most about it was also the thing that I liked the least. It is very philosophical. The characters debate deep topics such as the nature of humanity. While the symbolism and depth of the story are what makes this novel great and helps it rise above what I normally think of when I think of superhero comics, it also made it hard to read. I wish that the mystery and its investigation was given more weight in the story, I felt like sometimes the plot took a back seat to the examination of the bigger questions. Overall it was an interesting novel that made me think a lot, and wonder how much went over my head. I might want to see if I can find a study guide for this to find out what I missed.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I just received mine from the mail and its a fast shipping. I have a D3100 Nikon SLR and i attached to my camera right away to test it... I couldnt believe it. The flash is bright and u can adjust the flash in horizontal to 60' 75' and 90' degrees. It's also runs 2 AA batteries. I bought this flash first because the other speedlight for nikon is so expensive... Will see how it goes im goin to Las Vegas this weekend and i will test this flash..

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Even though the setting seems familar, the characters start the same, the ending is not shocking, you still love the story. that is why its 5 stars. Sparks take something he does well, and makes it unique , while still managing to make me cry like a lovesick child. once again. love it, to the very last word.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I got this because of it's price compared to the other options and it has exceded my expectations.  I can access and edit both local and Google Docs files and the files I have opened appear to render correctly.  I have not tried complex Excel files or Powerpoint files, I will update or re-post once I have some expeerience there.   Not impressed with the dictionary add-on.  It doesn't serve as a spell checker (which is very important to me a very POOR speller).  I do wish I could have access to styles and other more complex formatting of documents.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|When I first read reviews of The Night Circus, I was so excited to start reading it! I agree with some of the other reviewers though, it is promising at the beginning then drags through to the first half (and it's a LONG book).<br /><br />I was really surprised that I wasn't more into it because it has some of my favorite themes: circuses, black and white striped tents, Victorian era, magic. It's just that the author seems dead set on describing things (lovely but overly descriptive) rather than focusing on a good story. I usually read 1 book a week and this one took me about a month because I had to force my way through it.<br /><br />I do have to say that once I reached the middle, the story became a lot more interesting and I was able to finish the last half in 2 days.
B005FITIDC|5.0|WOW, what an awesome performance by Gerard Butler (Oscar worthy, in my opinion). This movie has an incredible message that needs to be seen.  I have read the book three times and have been so overwhelmed by Sam Childers' mission to save children and his transformation.  Gerard Butler got it right with his passion and hard work in nailing down Sam Childers. I was lucky enough to be within 70 miles of one of the few theaters that showed it.  Why did Relativity Media abandon this movie?  Aren't they in the business of making money? I guess the world will have to wait for the DVD. Don't suppose they will cancel that too?  Keep up the good work Sam Childers and Gerard Butler!
B003Y5H57E|5.0|With this film plus \\"Date Night\\" with Tina Fey and \\"Dan In Real Life\\", Steve Carell is becoming the heir apparent to replace the comedic mantle left by the late Jack Lemmon. In his wry understated way, Carell represents the Everyman in us we can sympathize with.  In this film he's surrounded by a talented cast consisting of Julianne Moore as his guilt-ridden wife, Ryan Gosling as the stud who teaches him how to handle women, Emma Stone as the woman who tames Gosling and Kevin Bacon as the office worker caught with his pants down.  They're all fine and aided by a fine script, this is one of the best comedy-dramas to come around in awhile--totally recommended!!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|After Matched, the first novel, I can definitely tell that Alli Condie's writing style definitely improved. Like most dystopian novels that appeal to teens and young adults, the main conflict is about wanting something that you can't have and fighting authority for it. Matched didn't have a ton of action in it; Crossed, however, did have alot more death and fighting, but Alli managed to keep it classy without the action overriding the depth of Ky's past and Cassia's desire to find the Rising. Crossed is written from two perspectives...Ky's POV and Cassia's POV. I was slightly disappointed that Crossed didn't include Xander's point of view, but once again, I believe this was necessary so that Alli could keep some secrecy among character thoughts and plot in this awesome novel. If you like Matched, you will certainly be pleased with Crossed. The writing style has improved, and whereas the Matched novel content was great, Crossed crosses the line and opens the reader's eyes to a new perspective on the Society and the Rising: Ky. I would definitely recommend Crossed to anyone!!
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and at first, I really didn't have any expectations past it being terrible. Those were my thoughts before the movie started. Once the movie got going, I actually thought it was awesome. A friend of mine saw it with me and he is more of a fan of the G.I. Joe franchise. Overall, neither of us had any problems with this movie. We both thought it had good action sequences and a lot of fun special effects. The acting was a little bit better than the average Bruce Campbell B-film. The story, though very...simple, is fun and doesn't have any gaps. There are a ton of flashbacks in here so, that is saying a lot. Snake Eyes is awesome and my friend was trying to imitate Ray Park's martial arts skills for the next few days, after we both saw this movie. I am not a fan of this director so, that may have been why I had low expectations for this film. Speaking as someone who did not have a preloaded good opinion about this movie, it's really great!
B0051O8Z66|1.0|Very avant garde, for me. Lots of loud sounds, lyric repetition and nothing to really sink your teeth into, to enjoy.

B000W4E3OS|5.0|In my humble but educated opinion (I am a composer and music teacher), the piano music of Scriabin should be performed and recorded as often as that of Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Debussy, etc. It has everything you could want in piano music: a wide range of expression, poetry as well as virtuosity, and an air of mysticism and eroticism that is unique to the repertoire. While Scriabin did not achieve his lofty goal of transforming the human race through his music, his work did help me realize that music is just as valid a place to search for meaning as anywhere else (religion, science, etc). There's something about music in general, and especially music like Scriabin's, that is simply beyond words, and I don't think it's too pretentious or presumptuous to call music one of the keys to life's mysteries.   As of now, there are only two \\"complete\\" sets of Scriabin's piano music available of which I'm aware: this one and the one in two volumes by Ponti on Vox, [[ASIN:B00007J4SI Complete Piano Works of Scriabin]] and [[ASIN:B00007J4SK Scriabin: Complete Sonatas]]. The Lettberg set is definitely better, although the Ponti has additional early works that are not included here. The main problem with the Ponti is the sound: in this music, you want to luxuriate, but are instead distracted by a brittle sounding recording. Both pianists are very fine, if not always reaching the heights of someone like Sofronitsky, Richter or Horowitz. I would say Lettberg is usually more poetic than Ponti, though both tend to rush occasionally when you want the music to stretch a bit more.   But these complaints are minor, and I must emphasize that Lettberg, a relatively unknown pianist, has achieved something amazing with this recording: she has recorded all of Scriabin's piano music with opus numbers, in excellent sound, with performances that are consistently superb and often magical. Consistency and comprehensiveness are the two major factors in my 5 star rating. Although there willalways be little things to quibble about, the bottom line is that Lettberg's set offers ALL of Scriabin's important piano music, and ALL of it is played extremely well! I think this is more than can be said about any other pianist who has recorded Scriabin's piano music. All the others are either not as comprehensive (Sofrinitsky, Richter, etc) or not as consistently excellent (Ponti).     So my point is, get this set while you can! It has already been withdrawn and reissued once, so who knows how long it will be around. It is also cheap, as is the Ponti, so if you must have the works without opus numbers, buy the Ponti as well, or a single disc of early pieces played by Stephen Coombs, [[ASIN:B000OQF58C The Early Scriabin]]. Even if you already have the Ponti, get the Lettberg if you can (I did and don't regret the extravagance). Whether you love Scriabin's music, merely like it, or want to discover it, this is a bargain that shouldn't be missed! It might even convert those who haven't previously enjoyed this music.

B006470HZ6|1.0|Season 2 has been so dull, predictable, and contrived that I went back and watched Season 1 again to see if maybe I had been mistaken about this series all along. Nope, Season 1 is very good. Season 2 so far lacks any of the elements that gripped me in Season 1. It has devolved into a rather lame soap opera with the occasional ineffectual zombie. I am sure all the episodes are already \\"in the can\\" so no course corrections to be made now. This will not have a Season 3, and I am personally done with Season 2.

1439190275|5.0|Am new to Atkins (about 4 weeks so far).  Decided to try it based on Gary Taubes' book, Why We Get Fat and What to Do About It.  The science seems pretty compelling.  The other reason I decided to try it is I've been a Lifetime Member of Weight Watchers for about 10 years.  During that time my weight has crept back up and I have found it increasingly difficult to keep off, even though I have followed the program faithfully.  I'm in my mid-50s now and menopausal, so I believe the changes in my hormone levels have interfered with my ability to continue being successful using the WW method (which allows you to eat any combination of nutrients you want as long as you stay within your points range).  Having said that, I did not experience the dramatic initial weight loss that some do with Atkins (only 4 lbs so far; my goal is 20 lbs total), but again, I think that's due to my age / hormone levels.  As it says in the book, it can be more challenging for menopausal women to lose.  However, based on how my clothes fit, I do feel like I'm losing inches (I confess I haven't measured, which Atkins recommends), so that's a positive.  Also, I love to cook and eat well and have more than a passing interest in good nutrition, and I've found Atkins to be a very healthy and satisfying / satiating way to eat.  Having cut out sugar, especially, seems to have really helped my sleep, and I'm not having nearly as many hot flashes.  Seems to be working for me, though it clearly is not going to be fast.

B004LROUW2|2.0|This is the first Haruki Murakami book I've read. Maybe it's the Japanese style of story development, but I found the constant retelling and rehashing of old history ultimately boring and distracting from the forward movement of the narrative. [I usually enjoy European, South American, and Asian fiction and read a lot of challenging books.] And I agree with some of the others about all the dysfunctional characters.  Kept wishing this had been pared down to 200-300 pages, and suspect that if this had been from a fresh talent the editors would have insisted on that, rather than giving free rein.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|I look at everybody reviewing poorly about \\"Twilight\\", \\"New Moon\\", \\"Eclipse\\", and even starting to talk bad about \\"Breaking Dawn\\" (which hasn't even been released yet).  The actors and actresses in these movies do portray what the overall feeling in the books were.  Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart do a wonderful job of capturing the feelings of Edward and Bella.  After all, this is a FORBIDDEN LOVE AFFAIR.<br />People say that in Twilight, Pattinson as Edward, looks in pain all the time, OF COURSE he does, read the book, he was fighting the urge to KILL her.  In each of the books, Bella is portrayed as a lovely yet clumsy girl, who really doesn't laugh alot, and has the sole responsibility of caring for Charlie (her Dad), she is dangerously serious (maybe wondering if her boyfriend is going to kiss her or bite her?), whose now moved from her Mother's house while a Junior in High School, with her Dad to the rainiest place in the US (which HAS to be depressing) and Stewart also did a great job portraying that.<br />I feel these movies are a great addition to anyone's collection that honestly likes Twilight and the fantasy world it portrays.  As long as people realize it's fantasy and shouldn't expect the same cinamagraphics or realism as you would from a non-fantasy movie.  These actors and actresses portray Stephenie Meyer's feelings in her books to a wonderful extent and couldn't have been cast better.<br />Try reading the books before \\"expertly\\" reviewing the films and the cast choices and situations will become alot clearer (you may want to also read the \\"Midnight Sun\\" draft by Stephenie Meyer, it's from Edward's point of view).  Also keeping in mind that the Producers do have a little artistic freedom to change aspects of the book for the movie versions as long as the overall concept and storyline is obtained.  Can't wait for BOTH \\"Breaking Dawn\\" DVD's!

B005TD4GTO|5.0|I've always been a fan of Oasis and found myself always enjoying the Oasis songs that Noel sang a little bit more than his brother.  Noel was definitely the creative side of Oasis and he carries that over in spades with his solo effort.  I was waiting anxiously for this album and every song is awesome.  I wished they would have added the song \\"Freaky Teeth\\" that he has been performing live.  Another great song.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|It's just funny!<br /><br />Loved this movie. I would call it a deep drama/ deep dramatic romance filled with bursts of comedy. This movie definiltey made us (wife and i) laugh hard. Steve Carrell definitely mad eus laugh. My wife loves Ryan Gosling! I thought the script was for the most part well written. I don't really have anything bad to say about the film other than they could have edited the edning a little for a more clear ending. Just felt like the movie had a quality that deserved a better ending, not that the ending was bad though ! I would definiltey recommend this film and I am sure we will watch it again because of the humor that barrels out of your center regions because of the absurdity! godbles movie lovers!<br /><br />~shauns move review
B004EPZ020|4.0|Paranormal Activity 3 relies on minimal scares in the beginning and gradually builds up to some more shocking situations later. With video cameras posted around the house we get to see what is going on at night. The mundane things we hear at night like furnaces clicking or wind blowing are at first made to look normal, but as the film progresses they become more insidious. The directors at first use special effects sparingly, instead waiting to build suspense throughout the film. A sheet creeps up behind the baby sitter only to collapse to the floor with nobody under it. Furniture and beds start to move and the sounds through the house seem like they are under control. Unlike so many modern horror films special effects here are needed only to enhance the documentary realism of the film.  Maybe these paranormal films have been successful because people are no longer swayed by elaborate out-of- this-world special effects.    When the director has convinced us that something is indeed going on he pulls out the punches. One the girl's has her hair pulled in mid-air by an invisible entity. The bed in the room starts to move violently. The family is forced to move to their grandmother's house where things get a lot creepier and the two unfortunate parents meets their demise by a Covent of ghoulish witches.  This film could have gotten ridiculous like the Poltergeist films, which were more like an amusement park rides than movies. I find those kinds of film neither suspenseful nor scary. Actually, many times they are actually funny.  What I liked about Paranormal Activity 3 is the film makers leave the situations up to your imagination. I like looking in the background for subtle supernatural hints being filmed by the camera. Sometimes something will flash by the camera that some in the audience will miss.  This is now the third Paranormal Activity film, and one wonders how long this gimmick can last. Nobody really knows how long these \\"docu-horror film\\" can last, but theBlair Witch Project was the first of these films and that was back in 1999.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|I have two kids, one 13 and the other 7 years old.  When we drive, they usually watch movies together if we can find one they both agree on.  It becoming increasingly more difficult.  The 13-year-old expressed reluctance but after the movie began, guess who was telling my wife and i that we were making too much noise. They talked amongst themselves while the movie was playing and laughing and joking about what they watched. After we returned, the 7-year-old wanted to see the movie again and we watched the blue-ray at home,  although I didn't watch the entire movie,  what i did see I did enjoy enough so I could watch the movie without reservation.

B004UA8D1O|4.0|Not a bad movie, kinda true in that its based upon real life.  I watched the 3D version, and my youngest son wanted to see it also, so the next day we watched the blue ray.
0312944926|5.0|Bull's Eye.  I just loved it.  For those fond of puzzles, crytography-thrillers and IS. Dan Brown can do more than just religious-tied riddles. He's also good in Information Technology
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This is an outstanding beginning for this young musician.  It is impressively performed and very well produced.  I think Scotty McCreery has started out on a very long and stellar career.  His musical talent and performance skills are rare in artists of any age or experience, but phenomenal at such a youthful age.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This quickly became one of our favorite movies. The villains are not scary for younger children and it's very entertaining for both younger and older audiences. Definitely a movie the family can enjoy together.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I really enjoyed a couple songs from this album, they were very nice and catchy. The rest of the songs I didn't care for to much.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|The game was great until it erased all my saved data when I was halfway through. This is a big problem that Amazon still has not addressed. I have talked to their customer support many times and they say sorry it happened but we can't fix it or get your data back. This is very frustrating as it is a long game and you have to pay for it. The free version on pc has all the same items as this paid app. If you buy the game for pc then you get access to mini games, puzzle, and survival. You get no additional content with this paid app just the adventure mode.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This mic has better low frequency response than the Canon HF M300, but isn't any \\"louder\\". The purpose of this mic is to be able to bring it closer to your audio source, nothing more. It will not reduce noise - it actually seems to be noisier at the same manual setting in a quiet room. By bringing the mic closer to source, you will increase your recording signal-to-noise ratio and the end result will be better sounding audio.   You won't see better results if the video camera will anyways be 2 feet away - you will get \\"bassy-er\\" sound, but also noisier. It's purpose is for use with subjects further from camera, such as lectures or talks.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|I have to agree with Wayne Rambo's review almost down the line.  I just wish I could give it 4 1/2 start.  Not quite a 5 star product but more than typical 4 star one.<br /><br />Can be a little tricky to install the bulb in the prongs, but that is true with ANY replacement bulb in a Mini Mag-Lite.  The increase in brightness is in my subjective estimation at least 2X the lumens of incandescent bulb, even a xenon one.  I have not had any focusing problems either, although it does not seem to have quite the depth of field differential as original unit, but still focuses at distance just as good and lot brighter.<br /><br />The on/off base switch is great feature, I can turn off and on with one hand easily now and maintain my focus setting.<br /><br />Simple fact of having a L.E.D. bulb is also a good reason for upgrading.  You will probably get at least triple the amount illumination time out of a set of batteries so will quickly save cost of upgrade in batteries if you use disposable carbon/zinc batteries and save time not having to recharge NiMH ones as often.

0547424779|3.0|I LOVE the book The Giver, which is why I was so excited to see a gift edition. I bought this because it looked genuinely deluxe. Well, it really isn't.    The illustrations in the text are nice, but the binding of the book is a big disappointment. That lovely image shown above is not what the physical book looks like, it is merely an image printed onto a dust jacket. I was expecting something along the lines of the gift edition of Lamb by Christopher Moore (seen here [..])    Don't buy this if you are expecting something really special. If you just want an illustrated copy, then this might be fine. For me, it's just a disappointment.
B0058WFO06|5.0|I have been listening to Wilson's work for almost a decade.  Knowing the sound of Porcupine Tree, Blackfield and his previous solo work I didn't know if the Grace for Drowning was going to be a surprise. It was. It is a musical journey that I have never taken before yet with familiar and characteristic tunes taken to another level. Each song slowly unfolds in layers being a journey on its own. Dark and haunting at times will make you come back to uncover more each time. Magnificent. Superb. A masterpiece.
0545259088|1.0|I can't even get into this one.  Then I thought let me peak at the end.  After reading that I thought I can't read this book its going to make me to frustrated and I have better books on my Kindle.  Luckily I borrowed it from the Library because the pink typesetting  and the small print gave me a headache.  I am sending this book back to the library unread.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|It is now obvious that when you want a super-hero film that takes place during World War II, the man to turn to is Joe Johnston.  First the highly underrated  \\"The Rocketeer\\" in the summer of 1991, and now the best super hero film of the summer of 2011.  Most people know the story of Steve Rogers, the 98 lb weakling turned into a  super-soldier by a scientific experiment.Created by the legendary Jack Kirby and Joe Simon before the U.S. officially entered the war, this film is fun and exciting from start to finish.  Chris Evans, the \\"Human Torch\\" from the Fantastic Four films is great both as 98 lb. Steve and super soldier Steve.  Tommy Lee Jones is a riot as a Pattonish Colonel that Captain America serves under.  British actress Hayley Atwell is beautiful in 1940's style make-up and hair design as the British officer assigned to the Captain America experiment who winds up being Steve's nominal love interest and Hugo Weaving is appropriately nasty as the Captain's nemesis, Red Skull.  As stated the action is fast and furious and the patriotic spirit of WW II is captured beautifully.  There is a nice patriotic musical number, \\"The Man with the Plan\\" starring the good Captain and a group of dancers probably representing the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes, played during the Captain's war bonds tour.  The picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are fine.  There are numerous not very long \\"making of\\" segments and one featuring the story of the Captain's origin.  There are deleted scenes and a much longer segment of the scene at the end where the Captain first meets Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury that is far better than the scene actually used in the film.  The music by Alan Silvestri is fine and the end-credits include patriotic posters, most of which were probably actually used during the war.  This just adds to the film's obviously patriotic feeling.  I looked forward more to \\"Green Lantern\\" last summer and greatly enjoyed it.  However I enjoyed this film more.  (If you enjoyed Director Johnston's work on this film, check out the previously mentioned \\"The Rocketeer\\"  I'm sure you will enjoy that one as well.)  And now we can look forward to the good Captain joining Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and others in the \\"Avengers\\" film next May.  And if you haven't already seen the film in the movies, stay to the absolute end of the credits for more on the above.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I do not write many reviews for books but I felt compelled to write a review on this book.  I have only known Robin for a short period of time but have learned so much from him.  The team at social-engineer.org has had him on the podcast a few times and each time I have learned something new.     When he told me that he was going to write a book documenting his steps to building rapport I knew right away that this information would be valuable for social engineers, sales people, managers, every day people... heck any one that can read and has to interact with another human being.     I don't want to recap everything but let me give you some highlights to the book.  Technique two is my favorite as it discusses using nonverbals.  Robin's simple approach and key reminders makes this very complex topic easy to understand.     Probably the most important topic in the book (in my opinion) is Technique 5 - Ego Suspension.  If this is the only point you walk away from after reading this book you would still be light years ahead of the masses.      Robin doesn't just give you the years of experience and life skills he has learned in those pages but he packed the book with 5 amazing practice exercises. Each of the exercises will challenge you to put the skills he taught you in the book to task.  That makes this a work book for your communications.  One that I am sure you will have dog-eared in no time.     Another valuable aspect to the book is that Robin gives you so many stories and not just the stories that make him look like a pro... but he actually goes into his failures.  He uses them to teach us lessons on how to and how NOT to do each of the principles he discusses.     This book is not just a book for security professionals, it is not just a book for sales people - it is really a book for all people.  If you are looking for a good read that will enhance your life this is the book you are looking for.  Christopher Hadnagy  Author of \\"Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking\\"  [...]

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This sounds funny for a business/technical book but this was a real \\"page turner.\\"  I couldn't put it down so good thing it's a quick read.  A very timely book.  A must read for anyone working in technology because it puts technology into context with business and the economy.  Every CEO should read it as it emphasizes the dramatic, and accelerating, impact technology will have on businesses and the work force.  Chapters one, two, and three are excellent.  Four and five are are good, but clearly from the perspective of academics.  As we look forward is the the goal of the economy to put people to work, or to raise everyone's standard of living?  Many maturity models use a chasm or valley (e.g. the uncanny valley in robotics) to describe a difficult transition in achieving the ultimate goal.  This book exposes the most pressing chasm of our generation:  maintaining the engagement of the work force as the next wave of automation (due to information technology) flows through society.  Surely Luddites will surface and it will be a difficult transition.  Too many insights to discuss.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|Breaking Bad is one of the best TV shows ever made, completely different from most of the other tv shows out there. Its entertaining and interesting. Has great characters: real people with rich, complex personalities, not the simple minded canned characters you typically see in other shows. The BB characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors, they do such a wonderful job. It also has intelligent, creative plots, and you just can't tell where its going from episode to episode. Always catches up by surprise. I hope it sets a new standard for tv shows of the future. Looking forward to another great season.

B005IGDW24|5.0|This movie resembles two recent 3D videos: it uses the same combination of real-life footage with cartoons as \\"Yogi bear\\" and its cartoon heroes resemble gnomes from \\"Gnomeo and Juliet\\". Like with \\"Yogi Bear\\", there is an entertaining plot which keeps you occupied, and there is good humor which makes you laugh. Smurfs is a little better than Yogi Bear, though, because plot is more sophisticated and acting is more complex and involved. There is nothing in this movie to scare little kids but they may get bored as one probably has to be 10+ years old to understand all the humor and adult's problems with balancing professional life with family and Smurfs, but adults will certainly have fun. I honestly think it is one of the better movies that came out in 3D to-date.   Talking about 3D - 3D effects are OK but not outstanding. There are several scenes made with extensive use of computer graphics done with 3D in mind which stand out, but the rest of the footage is regular 3D footage of live action with fine, but not stunning depth.  I noticed that this movie got several bad reviews on Amazon, with one and two stars ratings. As I looked through those reviews, I noticed that they were all written by people who remember Smurfs from TV shows from decades ago and who are frustrated that Smurfs in this movie are so different from what they remember. I can't blame them - this is human nature and the way how we attach to memories from the past. I never saw the original story, and if I saw it today, I probably would find it boring and outdated as the majority of old films and shows. Without the set of mind pre-determined by expectations about smurfs, I enjoyed the movie and found that it was fun to watch!
B004P8JPS6|2.0|Having read all Reacher novels -- and enjoyed them -- I am disappointed in The Affair. Details, pointed details that advance the plot or add to character, make good books. In this effort, Lee Child seems to have a handy encyclopedia to provide details of things like a claw hammer. Who needs the details of a claw hammer? Throughout the novel the details do not add, but rather slow the novel. Reacher's violence, which is always fun, consists of encounters that have nothing to do with the plot of the novel. I believe this is the poorest effort from Lee Child. I will await his next novel hopefully, especially if I get the old Reacher back.
0553801473|3.0|I've been a huge fan of GRRM's writing ever since I discovered A Game of Thrones all those years ago. I went on to devour A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, as well as a bunch of his short stories and novellas. All of these works exciting and enthralling, so much so that I was willing to forgive the A Feast for Crows fiasco, thinking he'd right the ship in the next book. With A Dance with Dragons, well, consider the ship still foundering.<br /><br />Unlike so many other reviewers, I'm not going to criticize Martin for taking the time to describe all the foods encountered throughout the world of his novel. I actually think that adds a layer of depth to the world-building. I also think it's childish to criticize Martin's sex scenes as, and I paraphrase, \\"the fantasy porn of a guy who doesn't have much experience with women.\\" Seriously, sex, food, setting descriptions...all those things in fantasy novels are like ads in magazines to me. If I'm interested, I'll slow down and pay attention. If not, I'll just skim through it until I get to the story.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have approached the heart of what's wrong with this book, and with AFFC before it. Characters travel and story-lines are moved into position, but the story doesn't really move forward. Lots of set up, things do happen, but nothing meaningful that gets the main characters acting upon each other.<br /><br />But I think the problem goes deeper. It's the characters, in my book, that are the problem. In the first three books, the main characters were involved in every single page, plotting to gain power and thwart each other. THAT was exciting. Some of them died, but their deaths made sense. Since AFFC, what I've been most disheartened with is the endless stream of characters that don't mean anything. For example, I could have gone through all these books without having to read a chapter from the perspective of any of the Dornish characters. Davos...? His chapters were interesting, but really?Theon's sister (can't even remember her name), Victarion, a Brazen Beast here, a Lannister uncle over there. It adds up to a whole mess of pages from characters I don't give a crap about. On the other hand, Arya gets a measly 2 chapters. Same with Bran. I can't even remember what happened to Rickon, and who knows where Sansa is now. Catelyn? Last I remember her, she had had her head sewn back on, but I can't remember seeing her since. And what happened to the other guy that kept dying and coming back, Berric Dondarion, I think?<br /><br />The sprawl has his this series hard. And I'm not sure GRRM can tighten it and bring it back under control.<br /><br />With ADWD, the problem is that I don't get to see enough of the main players acting in meaningful ways upon each others' plotting. I feel like the story hasn't moved since book 3. Just when things were starting to pick up in this book, GRRM pulls a frustrating little plot twist that's starting to get old. And the book ends.<br /><br />It wasn't all bad. I read it and continued to read it because I wanted to see where the story was going. Honestly, though, I was bored through the first 750 pages. I was more interested in the last 200. But then...well, I won't give the spoiler here.<br /><br />And despite my misgivings, I'm still going to read the next one. I'm holding on to this hope that these 2 last books were an aberration caused by the failed experiment of splitting two books by North and South. If he writes a condensed, complete 6th book, I think he can bring it back. Condensed in the sense that all the major players end up on the same stage (without all those minor characters taking up precious space), doing things that effect each other, and moving the story forward. From all his other works, I think he can pull it off. But he needs to do it quick, not another 5 years of waiting.<br /><br />And that brings me to my final issue with the series. I'm all for taking the time to write a polished product. But GRRM has taken that too far. I hardly remember a thing that happened in the 4th book, and only remember the major events of the first 3. Things get mentioned and referenced in this book that leave me drawing complete blanks. If Martin was releasing a book every 2 years, that wouldn't be the case. With all the time that has passed, the reader changes, and the story starts to lose significance (at least in my mind).<br /><br />So, if you've gotten this far, it's probably still worth reading. But don't expect any fireworks.

B005DHC6R0|4.0|One cannot discuss this album without a comment about Beady Eye's release earlier this year. On that note, let me say that Noel Gallagher's brother Liam (and other ex-Oasis bandmates Gem Archer, Andy Bell, and Chris Sharrock) delivered the goods: Beady Eye's debut album was/is surpisingly and shockingly good. Now some 8 months later comes Noel's highly anticipated debut album.<br /><br />\\"Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds\\" (10 tracks; 43 min.) starts off tentatively with the unfocused \\"Everybody's On the Run\\", with a choir all over the song that really makes it sound busier than it should be. \\"Dream On\\" sounds like the typical latter-day Oasis song, not bad, not great. \\"The Death of You and Me' (1st UK single) is truly a curious choice as a single, a mid-tempo, almost lazy-sounding track. \\"(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine\\" closes the so-so first half of the album, which I rate 3 stars. The 2nd half starts off with \\"AKA... What a Life\\" (2nd UK single), which immediately kicks up the energy a knotch or two, and one of the first highlights on here. Track 8, \\"AKA... Broker Arrow\\" reminds me of classic Oasis, and is BY FAR my favorite track on the album. The closing track is \\"Stop the Clocks\\", which was supposed to have been on the Oasis compilation of the same name (but Noel decided at the last minute to withhold it), and another great track. I rate the 2nd half of the album 4 stars.<br /><br />In all, this is not a bad album but quite uneven, and containing too few truly memorable songs. It sounds overall like latter-days Oasis, albeit a bit better, but not by much. It confirms to me that Noel Gallagher's muse is no longer where it was, say, 15 years ago. Compare that to Beady Eye's wonderful and deliciously 60s era-sounding debut album. As much as it pains me to say this (as I have no great love for Liam as a person), the Beady Eye album is the better of this, period. I would've never expected this to be the case, but there it is. Noel Gallagher is touring in support of this alnum, and he mixes up the setlist with this album and Oasis material (unlike Beady Eye, which strictly plays new material). Would love to see both of these bands in concert at some point (I have tickets to see Beady Eye next month, I can only hope the Noel will tour the US soon too).of this alnum, and he mixes up the setlist with this album and Oasis material (unlike Beady Eye, which strictly plays new material).

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is pretty much the same as the Ripped in 30 DVD with Jillian, which I also have. Unfortunately, I need to return this DVD or exchange it because the first (and only) time I've used it, it started skipping around.  If you buy \\"Ripped in 30\\" don't buy \\"30 Day Shred\\" and vice versa. Great workouts though!!
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Let me just preface this review by saying I'm only reviewing this processor based on my own experience, not by benchmarks, which, by the way, seem to be sorely lacking for this particular processor.  I've upgraded from an Athlon II X4 630, and I'm running the processor on an ASUS M5A87 motherboard with the 0701 BIOS update.  Updating the BIOS via ASUS' utility was a little nerve-wracking, but ultimately painless, and the FX-8120 works flawlessly with it.  Installation of the processor with stock cooler was also reasonably painless, though the lever on the cooler didn't exactly function intuitively, and the pictures in the manual were useless.  I had to watch a YouTube video just to make sure I was doing it right.  This doesn't matter, though, because you don't want to use the stock cooler, even if you're not overclocking.  Trust me.   The big minus to this processor is the utterly hideous stock cooler.  At idle, it's dead silent, true.  Idle temperatures were 18 degrees C for me.  Watch a YouTube vid, fire up a virtual machine, listen to an album in Media Player, or stream something from Netflix, and you'll hear a really loud whir that doesn't stop until a few seconds after you've stopped your minor activity.  My old Athlon II X4's cooler sounded like that when I'd been gaming for an hour or two.  And gaming...  The first night after I installed the processor, I played the new Dungeon Siege 3 DLC and my computer sounded like a shop vac.  My husband even complained about the noise.  The next night, as I was trying to figure out some sort of solution, I discovered it got almost as loud playing Torchlight!  Don't think you can snap in a new fan on the cooler to stop the noise, because it won't be as efficient as AMD's vacuum cleaner fan.  Believe me, I tried.  I'm now using the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo, and it's fantastic; I idle at 13 degrees C, and peak gaming temperatures are around 42 degrees C.  It's also reasonably quiet, about as loud as my old Athlon II X4'scooler during gaming.  Plenty of other aftermarket coolers are out there, so maybe you'll find something even better.  This leaves me with the pluses.  I can't even begin to list them, honestly.  This has been an utterly fantastic upgrade for me; everything's faster, and I didn't think my old processor was slow.      First, the stuff I never considered.  The time from the Welcome screen on Windows 7 to usable desktop is about 10 seconds faster.  I remember reading much merriment about how quick decompression and compression of files was the only thing the Bulldozer processors had over their Sandy Bridge counterparts.  As someone who downloads a lot of zipped files from Jamendo, Bandcamp and archive.org, this was actually a huge selling point.  Unzipping a file is about three times faster than my old Athlon II X4: most files unzip in less than a second with 7-Zip.  MSE's quick scans are about 15 seconds faster on average, and MalwareBytes' quick scans are about 30 seconds faster.  Word 2010 loads my giant fantasy novel from hell and finishes its spell-check and page count processing in half the time.  My Ubuntu VM on VirtualBox feels like it's running on native hardware.  I have 160GB or so of mp3s organized in single album folders, and my old Athlon II X4 would take at least a couple of seconds to display the first screen of files in Windows Explorer.  I can access them without delay with this processor.  Javascript-heavy webpages load instantly, no matter what browser I use.  Gaming is where I really expected to see most of the boost, and I haven't been disappointed at all.  Every game I play loads noticeably faster, and internal menus in any game's UI don't lag at all, unlike on my old processor.  Benchmarks have been utterly useless for me in this arena, because I don't play the FPS and racing games that are typically benchmarked.  Dragon Age: Origins is extremely smooth, and the 1.03 version with long, slow load screens isn't slow anymore.  Dungeon Siege 3 is fluid and gorgeous, without the occasional stutter I'd have when moving the camera or accessing the UI menus.  Older games play well with this processor: I've had no issues with KOTOR or Silverfall.  A word of warning: I've read that some of the newer Steamworks games have had bluescreen issues, such as Portal 2, Total War: Shogun2 and Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  I'm not sure if this has been fixed yet: the Steam client just updated Steamworks a few days ago, but the release notes were spotty, and I haven't read anything about the issue being fixed.  I haven't experienced any issues with my Steamworks games.  If I could, I'd deduct half a star for the horrible stock cooler.  Seriously, it's unusable for anything beyond surfing the web.  But other than that, this processor really deserves five stars from me.  I've seldom been so happy with an upgrade, beyond upgrading to my HD 6870.  If you have an Athlon II X4 630 or slower, an AM3+ motherboard, and some dollars to spare, this is a no-brainer.

1401229921|5.0|As an Artist I love the skill of Jim Lee. He is overlooked by most because of the title \\" Comic book \\". Not if you look at the raw art in this book... you will be amazed!<br />This book shows how infinitely beautiful his talent is. Most pages leave you wondering \\" How did he think this up... and how did he find the time to crank it out?\\". When you read his biography, and see all that he is involved in, then your stumped...he must be a 24/7 drawing machine... like a human printer to pull it off.<br /><br /> The story line in \\" Hush\\"  is one of the best for Batman. Upon finishing the book I immediately went back to the first page to read it again. ( and I am extreme A.D.D.) Also parents, It shows what it takes to be an comic artist... in skill and ability.. for anyone who is thinking of taking on this career you must see it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|From the very beginning this book grabs you as only Stephen King can do.  This is the first Steven King book that I have downloaded to my Kindle and I am really enjoying it.  I read every Stephen King book that he has written - anxiously waiting for each one to be published.  He seemed to be slipping a bit in the last few although I have always enjoy his style.  This one is very well written and is perhaps one of his best.

B00000J2PH|4.0|Tapestry is one of those classic albums you can't just get enough of. And on saying that this CD offers more - 2 previously unreleased bonus songs. One song called Out in the Cold which was apparently recorded during the Tapestry sessions which was OK and the other a live version of Smackwater Jack which I would have preferred left off. CD is very good quality.
B005BQTUVI|5.0|The addition of footage in this Director's Cut, while not significantly changing the story of the mutated Roaches, does add more of a human interest story to Miro Sirvino's and Jeremy Northam's characters.

B0011UBDTK|3.0|I was impressed with the price and how fast the product arrived, but was very disappointed in the quality of the disks.  There are several episodes that I wasn't able to watch due to the disk freezing up in the middle of the episode.  I thought that when you bought something New it was suppose to work.  Well this one didn't I would say out of all the episodes abt 6 were defective.  Very upset about this product.
0385344325|3.0|\\"The Affair\\" is the first of Lee Child's books I've read and I was impressed by his meticulously detailed style. He writes in the voice of his character Major Jack Reacher, an Army MP with a wicked right, left or center punch--it doesn't matter which direction he's coming from, he's lethal.   In this prequel to the Reacher series, he's been sent to a small town in Mississippi--the home of an out-of-the-way Army base--to keep an eye on a developing murder case. The Army is afraid that one of their own has slit a beautiful woman's throat and left her corpse in the street outside a local bar.  I don't usually read mystery thrillers--I scare easily--but I'm writing a mystery and it's a good idea to explore the genre. What I learned is that you must have a really smart steely sleuth--it helps if he's 6' 5\\" and handsome. He's got to meet up with a gorgeous woman who gets involved in the case--in this case the local sheriff. You have to put suspicion on several of your characters. I'm sure it helps if your hero and the gorgeous sheriff have sex at frequent intervals. Child out did himself with the sex, giving the characters an absolutely unique (even amusing) approach to the act. I'll add that there was nothing that would be offensive to most readers.  I did question \\"our hero's\\" ability to murder bad guys with abandon. He seemed to believe that he had the right and the duty to save the taxpayers the expense of a trial. That took him down as a hero for me.  It's hard to review a book like this because so much of what could be said would spoil the mystery for other readers. So enough said. I'm sure readers who frequent this genre will love this well crafted thriller. Next? Michael Connelly's \\"The Brass Verdict\\" is waiting for me.

0060936223|5.0|Patti Smith's prose is worthy of a Maplethrope Polaroid, or is it that his pictures worthy of her words? Their story is brilliant told, a slice of her long and his too short life. She pays homage to Robert the artist by giving us a glimpse of Robert the man. I can't help but feel she was being stinge with her stories (she admits as much at the end, saying she has many more stories about him, but this is what she choose to tell).  She tells the story with clarity and a touch that is light on details - I imagine like the light on Bond St., glorious even when cloudy, just enough to illuminate the subject but never fully chasing the shadows away.  The end come swiftly, but not without warning. We grieve for the loss of artist, muse, friend, companion, other half.  Smith allows us a rare glimpse behind the curtain of post-Woodstock NY and it is glorious and gritty and nasty and in the end it takes a favored son, one of many, but mourned none-the-less.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|melodrama<br />noun<br />1. a dramatic form that does not observe the laws of cause and effect and that exaggerates emotion and emphasizes plot or action at the expense of characterization.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I use the term pejoratively.<br /><br />With a main character so relentlessly pathetic, meek and neurotic, I found my sympathy quickly transitioning to frustration and then boredom.  What little psychological tension existed by the film's end was extinguished when subtlety was abandoned and the symbolism become grotesque, absurd and ultimately, silly.<br /><br />But then again, I did get to see Natalie Portman in a most satisfyingly intimate fashion, so, it wasn't all bad.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|I feel guilty writing this review, guilty because there is so much beauty and so much potential in this book.  Unfortunately, I felt as if the book was an unedited first draft after reading it.  There are some great chapters, and as other reviews point out, very magical images that really capture your imagination.  The characters and the plot line were the weakest points in my opinion.  The story often dragged and I found myself putting the book down for days at a time.  The main characters felt flat and one-dimensional, especially the darker characters.  I found myself more interested in side characters than the two main love interests, Celica and Marco, who seemed self-involved and pompous in varying degrees.    If you enjoy the excerpts with the intriguing imagery you'll probably get some enjoyment out of the book, but just be prepared for some tedious chapters in between.  I'm not sure what other book I could say this is like, other than to remember reading Proust thinking what a beautiful chapter, only to feel as if the next 50-100 pages dulled in comparision.    Again, I really feel like the problem is with the editing, not the writing.
1401207529|2.0|Those were the exact words running through my mind upon finishing this underwhelming and meandering story.<br /><br />Jim Gordon is a self-righteous putz, Bruce Wayne is aloof and unremarkable, and Batman is made out to be such an inept klutz in his beginnings that any subsequent heroic feats seem disingenuous, absurd and aided heavily by luck. How one can go from nearly getting his ass kicked by three teenagers to decimating a police death squad after a few months training is beyond me.<br /><br />I know, I know, it is just a comic.  Suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite.  But if that is the case, then I expect to be entertained and rewarded for my investment.  Instead, I read a rather ordinary story framed by cheesy, expository dialogue lifted from a Raymond Chandler novel, sans the wit and social criticism.
0670022705|1.0|Having heard about this book I searched for it on Amazon as soon as I could.  But, wait there's a big surprise.  The print, hard copy costs MORE then the ebook version.<br />I simply can't get passed such thinking to actually buy a copy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love playing this game. The graphics are great, have a great feel to them. The music is very relaxing without being too repetitious.<br /><br />The levels start out easy and add challenges and twists as you move along. You can earn hints for levels that you get stuck. The ultimate goal is to get gold (perfect moves) on all levels.<br /><br />I wish there were more games like this one but it seems to be pretty unique.<br /><br />A great game of logic and sequencing.

0896760278|5.0|This book not only includes many graphed-out patterns, but some drawings of other garments as well.  I was able to take a non-graphed drawing (from some of the earlier pages in the book, before she launches into the full patterns) of a 1914 gown, and even that scaled up into a wearable garment once I enlarged the image to the same scale as her graphed patterns.<br /><br />That was my first ever experience with drafting a pattern (for a class I was in), so I'd consider the book very user-friendly to a seamstress with moderate experience.  If you know how to properly re-size a pattern to fit your measurements, you should have no trouble using this book to draft the original.<br /><br />Love the garments in the book!

9707704667|5.0|Definitivamente este libro se ha convertido en uno de mis favoritos. Es seductora la manera en la que el autor narra los sucesos y describe cada lugar, cada personaje y cada escena. No dude en leer esta maravillosa historia de amor y pasión.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|From the moment \\"The End\\" kicks off The Black Parade, we know we're in for a ride on an epic scale:  the song deliberately sounds like Pink Floyd's \\"In the Flesh\\" (opening track to \\"The Wall\\").  There are other passages throughout The Black Parade that imitate classic rock, but this is still an MCR album through and through.  \\"Dead\\", \\"The Sharpest Lives\\", and \\"This is How I Disappear\\" could easily have come from Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge and that's not at all a bad thing.<br /><br />The Black Parade takes the idea of 'the sophomore slump' and kicks it square in the teeth:  MCR finds that right balance of keeping the sound the fans love with the need to move ahead.  They're not afraid of branching out and trying new things.  \\"House of Wolves\\" crosses straight-ahead guitar parts that could easily have come from Van Halen with a swing-style beat, turning the song into an energy-fueled romp.  \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" soars through Queen-like guitars backed by a military cadence, then breaks into a fast-tempo romp that reminds us that My Chemical Romance is still in control, building to vocal heights that Sebastian Bach would envy.  It's this combination that makes The Black Parade an excellent album.  \\"Sleep\\" mixes in samples of people describing terrifying nightmares, but one of my favorite passages in this album is hearing lead singer Gerard Way somehow manage to sing softly, angrily, through clenched teeth (the opening to \\"Famous Last Words\\").<br /><br />If you're new to My Chemical Romance, this is a good place to start:  it's broader than Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge but it's not a themed concept album like Danger Days.  You'll hear more of their potential here, where it's clear there are great things ahead for them.  The big standout hit was \\"Teenagers\\", but give The Black Parade a spin and you'll see there's a lot more to explore here.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I can't quite put into words about what Megadeth has managed to conjure up over the years.  It seems that since the misfires of \\"Cryptic Writings\\" and \\"Risk\\" way back when, Dave Mustaine has forged the band on a truer metal path that the band hasn't had since the 80s.  Saying that, \\"TH1RT3EN\\" is simply wonderful.  With founding bassist Dave Ellefson returning to the band, this is Megadeth at their best.  \\"Sudden Death\\", \\"Public Enemy No. 1\\", \\"Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)\\", \\"Black Swan\\", and the title track are spectacular, headbanging goodness.  This is the Megadeth I love and remember and have cherished for years now.  Ellefson is a welcome return to the lineup, and Mustaine and co. sound great and polished.  All in all, \\"TH1RT3EN\\" is just plain awesome, and deserves to be heard by your ears immediately.  No seriously, go listen to this now.

B004CAWKXE|5.0|Danger Days is a concept album:  it throws us into the badlands of a post-apocalyptic wasteland right from the start.  While there are stand-alone songs, the whole of Danger Days weaves the Mad Max concepts in & out.  Between tracks we get a DJ host named \\"Dr. Death\\".  Dr. Death's tongue-in-cheek news, weather & traffic reports are reminiscent of Fallout 3's \\"ThreeDog\\" and Iggy Pop's \\"Angry Bob\\" (from the cyberpunk film \\"Hardware\\").<br /><br />If there's one thing different here for My Chemical Romance it's the addition of keyboards--\\"Sing\\" and \\"Planetary (GO!)\\" are good examples of how a song can still be high-energy and original even with a synth background.  The songs that stand out as 'hit' material are more accessible than their earlier work: while The Black Parade was a bit more appealing for existing MCR fans,  you could easily hear \\"Bulletproof Heart\\", \\"Gravity\\", and \\"Planetary (GO!)\\" on the radio and that wouldn't be a bad thing.  Ballads like \\"S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W\\" and the shout-punk \\"Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)\\" are pure pop guilty pleasure.<br /><br />I thought Danger Days would just be a fun album to listen to from time to time; instead I've been pleasantly surprised at the enjoyable sounds they're broadcasting for us in Danger Days, from their own vision of a blasted land.

185984054X|5.0|In modern culture, people commonly refer to kindly persons as \\"Mother Teresa.\\"  They couldn't be farther from the truth.  This book exposes her true motives and the great evil that forms the infrastructure of all her efforts, including the politicians and other self-serving individuals who conspired with her to bilk millions of dollars from the kind-hearted and unsuspecting.  It is rare that an \\"icon\\" of religious culture has the covers removed.  This book does a good job of showing a classic example of a \\"whited sepulcher\\" that has rotting dead men's bones within.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|The one thing I will say, over the course of the past twenty-six years or so, is that Megadeth is consistent.  With the exception of Risk (which still had gems like Prince Of Darkness and Breadline)they have never had a truly bad album to their credit.  TH1RT3EN is better than most.  Since I heard Countdown To Extinction (my personal favorite) I have not heard a Megadeth album that was this stunning.  Stunning? Yes.  Stunning!  From open to close, TH1RT3EN is sheer metal goodness Megadeth style.  Last January I was afforded the opportunity to see Dave Mustaine at the NAMM show and he was talking about this album, saying that they had to do something special since it was the 13th album Megadeth would issue.  Between then and its release, Dave & Co delivered.  I'm not sure if the return of David Ellefson has anything to do with it (I'm sure it helped) but there is something on TH1RT3EN that has been missing on the last few Megadeth albums.  Hooks.  And plenty of them.  Some will say that this is too commercial for them and that is to be expected (your copy of Peace Sells is right over there...) but I prefer to have songs that I instantly remember.  Chris Broderick is amazing here and there is an energy that you can feel right from the first few tracks.  Let's look at the songs:<br /><br />Sudden Death:  Wailing opener.  Great lyrics.  This song sets the poundin metal pace for the entrie album.  Heaven send its love... with sudden death from above!<br /><br />Public Enemy #1:  This sounds like it was right off Extinction! Great!  The drum sound is epic and Chris & Dave are on fire!  Great licks, memorable chorus, and haunting lyrics.  Roses on your grave, I'll be on my way, there's no time to stay, with the enemies I've made...<br /><br />Whose Life (Is It Anyway):  This sounds like something off of Peace Sells.  Thrashing.  Angry.  Pissed off teenage angst song. Shredding aplenty.  The drums smash you in the face. Hey! Just whose life it it anyway, you tell me how to live but who asked you anyway.<br /><br />We The People:  I knew Dave couldn't go too long without adding a political speech into the background.  Who is that JFK?  Probabaly.  Dave's voice is a bit strained here (hasn't it been for 30 years?).  Great lyrics.  American political stabs.  Excellent.  Dave is here to tell us how it is and he's probably not far from the truth.  Sounds very Youthanasia, which isn't a bad thing.  Dave definittely sharpened up his writing skills as the lyrics flow perfectly.<br /><br />Guns, Drugs & Money:  One of my favs from the album.  Drity, angry, venomous.  Dave does nasty like no other.  Poverty will turn the life of any good man bad...  There are hooks here and it shows immediately.  TH1RT3EN will ingrain itself into your memory quickly without the typical 20 listens.  This song is epic and the production shines.  Hard, fast and METAL!<br /><br />Never Dead:  Creepy intro.  Great riffs.  Wow!  This sounds great. Dave really outdid himself on this 13th outing.  The effort shows immedaitely.  Machine-gun accuracy.  This song rolls over you like a tank.  Sounds like Rust In Peace!<br /><br />New World Order:  Here we have a song that many would call filler (I do)but it's not a bad song, it's just rehashed.  From Youtahasia-era Megadeth, this song has already been collected and that is why I'm calling it filler.  No offense to the song, it's killer.  It's just not new and I believe that Dave used this and the other previously recorded song here to round out the album to 13 songs.  New World Order is a great song.  heavy.  Driven.  Dark.  Megadeth.  But why re-record it?<br /><br />Fast Lane:  Reminds me of Moto Psycho from The World Needs A Hero.  Road rage song.  Lyrics are sharp and come at you like a knife.  The riff is very Black Sabbath.  Sounds like it could have come from So Far, So Good... (better production, of course).  Dave is relentless.  This is Megadeth in overdrive.  Yikes!<br /><br />Black Swan:  Another favorite on thealbum.  God, there are riffs all over the place!  Haunting.  If you didn't know Megadeth, this would sound like something from the early 90's.  Dave is revitalized. You can feel the energy in every track. The shredding is here and it's awesome.  Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me, it's only there to terrify my mind, black swan keeps haunting me.<br /><br />Wrecker:  The angry ex-girlfriend/wife song.  Reminds me of 1,000 Times Goodbye.  Thrashing.  Driving.  Cranked-up metal.  Poison ivy in your touch, being with you wrecked so much...  Is there a little She-Wolf here? Yeah.  Just listening to this song gets your adrenalin pumping.  Hell yeah!  This deep into the album, you will still be amazed at the clean, deep sound they got out of the production.  Epic.<br /><br />Millennium Of The Blind:  The other rehased Youthanasia song.  This one sounds much better than the orginal and I believe that there are some lyrics added here since the original was like 2:15 and this new version is 2 minutes longer.  I got a little creepy Guns N' Roses feel in the chorus section.  This is not the best song on the album,  It's heavy, ponderous and dreary.  And that's not terrible (it's a Megadeth album!), just not going to be your favorite.<br /><br />Deadly Nightshade:  The riff sounds like Mustaine-influenced Metallica.  The dangerous chick song ala She-Wolf.  You can hear David Ellefson loud and clear.  Rocking.  Won't be your favorite either, but it doesn't manage to break up the continuity of the album.<br /><br />13:  Of course, the 13th song on the 13th album is titled 13.  I believe this is the reason for the two filler songs.  Had to have everything right.  Great accoustic intro.  Dave's strained voice is genuine and this song will quickly grow on you.  Great album ender.  When was the last time you even got this far on an album and the music wasn't an attrocity? Not very often.  Excellent!<br /><br />You will fill the energy on TH1RT3EN immediately.  This is a great album.  Where Endgame was musically awesome, there were no hooks.  here they are.  Dave and David work well together and it has been too long.  This is the Megadeth album that you will be listening to for a good long time.

B00637UISI|5.0|Been listening to it all morning. REALLY like it, and am glad I went ahead and got the deluxe version.  The overall tone of the soundtrack is quieter than the soundtracks for the first three movies, but it makes up for volume with intensity and passion.  The token track from the score, \\"Love Death Birth\\" uses bits from Carter Burwell's original Twilight score.  I'm eager to hear what he's done for the whole score when the movie comes out. I am tempted to want to knock half of a star off (if that were possible) from the overall rating because of the last track, which is just an instrumental version of \\"All Yours\\" from the Eclipse soundtrack.  It's a nice arrangement, but doesn't really fit in with this CD.  Oh well, that's the beauty of building your own playlists--you can just skip over the songs you aren't crazy about.
B004LROUNG|5.0|The characters, plot(s) and prose all combine to make this one of Grisham's best yet.  Why? because it is so believable and realistic.  There is a little of each of us in this book.  A truly enjoyable read!
1593157134|4.0|Darren Hardy's book, The Compound Effect, is billed as another in the line of Dale Carnegie's How To Win Friends and Influence People and Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad. While I benefited from reading Hardy's book, it is not as ground-breaking or life-changing as those other two.<br /><br />Hardy's thesis is best summed up near the start of Chapter Two: \\"For most of us, it's the frequent, small, and seemingly inconsequential choices that are of grave concern. I'm talking about the decisions you think don't make any difference at all. It's the little things that inevitably and predictably derail your success.\\"<br /><br />The book doesn't teach you any new lessons that haven't been covered before elsewhere. In fact, Hardy, the publisher of SUCCESS magazine, frequently quotes successful men and women whom he has interviewed for the magazine. The strength of Hardy's book is, instead, the simple, sustainable tips it offers.<br /><br />This is a great book to read if you've had trouble sustaining productivity, because it is motivational and offers achievable goals. Hardy's principle -- making small changes that will lead to large effects -- is applicable to any area of life: working out, eating healthier, getting further at work, and more.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book: If you're looking for a book to help you achieve more, if you're feeling stuck in your bad habits, or if you haven't read a good self-help book in a while. I wouldn't recommend this book if you are already well-acquainted with books like those aforementioned or others by authors like Jim Rohn or John Maxwell, and if you're not in need of another, simpler version of those titles.<br /><br />Note: I was provided a free copy of this book by the publisher and was not required to write a positive review.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I got a white 4S because I was forever losing my old black phone in my purse or car, so I wanted a cover that would not cover up the color.  I love the look of this cover, and that it is not bulky and provides just enough protection for what I need.  I took off one star because the opening at the bottom is just thick enough that I can no longer put the phone on my docking station, maybe i'll find a way to shave it down a bit without ruining the case altogether.
B004ZNB12O|3.0|I'm really angry about this trying to formally \\"review\\" this album.<br /><br />Yes, it is all totally remastered music and yes, the price is nice, but can you remaster my mind to buy such a barebones collection of music most of us already have?<br /><br />I love this band. They stand (or at least once stood) for individuality and straightforward rock with so many deep levels of messages in their music it was a wonderful experience.<br /><br />What is getting me so steamed up (and so upset) is that this is one of the best 60's/70's prog bands to stand next to such rock giants as Led Zeppelin and the Doors, and (until the last few years) have never released more than two much better done \\"greatest hits\\" albums.<br /><br />This \\"collection\\" is insulting to any potential Pink Floyd fan who knows them for only a few songs, and is even more insulting for the hardest of fans.<br /><br />The majority of this album is made up of either songs \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Dark Side Of The Moon,\\" and these two albums - wonderful as they are for their own special and unique reasons - do not define the Pink.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few cuts from their early days - \\"See Emily Play\\" has always been a mind-blower on it's own - but to totally gloss any selections from over the wonderful albums \\"Meddle\\" or \\"Animals\\" hurts me personally as they showed the world they were not just a group of guys who just played psychadelica, but made insightful, controlled and massively entertaining musical works that were evocative in so many ways that it has changed the way many bands have approached their works since, and those two albums defined them, and to omit any songs from those albums is painful to see.<br /><br />However, if I wanted \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" I would have bought them separately, or I would have bought one of the best collections by them, \\"Echoes,\\" which can be found here on Amazon for half the price and has twice the content and gives you a better timeline of who the Pink really are.<br /><br />I wanted to give you the tracklist, but you know most of the songs here, and if you are even the lightest of fans, you've got most of this music anyway!<br /><br />I feel bad that \\"the three remaining members hand chose these selections,\\" as it's measly as a sampler and low on their real content that hasn't been put out there many times before.<br /><br />Please understand, I love the band and their music, always will - but to basically toss this off at the fans as a one-off album selection is kind of insulting.<br /><br />Shame on them.<br /><br />(Anyway, thanks for reading, and please don't leave a vote or comment if you liked it or not.)really are.<br /><br />I wanted to give you the tracklist, but you know most of the songs here, and if you are even the lightest of fans, you've got most of this music anyway!<br /><br />I feel bad that \\"the three remaining members hand chose these selections,\\" as it's measly as a sampler and low on their real content that hasn't been put out there many times before.<br /><br />Please understand, I love the band and their music, always will - but to basically toss this off at the fans as a one-off album selection is kind of insulting.<br /><br />Shame on them.<br /><br />(Anyway, thanks for reading, and please don't leave a vote or comment if you liked it or not.)

B005HQ5S3G|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this album.  I didn't care for \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" at all. In fact, I hated it.  I didn't care for \\"My December\\" either.  So Kelly, coming off 2 subpar albums, I really didn't know what to expect.<br /><br />What we got here, is a beautifully crafted album.  It's the first album since Kelly's debut album, that isn't overproduced.  Kelly has been working with the best of the best in terms of producers and writers and quite frankly, they've been overproducing the poop out of her music.  They turned Kelly into a manufactured sounding, bubble-gum pop artist.  However, on this album, Kelly sounds totally different.  The sound is mature, and it isn't overly poppy at all.  It's very, very refreshing to hear, like I said, after several overproduced albums in a row.<br /><br />\\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Einstein\\" are definitely 2 standout songs for me on this album. The album is solid across the board, and there really isn't an \\"Instant Skip\\" song on the entire CD.<br /><br />For those who might have lost faith in Kelly Clarkson over the past 2 albums like I did, this is a breath of fresh air, and puts Kelly back on the map in a very positive light.  Excellent work!

B002ZG99TK|1.0|Literally the worst film I have ever seen. I'm not normally one for writing reviews but this is up there with '2012' (with John Cusack) for ridiculousness and I feel compelled to write about it! The continuity errors are ridiculous from the start and the fact that it is based on true events make the people involved seem like morons. Police shooting at a stop button on the train which is next to a fuel tank - genius. The only thing that could have made it worse would be for John Cusack to pop up with a 2012-esque performance. Denzel Washington is the one bright spot but I think it is time he moves away from train-based movies... Avoid this film at all costs.
B005NPLXJ4|3.0|I approach this more of a Metallica fan, and own virtually every scrap of music they put out.  So when they annouced this project, I was in for it, and pre-ordered it as soon as I could.  Now it is here, all I really have to say is that this is a Lou Reed ablum, and Metallica is his expensive backing band. And truely, the label \\"Lou Reed & Metallica\\" is labeled correctly for this reason.  If you step back and objectivly look at this album, it is not a far cry from the glam rock/art rock based music Lou Reed has done since the Velvet Undeground and his own solo material.  Metallica used this opportunity to work with someone they have admired for years. I agree this album is repetative in the music riffs, and the vocals are more just rambling poetry and thoughts. But looking at the album as a whole, it does fit the \\"theme genera\\" about LuLu from the 1895 Erdgeist play by Wedekind and the LuLu Opera in 1937 by Alban Berg (in short, a prominent promiscuous woman with many troubles who ends up a prostitute who meets Jack the Ripper).  Overall, I think it has it's part's that work, and it was not as painful for me to listen to as some would claim, but overall, not my cup of tea, and it will be a few and far between listen to album for me. If this was paired with a new performace play and a book/writing set up as many plays are, this would solidify more for many people.

B001TAFCBC|3.0|First, I must say upfront and be honest here when I say that I have typecast Jim Carey into humor roles only, and that seeing him in a more dramatic role just didn't work for me from the beginning. He has those crinkles of humor around his eyes, his face, everything. He's a classically handsome man, but I just can't see him as anything but a comedic actor.<br /><br />Secondly, the filming of the movie was poor. It felt B-grade, low-grade, and kind of dark and jerky. Perhaps that was the intent but for me, it made the movie feel old. Had I not known it was a newer movie, and just glanced at it on the television, I would have thought it was a 70s movie.<br /><br />All that said, I love the premise: What would life be like if you could just erase all your worst memories, to get rid of all those things that are painful, negative, etc. What would that do to who you are and how you feel?<br /><br />The movie brings up more questions than it does answers, but in a good way. And it does provide answers as to what it does to certain people.<br /><br />However, I found it boring, dragging and slowly plotted. I was easily distracted because I couldn't get into the movie. I wanted to like it, but it just didn't do it for me.

B002ZG99N6|5.0|This movie grabbed me from the opening scenes and didn't let go of me for even a moment until the very end.  Well done!<br /><br />There's a blend of action, romance, and intrigue, the acting is solid, the characters are believable while having depth, and the story is interesting in a Bostonian blue-collar struggle sort of way.  We wind up simultaneously disliking the lead character (because he's a criminal) and liking him (because he clearly still has goodness and moral criteria in him), and that ambivalence nicely ties in with real life.<br /><br />Though there was a minor plot flaw which my wife picked up also, it wasn't large enough to ruin the movie, and overall I enjoyed the movie enough to readily recommend it.
0066620996|5.0|When I first heard of this book I expected another management snoozer filled with platitudes.  It's anything but.  Yes, \\"great\\" is distilled down to a manageable number of primary concepts and findings, but Collins' authorship makes it a compelling read as he proves and disproves his own preconceptions.  This was as meaningful to me as Peters' In Search of Excellence and Porter's Competitive Strategy.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|Going over what I heard last night at The Red Lobster while eating too much of all you can eat all kinds of shrimp dinner with some members of  my Monday night writer's critique group.  Going over what I said too.  Discussing a best seller.  What makes it good? That's not our question.  What makes it sell?  That's what is important to us or so we say.    \\"The worst book I've ever read,\\" the first woman said.  There were four of us and nobody else thought Jennifer Egan's  A Visit from the Goon Squad which is a National Bestseller, a New York times Book Review Best Book, a National Book Critics Circle Award Winner and a Pen/Faulkner Award Finalist was the worst book we'd come upon.  But, the consensus was, there were too many characters and it was  hard to keep up with them. (I use Kindle on my i-pad. One of our group showed us how to follow a character on Kindle by typing the name of the character you want to follow.  What a great machine!  I also like that I can put my finger on a word I don't know and a definition comes up.)    This morning, I haven't had breakfast and I'm thinking Egan's book was so breakout, so nouvelle, so original in style and form, I want to write a similarly styled book with my own characters. I've already thought out two chapters. Is imitation the sincerest form of flattery?  I don't know.  But, Jennifer Egan, I am impressed.

B005FNVDSA|5.0|There was no need for a third recording by Pollini of the Brahms First Cto., his previous two with Bohm and Abbado being high-profile events that displayed his prowess in this work. Perhaps he's lost some force in the grueling first movement, but otherwise we get what you'd expect, a superb performance by a great pianist on the verge of turning seventy next January. (It's peculiar to me that Pollini hasn't summoned the same virtuosic enthusiasm when he plays the Beethoven concertos, but his mastery here is unchallenged.) Among the favorable things about this new version is that the presentation has no bombast about it, which isn't that common in the Brahms First; by Pollini's standards, he's almost autumnal.<br /><br />On the orchestral side this CD reflects the endgame in a confusing round of musical chairs. After the Dresden Staatskapelle abruptly parted company with Fabio Luisi as music director, Christian Thielemann just as abruptly left the Munich Phil. to land at a much better orchestra. He brought his DG recording contract with him, although on Profil one can hear an impressive Bruckner 8th from Dresden when orchestra and conductor first got together. Luisi is now music director of the Metropolitan Opera in all but title, while the Munich Phil., one suspects, will not be recording very much with a major label. (Three years later, my prediction looks dubious, with the hiring of Valery Gergiev.)<br /><br />Thielemann begins with an exaggerated contrast between the roaring opening theme and the lyrical second subject, but the pianist doesn't go along, achieving a more consistent flow. As usual, Pollini's command is fairly Olympian; he rarely relaxes and isn't intimate. But Brahms conceived of his first concerto on a titanic scale, so I feel no loss.<br /><br />Nothing unusual happens so far as tempo or phrasing goes. What makes Pollini's performance so striking is his ability to hold one's attention from first note to last in a continuous arc, a phenomenon I've experienced in his Carnegie Hall recitals.  The catalog is crammed with great Brahms concerto recordings, even though lazy reviewers tend to trot out the same recommendation of Gilels/Jochum (much too laborious for me) and Fleisher/Szell. For anyone who wants to branch out a little,  there's Barenboim/Barbirolli, Curzon/Szell, Serkin/Szell, Moravec/Belohlavek, and the two best Pollini accounts - the Abbado and this new one.<br /><br />If recorded sound is a deciding factor, I don't detect that this new recording is any better than Pollini's second one (with Abbado), and in fact the piano could be fuller and more realistic. More decisive, perhaps, is the wonderful timbre and sheen or the great Dresden orchestra, which has a glow about it.experienced in his Carnegie Hall recitals.

0307460444|2.0|I was looking for a tasty cupcake cookbook. After reading all of the review of this book and others I disregarded the bad and focused on the good while adding this book to my shopping cart. I thought, how bad could it be. It's Martha Stewart the queen of baking, it must be good. I have her cookies cookbook and love it. Why wouldn't this book be just was wonderful? Like my mom used to say, \\"you should have listened.\\"<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />- Nice photo's<br />- Cute and simplistic decorating ideas<br />- Straight forward instructions<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />- EVERYTHING ELSE!!<br /><br />I don't want to over exaggerate but the recipes are just awful. My children are dessert enthusiasts and love just about everything sweet. They are also my best critics because they are brutally honest and haven't quite grasped the concept of not speaking their mind if it'll hurt feelings. I have made 6 different recipes on 6 different occasions and they bit into them once and chucked it. I would say, \\"wow that's not nice\\" and they would respond, \\"it taste awful mama I don't even think Skyy [our dog] would eat it.\\"<br /><br />I didn't like them either but didn't want to trash the batches because of all of the work put into making them and the ingredient costs associated. So I enthusiastically suggested that they take them to school for their entire class as a treat. Umm, yeah...all 30 kids in their class did the 'taste and chuck' routine each time a batch was taken to school. Not good. Not good at all.<br /><br />I give it a two star just for the photos and ease of techniques. But for flavor and taste (which is the reason I purchased this book and not a cupcake decorating book) I give this a zero. Fat, round, and empty just like my wallet after purchasing this junk. Ugh!
B005HNG1S0|5.0|Grimaud has avoided the Mozart piano concertos until now; is it because her fiery, spontaneous style doesn't suit the music?  Argerich, who shares a similar temperament, has also given us only a small handful of Mozart. The present album came under scrutiny in the NY Times when it was revealed that Grimaud recorded it with Claudio Abbado, only to run afoul of \\"artistic differences\\" (i.e., an argument over whether to use a brief cadenza written by Mozart that Grimaud didn't like), and since neither party would budge, DG fell back on a live account from Munich with Grimaud as pianist-conductor. The pity is that Abbado will never perform with Grimaud again, despite their successful collaborations in the past. The cadenza used by her in the A major concerto is by Busoni.<br /><br />Grimaud follows Maurizio Pollini and Evegeny Kissin, two other keyboard stars who fairly recently turned to recording Mozart concertos assuming a dual role. The result is more vibrant and colorful than with them, however. In part this may be due to the concertmaster, Radoslav Sculz, who is given credit along with Ms. Grimaud. But the chamber orchestra pulled out of the Bavarian Radio SO is a superb group to begin with, and their lively playing is vividly recorded. (On my playback system there is a bit of a hard edge at loud volume, however.) The first piece, the buoyant Concerto no. 19 K. 459, comes across just right, poised but energetic, without a trace of the tinkly, prissy style that has become too prevalent today, thanks to misplaced \\"authenticity.\\" Like Argerich, once Grimaud has gotten around to Mozart's concertos, she doesn't sacrifice her spontaneous, strong-minded style. We do get a few period touches in the vibratoless strings, but they are doubled by woodwinds so often that the effect isn't grating. In fast sections the rhythms tend to be brisk and accented, something not every lover of this music will appreciate; Grimaud prefers propulsion over charm.<br /><br />As the Amazon blurb notes, Grimaud is especially in love with Concerto no. 23 K. 488. Compared to Pollini's account, also conducted form the keyboard, the orchestral part is quicker and more pointed in the Allegro movements. Grimaud felt that Mozart left a less-than-inspired cadenza for the first movement, and she plays so \\"big\\" that inserting Busoni's fairly aggressive alternative works. It's only 40 seconds long and by no means startling: one wonders what kind of power struggle actually led to the rift between Abbado and Grimaud. She is less relaxed in the sublime Adagio than any number of rivals, but the added alertness is telling - we don't always have to be in lullaby land. Grimaud applies the same force in the finale that she would in Beethoven; it's a take that I like, but listeners should be told in advance that we are far from Brendel's approach.<br /><br />Most CDs are content to include two concertos, so it's a nice bonus to get Mozart's most famous concert aria, \\"Ch'io mi scordi di te?\\" with its extensive piano obligato. There are classic recordings by Lucia Popp, Kiri Te Kanawa, and (my favorite) Elisabeth Schwarzkopf; here we get the rising German soprano and Mozart specialist Mojca Erdmann, who is musical, clear-voiced, and capable of the aria's demands. She doesn't dramatize the words as poignantly as her great predecessors, and her sound isn't very individual, but the performance is enjoyable, and Grimaud plays the piano accompaniment without stealing the limelight.<br /><br />In all, this is a very appealing album, despite the regrettable background story. When Grimaud told the press, rather ungraciously, that she liked her Munich performance better than what she recorded with Abbado, I suspect she knew what she was talking about.especially in love with Concerto no. 23 K. 488.

B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|I think anyone who feels for people getting treated badly because they are infirm, or anybody who is infirm themselves will love this movie. The main character in this movie was treated bad for his infirmity. What's worse is that he was treated bad by the woman he loved.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the best version of Moulin Rouge. I honestly don't know why they decided to do a remake that actually pales in comparison to this one. In all honesty, the new version used to be one of my favorite movies until I saw this version. They should've remade it to be only about the story of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Every time I watch this version, I love it more and more.<br /><br />Many people wrote their review about how good the color looked or how amazing his paintings looked. His paintings are beautiful and he's an amazing artist, however, I'm writing my review from an emotional standpoint.<br /><br />Over the course of his life, Toulouse-Lautrec was mocked for his appearance. All he wanted was to have someone who loved him, or at least cared for him enough to treat him respectfully. He met a woman named Marie Charlet and he fell in love with her while they lived in the same place for a time. She pretended to love him only to get his money. She would get mad at him for no reason and call him horrible names. When I saw the way he was treated by her, I cried for him. Now every time I watch it, I bawl my eyes out. No one should ever have to endure that kind of treatment. The way she treated him was horrible. I'm sure that she was never taught the right way to treat people, but that doesn't make it any less sad. I wish I could've gone back in time to give him a great big hug. I would also tell him that he is loved no matter what. To me, it wouldn't matter whether or not a person is disabled or disfigured. If you love a person, that's really all that matters. And if you don't love them, that's no reason to treat them badly. He really deserved better. Later on, he met another woman who he had fallen in love with. Her name was Miriamme Hyam. They quickly became friends and they hung out together a lot. Over the course of that time, he must've noticed things about her that made him fall in love with her. I liked her character. She seemed to be a compassionate person who sees beyond physical appearance. Toulouse didn't want to reveal his feelings to Miriamme because he feared that he would be treated the same way that Marie Charlet had treated him. She did love him back. Did they live happily ever after? You'll just have to see for yourself.

Ultraviolet is the worse thing I've seen for media management... and all because Warner Brothers refuses to negotiate with Apple to include their media in the ITunes media libraries. Greedy Execs are hurting the end users so they can save a penny.   Know what you are buying before you buy it. Boycott Warner Brothers for this horrible \\"digital\\" media (which it is not).
B000NA28I4|2.0|It is an alright movie but nothing like the book.  Read the book before you watch the movie.  The screenwriter did not read the book before he wrote the screenplay for the movie.
B000TETE04|5.0|I love this CD. I love marching around my local park and humming Parklife. I get excited when I hear these songs, especially Song 2(Whoo who!!). Most people know Blur on the basis of that hit, which I still hear on a lot of American radio stations. If you're curious to know what else the band did, (which is actual a staggering amount of awesomeness), I would definately recommend this collection of songs to jumpstart an obsession or satisfy a curiosity. I'm of the personal oppinion that almost everything Damon Albarn, the lead singer touches turns to gold, and so it is with this collection.<br /><br />By the way, you probably know Albarn from Gorillaz, that punky, hip hop, rapping, occasional opera singing, mega hit in 2000 or so, cartoon band. If so, you may go on to pretend that 2D is singing you these nice little ballads. Though I personally prefer the Gorillaz, I do love listening to Blur occasionally.<br /><br />Highlites of this album for me are End of the Century. Who doesn't love a song that starts out, \\"She says there's ants in the carpet, dirty little munsters!\\" -Plaster a big, idiot smile over my face here.- Also, Girls and Boys. The song just makes me want to jump up and down, and scream it out at the top of my lungs. This Is A Low is a downer for me. Well, just look at the title, you're probably already feeling down in the dirty dumps, aren't you? There's something so mesmerizing about it though. \\"This is a low, but it won't hurt you. When you're alone, it will be there with you.\\" -Shivers-. Depressing, but not in a blubbering, back of the bar on a Saturday night way, not for me anyway. For me, a kind of soul sucking vacumm of a song, where you look up and the sun seems to be shining less brightly. Makes you feel numb. Oh, and No Distance Left to Run, right, now that is a depressing song. You might want to hole yourself up in the aforementioned bar while listening to this one. It's almost too much to handle.<br /><br />So, obviously I like this album very much, from the rowdy song 2 that makes me want to jump up and down to the sadness of No Distance Left to Run. Something here for everyone, I think. I would highly recommend purchasing this album, perhaps even before purchasing any other Blur material. It will give you a wide spectrum of what Blur is about and their most popular hits. Long live Blur!2 that makes me want to jump up and down to the sadness of No Distance Left to Run. Something here for everyone, I think. I would highly recommend purchasing this album, perhaps even before purchasing any other Blur material. It will give you a wide spectrum of what Blur is about and their most popular hits. Long live Blur!

0140282033|2.0|I was SO excited to read this book.  The great reviews and my love of chocolate and Europe seemed like it would be the perfect mix.  Boy, was I wrong.  I started out loving it...for maybe the first 15 pages.  The descriptions were beautiful; I was enjoying the main characters.  But sometime after we're introduced to the priest, Vianne began to annoy me.  Suddenly, she seemed too perfect and loving while the priest was given NO likeable characteristics.  Obviously the reader is supposed to see that the priest is corrupt and practically insane with religious zeal while Vianne, who only does what she wants with her life and loves everyone, following no certain path at all, is the one we should like.  I am not religious.  But I was sickened with how Harris portrayed the priest, and I found Vianne very selfish.  The book seems to promote doing anything you want without any thought to how it will affect others--Armande's choice of what to do with her life and what Vianne does to Josephine are major points that come to mind.  Some friend.  Also, the book seems like it's building up to some exciting climax between Vianne and the priest, but nothing ever happens.  The ending is a complete and total let-down.  Harris never knows what time period the books is supposed to be in.  Supposedly, it takes place in recent times, but the descriptions point to a much longer time ago.  Finally...the adverbs, oh the adverbs.  I hate it when writers depend on adverbs.
B00005WVEK|5.0|I saw a few magazines when I was in Vietnam. I spent a week in Cambodia before coming home in 1970. The novel I wanted to read most was Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five. Being drafted for service in the American army was part of a global strategy maintained for superpower purposes, and the limited warfare I took part in with a few free fire zones and secret CIA armies in neighboring countries were minor matters compared to the idea that a real war would allow us to wipe out everything we hate. Opinion polls about fighting godless Commies used unpopular as a euphemism for what many people would not allow to be printed in newspapers.<br /><br />In introducing Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut asked some questions of the US Air Force that got a response covering the bombing of Dresden with secrecy. Cambodia had been bombed in ways that were not revealed when Nixon claimed in 1970:<br /><br />Up to this point, we have scrupulously respected the sanctity of international borders.<br /><br />Books seemed like the best way to turn war inside out. I have read many books that other people consider obscure because books reveal human aspects of behavior that are not what anybody thinks openly. Books that have been published after the death of an author can reveal what only a fool would admit. The goal of self-overcoming that Nietzsche tried to make a style of transvaluation of all values when he was preparing his last works digs much deeper than comedy into the way a mind can find paths in thinking that has become twisted because it is never the same time.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.<br /><br />The entire history of religion, philosophy, anthropology, and any expectations of an end of the world have been hopping back and forth between such weird alternatives that the idea of a learning curve with a money mudslide wiping out society keeps hopping back and forth until nobody knows what shoe to expect on the other foot the next time around. Even our short term is thinking up euphemisms for tremendous repudiations.thinking up euphemisms for tremendous repudiations.

B005ER6STG|1.0|I am normally a very open minded person and rarely ever write a bad review about something I have bought or have rented. This film is just plain gross and unnecessary. I have no one to blame but myself for buying this. The part that makes me upset is the part that implicates the main character is drugged up and unknowingly sodomizing his own young son. It doesn't show the boys face or body, a blanket is thrown over the body, but still,.. Its one thing when he was doing this to his wife but THIS was the final straw. I am surprised someone hasn't brought the director up on legal charges. Perhaps because it was filmed overseas. I have to admit I am planning on throwing this monster in the trash barrel after breaking the disc in half. Sorry folks I am not trying to come off mean but this is too much. I cant even bring myself to show this to my friends.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Although not my favorite film of the Star Wars Saga by a long shot, it was still necessary to purchase to complete my collection.  The product arrived quickly and in the condition the seller had stated (really, only a small fuzz in one scene lasting about 5 seconds)-I was expecting much worse so was pleasantly surprised.  The order was handled professionally and the service was great.  Thank you very much!

B000O8OTNC|4.0|It's not a wetstone- don't think that it is. It will not bring your knife to hair shearing sharp. It will rescue abused blades and return a decent edge to anything, just don't expect it to feel like a properly sharpened knife. It will take damaged blades and return them to factory sharp though, and just for that it's worth the money.

B000VL9XNI|5.0|This three-disc limited set is everything you could expect if you think on video footage from AC/DC. It has an interest footage selection from either Bon Scott and Brian Johnson eras. And the extras on disc 3 are just fantastic! Audio and video quality are superb. The booklet is well accurated and the other gifts are very interesting: a poster from a show of '79 tour and a pack with reproduction of concert tickets and stage-free passes. In my opinion, a must have for any average fan of AC/DC.
B004ZNARH4|4.0|I read a lot of reviews that said this item, (Immersion Set) has a flaw in the original packaging. I ordered from Amazon anyway because they said I could send it back if I had a problem with it.<br /><br />I did have a problem with it. But it was not Amazon's fault. Their packaging was excellent. And in fact the \\"Immersion\\" packaging was also excellent. Had someone bother to put the Disc's in properly when the original package was put together.<br /><br />Here is what I found: All four of the first four discs that have holders in the bottom of the Immersion box were not put in with any force. Had they been, they would never have moved! I proved this by correctly inserting all four discs in their holders properly, turning the box upside down and shaking very vigorously and not one of the discs came out!! So it is a very good design. Just poorly installation job on the part of the packager.<br /><br />Now three of the discs had some type of scratch or smudge on them. One was what I would call bad. Nothing I would call real bad though. I was able to play all the discs in several different players and was able to use Exact Audio Copy (free) to rip the discs and archive them. This was my biggest concern when ordering this set.<br /><br />I haven't watched the DVD's yet, but have listened to the CD's. They all sound excellent! Best I ever heard. They did a nice job with it IMO. I don't own audiophile caliber equipment, but what I do own is very good. And what I hear was excellent! I enjoyed it. Even the live CD was great! (Note: I am speaking of sound quality)<br /><br />The books I found were of very high quality and look really good!! The marbles are nice but upon closer inspection look cheap. My son noticed this and pointed it out to me. He was correct. Haven't opened the scarf or the coasters yet to see what they look like.<br /><br />The box that it comes in is a great looking box. Really nice. They did well here.<br /><br />Out a 1-5 i give this a 4 on quality of the PF music. A 0 for packaging though.<br /><br />Oh and I never returned the set to Amazon. I figured it wasn't their faul and was able to view/hear everything. So I kept it.to Amazon. I figured it wasn't their faul and was able to view/hear everything. So I kept it.
B002A97IJ0|3.0|Many of us with these monster heat sinks in our rigs have trouble fitting our side fans into our cases. So this Slip Stream Fan gets around that issue. And frankly, it's a good for what it is: it's better than no fan.  But due to its size, it's just not capable of moving as much air as a full-sized 120mm fan unless you crank it up to 2000rpms, which makes it quite loud. at lower speeds (<1200rpm), it's pretty quiet.  However despite it's limitations, I still think it's a good buy.
1451648537|4.0|I just finished reading Steve Jobs not five minutes ago.  For the most part, especially the first few hundred pages, Isaacson's biography is deeply interesting and rather informative. Gaps start to appear around Steve's time at NeXT, but it picks up again when it comes to Steve's return to Apple.  Later in the book, however, the story seems to drag on. In the final two-hundred pages, the author seems to deviate from writing an autobiography and gets into deep descriptions of Apple products that don't add much to the story of Mr. Jobs.  That said, it was a fascinating read and well-written. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|--------------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"Spartacus: Gods Of The Arena\\"<br />(Starz, 2011)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />Note: this six-episode prequel to the popular but raunchy \\"Spartacus\\" cable series is best seen *after* viewing the original show - a \\"previously on\\" intro gives away the climactic ending to the first series, and though the backstory provided in \\"Gods Of The Arena\\" is nice, new viewers will be bummed by the spoiler aspect. That being said, this series kicks ass. Here we meet the House of Batiatus, a fictionalized version of a real Roman gladiator school where the famous rebellion led by the slave known as Spartacus began. As in the first series, there's plenty of gratuitously gratuitous and graphically graphic violence and only slightly less graphic and gratuitous sex - the sex scenes are far less disturbing than the highly stylized, slow-motion mauling, slashing and beheadings that take place in the arenas... But it is certainly a titillating view of ancient Rome. Although the show is unapologetically salacious and depraved, it's hard not to get sucked in by the soap opera-meets-snuff film drama, and Lucy Lawless (who I remember fondly from \\"Xena\\") has the best role of her career here. Can't wait for Season Three! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue movie reviews)
B005DZMP00|5.0|I won't go on about this \\"new\\" Grateful Dead \\"Europe 72,Vol.2\\" except to note that even non die hard Dead fans aka Deadheads, may find this a great recording to own.  There are many more detailed reviews on this subject, so I won't go into detail about the songs and what I was doing in '72. Safe to say that \\"Europe '72\\" was a long time road companion.  The Dead have released most of these '72 shows in individual form so I'm guessing they decided to release this \\"Vol. 2\\" to highlight more of those shows from the tour.  A large number of the songs on \\"Vol.2\\" are from concerts in England.  As I listened to this, I was immediately amazed that I liked these recordings as well or better than the ones on the original \\"Europe '72\\" which I have on the original vinyl 3 LP set and in the remastered box set.  The recording quality is mostly excellent, and that may be due to the improvements of CD remastering.  The recording of \\"Dark Star\\" while not as lengthy as some that have been released, may be the best one I've heard so far.  This should be a must have for fans of great 60's and 70's psychedelia, jam bands, blues rock, etc.  What could be better than some old Dead?

B004EPZ07U|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie.  Yes, I like and read comics, which helps like this movie, but my one star review is purely for the dumbest idea since digital movies were born - Ultraviolet.  Besides having one of the stupidest names of a program I thought I was getting a digital copy that I could put on my phone or ipad, but as you can tell from the other reviews that is not the case.  The description is that you can watch an ultraviolet movie ANYWHERE, oh really?  tell me Warner Brothers, how am I to watch said ultraviolet movie in a place without an internet connection????  One a plane? nope! While on a car ride? nope! At home?  well, yes, I do have internet at home, BUT I ALSO OWN A FREAKING TV AND BLU-RAY PLAYER!!?!? why would I want to watch my digital copy at home when I just paid for a blu-ray disc????  So, now it's back to ripping discs and looking for torrent download websites.  Basically, all Warner Brothers and the rest of the movie studios did was push people back to finding \\"creative\\" ways to get REAL digital copies of movies.
B004LROUNG|1.0|I've been a Grisham fan since the beginning, but I couldn't finish this one There was nothing particularly likeable about the characters, nor compelling about the story. I agree with an earlier poster that a first time author would never have gotten this published.
0375707972|4.0|At first, I thought this would only be a book about an affair between an older woman and a boy, and its sure complications. I was wrong. The author brought us into his own life as a young German during post WWII, but I'm not so sure I wanted to go there. The issues of illicit love had sufficient complexities to explore, in my opinion. But, when the main character's thoughts shifted to explore implications of morality concerning the actions of WWII parents, and the questions, doubt, and guilty rejection of their children, I found myself wishing it hadn't happened. That particular issue of thought deserved more than to be side-swiped during the movement of the love story from beginning to end.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the story in its crafty portrayal of a budding young male child, clumsily struggling to manage passion and maturation while amorally exploring a most immoral and illegal relationship. I also enjoyed hanging off the edge throughout the book with Hanna's dark and tormented mind.  One more thing... the educator that I am was captivated by the twist. That illiteracy could have such a phenomenal impact in life decisions was of far more value to me, in this read, than the attention-deserving but ill-placed exploration of the relationships of parents and children of post WWII.

0525423656|4.0|Well I absolutely loved Matched and this is a great sequel to it. Some parts are kind of slow, and there are a lot of flashbacks, but overall I'm really happy with it.  I've been awaiting this addition to the Matched trilogy for so long, I just about died when I finally got my hands on it! I love that it's written in alternating POVs (one of my faves if you know me!!) between Cassia and Ky. It really gave me great insight into Ky and who he is and what drives him.<br /><br />Cassia is definitely a different character from Matched, she's a lot more mature and a stronger woman in general. She always knows what she wants and what she needs to to do survive and eventually find her way to Ky. I really admired her, although she makes a couple decisions that were pretty stupid. Ky is Ky. It was nice to learn more about him, and what makes him tick, but I felt like he wasn't as exciting as I needed him to be. I have an insane love for bad boys, but that just isn't Ky. I wish we had more face time with Xander because I think I've switched teams.<br /><br />The writing seems more elegant and mature in Crossed, which I felt was appropriate because the mood definitely changes into one that's a lot more mature. There's a lot of death and destruction in the novel, and some more mature themes are introduced. Plus the way Cassia's grown is sort of displayed through the writing.<br /><br />I'm still a little confused about some things though. Like, who is the enemy? Who is the Society? Who is involved in The Rising? Hopefully some of these questions will be answered in the final book, but I'm a bit confused right now. Also, I'm still wondering what an Aberration is? And an Anomaly? I don't really understand those terms very well, maybe I just missed something? Oh well..<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Crossed but I feel like it was a bridge novel between Matched and the final one in the trilogy. I felt like I didn't get much information out of it, but it set up the last novel really well. If you loved Matched you're definitely going to enjoy Crossed and if you haven't read either, then you better get your hands on them!!definitely going to enjoy Crossed and if you haven't read either, then you better get your hands on them!!

This must be part of the reason they fired Frank Darabont, the saving money part.  This must've been shot for 20k, since there is only a single, cameo appearance by a zombie and the rest is just shallow blah blah blah without any insight. And the entire zombie in the well sequence was just plain stupid.  What a disappointment this show is becoming.
B005I64U5C|1.0|This review is about the contents (or lack thereof) on this set of discs rather than the film's story, acting, etc.  I, like many people apparently, was very dissatisfied with the Ultraviolet \\"digital copy\\" included.  THERE IS NO DIGITAL COPY INCLUDED--at least not a digital copy as every other disc has had to-date.  This disc package includes a code to stream the movie to a limited set of devices and only with a network connection.  This set DOES NOT include a version that can be played while off-line.  To me, that does not meet my expectations of a digital copy.  On a related note, I also experienced problems with using the Flixster service to watch my \\"digital copy\\".  Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't--from the same computer on different days.  If you need/want a digital copy of the movie that can be played while not connected to the internet, DO NOT BUY THIS SET.

B0014YVCDK|5.0|BINAURAL not only has no weak tracks, it is brilliantly sculpted into an album that is greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />It has several good rockers and ballads each, but one of the things that makes it different from and better than either NO CODE or YIELD is the '70s progressive rock sound of \\"Nothing As It Seems\\" and \\"Sleight of Hand.\\"  The tragic \\"Nothing As It Seems\\" sounds very Pink Floyd-esque, complete with David Gilmour-style lead guitar, which was new for Pearl Jam.  Jeff Ament wrote the music for both songs and the lyrics for \\"Nothing,\\" while Eddie Vedder wrote the lyrics for \\"Sleight of Hand,\\" which is mysterious and provocative.<br /><br />The first two tracks are speedy rockers, \\"Breakerfall\\" by Vedder and \\"God's Dice\\" by Ament, and the third track, the New Wavish \\"Evacuation\\" by Matt Cameron with lyrics by Vedder, continues the high energy.  The other two rocking songs are among the band's best, \\"Insignificance\\" and \\"Grievance,\\" both by Vedder.<br /><br />Stone Gossard contributes two fine ballads, the beatiful \\"Thin Air\\" and \\"Of the Girl.\\"  The great lyrics to \\"Light Years\\" are by Vedder, while Vedder, Mike McCready and Gossard collaborated on the moving music.  The last number, \\"Parting Ways,\\" is a lovely breakup song by Eddie.<br /><br />That leaves two minor songs that bookend the stunning \\"Sleight of Hand\\" -- \\"Rival\\" and \\"Soon Forget.\\"  The latter is a little ditty featuring Eddie and his ukelele, a cautionary tale:  \\"[s]orry is the fool who trades his love for hi-rise rent,\\" \\"a man we'll soon forget.\\"  Gossard's \\"Rival\\" strikes a humorous note and reminds me of Mike Patton & Faith No More's \\"RV\\" from ANGEL DUST, as well as \\"Glorified G\\" from VS.<br /><br />BINAURAL was the first Pearl Jam album not to go platinum.  It sounds to me like a breakthrough to a higher level of musical realization following the band's escape from grunge (NO CODE) and initial forays into the broader sonic terrain they discovered (YIELD).<br /><br />I didn't hear it at the time of its 2000 release, but I'm glad to finally catch up!finally catch up!

030788743X|4.0|Ready Player One is what you'd get if William Gibson had written Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Geeks that grew up in the 80's will certainly enjoy the numerous pop culture references.  My biggest issue with the book is with the character dialog.  For a story that takes place in the year 2044, why does everyone speak like it's 2010?  Language is constantly changing and no where is this more evident than with teenagers.  I can't imagine what new terms, slang, and banter will be popular in 2044 and neither could the author.  He had an easy option however and didn't employ it.  For a group of teens that is obsessed with 80's culture, no one ever uses words from that era like \\"rad\\", \\"awesome\\", \\"totally\\" \\"dude\\", \\"bogus\\", etc.  Instead they prefer the word \\"ass\\" (and it's many variants).  A Japanese character speaks in a stereotypical subdued and humble tone.  Another peppers his speech with Mexican words without any apparent reason.  Fortunately most of the story is narrative.  It's easier to imagine what technology will be like in the future than to imagine what humans will be like.  As such, I enjoyed this book for the story and cultural references.  The characters are mostly uninspired and forgettable.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This lengthy, carefully researched and detailed biography is excellent.  I found myself linking points in my life to the technology discussions (the first \\"home brewed\\" computer I met, c prompts - remember those?, my first WWW encounter, my first ipod etc).  If you are middle aged, this is not just Steve Jobs' story, it is also the story of technological evolution in your lifetime.    Jobs is not sugar-coated, few of us would be brave enough to have him over to dinner.  Issacson makes it clear exactly what Jobs did and didn't contribute to the creation of Apple's many magic products.  He interviewed 100s of people to do so - given that Jobs endorsed the book (actually pleaded for it) the author had total access to everybody.    Jobs was an SOB (at least in many ways, at many moments) but he was also a genius who knew how to put together a company and supervise a large raft of folks to micro-manage the creation of multiple new technologies that have transformed many of our lives significantly and positively.  Excellent book!      Ruby [...]

1451648537|4.0|Steve Jobs was such a jerk. Yes, he was brilliant and all that. Some might say that his gifts to tech development, that he changed and invented whole industries, would compensate. Maybe the two things went together, cruelty and brilliance.<br /><br />But the lesson to be drawn here, future CEOs, isn't that his cruelty fed his brilliance! He was aware of the pain he was causing other people, yet like so many other cruel, overbearing, harsh, thoughtless and petulant overlords, he was very thin-skinned. Also, I don't believe that his often-cited sense of abandonment, having been put up for adoption, justifies his behavior.<br /><br />He was, as the author put it, \\"bratty.\\" Jobs would fiddle with design changes to the point of driving his team mad. A thousand different variations of white weren't satisfactory. He wanted a new color to be invented, regardless of the damage done to the rollout of the new object.<br /><br />Isaacson makes an interesting point when he says Jobs was a genius. He means genius not in terms of a high IQ, but in terms of an ability to see things in surges of intuition, inspiration, and creativity. (BTW here's an interesting rundown of the smartest people on the planet:[...]) Because of his genius, I agree that Jobs deserves to be included in the company of Edison, Franklin, et al.<br /><br />Steve Jobs pushed everybody until they wanted to kill him, but the pushing yielded amazing, brilliant new products. His unique brainpower allowed him to see how things might align, merge, and serve each other, and how utility might be blended with art. That vision led to creations of whole industries.<br /><br />His obsession with perfection and control led him to flirt with emulating the Big Brother that Apple was created to bring down. One of the fascinating threads of this book was the debate between proponents of closed and open systems. Was it better to manufacture a pristine, inflexible system or the messier free thinking open system? And what were the implications of that belief on Jobs' view of his customers and his worldview?<br /><br />Yet he defined petulance. His food had to be just so.

B004J4WKTW|2.0|The concept for this was interesting, and some of the imagery would clearly make for a good movie with artistic special effects. However, I didn't find myself truly engaged by the characters, and the grammar was ATROCIOUS. I'm usually willing to let slip a few editing mistakes, but this book was clearly not edited by anyone with an eye for proper sentence structure, and it was so irritating to have rambling or incomplete sentences over and over that it really detracted from the story for me. With more character development and a large improvement in writing I would recommend it, but otherwise I'm not able to say that it lives up to the hype.

B005NKIQ26|3.0|Justin Bieber joins the bandwagon, releasing his first holiday album, [[ASIN:B005NKIQ26 Under The Mistletoe]].  While holiday albums are almost always predictable and undercooked, Bieber delivers some credible and enjoyable moments, even if there is nothing particularly valedictory or earth-shattering about this affair.<br /><br />\\"Only Thing I Ever Get For Christmas\\" opens the album soundly, produced by Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart and Aaron Pearce.  Vocally, Bieber has more depth and bass about his voice, and his vocal agility has grown since his [[ASIN:B0037AGASG My World 2.0]] days (which was just last year).  The songwriting is solid, helping to get Under the Mistletoe off to a fast start.  Another original, the exceptional first single \\"Mistletoe\\" is nearly flawless, finding Bieber sounding amongst his most mature of his career.  The airy, conservatively produced single (The Messengers are behind the boards) is a great addition to original holiday-penned songs.  The brief length is another selling point, not to mention the addictiveness of the lyrics themselves.  Keeping it `on point,' \\"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)\\" pairs Bieber with his mentor, the great Usher.  The vocal chemistry is `solid-as-a-rock' by all means, yielding some incredible, harmonious moments.  Bieber continues to impress the skeptics with his matured pipes; Usher is expected to be polished and fantastic.<br /><br />\\"Santa Claus is Coming To Town\\" is sort of corny and a bit generic, but it sort of `goes with the territory' given the corny nature of the carol itself.  One might question the validity of \\"Tricky's\\" production work here, but it works without compromising the original carol. Original \\"Fa La La La\\" featuring Boyz-II-Men is a winner by all means, finding `the Biebz' hanging with the `big boys.'  The supporting vocal harmonies by Boyz-II-Men are superb, as to be expected.  \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You (SuperFestive!)\\" features Mariah Carey and delivers another credible, capable `cover.' This time, the cover is of Mariah Carey herself.  While the duet version works for the most part, Mariah's original remains the standard.<br /><br />\\"Drummer Boy,\\" featuring a surprising guest spot from Busta Rhymes, maybe the album's most original cover.  Justin Bieber and Busta Rhymes trade raps in this liberalized take on the Christmas classic which may be detested by purists and loved by `the young crowd.'  Regardless, \\"Drummer Boy\\" sounds more in-line with what Bieber would perform as opposed to a `stodgy,' old-fashioned take on the song.  \\"Christmas Eve\\" is solid, written and produced by Chris Brown's entourage (including Brown, Kevin McCall, and Antwan Thompson).  \\"Christmas Eve\\" is pleasant, though not revolutionary.  \\"All I Want Is You\\" smartly contrasts the contemporary leanings of \\"Christmas Eve\\" with a quicker, more energetic sound. That said, \\"All I Want Is You\\" lacks the quality of the best originals, namely \\"Mistletoe\\" or \\"Fa La La La.\\" \\"Home This Christmas\\" featuring The Band Perry is a solid cut while closing cut \\"Silent Night\\" is soulful, if a bit too `sleepy' an interpretation.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B005NKIQ26 Under The Mistletoe]] is an enjoyable holiday affair.

B006P0FD4W|4.0|minor plot spoliers<br /><br />I am not a fan of this series. The stories are too slow to build with long scenes of nothing and then the scare is minimal. This movie is the spoiler for the series as we find out from the subtitle \\"It runs in the family.\\" We do get an explanation. This is a prequel filmed in high quality DVD using a VHS camera. The acting was better in this one. Lauren Bittner was convincing as Julie. In one scene she puts on a mask and scares the guys. She is so happy she got one over on them, she jumps around with bubbly joy. Also extremely realistic is young Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) who convinces me she has an imaginary friend named Captain Howdy, er ah Toby.  Likewise child actor Chloe Csengery did an excellent job as Katie as she goes screaming across the room.<br /><br />There is a sex scene that is comical. Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) starts out mouthing \\"wack-a-da, wack-a-da\\" porno music and as a romantic sort stampedes right to Julie's chest. There are some strange events going on in the house, so it gets wired for VHS tapes. Now as I recall the longest VHS tape setting was 6 hours (some were 8 hours) which means they would of had to been changed out frequently and viewed for paranormal activity with some scenes lasting for a second. With multiple cameras going 24/7...well you get the idea of how tedious and impracticable this becomes. In one scene the stationary VHS camera is looking at the entire girl's bedroom and then the next second it is focusing on Kristi's bed. While they used the amateur camera for a realistic effect, they didn't stay true to it, which made for a better movie. Maybe one day they will discover how real movies are made.<br /><br />What is not credible is the wife not believing what is going on and refusing to look at the evidence on film. They had to do this so they could keep the constant build up. Dennis filming everything with the camera at grandma's house didn't make much sense. At some point if you are being chased, you stop filming and run. If you are hiding and need to be quiet, you don't keep the camera on. The chase scene is hard to justify filming in all of these types of movies. I felt a little short changed on the ending.<br /><br />Like the other movies, it starts out slowly, but it doesn't sputter and grind its wheels like they did. This is my favorite of the three.<br /><br />F-bomb, no nudity, comical foreplay scene. Was that a 1993 Free Willy stuffed whale in this 1988 movie?

While he initially rides with the cavalry, he eventually is captured by the Germans and used a work horse.  This story is a quick and easy read for most and I would recommend it for anyone trying to find a book for late elementary/early middle school aged child (especially if they love animals).  However, older readers may find this story to be a bit boring and there is not much here for teachers if they are looking for a novel to teach.  That being said this would make a great addition to any classroom library.

B005D0RDIE|3.0|True there are 9 Rush songs making their first appearance on DVD. And 16 more that we've seen a few times. Six of these tunes have appeared on at least 4 other Rush DVDs. This makes appearance #7 for Spirit of Radio and Tom Sawyer. This is what happens when you release a complete show to DVD. You wind up including all the hits that have to be played on nearly every tour. Just once I'd like to see them make a DVD focusing on deep tracks and avoid the classic songs that have appeared so many times already. Time Stand Still and Stick It Out are great choices. Now how about great songs like Tai Shan, Nobodys Hero, How It Is or Chain Lightning? Or maybe Countdown, Warpaint, Open Secrets, Cut To The Chase, Kid Gloves, What You're Doing, Think I'm Going Bald, Under The Shadow, Ceiling Unlimited, Nocturne, Freeze, Time and Motion, Virtuality, Limbo, Scars, We Hold On, Beneath Between and Beyond...

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Despite the criticism levied by the likes of Devin Faraci and other self-appointed movie \\"iconoclasts\\"/contrarians, the Star Wars saga deserves credit for both ushering in over an initial decade of ambitious sci-fi and fantasy movies, and for having a long-term influence on moviemaking in general.  Say what you will regarding George Lucas's odd need for constantly (and possibly unnecessarily) revising his own work, noted filmmakers such as Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, Christopher Nolan, and James Cameron have all cited George Lucas's Star Wars saga as an influence on their own notable bodies of work, not to mention other entertaining (if not quite as lauded) movies such as \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\" and \\"The Last Starfighter\\" having been clearly influenced by the Star Wars franchise.  Informed by Joseph Campbell's studies of the common traits shared by myths of different cultures, colored by the pulp science fiction serials of the past, and crafted in a rather pragmatic fashion, with an emphasis on making a fantasy world that seems \\"lived in\\", Star Wars may have sacrificed \\"thespian values\\", but in return was imbued with a visually-based, likeable appeal.  In keeping with his approach to the DVD format, Lucas has (almost interminably) delayed releasing a Blu-Ray version of his movies, until it was clear the format would survive the hi-definition wars.  \\"Star Wars: The Complete Saga\\" was touted as the ultimate release of all 6 movies of the Star Wars franchise, in the current benchmark visual media.  So how does it measure up?  I'm going to be honest here- this release is a tad disappointing, but more so due to various ancillary disappointments, as opposed to the visual quality of the movies themselves.  I'll break down each of the movies individually in a bit, but first I must address two of the main reasons this release got a 4 rather than a 5 star rating.  The first is simply the fact that 20th Century Fox continues to treat its consumers as second class citizensby imposing Byzantine copy protection schemes that actually render some of the discs unplayable in some machines, at least without having to mess around with firmware updates (and I wager that many \\"casual\\" movie fans wouldn't expect to have to download and implement software updates to their Blu Ray players in order to play such a well-known movie).  While the discs all work on my PS3, the Episode II disc won't even load on my father's Sony Blu-Ray player.  This isn't an isolated occurence, as I've read problems with various players on a number of forums.  This is simply unacceptable behavior from a major movie studio.  The second major issue is that many of the extras that were present in the DVD releases, including the outstanding \\"Empire of Dreams\\" documentary, and the prequel trilogy deleted scenes from the DVD bonus discs, were simply omitted.  Simply put, HOLD ONTO YOUR DVD BONUS MATERIALS, because this supposed \\"ultimate\\" version omits much of what the DVD releases had.  The good news is that at least the DVD commentary is still intact, with the added bonus of a second layer of \\"archival\\" commentary material.    Let's move onto the movies themselves.....  Episode I: The Phantom Menace: Easily the weakest of the Star Wars movies, wooden acting, poor dialogue, questionable pacing, and the constant in-your-face antics of the annoying Jar Jar Binks all drag this movie down.  The good news is that the Blu Ray release manages to improve the audio (which was too low in the DVD version), while the hi-definition treatment emphasizes one of the things that the movie did well: the bright, colorful visuals that manage to stay true to the Star Wars ethos.  Also of note is the fact that the oddly grotesque version of the Yoda puppet used in TPM has been replaced by the CGI Yoda.  Still, Episode I manages to confuse the idea of \\"child-like wonder\\" with \\"childishness\\".  Perhaps the concept of Anakin Skywalker starting his adventure as a little kid was a mistake.  In any case, this version's HD visuals are its saving grace, as the fidelity made it actually more watchable.  Episode II: Attack of the Clones: Episode II is rather tricky to review, as it's best described as the most perplexing combination of cool and crap that I've experienced.  On the one hand, when it works, it's a better film than its predecessor.  The action scenes (particularly the last 30-odd minutes when the Clone Wars begin), and the \\"suspense\\" sequences (i.e. Obi-Wan on Kamino and Geonosis) feel true to what fans like about Star Wars.  On the other hand, the \\"romantic\\" scenes are filled with some of the most awful dialogue and grimace-worthy acting I've ever seen.  It's almost as if George Lucas yelled \\"action!\\", and suddenly wandered off, distracted by shiny objects or something, leaving the actors without guidance.  Similarly, the HD transfer here is a bit \\"oddball\\"- while the CGI-heavy cinematography didn't look too awkward in standard definition, there's something off and flat about some of the shots in HD.  Notably, there were some strange color-banding issues in one of the scenes on Tatooine.  At the same time, the almost cartoony color saturation has its own endearing quality.  This is a movie where Lucas more or less got the big story right, but goofed on executing the \\"human element\\", bigtime.  Episode III: Revenge of the Sith: Despite revisionists who claim Episode I was better in retrospect, Episode III clearly seems the best of the prequels, and in many ways stands in the company of the original trilogy.  Although still wooden and goofy at times, the acting is better, perhaps because this movie finally delivers the payoff we were expecting, and thus required a more tense atmosphere.  The pacing is what is key here, as the slam-bang opening action sequence starts things off quickly, while the mounting expectations of disaster for the Jedi keep the scenes on Coruscant rife with tension and atmosphere.  There's a lot of action (a massive space battle, five (count 'em, five!) lightsaber battles, Clone Wars scenes), and the downward spiral into darkness that is initiated at the movie's mid-point taps into the same well of darkness that The Empire Strikes Back drew from.  While there's a couple of questionable decisions here and there, this is a pretty entertaining installment.  In terms of visuals, this is, simply put, a benchmark for HD viewing, with the best effects of the series.  Episode IV: A New Hope: In terms of the movie itself....well, it's the first Star Wars movie!  Of course, this is the latest \\"Special Edition\\" version, not the original theatrical release.  The CGI Jabba (the DVD version, thankfully) is still there, along with the additional sequences.  As for the infamous \\"Greedo shoots first\\" scene......Lucas has tweaked it further, so that both Han and Greedo essentially shoot at the same time.  It's a tiny bit of compromise from Lucas, but by this point you've probably already made up your mind on whether his change was a dealbreaker.  One questionable change here is the revision of Ben's \\"krayt dragon call\\", which frankly, while more believable than the odd sound effect from earlier releses, is also sort of.......dumb sounding.  Visually, the HD transfer is actually surprisingly good.  While I was expecting the higher resolution to make the \\"composite squares\\" surrounding the Tie Fighters in space look more glaringly obvious, Lucasfilm managed to subdue that effect relatively well.  Obviously there will be issues with a 35 year-old special effects movie, but overall, I'm pleased with the result.  Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back: The \\"darkest\\" chapter of the original trilogy is also the most personable, and Lucas kept his meddling with \\"history\\" relatively subdued and in good taste.  The changes are generally improvements, with the most notable being inserting Ian McDiarmid into the scene where Vader speaks with the Emperor via hologram (which was done for the DVD release).  Continuity-wise, it was a pretty necessary decision.  For theatrical release \\"purists\\", this installment will undoubtedly cause the least amount of grief.  Visually, Empire is on par with the other original trilogy releases, and Lucasfilm makes some of the dodgier lightsaber effects shots from the DVD a bit more palatable here.  Episode VI: Return of the Jedi:  Unfortunately, Lucas has historically saved his most egregious film \\"revisionism\\" for this entry, for whatever reason.  It pains me that despite the cries of fans everywhere, Lucas refuses to undo that most horrid of the Special Edition alterations- the \\"Jedi Rocks\\" Max Rebo musical number.  It boggles the mind as to why Lucas thought we'd still want to see this terrible, out-of-place reject from the Muppet Show cutting room floor, with all it's \\"look at me, I'm computer-generated\\", in-your-face, tone-deaf obnoxiousness.  Similarly, you'd think that if Lucas was dead-set on replacing Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christiansen in the ending \\"ghost scene\\", he'd at least dig up a less \\"creepy\\" shot of him for the Blu Ray release.  But....no.  This time around, Lucas also added a couple of other changes, such as Wicket the Ewok blinking (it actually is rather subtle), and Vader yelling \\"no....no!!!!\\" when making his decision to stop the Emperor from killing his son.  That last decision isn't quite as awful as people make it out to be, but I still think Vader silently making his ultimate sacrifice was just fine as it was originally done.  Visually, RotJ is well done overall.  It's a shame, though, that Lucas refuses to listen to the fans, and won't at least tone down his prior mistakes.  Still, in the context of the prequel movies, RotJ actually resonates a bit more thematically.  Namely, the basic emotional necessity of \\"attachments\\" that the Jedi Order of the prequels denounced, turned out to be the very thing that saved the galaxy, as the emotional bond between Vader and Luke is what drove Vader to kill the Emperor.  Interesting stuff.While I've discussed the omission of the DVD bonus features, I should note what has been provided.  The prequel deleted scenes are interesting, but unlike the DVD deleted scenes, are actually sort of half-baked, with grotesquely unfinished effects.  The real gems are the deleted scenes from the original trilogy, including the \\"Taschi Station\\" scenes, which were to be the original introduction of Luke.  There's also an assortment of interviews, and of course, the ubiquitious presence of Rick McCallum, whose main job on the DVD commentaries and interviews appears to be to remind us how awesome George Lucas is.....many, many times.  The \\"spoof\\" reel is kind of chintzy, and is mostly forgettable.  While I enjoy the appearance of the Star Wars Gangsta Rap in this \\"gag reel\\", the lack of the classic \\"Hardware Wars\\" short film pretty much robs this feature of its relevance.  There's also some rotatable models of certain ships, with a bit of nifty video commentary embedded in that feature.  It should be noted, however, that the special features menu is clunky, and reacts slowly.  And while it was always a long shot, the inclusion of the \\"Star Wars Holiday Special\\" as a hidden easter egg would've been a funny surprise.  So there you have it.  Visually speaking, this is the best version of the movies yet.  For that, it deserves 4 stars, as despite its flaws, Star Wars is a seminal franchise in moviemaking.  However, a myriad of questionable decisions regarding omitting content, the continued presence of the \\"Jedi Rocks\\" musical number, and 20th Century Fox's \\"screw the consumer\\" mentality rob this otherwise essential set of its 5th star.  Thanks for bearing with this rather long review, if you're still there!

B005HGZV6U|5.0|When I went to the amazon page after watching Interstella on Blu-Ray, I expected to see reviews applauding the audio quality of this amazing movie. This audio transfer is in my top 10, if not top 5, of Blu-Ray movies, it honestly ranks as one of the best I have had the pleasure of listening to. It captures every nuance of Daft Punk, completely immersing you into the album.<br /><br />For that alone, in comparison to MANY Blu-Ray audio only discs, the price is on par.<br /><br />But this also throws the original animation, which I have incredibly fond memories of, both on my own and through my children, as this was one of the first movies to bring them to tears (no spoilers, but those who have watched this most likely know what I'm talking about).<br /><br />That alone awards this 4 stars.<br /><br />Detracting one star for video quality would be fair, but to see all of these 1 and 2 star reviews... It just makes me sad.<br /><br />This is a brilliant movie, and although the video transfer is not the best, it certainly isn't worthy of this horrible criticism.<br /><br />Let's be realistic. Daft Punk set out to create a throw back animated feature to bring a bit of life to their album. They focused on high quality audio (the original soundtrack was DTS, which some believe to be a stronger encode than straight Dolby Digital, I am in this camp) and animation pulled straight from 1987. I agree there are jagged edges throughout the film, and no it's not as crisp as I would like it to be. However the colors are wonderfully accurate, and there are minor banding issues, but for the most part the line detail is great. I may not have first hand experience of what Daft Punk initially created, maybe the production company was lazy in the transfer and somewhere there exists a perfect unblemished video copy. However, I do doubt that to be the case.<br /><br />I love this movie. I love this album. No, the video quality is not perfect, but I honestly do not believe it was intended to be.  I do not believe it deserves the terrible reviews that everyone here is piling on. The lossless soundtracks alone are enough to warrant an upgrade, and I do see that there is beauty in the video transfer. Maybe the beauty isn't enough for some people, but it is for me.<br /><br />Please think before you just hastily pass this up. If you are an audiophile, you cannot put a price on the lossless upgrade. If you own the DVD and believe that you do not need or cannot hear a difference, then I suggest you keep the DVD version. The DTS soundtrack was very strong indeed, and I thought it was sonically brilliant, but nothing close to what I have now with the DTS-HD MA soundtrack.veryone here is piling on.

The plot seems contrived and artificial:  the protagonist's transformation from saint to manipulator is too sudden, and isn't quite believable.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the main themes of this book -- the corrupting power of money, the diabolical ways of the rich, the sacrifices of good individuals -- are even more relevant today than they were fifty years ago.
159448385X|5.0|I just finished the audio version of the book. It was beautifully written, heartbreaking and heartwarming, and I think, a fair representation of life in Afghanistan over the past few decades.  I can't wait for another book by this author!

B002ZG97LK|5.0|As soon as I heard from a local Sheriff in Hiram, Ga that the Downtown Hiram Car lot and Downtown Hiram (Where the bus drove through and stopped) was filming the new Footloose (August 2010) I was all over it. I found all of the locations used, and even went into Cowboys Atlanta in Kennesaw, Ga when they were filming since I know the houseband and had connections. I was waiting since then for it to be in theaters. I have seen the original 1984 version thousand times, but I LOVE the new one as well. Not only is it personal to me, but I love when they actually do a great re-make. So if you have not seen it yet. Get off these reviews and see it BEFORE judging (since I know some people are TOO judgmental over it)
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Monae is one to watch.  I had heard Tightrope and really liked it so I borrowed the whole album from the library to listen to.  I have to admit...I was totally prepared to hate the rest of the album.  I thought \\"oh Tightrope will be good and the rest of the album will be that tedious, soul/r&B, Mariah-like, wailing crap that I hate.\\"  WRONG!  This album is so ecclectic.  You can hear everything in there - 60s soul, funk, punk, Simon & Garfunkle, Bowie, even Burt Bacharach!  And Monae has a beautiful voice that works in every style.  What I also like is that it's a \\"headphone\\" album.  Who makes those anymore?  It's marvelous...a good ol' CONCEPT album that you can just zone out to on your headphones.  Don't be driving, don't be doing yardwork, don't be putting it on \\"in the background,\\" just put on your headphones and listen.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Life is the dream  Death the awakening   *** WARNING contains SPOILERS ***  *  *  *  *  *  *  Have you seen the moon recently? Since I began reading \\"1Q84\\" I too sometimes see two moons in the sky. What could this mean? Two moons. It is tempting to see it as many of the characters in the book do. An alternate reality. A train switched from the main track to a different parallel track. Why not? Physicists sometimes conjecture that there are many parallel universes existing side by side. Or perhaps as E.A. Poe says \\"All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream\\" Fair enough, but still this is Murakami we are talking about. In the end I choose to believe what the taxi driver at the beginning tells us \\"If you really want to know what's happening here and now, you've got to use your own eyes and your own judgment.\\" and a little later adds: \\"the everyday look of things might seem to change a little. Things may look different to you than they did before. I've had that experience myself. But don't let appearances fool you. There's always only one reality.\\"   Always only one reality. One moon or two moons. There's always only one reality. Dreaming or awake, always only one reality. This I believe is what Murakami wishes for us to understand. Sometimes we can get stuck, as in the town of cats. Sometimes we can return to a world with one moon. And sometimes we are in a state of perplexity. Not understanding what is going on. We wish to know where we are going and what we should do. But as Fuka-Eri says \\"What kind of world will be there tomorrow? \\"No one knows the answer to that\\"    So do not look to this book for answers. The book itself tells us that also: \\"It was probably Chekhov who said that the novelist is not someone who answers questions but someone who asks them.\\" The answers are in the choices we make and the life we live. Sometimes there are two moons in the sky, but what we do and how we do it, are what count.
0307887960|2.0|This is a well-written book and I think oat bran is probably a healthy addition to most people's diets. I made the galettes (adding vanilla and cinnamon as well as a hefty pinch of salt, highly recommended) and they were not bad at all.  Be sure to grease your skillet well, even it's non-stick!!  But basically this is just the same as South Beach, except more restrictive.  At least South Beach allows you veggies during the strictest phase, which makes life a lot more pleasant (at least for me) and I don't think it slows your weight loss any.  Also, I think the South Beach recipes are tastier, more creative and more varied.  I have not actually tried to do the full-blown Dukan diet because I know that low-carb doesn't work for me in the long term.  The minute I add back any carbs -- even tiny portions of healthy, high-fiber carbs -- the weight comes right back, especially since I'm ravenously hungry after losing the initial weight.  Like South Beach or Stillman, this type of diet is probably OK as a short-term \\"desperation\\" diet -- to drop 5 pounds for a wedding or whatever.  Long-term, forget it.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Set in the 4th century city of Alexandria, in the Roman Empire just before its split in to two separate Empires. The narrative revolves around the Greek philosopher Hypatia (a teacher at the Platonic school) where the future elite are educated. Her story is told against the back ground of a Roman Empire running out of `steam', and is turning rapidly from Paganism to the early form of Christianity .The metamorphosis of the relatively new religion is neither pain less or consequence free. Religious tolerance seems non-existent, from this new faith. In turn the Pagans either convert on mass and the few who remain try to keep a low profile. The Christians then turn their attention to the Jews, and soon they come into conflict, committing violent acts against each other. The majority soon prevail, with the Christians ultimately wresting power from the only other religious group remaining. During this time of change - which at times are punctuated by a years of peace our philosopher Hypatia, continues with her single minded quest for knowledge. However, her study of heliocentrism, is not permitted by the new faith and soon she has to focus on working privately on her theories and experiments.<br /><br />Heliocentrism is the study of `astronomical model' in which the Earth and planets revolve around a stationary Sun at the centre of the solar system. This type of study was at odds with the accepted theory that all heavenly bodies, including the Sun, revolved around the Earth, the Earth was the centre of all things. While film is based on key main events in the Historical record, the narrative, the characterizations are fictional. The colour and iconography are rich and sumptuous, and remind me of such classic films as Ben-Hur or the Ten Commandments.<br /><br />This review does not wish to give away plot themes and the narrative that encompasses this rather fictionalized view of a rather extraordinary person who was ahead of her time by nearly 500 years plus, both as an accomplished scientist and women who was not abashed in speaking her mind in the company of men, these men being the elite of Alexandria in their own home patch. This then brings Hypatia into conflict as it is believed that she is the cause of strained relations between Orestes (a former pupil who loves her and values her intellect), the Imperial Roman Prefect, and the Patriarch Cyril, thus she attracted the hatred of the Christians of Alexandria, who wanted the politician and the priest to reconcile. One day, in March AD 415, during Lent, a Christian mob of Nitrian monks, way lay, attack and finally kill what they perceive is a Witch of the worst kind.<br /><br />I do not believe this film is anti Christian and for that matter nor is it anti religion. As one reviewer has puts it, the film is about `fanaticism and unreason'. Well I see the threads here that may lead to this inclination. However, for me I felt it was more about power play and influence, the religious conflict etc are the tools of the conflict, at the end of the day it was about power and who has it. The same is true in today's world. That said it's a film worth seeing, a beautiful but sad story worth 5 starscomplished scientist and women who was not abashed in speaking her mind in the company of men, these men being the elite of Alexandria in their own home patch.

B00466HN6S|3.0|There's a reason why it took so long for this movie to come out...<br />I did enjoy the movie...like i enjoy all new animated movie, but by<br />the end of the movie, you'll know why it does'nt stand up to other<br />big productions...but its much much better than some of the other<br />movies coming out these days.
0786891416|1.0|If you like the TV show \\"Castle,\\" just stick with that. This book was badly written and not the least bit fun to read. The dialogue is terrible and the characters aren't interesting. I could go on, but you get my point. The book only takes six hours to read, but it took me over a month to finish.<br /><br />Also, we get it: Her name is Nikki Heat. You don't have to use her full name in every sentence. That's just poor writing.

B0061US58C|4.0|4 Stars for the Movie:<br /><br />Cars 2 is still pretty entertaining, but I couldn't help feeling that it seemed to be a DreamWorks movie marked with a Pixar logo. Dreamworks movies are also great imo, but they have a very different feel than Pixar's movies. This movie feels that it's more about action and a lot less about story and character development, which makes sense since Cars 2 is a spy movie. (Then again The Incredibles had a ton of action AND the typical Pixar story & character development.) I'm sure kids will enjoy it the same as other Pixar movies, but I don't feel it's as engaging to adults.<br /><br />3 Stars for the Stream Rental:<br /><br />Since this is also a review of the online movie stream rental, I have to note that I was pretty annoyed that the movie still had a letter box even though I have a full 1080P HD 16:9 TV. That makes very little sense. I used a Roku to stream this movie, and plenty of other movies from Amazon and Netflix. This is the only movie that had a letterbox, and I actually paid for it.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love and have read all the Twilight books, seen all the Twilight movies and own every soundtrack and score.  The music is by far my favorite part of the whole franchise.  They always pick songs that not only are spot on with the movies, but also introduce me to some very cool artists.  There is always a lot of variety, and in particular on this album, you get the reincarnation of \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\\" (Wedding Version) which is a softer redention of one of the most popular Twilight songs and the instrumental version of \\"Turning Page\\" by Sleeping at Last, which is probably my favorite song on the whole album.  If they have to stop making movies, can they at least keep making soundtracks?  Please?  LOVE THIS ALBUM!
B005TD4GTO|5.0|The entire album flows very nicely and contains some of the best songs Noel has ever written.  Don't buy it expecting any crazy fast hard rock numbers because there isn't any.  This album focuses on lyrics and the possibilities of mellow/delicate song structure.  It kinda reminds me of a collection of Oasis demos that Noel never gave to Liam to sing.  My favorite highlights include: \\"Dream On\\", \\"AKA...What A Life\\", \\"(Stranded On) The Wrong Beach\\" and \\"Stop The Clocks.\\" Can't wait for the second album coming out in summer 2012.  I don't need to explain how good these songs are.  Listen to the previews and you'll know it's definitely a must buy.  Enjoy!!!
B003L77GH4|5.0|Oh, how I love Amazon.com, you can purchase almost anything you want. It is shipped to you in timely manner for way cheaper than other places. When I received my \\"Vampire Diaries\\", it was in excellent shape, and I bought it used. I would definitely recommend purchasing this item, or any item from Amazon.com, for that matter. Keep up the great work!!
B004G6009U|5.0|One of the best animations to come out in a long time. Way better than Lion King with great action, light music, fantastic comedy and more twists and turns than Chubby Checker in a blender. Highly recommend this film!
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever watched.  It is my favorite one and I have watched it numerous times.  Colin Firth is absolutely the greatest actor I have seen in a very long time.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Very good app. Very good company. I love everything Adobe's products. Everybody must have quality products. Thank you very much Adobe.
B004OKFIQI|5.0|This is simply the best version of Rumors I have ever heard. 45rpm and extremely quiet and beautifully pressed. Worth every cent.
0345441184|5.0|Great story, vivid imagery.  Recently I re-read the book and fell in love with it again.  It is a great mythological tale filled with power, spells, love, religious conflict, betrayal, revenge, and sex... everything that makes reading a joy.  But it is not only a great read, it had me thinking about society in general, how change just comes regardless of human efforts to stop it.
B005L3HJ8M|1.0|I purchased the vinyl and suggest everyone to stay away from buying the US version on Capitol which is totally unlistenable. After 30 minutes of painstaking cleaning a brand new vinyl the side B is still impossible to listen to. Capitol as a label is consistently making poor quality pressings which is extremely noisy over and over again on vinyl.   Might give the UK version a try to compare if this is USA version only which has the pressing defects.

B005NJ2K6U|5.0|way better then jewel quest. tale a few rounds to get the hang of the spinning part but once you do you can't put the game down.
0545123275|4.0|If I could give the beginning a rating and the ending a rating, they would vary a little. The beginning was slow to start, but the second half of the book drew me in so much that I read it all at once. I don't like crying at movies or books, but I did shed some tears while reading this one. The characters of all of the teens and the wolves seem very well thought out, very real, but the parents (oh, the dreadful parents) are all completely clueless, self-absorbed, and annoying. Being a parent of a teen myself, I'm appalled that there would ever be parents as clueless and uninvolved in their children's lives as these.<br /><br />The prose, song lyrics, and poetry that are all combined into this book in order to relate how Sam's mind works are all beautiful and could stand on their own as part of a separate book. The relationship between Sam and Grace rivals many others and I think is now one of my favorite paranormal romances now. If you love the supernatural/human romance, this book is for you, it truly is a love story as it focuses more on that than most listed as \\"paranormal romances\\" that have been put out lately. Every girl needs her Sam, every guy needs their Grace and it's great to see such a wonderful relationship in the teen genre.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Does not work on my Droid incredible. The app just closes when I open it. I love this game and wish they would update it to work on all phones.
1423113381|4.0|I'm already a fan of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson & The Olympian's series, so I jumped at the bit to read this book. The Red Pyramid is a great adventure book based around Egyptian mythology this time. We read the book from both Sadie and Carter's perspectives, which makes it more fun and interesting than a one sided view in this case.<br /><br />This book is quite a bit longer than any of the individual Percy Jackson books and there is a lot of more information about Egyptology, so I would save this for the kids in the top of the age range it's directed at. There is a lot going on, a lot of strange names, and some sliding back and forth out of our basic world and into another that could cause some confusion for the younger audience.<br /><br />The story moves right along, no sitting still or waiting to develop characters, that is all done while on the run, and it is done well. The constant action makes it easy to read this book with no desire to take a break or put it down for the night. Love The Mummy movies, this book is the kids version of that, always trouble lurking around the next corner, something else cool to discover, magic learned, enemies to defeat, and on and on. This book could make itself into a great movie if it's backed with the right people and enough money.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I can't really explain why this album is so fun for me to listen to. Each song has it's own rhythm and style yet the entire album seems to have a unified theme...at least in my interpretation. The songs are fun, seem to come from the heart (or the head), and draw a wide range of positive comments from people while being playing in my car. I would recommend this album to anyone from head bangers to people more like me who just like to sit back and realax to good music with a good beat either at home or in the car.
0823003590|5.0|I am enjoying this book and have made progress in my portrait drawing in only a few sessions with it. One of the best I have seen, and I have many art books and drawing guides.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great bag with plenty of room for all my gear.  I packed a 7D plus five primes and two zooms into this.  From the pictures I thought it would be larger.  My wife called it \\"cute\\" when we received it.  But, even still, like I said, it has plenty of room and is very well made.  Should last a long time.  The price is killer especially compared to the overblown costs of many competitors.  Definitely recommend!

B005J9ZDYK|4.0|My 12-yr daughter and I moved right into Season 2 as soon as we finished Season 1.<br /><br />We noticed a few things right away.<br /><br />1) The screen width was cut down from widescreen to a traditional TV 3:4 ratio picture.<br />2) The claymation animators made changes to the appearance of some of the characters. These include the Farmer who now has a perpetual 5 o-clock shadow, Blitzer the dog who now has hair-like details rather than the simpler more innocent smooth finish you would be used to seeing on Gromit (if you know Wallace and Gromit) and more detail around the mouth and nose.  The cat has been upgraded from a sort of wolverine/bear like critter to a cat with claws, and it plays a bigger role in season 2 than in season 1.  While a few of these changes were probably a good idea, I think that changes to the characters' appearances were more distracting than beneficial.  Like I mentioned before, these changes made the characters less innocent looking and, well, I missed most of the old versions.<br />3) One of the things that totally cracked me up about Season 1 was the way that Blitzer blows his whistle and occasionally hands out yellow or red cards, just like a soccer (football) referee.  Sadly, he doesn't do that any more.  I REALLY miss that.<br /><br />Anyway, changes aside, the series is still worth a look, especially if you still have children around the house.  Oh, and I still love the pigs.  They and the sheet still mix things up from time to time - hilarious!<br /><br />The animation is still fun and fresh, and changes aside, it's still a solid 4-star offering (considering Wallace and Gromit in their three original adventures as being 5 stars).<br /><br />If you like Wallace and Gromit or Shaun the Sheep Season 1, you will almost certainly like Season 2 as well.<br /><br />Keep up the good work!
B005ZOLW4Y|4.0|I love Billy Joel and this is a great album.  I wish they would have left the introductions and the radio Id tag out.  Who cares about these things, certainly not I.

B004EBT5CU|4.0|Everytime, I turned on the radio they were playing a song from this CD..... so I bought it.  I like the CD,  my favorites  \\"He Won't Go\\", \\"Someone Like You\\", \\"Rolling In the Deep\\", \\"Lovesong\\", \\"Turning Tables\\", \\"Don't You Remember\\", and \\"I'll Be Waiting\\", her sound reminds me of Stevie Nicks/Aretha Franklin with a hint of Nora Jones!  I believe Adele has \\"staying power\\" and will be around for a long time!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|So I love Settlers of Catan and finally bought it. It's great, the packaging is crisp, all the pieces and cards look great, it feels like a great game and is super fun to play. I only have one complaint, and it's big enough to drop it from 5 stars to 4. That is the outer edge pier tiles. They bubble up for some reason and won't stay flat, even after hours under heavy materials. Since they rise up, it makes it nearly impossible to fit the hexagon pieces inside the remaining area without them sliding around. It's really annoying! I hope someone makes the outer connecting pieces much sturdier next time around!
0553386794|5.0|This series is amazingly well written. The way the story is told through different character's points of view allows the author to build an intimate view of the primary characters. We see the inner tickings and internal reasoning of their actions across the series. We see growth and collapse of characters personalities. The world is immense and the people in it widely varied. There are some lulls, but the story is exciting and hard to put down.
0307455874|3.0|I have to say Obama seemed okay in some ways before he was president.  Then once he was in office he was an absolute disaster.  He lied about ending the wars, he lied about closing Guantanamo, he lied about bailouts.  But then I read his book and he seems to have a full understanding of how DC works and what is wrong with it.  He oddly enough was even considered a Constitutional lawyer, yet when he became president he seems to have forgotten what the Constitution actually says.    I guess the main point is that there is a major disconnect between Obama before he was president and during.  The same can certainly be said about Reagan as well.  Both made promises to change things.  Reagan was fed up with Carter's \\"spending\\" so he promised to cut spending then ended up spending more than anyone in history.  Obama criticized Bush, but then accelerated all of the Bush policies.  It's like he lost his head.  Reading his book though shows me that at one point he did at least somewhat have a head.
0525423656|3.0|~~* Possible spoilers *~~ I absolutely adored \\"Matched.\\" I thought it held intrigue, romance, and all of the qualities of a very well-written story. I pre-ordered \\"Crossed\\" and was so excited to get started reading. About half way through the book, though, I found myself wondering when it was going to get started. Overall, it seems I've just read 255 pages worth of filler. Unfortunately Condie fell into the pit hole that many authors of a trilogy series do- she's written a 2nd book that seems to serve simply as a bridge, with none of the character development and plot intrigue of a truly successful novel. Of course there are aspects of the novel which are important, and key ingredients of the story were introduced, but the character of Cassia, who I saw grow and change significantly during the first novel, seemed stagnant and boring. The dynamic between her and Ky was dull. Xander, who seemed to be the only character with a significant secret revealed, was hardly in the story at all, though he was mentioned almost every single waking thought Cassia had. The prose, however, was beautifully written, much more poetic and inspired than the first.  Overall, I think \\"Crossed\\" holds a few very minor important plot points, but was majorly overstated. Once I was done reading I felt a bit cheated, having spent the time following Cassia's journey, only to have her end up practically right back where she started. Everything I was interested in seeing resolved in \\"Crossed\\" was stretched out and beaten, left hanging for the 3rd piece of the trilogy.  Despite this, I am still very much looking forward to the last novel of the series, where I will finally get to see the conclusion of the exciting story Condie began with \\"Matched.\\"
0062011847|5.0|Another fantastic book from Terry Pratchett.  Well worth the read.  Great sense of humour and makes the ordinary sound so funny.  [[ASIN:0062011847 Snuff: A Novel of Discworld (Discworld Novels)]]
0545259088|3.0|This is the third, and thankfully the last, installment of The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy.  I say thankfully because while I enjoyed the series (book 2 is actually the best of all of them), enough was enough.<br /><br />Our intrepid heroes in this last novel fell flat.  Grace was checked out and Sam turned into a wimp.  The only thing that made the series worth reading for me was the great cast of secondary characters that the author thankfully turned into main characters.  All of the supporting cast was well developed with wonderful, witty dialog and were it not for them, the whole plot would have tanked.<br /><br />Sam and Grace?  Mooney teenage love that saps the common sense out of normally smart characters.  I'm certain it appealed to it's intended audience, but for the rest of us who got sick of that kind of behavior after Twilight, it was irritating.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad I read the series, but you won't be missing out on a lot if you skip it.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|This book is well worth a read for anyone interested in this turbulent period in history.  I was sorry when it ended {even though I knew how it would turn out! :-)}.
B004WJREMW|4.0|McCartney writes material for several distinct target audiences. But it all goes on the same album. And it does this album. And on album after album. In retrospect, one can use CD-Rs or iPod playlists to separate out those different categories of songs: Beatlesworthy tracks, kids stuff, bopper stuff, adlescent fare, and middle-of-the-road (MOR) It's a measure of Mac's genius as a composer that he can address all these different audiences, and more--with his oratorios, symphonies, string quartets, ballets, chorale music, movie soundtracks, fusion etc.  But a lot of us don't like the mix served up on official releases. If I'm of a mind to listen to Mac doing kids stuff, I can glean all his kids numbers from his many CDs and then sit down and listen through the lot with my 8-year-old. Including `Bogey Music' from McCartney II.   `Coming Up' may be a Beatlesworthy tune, but only in the form of the `live in Glasgow' version that was the hit in the U.S., not the lame studio version on this album. `Temporary Secretary' has its virtues but grates on the nerves after a number of listens. The rest of the album is for diehard Mac fans, not Beatles fans. On the whole, the 1980s would become a pretty bleak era for the Beatle still lurking about within Paul. His inner Beatle wouldn't really emerge until after he'd gotten involved in the Beatles Anthology project in the early 1990s. In its wake, we would see a tremendous resurgence in Beatlesque/Beatlesworthy material from Paul. Only mediocrities are ALWAYS at their best. It is precisely because Paul is something of a genius that one shouldn't expect his best at every turn. Give the artist some space to make some wrong turns. One doesn't have to praise everything he's done to ensure one's credentials as a major Mac fan.

0385534639|1.0|It's been quite some time since I've read a book with absolutely no literary merit, but that streak came to a devastating end with this meltdown of a novel. If you set aside the saccharine platitudes communicated through the pen of a seemingly oh-so-misunderstood teenage girl, this is a book that says absolutely nothing over the course of 387 pages.<br /><br />There were several uses of the word \\"magical\\" to describe the air. \\"The air was magical.\\" I have no idea what Morgenstern means here. She assumes that this word is going to conjure some image in the reader's mind, but as I'm personally unfamiliar with magical air, it did nothing but come across as vapid psychobabble. Show me, Ms. Erin, don't tell me. Is there some characteristic of the air that distinguishes it from \\"regular air\\"? If so, show me. If not, then why on earth are you using your time to describe the air? This might seem like elementary level criticism, but in a work that never rises above insipid musings on a trite love story, nothing more than the most simplistic critique is necessary. If the writing stinks, does the story even matter?<br /><br />Ms. Morgenstern, whether she realizes it or not, is a by-product of J.K. Rowling throwing in the towel on Harry Potter. The fact that this novel made it to print is no different than sad sack bands like Coldplay and Travis taking off after Radiohead stopped playing a guitar on Kid A. Publishers must be hoping that The Night Circus will siphon off some of J.K.'s now-lonesome audience, but this is not the work that will do the job.
B0054N73EY|3.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers make a transition between guitarists and what sounds like a transitional album. \\"I'm With You\\" carves out pop turf with new guitarist Josh Klinghoffer providing sturdy support and more than a few interesting riffs. And once again, Rick Rubin brings his less-is-more production philosophy to the Peppers, which is a good thing for a band that works more on instinct than technology.<br /><br />That instinct serves them well here. The fuzz-bomb that opens \\"Monarchy of Roses\\" lets you know that you've got the m-fing Red Hot Chili Peppers back in your player, man, before things turn conventional and the meaty chorus sinks in. If the lead single's title of \\"The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie\\" didn't make you think about \\"Dani California,\\" the bass/drum shuffle sure will. Plus, there's a great tribute song for writer Brendan Mullen that revisits the acoustic-building-to-wall-of-sound that was \\"Under The Bridge.\\" \\"Brendan's Death Song\\" may not be the revelation that \\"Under The Bridge\\" was, but then again, \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" is still the best thing the Peppers have ever done.<br /><br />What \\"I'm With You\\" boils down to is RHCP's constancy. Once they hit a secondary peak with \\"Californication,\\" they've been pretty much fishing in the same barrel ever since. \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" scored some bonus points for its audaciousness, while \\"I'm With You\\" sounds what I imagine \\"Stadium\\" (even with the switch in guitarists) would have sounded like had the Peppers held themselves to a single disc release. Don't expect anything radical, just know that you're still getting a quality album.

0307272702|5.0|I LOVE IT. the best part about this book is all of the actual EVIDENCE HE GIVES. Most of it is common sense also, but obviously not too many docotrs, nutrtionist, and other health authorites have that. This book is a Blessing for mankind, if you have any problems that come from poor nutrtion this book is for you, if you want to know how to eat healthy for life this book is for you. This book should be a mandatory read in Highschool and college.

1567184855|2.0|I first discovered this book in 2004, and upon first reading it I was astounded, comforted, and very intrigued. Over the years since then, I've reread it a couple more times, as well as Michael Newton's follow-up book of case-histories &#34;Destiny of Souls&#34;. Unfortunately, the more I reread these books, the more convinced I am that this is not a factual picture of an afterlife. The language used in the various transcripts is always very detailed, articulate, and flowing - in fact, all of the case history transcripts exhibit &#34;one voice&#34; and it is an exceedingly articulate and erudite voice. This despite the fact that most of the footage I've seen of subjects in deep hypnosis show most of them speaking haltingly and only semi-coherently. More and more, I am coming to believe that the case history transcripts in the books are figments of Michael Newton's own personal vision: this appears to possibly be his OWN paradigm of the afterlife, which he has synthesized by studying the philosophies and religions of the world (which he clearly acknowledges in his writings). Moreover, there are major problems with using hypnosis to access/unlock forgotten memories; 'false memory&#34; is a very real thing in hypnosis. Your mind will never tell you &#34;I can't retrieve that info.&#34; It will simply create a false memory, sometimes with tragic consequences (i.e. false memories of sexual abuse, etc. which never, in fact, occurred). I am not suggesting that there is no afterlife and no reincarnation...but I am suggesting that people pay close attention and read these books with critical thinking skills firmly in place.  Edit: Also, this aspect of the book does not make sense to me: According to this book, most of our most profound & intimate relationships on earth seem to equate to us all being in the same small &#34;soul cluster&#34; group in the afterlife. However, my most profound relationships/friendships come from far & wide - we are not one tight, close clique here on earth. Most of them don't even know each other, some of them live in other countries. How could all of us belong to one soul cluster group when the only thing all of us have in common...is knowing ME. This is an inconsistency, it does not make logical sense. It would only make sense if all our most profound relationships existed together in a tight, equally close, family-like group on earth - which is not the case for most people.
B00026ZG10|2.0|True Lies I thought was nothing that great from Schwarzenegger and would put it on the bottom of my list of his favorite movies.  Some of the scenes were kind of weird and stupid I thought especially the one where they question his wife in the empty room behind close doors, just seemed bizarre.  That along with the one were he plays that tape recording to get his wife to strip her clothing off, did not really like it or the storyline much.  Look towards Collateral Damage or Eraser for a better performance from Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|First off the animation is top notch which is not that big of a surprise for Pixar. There is nothing wrong with the story/script either its just fine. James Bond meets cars works for me. My 8 year old daughter just loved it and we see all the top animation.  If your looking for superb animation and a fun and exciting story well then look no further. Dont listen to the critics on this one, its a winner. Is it the best of the best, well no, but its worth 4 or 4 1/2 stars to me. If you have any doubts just hit it up at the red box.
0790729601|3.0|Eraser is a good action effort from Arnold Schwarzenegger and I would put it around the top of his movie lists but would not call it the best movie he has made.  There is a lot of action and neat stunts in Eraser which makes it entertaining while the storyline is pretty well written.  For sure a must see for all Arnold fans and anyone who likes good action/stunt movies.  Eraser should go down as one of his better films but take a look at Collateral Damage or T2 for a more A1 performance in my opinion.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller

B002A97IJ0|5.0|Purchased this because my cooler was a bit large.  It fit well and works well.    As some of the others have stated, it is a bit louder than my other fans, but it was also blowing more air than my other fans.  I went into my bios and lowered the RPM down to 1500 and it is now as quiet and blows the same amount of air as my normal sized fans.

1400052181|5.0|This is what happened.  This is why it happened.  These are the circumstances that made this all come together. This is one side of the story.  This is the other side.  These are the misconceptions each side has.  Both sides are wrong on these points.  Both sides have these valid concerns.  This is why these misconceptions exist and persist.  This happened in the 50's, which was a very different time.  One of my favorite aspects of \\"The Immortal Life of HeLa\\" was Rebecca Skloot's ability to observe and convey all sides of the story and differentiate fact from opinion.  She made clear the views and feelings of scientists and family without victimizing or taking sides and gracefully corrected any misunderstandings while explaining why they had these misunderstandings.    Skloot tells the readers what Henrietta suffered as a result of being a black woman in horribly racist times and what she suffered from being a sick woman in the 50's, before medical advancements and what she suffered by coincidence.  She shows the racist feelings of the family and the medical professionals and reporters that dealt with the family.  She shows the misconceptions of both sides as well.    Some reviews criticize the inclusion of the family story rather than Henrietta's, but the author explains that Deborah agreed to give information about her mother on the condition that the family's story be told.  Henrietta died too soon for her children to recall anything about her and the family was initially reluctant to cooperate.  It's hard to gain information on a dead person when those who knew her will not talk about her and even more difficult when they don't remember.  I suppose Skloot could have made stuff up to make her critics happy, but she didn't.    Some people criticize Skloot's \\"portrayal\\" of the family as a stereotype and say she tried to make them look ignorant.  Again, Skloot explains why.  The family worked a tobacco field and the children felt the need to leave school before 4thgrade to work.  No, they aren't educated, yes that's unfortunate, and yes, it has a negative effect on their English, but that's the way things are for them.  She didn't judge them and nor should any reader.  The family IS ignorant, that is clear, but ignorance is not stupidity.  Some of Henrietta's descendents DID make it to college to study science.  It is clear that Deborah tried to educate herself as much as she could about the cells and the impact they had on medicine. These are not the actions of a stupid person.  Her brothers do demonstrate a sense of entitlement, but gradually lose these feelings, but whether this is due to a change in heart or loss of interest cannot be known.  Whether the reader agrees with the family or not is irrelevant; the book isn't about how they SHOULD think, but what they DO think.  Good, bad or indifferent, stereotypical people exist.  To say someone one thinks fits a stereotype cannot or should not exist/be accurately portrayed is equally bigoted as assuming a stranger does fit a stereotype based on whatever factor, be it race, religion, sex, etc.    Yes, I found the family story insanely boring, as I wanted to know about the science.  I was relieved to know there was a reason the family was included beyond the gathering of facts.    In the end, this book demonstrates the effect that HeLa had on Henrietta's family and science.  It does not attempt to persuade the reader to think or feel in a particular way.  It does not focus on debate of tissue ownership, but uses the ubiquitous HeLa to show both sides.  The medical community is still evolving, as is the debate regarding tissue ownership.  The only way to dislike this book is to misunderstand its purpose.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|As jaws was to the water Hostel is to back packing in Europe. It will have you second guessing the places you stay and the \\"friendly\\" locals you meet. Such a strong movie with direct clear messages. Ignore the haters out there. Everyone who strongly hates it is just proof that Eli Roth's second endeavour into feature film making was a success. Yes there is a good amount of blood and torture but when you break it down it is all justified to the story that was told. Was there nudity?, yes. But isn't that how the most sheltered Americans believe Europe to be and what encourages young college students to venture there. Honestly one of the greatest horror/suspense films I have seen. Eli Roth is pure genius with his story telling, and his eye for selecting the perfect cast. Not a role was poorly acted it was a nice change to the traditional bag of performances that you usually get from horror like films. If you absolutely are unable to watch blood or violence on screen then this is not for you, But everyone else its a must!  Also DVD is filled with excellent special features and great in depth commentary tracks.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|And that is probably the biggest problem with this album - with the concept of it..  Most Velvet Underground fans aren't Metallica fans, and most Metallica fans don't care about the Velvet Underground.  Both bands had offsprings in different directions... Fans of the Velvet Underground went on to listen to a lot of indie/alternative music, fans of Metallica went on to listen to harder bands...  Combining the lead songwriter for VU and combining Metallica just isn't a good mix, musically it's not a good mix, and in concept it's not a good mix.  I can understand Lou Reed making an album with Sonic Youth, Pavement, Pixies... And I can understand Metallica making an album with Ozzy, or Slash, or Axl... But I can't see Metallica and Lou Reed making an album together - it really isn't a good mix.

B0058WFO06|5.0|I have enjoyed Porcupine Tree for a number of years now and Progressive music has always been my favorite to listen to.  This new CD by Steven Wilson is just so soothing to the ears.  I find it very easy to listen to and can enjoy it in any state of mind.  One thing I have noticed about Steven's style, is he's able to create many different sounds and have it flow and meander though a forest like a stream; it's just so wonderful.  To me his music is like a story of sounds. I'm certainly looking forward to the next Porcupine Tree CD, but now I may be more excited to get his next solo CD.  Like many have been saying, \\"Album of the year.\\"  If you like \\"Recordings\\" then you'll love this CD - buy it.

B004UXUWYM|2.0|Not sure what to make of this film.  Depp is usually very good in these sorts of obscure film roles but, in this film, it seemed like he was not all there.  Perhaps, this was the idea, or it can just be attributable to the absence of any real plot.  Okay, there was a lot of drinking but the drinking emphasis was so affected that it lost all sense of reality.  So, maybe this was supposed to be the point.  Again, I'm not sure what the hell to make of this film.  When it was boiled down, you got Depp as a drunk writer, other drunk writers in need of a shower and shave, a real estate developer (who is the \\"bad guy\\"), a sex-craved blonde bimbo, cock fights, acid trips, and some sort of newspaper that suddenly crumbles (around 30 minutes after my patience did at sitting through the film--although I did gut it out to the credits).    Perhaps, I missed something with this film.  Or, perhaps, I got what I was supposed to get and just did not \\"get it.\\"    Like I said, I am not sure what to make of this movie other than I would not pay to see it again (and would likely ask for a refund if I could).
B004Q84Z0S|4.0|This recording of \\"Ariodante\\" without a doubt will take its rightful high place among the other recordings of this opera.   All soloists' voices are flexible, well controlled. I consider Topi Lehtipuu the best Lurcanio up to date, his phrasing is flawless and very moving. The performance of Karina Gauvin (Ginevra) is very involved, she manages to put real passion to her singing and still keep in touch with abstained, but meaningful conducting manner of Curtis. The dark timbre of the voice Marie-Nicole Lemieux is very well suited to the role of Polinesso. The singing of Matthew Brook is overall adequate, though inexpressive and bleak.   Joice diDonato... Based on her previous collaboration with Curtis (Radamisto, Alcina, Elmira(Floridante)) I had really high expectations from her rendition of Ariodante... Well, I was disappointed... Of course, she do her best here, all advantages of her voice - flexibility, warmness and clearness of tone, shining top range etc, are present and demonstrated, but there are obvious problems: her bottom range is not well suited to the part, she is a little dull and uninvolved in pathetic moments.   For me the major shortcoming of this recording is Sabina Puertolas. It is really mystery why on earth Curtis gave part of Dalinda to the singer who noticeably lisps...  Let's summarize. Lehtipuu and Gauvin receive grade A, Lemieux: A-, diDonato B, Brook: B-, Puertolas: C. Curtis and Il Complesso Barocco A-.   Overall I would rate this recording as good (4 stars), but not exceptional.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I cannot believe I have waited so long to watch this movie. I have netflix, and when you add a movie to your queue, it pulls up other suggestions and I always see this movie...thinking that by the title it was more of a love and war movie..which at the time I didn't care too much for war movies. So, I didn't pay it no attention. Well, I began watching Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre, so I searched to see if there was any other movies like that, and every website suggested this. I cannot believe I judged this so harshly without researching it. I could not stop watching it. I stayed up till 7 in the morning to finish it. I watched it again the next day and I knew I have to have this movie in my DVD collection. This is my FAVORITE movie of all time. I can say I enjoyed this WAY much more than Pride and Prejudice or Jane Eyre, even though those are quite brilliant and great movies. But North and South, this is how I think the best romance plot line that is ever made. Thanks to the directors and Elizabeth Gaskell for making this for all who yearn for such romance!

B004LROUW2|3.0|I really, really wanted to like this book. After reading so many rave reviews prior to it's English publication, I was excited to read something unique, involving, etc. I should have stopped reading after fifty pages, but I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. It is maddeningly repetitive, the conflicts are weak and fizzle out, it breaks out into what I can only describe as a fourteen year old boy's version of sexuality. The world of the novel only borders on interesting. The themes of reality and free choice will grab your attention, but for that I'd rather watch Lost. In a better world than this, an editor would have insisted on these three words: \\"Half as long.\\" I could go on about this for fifty more pages, but only people who have read the book would get the irony.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|As evidenced by the many other reviews on this title and Green Lantern, Ultraviolet IS NOT a digital copy of the film.  It is a blatant and misleading lie by the Warner Brothers attempting to control the content that you purchased.  It DOES NOT work.  The streaming is terrible.  The functionality is gawd awful.  You do not get to keep the 'digital copy' as it expires after three years from when you register it.  It is currently impossible to download a physical digital copy without also putting Warner's Flixter application on your computer so they can DOCUMENT AND CONTROL your entire movie collection (if you read the terms, they also state that you may lose access to ANY of your movie content at anytime... even if it was not obtained through UV by installing this software).<br /><br />Read all the terms and conditions.  Read the privacy policy (or lack thereof) on Flixter and UV.<br /><br />It is all a scam.<br /><br />I wish studios would stop being stupid and just go with what works.  Get over the greed and try to look at things from your customers perspective for a change.  Studios will find they make A LOT more money when they stop fighting their customers and simply make good movies.<br /><br />All this does is push legitimate purchasers to piracy as an only option.<br /><br />Stupid.

1401201911|5.0|When DC Comics began their Elseworlds series in the late 80's,the stories ran the gamut from finding their iconic superheroes in specific periods of history,to reinterpretations of familiar storylines and continuity.Some of these truly stood out from all the rest,like this selection from writer Mark Millar,in which the previously All-American Man Of Steel is now a hero of the Soviet Union,coming to manhood at the very beginning of The Cold War,an event which has the U.S. Government turning to its top scientist Lex Luthor for aide.  Despite what the previous sentence might suggest,this isn't an alternate reality where Superman is the villian and Luthor is the hero;Millar wisely avoids such an obvious plotline,giving us instead a Superman who wants to do the right thing by his adopted race,even with his strong belief in the Marxist Doctrine.Although destroying the Soviet Man Of Steel becomes an obsession for Lex Luthor,he carefully straddles the line between diligence and deviousness.Caught between these two men is Lois Lane,unsure of with whom her destiny lies.Other characters in the DC canon,such as Jimmy Olson,Batman and Brainiac round out the cast.  The eye-catching artwork,provided by Dave Johnson and Kilian Plunkett,perfectly compliments Millar's provocative story,which concludes with a twist ending that is far too good to reveal here.
1451627289|4.0|Hey, dedicated Stephen King fans!  You're in for an epic treat--an odyssey, a Fool's journey, an adventure with romance. A genre-bending historical novel with moral implications, this story combines echoes of Homer, H.G. Wells, Don Quixote, Quantum Leap (the old TV show), Jack Finney's Time and Again, and even a spoonful of meta-King himself, the czar of popular fiction.<br /><br />The voice is familiar--the reluctant, lonely, courageous, romantic, destiny-bound hero/scarred social warrior. The story is King-esque- towering, prophetic, and flamboyant. This is mainstream entertainment; King is King of what King does--the unruly escapist story with a blazing heart. King is loyal to what he calls his \\"Constant Reader.\\"<br /><br />This is not horror, in case you are strictly old school fans. However, there is a touch of the supernatural via time-travel. If you are new to King, and are reading this for more insight into the fateful day of 11/22/63, or a \\"what would the world be like if...?,\\" this is not King's principle design. It hovers, yes, and is material only to the primary theme.<br /><br />Through a time portal in the storeroom of a greasy spoon diner, is a way back to 1958. Do we have the moral right to alter history, if we could? This is Jake Epping's noble journey--to answer that question--and, even more so, to ask it. King's demonstrates how the past and the present have a harmony that echoes, sings, dances, and shadows. He has refined his work from the genre horror, and the horrors that he now portray are undeniably real.<br /><br />King provides details that make the time-travel plausible--suspending disbelief is playfully easy. Jake confronts the prophecy that \\"the past is obdurate,\\" and \\"life can turn on a dime.\\" Inevitably, his mission and his new life rub together, generating poignant conflicts and urgent demands.<br /><br />King's strengths include his sense of place and time. He renders 1958 so specifically that you will be transported. Ten-cent root beers with foam; fin-tailed Chevrolets; cigarette smoke wafting inside and out; Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis from the jukebox; dancing cheek-to-cheek; mink and Moxie; rotary dial phones and party lines, and so much more to texturize the \\"Land of Ago.\\" King makes it credible for memories to branch arterially from past to present, for different time periods to cast hazy shadows on each other.<br /><br />\\"It's all of a piece...It's an echo so close to perfect you can't tell which one is the living voice and which is the ghost-voice returning.\\"<br /><br />Despite the voluminous research done by King into the Oswald controversy, his historical conclusions are woven into the book rather cursorily, but emphatically. Does this matter? It might. I was distracted at intervals. We don't have to necessarily agree with a character's actions, but if an historical context is displayed as fact, but the facts don't add up for the reader, then the framework strains to hold together. Then again, it might not matter at all.<br /><br />The narrative is earnestly embellished, characters and motives occasionally simplified, and plot devices wistfully executed. He isn't one for much technical subtlety, and he justifies (too many) coincidences by cleverly making coincidence part of the theme. But this is King's signature style, and it works. I cared as passionately as Jake. Sadie, however, is the unforgettable character in this book. Jake/George may be the hero, but Sadie is the spirited touchstone. Comely, fetchingly clumsy, and wounded, she dances off the pages.<br /><br />No popular author opens and closes a story like Stephen King. Enchanting and sublime, he builds deft bridges and ladders that are not only elaborate and infinite, but also inspired and relevant. He captures in a few chapters what an evocative song can capture in a few minutes. Whatever his flaws, his rewards are plentiful. Classy, cosmic, mystical, and kaleidoscopic--the story was radiant and clear, through a glass, darkly.<br /><br />Addendum: Simon and Schuster sent me a copy in October for review. The views are entirely my own.y my own.
0857685570|5.0|Fantastic book about one of the greatest illustrator and movie poster artist in the world! I previously bought the Art of Drew Struzan, so I was a little afraid that I was buying some kind of \\"duplicate\\" in the most part of it. I was wrong! This book features a lot more gorgeous artwork (and counts a lot more pages). This is an absolute must-have for all Struzan, movies and poster illustrations.  (sorry for my english, i'm italian!)

Michael is fun, romantic, serious all at the same time in this recording...I played it at work on Saturday and I was either weak in my knees or dancing around the room and laughing!!! I love this cd and I know you will 2! ( side note: ok so his version of \\"Santa Baby\\" is different and hard to get used to because of the original version always being sung by an woman but he makes it his own soo you will just need to make up your mind if u like or just not like it..)
1594484805|4.0|. . . and the note that he sang was \\"intrinsic motivation.\\"  Yes, Pink hits you over the head again and again with his views about motivation --- that personal investment, flexibility and responsibility are critical, while carrots and sticks weaken motivation and obliterate creativity.  No doubt there is something to his views, and, for me, having the point repeated over and over again in this short book, if not exciting, did help the ideas sink in.  Readable style also explains the popularity.
B004EQAVFU|3.0|When you're watching this movie, you get the eerie feeling that all is not as it seems, which in the end, turns out to be true. \\"Never Let Me Go\\" isn't what I'd classify as an 'entertaining' movie but rather a film that takes what is possible in this day of modern science marvels and turns it into a disturbing reality. Kathy, Tom, and Ruth grow up together in an what could be perceived as an orphanage/boarding school. The children are treated well, with the exception of the several boxes of broken toys that are delivered to the school. But one day, a teacher decides that the children deserve to know 'the truth' about their existence and purposes in life: to be vital organ donors 2 or more times until their lives end, without the possibility of even living to be middle aged. Once Kathy, Ruth, and Tom learn of these truths, their own lives take on new meanings as they strive to live what little time they have as best they can. This movie is worth seeing at least once if for no other reason than it does make one consider what could happen in this age of organ donations, cloning, and dna engineering.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|I am not an audiophile, and was curious how I could get the most out of my new ATH-M50 headphones. Many recommendations pointed to this, and here we are now. I can confidently say that non-audiophiles will be able to tell a difference with this amp. Whether improved sound quality from your computer, iPad, etc. is worth ~$100 to you is your call, but if you are looking to make improvements, just go with this.<br /><br />As a note, the front plastic scratches VERY easily. It even scratches from rubbing it with a microfiber cloth. Hell, it even scratched when I rubbed my finger on it. FiiO is aware of this, and provide a free screen protector. Make sure you put this on ASAP. Also, don't fret if you did smudge it or add small scratches, as the screen protector nicely hides them very well.<br /><br />Also, throw away the crappy pouch/sleeve that it comes with. It's some super cheap material that sheds like crazy.
B005K8QIS0|4.0|\\"Blue mouse\\" won me over right away - what a visually captivating show with so many strong, consistently interesting characters.  From the sisters to the man who cannot accept no for an answer in the death of his precious daughter, to the writer suddenly confronted with reality around him and his own secret.   There is no Agatha Christie here or complex plots and yes, they are a bit convenient but so much can be in the telling of a tale, as in it's outcome and this is where Jackson Brody glows. Unusually for these shows, the victims are far more captivating, compelling and in focus than are the \\"villans.\\"   I will say they are wearing out Mary Gauthier a bit - I enjoy her music but in every episode over and over? It's getting a bit weird and tiresome.  And Mr. Brody finds more reasons to remove his shirt during a day than I do in a week but maybe I would too were I so fit. Even so...  Otherwise this is a beautifully filmed series you can relax watching and just enjoy where it takes you.   Outstanding, wonderful show. I'm greatly anticipating more.
B0034G4P8A|3.0|No more combo packs.  I wish manufacturers would give buyers the option to buy the Blu-ray only!  My God I'm sick of purchasing 2 or more discs that I'll never use just to own a movie on Blu-Ray.
B002ZG99IG|1.0|\\"Horror\\" indeed!  This movie is about as scary as a poor little kitten in a dryer.  Now that was repulsive!  I'm a dog lover in the first degree, but this doesn't mean that I hate cats.  In fact, I think hurting any animal is a terrible thing, but you knew it was going to happen.  In fact, you knew everything that was going to happen before it even entered the script, simply because the title alone is cliche'd, so shame on me for expecting something else.  At least a viewer would have the decency to dislike it highly after being exposed to such a lousy film.  Leighton Meester is the only cast member under 30 that I ever heard of before, and that's only because I admittedly watch Lifetime once in a while.  Minka Kelly's character takes so long to figure out what kind of psycho she's living with you wonder how low of an IQ even a fashion designer has to have to get into THAT college.  When the writing's on the wall, READ it!<br /><br />I am surprised at the appearance of an excellent actress like Francis Fisher in this poor ripoff of Single White Female and Fatal Attraction, but they can have Billy Zane, the king of heavy eyeliner, because he's appallingly bad no matter what movie he's in, so he fits right in with the younger cast.  I have never seen anyone so old playing roles that are a desperate attempt to make him look cool to an audience so far out of his age range.  It's time for him to play daddies and bosses instead of some funky looking enigma, because he can't carry it off any better than the stiff and lifeless Dermott Mulroney can play romantic roles.<br /><br />Full of overused cliche's, a bad script, and predictable from start to finish, this movie is a complete waste of time.  It's not boring, but it does leave you rolling your eyes so much that you resemble Little Orphan Annie all too frequently.  Hell, now that I think about it, you're better off watching Annie.  It's not nearly as insulting to your intelligence.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I'm with everyone else and their disastisfaction with the so called digital copy, but I'm still buying the combo pack because I have a PS3 but others in my house have DVD players. I want the quality of the Blu-ray for me and will let the others borrow the DVD when they want to watch the movie. I just won't utilize the so called digital copy. There was a suggestion from another poster that buying the combo pack won't affect the ultraviolet copy, only installing it will so if you're like me and want both the Blu-ray and DVD, buy the combo and just not install the Ultraviolet copy. The movie industry will get the hint sooner or later and do away with it just like they did away with laser disc's and VHS taped movies.  Now with the movie, it is sad to see this movie franchise come to an end. I'm kinda hoping that sometime in the future, someone comes along and does a movie about how Harry might become the head master at Hogswart's. It did take what, 20 years for Star Wars 1 to come out? This part 2 is definitely one of the best of the bunch. I went and saw it 5 times at the theatre and in todays economy, for me, that would be a year of going to the movies. Can't wait to get this home and watch it again!!!!!
B005G4TJI4|1.0|I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and was disappointed when I got it. It said online that it was a 2-disc and I only got one disc. It wasn't in it's original packaging, and I payed as much for it as I would in a store.
B000ICXQXI|4.0|I found Psycho very interesting and intriguing. It is a film unlike one I have seen to date. I am sure that there is not one scene throughout the film that was thought about in great detail. Hitchcock clearly put every insight into the film. I like how it was shot in black in white which enhances the shadowing throughout the film and adds to the \\"dreamy\\" and mysterious feel of the film. I also liked how the film was shot off centre which is reflected through the main character Norman. The most striking thing I found about the film was when Marion was killed so early in the film, as the viewers are made to believe she will be the main character throughout the duration of the film. I think a lot has to be said for Hitchcock's talent as he made the audience feel part of the film. Great film!
B005NNUKF4|5.0|It's all about the live '74 sweetness to me. Nice upgrade to the bootleg I've been listening to for the last hundred years. Incredible to finally hear that show as it was intended. Now, ahem, boys, how about the same treatment and release of the Paris Theater shows? The mix for the Wembley show is fantastic!I was afraid it would be squashed to death and right up in your face but it's really not too bad. It is a hot mix but it breathes and the dynamics were preserved thank god. Lovin' this for sure and wanting to drop a tab and stroll down memory lane. The only bummer is the omission of the Echoes encore. I should also note that ACYL from the long circulated FM broadcast bootleg differs from this official release. Not sure which version is the historically correct one for that date,  or if there was a second show that day? Dunno but must investigate now...

B002ZG97LK|5.0|This movie is about a guy named Ren Mac Cormack (KennyWormald) who just moved into with his aunt, uncle and cousins in a  really small town called Bomont.  Ren meets Ariel Moore (Julianne Hough) who is the wild girl and reverend's daughter.  Bomont has a law that the residents of residents could not dance or listen to loud music because some seniors, including Reverend Moore's son (Dennis Quaid) and Ariel's brother was killed in an accident along with some other seniors in the class coming home from a dance.  After three years after the tragedy Ren and the other seniors want to have a dance to celebrate the end the year.  This movie is really good. I loved it so much!

030788743X|2.0|Ready Player One is a book with a great concept, but it fell short in its development. The idea of a virtual competition on digital worlds based on nerd culture icons from the 70s and 80s made me get this book (in the audio book version well narrated by Will Wheaton). The book abound in nerd references (many of them obvious for nerds like me that grew up in the 80s) and its really enjoyable to identify and remember the movies, games, lines of nerd culture grails. However, after a while, this gimmick gets a little boring, and one has to focus on the plot and the characters of the book. This is when the books fails to deliver.<br /><br />I really hate protagonists that seem to be \\"bonus players characters\\", specialists in all areas, that know-it-all and have few or none handicaps. As Kvothe in the second part of the second Patrick Rothfuss' Wise Man's Fear, Ready Player One's Wade is extremely obnoxious, bragging his supreme expertise in all areas of \\"nerd-dom\\". He is a professional-expert-level videogame player, he knows all anime, movies, TV series, SF literature, comics that was produced in the late 70s, 80s and 90s,he is an expert a computer programmer,etc..<br /><br />At first, I kind of accepted that as his real life was horrible, living in the slums and being overweight due to his addiction to the Oasis virtual world (although at his young age, it would be impossible to having consumed so much media in such a short time). Still, later in the book, while the plot is still developing, this handicap is completely removed as the loses weigh,  get a lot of money and keep on bragging about his own intelligence, his virtual possession, talking on \\"how cool he is\\", etc. He even turns himself into a real-life secret agent! This irritating pattern prevented me to enjoy the book.<br /><br />Another problem with the narrative is that, as the characters are obsessed with the 80s, due to a virtual competition, their dialogues are full of horrible and cheesy cliches, which also made me cringe. The book gets much better when it describes the real world, but these passages are sparse. Also the overuse of 80s references in the virtual world devolved into a pastiche, and it looks like lazy fan ficion style writing or just the fact that creativity and originality died in the future decribed by the book and people just rehash 70s and 80s visuals and references.<br /><br />I recomend this book just for the ubber 80s nerds just for the fun of the references. In terms of plot and character development, look elsewhere.ets much better when it describes the real world, but these passages are sparse.

B006470HZ6|1.0|I waited a whole week for this? A cool series turned slow boring drama, with the occasional zombie for shock. This show is Walking Dead.
B00646W2XC|5.0|The most interesting development to my mind was well developed in this episode.  This is that Will Gardner may be every bit as bad a choice for romantic interest as Peter Florek proved to be.  Most series tv would have never let Alicia and Will start having an affair.  That's because the creators would be thinking in terms of \\"happy ever after\\" which is synonymous with the \\"the end\\" in series tv. Not so here.  This is a series willing to take risks.<br /><br />We learn, for example, that Will once embezzled from a client's account to cover his gambling debts. Then, in one case against the government, which Alicia is trying with Diane, Alicia is put in a precarious position with the government.  When she consults with Will and Diane about it, her concern grows that they are more interested in protecting the firm than in protecting her.<br /><br />There is a high bit of comedy here too if you have been watching all seasons.  The two most shark like lawyers have been Michael J. Fox's character and Carey's friend who became a house husband. These two make terrific long term husbands and fathers.  Will and Peter are considerably less talented as lawyers and they both make rotten husbands and father material. They can't leave their viciousness and game on the playing field of the courtroom. Alicia is thus a flawed heroine too as she is solely attracted to the wrong men as husbands and father material.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Quentin Tarantino movie, quickly became a classic, not historically accurate, lots of good lines, whether intentionally or not it gave us a quick look into our culture today, which is sort of WWII era German, in that we have a strong sense of pride and that we're better than everyone else. Overall a good funny movie.
B0064IZ32C|4.0|The two women they've added to this show are not doing anything for me.  They've churned through a number of good women characters in this show and maybe the time is up for continuing to try that story arc.  I think it would be better to finish out with the characters we already are used to seeing: House, Taub, Chase, Wilson and now Omar Epps, their old co-doc Eric has taken over Cuddy's job.  I don't need any more characters.<br /><br />Otherwise the episode was pretty good though.  The patient first confesses to an affair with another woman, which is true, but keeps confessing to other misdeeds until it is clear that is part of his disease.  These HOUSE MD diseases are so exotic and the explanations so complex that I'm never really sure what they have by the end of the show, just that it's been truly bizarre.<br /><br />But I'm enjoying have Taub and Chase back.  There were many comedic moments including a betting pool as to whether Taub's two kids are really his. Even Wilson tries to sneak Taub's DNA as he too has joined the pool.

B004RFYEEC|5.0|And sometimes Brian go OVERBOARD....just a wee bit.  In December of 1966, a radio ad announced it was expected that 1 million units would sell of The Beach Boys forthcoming album \\"SMiLE\\" after it's release in Jan. of 1967.  Talk about jumping the gun!  But now here it is, almost 45 years later, as complete as can possibly be.  NOW lets talk about sales.  What can I say about this incredible box set that hasn't already been said?  I mean, it's INCREDIBLE (and I had to clear out an entire dresser drawer just to find a place to store it).  If you're on the fence about whether or not to buy this box set, well, first weigh your options clearly (do you OWN a record player?  Do you want to hear Brian instruct and correct his fellow Beach Boys and studio musicians over and over again to the point where YOU actually get mad at him and yell out, \\"LISTEN I'M TRYING AS HARD AS I CAN, GIMME A BREAK!\\").  If you said yes to both of these then by all means buy this set!  It's by far the most gorgeous box set you'll ever own (how many 3-D box sets do you own anyways....that also weighs about the same as a block of concrete).  And when it comes to giving your money to Mike Love....well....whataya gonna do?  I mean, he WAS/IS a Beach Boy and he WAS one of those voices you're loving on this set.  I could see where there was general concern about this whole project.  I could see the guys telling Brian, \\"Brian this is great and all but where are we GOING with all of this?!\\"  After examining the second disc in the set it's apparent that \\"Heroes And Villains\\" played a role in turning \\"SMiLE\\" into a frown.  Brian just couldn't stop working on that song!  It was started in Oct. of 1966 and Brian was STILL working on it into June of 1967!  (The June '67 sessions were a remake of the song after the project had collapsed).  All the other sessions heard through Discs 3 and 4 seem to come together rather quickly (quick for being as progressive as they were).  And a note for you bootleggers who STILL want to bootleg the album after this release, may I suggest sequencing a track line up utilizing the 12 songs that were listed on the original back cover.  That might be fun.  Maybe THAT would even be closer to what might have been released in '67 than this set that runs for 3 LP sides.  But a 3 sided LP is fine by me because it's the closest reality of \\"SMiLE\\" we can possibly have.  And believe me, this music will really sooth your mind after a hard day at work.  It's concept is loose but it flows better with every play (even better if you're already familiar with the 2004 remake).  For a lark (no actually it was enjoyment now that I think about it), I put on \\"Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, Jones Ltd.\\" by The Monkees and really focused on how lightweight it was in comparison to what Brian was cooking up in the recording studios on the Sunset Strip.  And THAT album shot to No. 1 in the charts, while Brian's masterpiece was confined to the vaults.  Maybe \\"SMiLE\\" just wasn't meant to be released back in 1967.  Maybe it was meant to be NOW.  With all that's going on in the world, I think we could use this album now more than ever.  Brian and Carl prayed over \\"Pet Sounds\\" when they were making it.  God can answer prayer with three replies....yes, no, and wait.  Sometimes God says \\"wait.\\"  But good things come to those that wait, yes?  Thank you Brian for finally releasing this incredible music and thank you fellow Beach Boys for supporting the release.
B006470HZ6|1.0|What started life as a good reasonably paced survival/Zombie series has sadly devolved into a \\"relationships\\" and personal crisis  drama with Zombies as a cover story.  each episode features less and less compelling plots,  she wants to die, he did something bad and oh I am preggers.  endless moral debate that borders on inane.  \\"gun control\\"  dragged into world where zombies are eating people alive, really?   There would be no question of ever not carrying your gun.   each week after another  the Walking Dead goes further down the path of a thinly disguised  personal drama about relationships, feeling and such like, then scattered through the 45 mins are a few token zombies.  The show has been watered down so far I cant tell if its coffee or tea.

B005L38QHA|4.0|Let me start off by stating that I'm not a World of Warcraft player but my other half is.  That being said our old mouse was dying a slow death and a replacement was in dire need.  So when I saw this mouse on Amazon Vine it was a no brainer selection for a review.  Here are my thoughts on the World of Warcraft Legendary MMO Gaming Mouse;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Ergonomic and solidly built even though it's all plastic.<br /><br />+ Plenty of extra buttons all of which are easy to access.<br /><br />+ Scroll wheel is rubberized for an easy grip.<br /><br />+ Nice box/packaging.<br /><br />+ Can change the color and brightness of the Warcraft window light or even set it to pulse if you wish.<br /><br />+ Easy set-up with the ability to create mouse profiles to tailor your play-style.<br /><br />+ Officially licensed World of Warcraft product.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Rather pricey.<br /><br />- Mouse heats up a bit from the display lights which cause your hands to sweat.  Never good thing when gaming.<br /><br />- Only the light color of the Warcraft centerpiece can be changed, not the radiating lightning pattern on the mouse.<br /><br />- Lightning pattern of mouse reminds of a bad 80's metal cover.  Metallica's \\"Ride the Lightning\\" album comes to mind.<br /><br />Overall a nice Warcraft licensed mouse but as another reviewer stated it's not really the same caliber as the WoW Cataclysm Edition mouse.  Die-hard World of Warcraft fans are sure to enjoy this mouse if they can stomach the asking price.  But chances are if they're willing to shell out $100 for the Cataclysm version then $80 may not seem like that much.  Not being a World of Warcraft player I wouldn't spend the cash on it, however it's still a very nice mouse despite a few cons.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|What a tragedy that Tim Ripper Owens left Iced Earth after producing this album with them. Iced Earth with Ripper produced what is easily one of the greatest heavy metal albums ever made. This way surpasses \\"The Glorious Burden\\" (the first album with Owens and Iced Earth) and everything that Owens and Iced Earth have produced separate from one another. \\"The Clouding,\\" in particular, is a masterpiece. History will judge this album as a classic.
B005RAQRQO|2.0|Been a fan of Mayer since I heard his first single.  His newest effort on Universal has some strong points.  Killer collabo with Snoop Dogg. But upon multiple listens, the album loses me around the halfway point. And some of the \\"soul\\" sounds a little forced. Its missing the warmth that his Stones Throw release had.  I also am not sure why \\"No Strings\\" is an album closer. The version produced by Clasixx is far superior. This one fails in comparison and is skippable after hearing the Clasixx version
0812550706|5.0|I can't really explain how much I enjoyed this book.  I like the characters, I love the plot, and adore the universe that Card has created.  But most of all I identify with Ender and his classmates.  I have spoken to a number of people about it, and it seems to me that you either identify with Ender and the other kids or you don't.  Most people who can identify seem to enjoy the book.    The title character is is what so many of us longed to be as children.  Intelligent, powerful, commanding of fear and respect.  And he has all these things as a child.  But, like most extraordinary children, he is alone and isolated from everyone, even his family.    This story rings true to us because we know Ender, we have seen pieces of him in ourselves and others.  The book also echos what we know about society, about how we react to a threat, especially a threat we don't fully understand.  I see parallels in the way America came together after September 11, 2001 and the way that Card's earth united to form the International Fleet.    I also see how young children can quickly pick up the gist of a video game, learn the strategies that it's AI uses, and master it in just a few hours.  With the rise of UAV's and robotic equipment on the battlefields of today I wonder how long it will be until train child soldiers to man them.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I upgraded from an AMD Athlon II X2 ~2.9GHz processor (forgot the model).  GTA IV has been working amazingly fast, and my computer's response times are out of this world.  With video converters, it has been working awesome.  I used to have had to leave my PC alone while it converted videos as my whole PC slowed down tremendously, but with this processor, I have the video converting on highest priority without compromising my other applications speed.  I highly recommend this processor, as it's a great upgrade with an awesome price tag.
0812550757|5.0|Ender's Game moved me.  It touched me personally because I identified with the child characters.  This book also touches me, because I can identify with the adult characters.  But not, as I expected, Ender.  Ender has become a wise teacher.  We still see in him the isolation and social inexperience we first identified in Ender's game, but he has almost transcended the human condition now, becoming somehow mystic in his relationship to those around him.    But now I can identify with Valentine, and with several of the researchers on  Lusitania.  I can see the cruelty of society in both the way that the rest of the colonies treat Lusitania, and the way the Lusitanians treat their own.  I think this is important to the story, to help the reader understand that these future colonists are just like us.    In a way I was surprised that I liked this book as much as I did.  It doesn't have a lot of the elements that I tend to enjoy in a sci-fi story.  But there are many mysteries.  Some are revealed, others yield only more questions.  If you decide to read this book, you should know that the story of Lusitania and all of it's inhabitants is not really finished at the end of the book.  It continues into Xenocide and Children of the Mind.    Only after reading all these did I feel like I had finished the tale.  That is the worst thing I can think of to say about this book, it just didn't leave me with a satisfactory ending they way Ender's game did.  But I did enjoy it very much, enough to continue on and read the next two books.
B001GSV3EC|4.0|Ok, here's the deal.  I downloaded an mp3 of \\"A Day in the Life\\", the Beatles song that Jeff Beck covered.  Just BLEW me away!  So I get this live album that the song was on.  I've found that several tracks I like a lot, but the whole thing is NOT up to the standard of \\"A Day in the Life\\".  But, I do like listening to it.  so, 4 of 5.

0812550706|5.0|My 13-year old son recently read this for his 8th grade class, and as a result I finally read it as well.  I'm glad I did.  The ending of this book is so powerful that I was moved to tears (a few, not a waterfall), and felt emotionally choked up, something which books rarely do to me.  The journey of 6 year old Ender Wiggin up to his 13th birthday and beyond is told beautifully with lots of action, emotional impact, and memorable scenes.<br /><br />We will be purchasing the boxed set to continue our reading into Ender's World.
B005I64U5C|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie in 3D. I like all the movies taken from comic books and the action they provide. This was a pre-order item and I was very impressed with Amazon and how they do business.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This was the first Dylan I bought/listened to since his music of the 60's. His sound is completely different but I like it just as much. His voice is real scratchy and raw. But lets face it....Dylan was never know as a great singer. I love this CD. It is so different from not just his music but others as well. Plus every song is long. Thunder on the Mountain is a foot-stomping song. I could see it being used for line dancing - not that I would know since I have never done that or seen it. Each song is a story. he Levee's Gonna Break, Spirit on the Water, Rollin and Tumblin are all great. Every song is great. This CD reminds me of a group who is still hungry trying to make it big and does a knockout performance. Dylan is like a Van Gogh of music. He may not have the best voice play the best instrument but what he puts on a recording strings a chord with the listener. It is how he \\"sees\\" the music that makes him great.
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|I had seen this movie before but not in 3D. It was nice to see it again especially in 3D and viewing it brought back fond memories. I would recommend, for those of you with 3D capability, to watch this movie in 3D. I think you will enjoy it.

B005FNGAD8|5.0|Billy Joel had a long career in music before his first commercial break with this 1973 album and its title hit single. He'd played piano as a studio sideman and recorded with several rock groups, including the Hassles and Attila, before settling into the singer-songwriter style that began with 1971's [[ASIN:B0012GMX6K Cold Spring Harbor]]. With his solo debut having stiffed commercially, and label problems keeping him from recording a follow-up, he relocated to Los Angeles where he spent six months playing as a lounge pianist, writing new material a eventually returning to touring. Signing with Columbia, he released this sophomore album in November and cracked the Top 40 by the following Spring - more than five months after the records were released. The single rose to #25, but it would be three more years until Joel achieved massive acclaim with 1977's [[ASIN:B00000DCHC The Stranger]].<br /><br />The introspection of Cold Spring Harbor was mostly replaced on his second album with lightly- and wholly-fictional character sketches. The album's love song, \\"You're My Home\\" (written as a Valentine's Day gift for Joel's first wife) is also its most personal, though the title song is clearly drawn from Joel's tenure as a lounge singer. Narratives of travel and distance, as well as the line \\"too many people got a hold of me\\" (from \\"Worse Comes to Worst\\"), speak to the touring and travail of his early solo years. The album's sound was heavily influenced by California's early-70s canyon-country scene, mixing West Coast twang with Joel's East Coast bravura. The epic \\"Captain Jack\\" turned out to be the cure for that early turmoil, as a live recording from a 1972 radio broadcast became the turntable hit that sparked Columbia Records' interest.<br /><br />The Legacy edition of Piano Man augments a remastered edition of the original album on disc one with a newly commissioned mix (from the 16-track master) of the 1972 radio concert that yielded the pivotal live recording. Recorded live in April, 1972 at Sigma Sound Studios, the concert was broadcast on Philadelphia's WMMR-FM. The audience was made up primarily of contest winners and the set list included six songs from Cold Spring Harbor, three that would be recorded later in the year for Piano Man, and three rarities from Joel's early songwriting catalog (\\"Long, Long Time,\\" \\"Josephine\\" and \\"Rosalinda\\"). Joel is commanding at both his piano and microphone throughout the show, and his road band is soulful and razor sharp; together they deliver performances with more musical life than the studio versions of Joel's first two albums.<br /><br />As Jonathan Takiff point out, Joel captivated a Philadelphia audience who knew relatively little about him, getting them to respond to songs they were hearing for the first time, rather than hits they'd come to hear. Joel showed himself to be a formidable singer-songwriter and a magnetic showman whose patter (including an impromptu station ID) keeps both the studio and radio audiences hooked. Those with bootleg version of the concert will find a few changes have been made, most notably drummer Rhys Clark's flub on \\"Captain Jack\\" has been excised. Those weaned on the original tape may take exception, but most listeners won't notice. The two-disc set is housed in a tri-fold digipack with a 24-page booklet filled with detailed liner notes and photos. The original single edit of \\"Piano Man\\" would have made a nice bonus, but that's a nit; fans who didn't have the opportunity to see Joel perform in the early `70s owe it to themselves to hear this seminal 1972 concert.

B000000WJK|5.0|Suddenly, I came to realize, only moments after listening to this cut for the first time, that while it deserved to become one of 1993's most universally recognizable \\"modern rock\\" tracks, \\"Already There\\", the third song from (The) Verve's  groundbreaking debut release, would probably not even receive airplay on our local, corporately owned \\"alternative\\" station, precisely because it sounded nothing like the bland, steady diet of one-off hits by Blind Melon and The Lemonheads that were being force-fed in heavy rotation to anyone dialing in their knob to the call sign.<br /><br />\\"A Storm In Heaven\\" is easily my favorite of all of (The) Verve's releases, and in a fair and just world, \\"Already There\\" should have garnered as much attention as \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" did several years later. Typical instruments universally associated with conventionally arranged rock songs are all present on the track, but are used to create more of a mood than a song that presents with a straightforward progression. A heavily resonant bassline, tom-tom driven percussion, and soft washes of delayed, reverbed guitar give \\"Already There\\" an organic flow without necessarily giving it a forward direction; the track builds toward explosive crescendos only to revert to a more quiescent dynamic, occurring somewhat frequently during the last half of this track. Richard Ashcroft's seductive crooning soars and dips with the peaks and valleys of the song.  It could almost be called shoegazing, if guitarist Nick McCabe were burying everything under layers of heavy distortion, reverse reverb, and sculpted feedback on every single song. While he is capable of creating a wall of sound, he more often opts for soft, clean, fluid tones that wash over the lockstep groove created by the percussive flourishes of drummer Pete Salisbury and Simon Jones's elastic, percolative basslines.<br /><br />Together,  the first, second, and fourth tracks ( \\"Star Sail\\" , \\"Slide Away\\" , and \\"Beautiful Mind\\") are just as successful at following this blueprint, with \\"Star Sail\\" and \\"Slide Away\\" each  building to a peak of sustained explosive release before retreating into a mellower valley where the swell  of  the guitar is replaced by the fluid chiming of delayed, echo-laden, reverb-bathed  wash of gliding notes, with \\"Beautiful Mind\\" mining the quiescent element, though McCabe imbues the track with expansive, infinite tonal shading. Taken as a whole, these first four cuts present the strongest, most cohesive opening that I was to hear from any band releasing material in the `90's, and (for me) outside of Van Halen's self-titled debut and Led Zeppelin's \\"II\\" from my childhood, perhaps the smoothest ever.<br /><br />And if I were coming to \\"A Storm In Heaven\\" from (The) Verve's later releases, I'd want to know that there is a qualitative difference between the first four tracks and the last six. \\"Make It `Til Monday\\" is the only track in the latter grouping to hearken back to the ones in the former, but with a powerfully ruminative, down-tempo energy to it. \\" The Sea, The Sky\\", \\"Blue\\", and \\"Butterfly\\" are all cuts with a kind of a raw, chunky, aggressively unfolding potency to both the groove from the rhythm section and the texture of McCabe's guitar work. These are energetic tracks and taken separately they bear repeated listening, but don't gel with the same fluid, psychedelic consistency the first four tracks do. \\"A Storm In Heaven\\" is worth snatching up just for the first four tracks alone, but every song was clearly labored over with much love, detail, and attention. If you've never heard (The) Verve before, this is an ideal entry point, and in my opinion eclipses \\"A Northern Soul\\", Urban Hymns\\", and \\"Forth\\".ccessful at following this blueprint, with \\"Star Sail\\" and \\"Slide Away\\" each  building to a peak of sustained explosive release before retreating into a mellower valley where the swell  of  the guitar is replaced by the fluid chiming of delayed, echo-laden, reverb-bathed  wash of gliding notes, with \\"Beautiful Mind\\" mining the quiescent element, though McCabe imbues the track with expansive, infinite tonal shading.

B005CMSDLE|4.0|This was a truly unique movie, and the young star, Saoirse Ronan, puts in an exceptional performance that will hopefully lead to much more to come for her. She is gorgeous and ethereal on screen, with a face that subtly displays every emotion, without overacting. It's hard to say too much about the plot of this movie without spoiling it, so I won't, but basically Eric Bana plays her father, and the movie starts with them in a remote, frozen tundra where he is training her as an assassin or warrior of some type, although we don't really know why. Cate Blanchett also stars, as an intelligence officer somehow embroiled in what is going. The movie is an action adventure, but the pacing, filming, music, and soulfulness are more indie than blockbuster, and the entire thing really hinges on the performance of Saoirse Ronan, who more than pulls it off.<br /><br />I was engaged all the way through, but my husband found it a bit slow and dull in parts. I was OK with the pacing - I appreciated the more nuanced character development, which you don't usually see in action films - but I did think the ending lacked a bit. While I welcome the attempt to not simply tie everything up in a neat little bow, in this case a little too much was left unexplained, IMHO. So that's the only reason I give it 4, rather than 5, stars. But definitely worth seeing.
B001AEF6CW|5.0|Great movie. Great set!<br /><br />Grab yourself a caucasian, light a J and enjoy this awesome film.<br /><br />I can honestly say this is one of my favorite films of all time, and everyone should give it a shot.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I ordered this set of \\"Married With Children\\" DVD's for my husband as a birthday gift and he totally loves it! We watch them every night before going to bed. It arrived earlier than expected and was in great condition! Had no problems with the seller and would order from them, again! If you like this t.v. series then, this is for you!
B005SZAEYO|5.0|From what I can tell from the first episode, this series has taken cues from many of the earlier horror stories during the late seventies, early eighties. It is very well made and the all-star cast does a marvelous job. I plan on adding this to my DVR.....
086571701X|5.0|This is emphatically not just another \\"here's how I made my backyard aquaponics setup\\". Rather it's a good collection of the wisdom of this nascent pursuit. It's pretty evenly balanced between initial considerations, start up and maintenance, and is very easy to read and digest. Despite the fact that the author has her own aquaponics websites and products, she frequently refers to other websites and forums and never really tries to push her own brand of products.  There are plenty of forums, blogs and videos online to learn how to construct a basic small scale aquaponics system. Bernstein does a good job of over viewing the basics for this, but I believe most readers would want to seek outside info to augment what she describes. Fortunately she provides links to the most popular and successful sites.   Where this book shines is that it goes into detail of what she calls the software of aquaponics. These are the fish, the plants, the worms and the bacteria. I instantly relate to her description of aquaponics farmers as bacteria farmers. I know all too well that growing ruminants, one is primarily a grass farmer. And that growing a conventional garden or using a greenhouse, one is primarily a worm farmer and a compost engineer. So, it makes perfect sense to me that in aquaponics one is primarily a bacteria farmer since it's the crucial bacteria that perform the necessary ammonia to nitrite, nitrite to nitrate conversions. I also really appreciate her detail about such topics as cycling the system and what to do in times of chemical imbalance crisis.   This book has given me the confidence to try small scale aquaponics with an eye towards eventually doing it on a much grander scale without feeling like I might just be killing fish in a barrel. It is true that much of what's in the book could eventually be found online in various forums, but I feel like this compilation of info in such an accessible format saves months of looking. If you are thinking of getting into aquaponics, or if you already have but aren't quite sure what it means when your system seems out of balance, this book is for you.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I saw the live feed of Phantom in Lowell, Massachusetts, USA. Loved every minute of it. Ramin and Sierra are brilliant!!!  When Sierra sang \\"Wishing you were here again\\" it was a show stopper! You know when you see a production of this caliber and experience a moment like this, it is a  magic, unforgettable one. I can't wait to own the DVD to be able to watch it over again. It was a treat to see and hear Anthony Warlow! Wish his Dr.Zhivago (the musical) score had a CD and DVD.

Artist need to know, hearing a cd for the first time is a make or break, this order of song is BAD.....Hear is how it sounds great...1 Shake it down, 2 Breaking Down 3 What the water gave me 4 Only if for a night 5 Lover to Lover 6 No no light 7 Spectrum 8Leave my body 9 Never let me go 10 All this and Heaven too. Put these song is this order, Like I said, more song do not make a great cd......DO you hear me flo....try it...enjoy it. I love this cd.

There's no disputing the album's musical content, but this version of it was poorly packaged. My rating is so harsh because EMI should have known better after so many years as a publisher of music.

0345495004|5.0|Loving Frank by Nancy Horan (Ballentine Books) is an exquisitely written novel based on the world-renown architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Mamah Borthwick Cheney.<br /><br />In 1903 Mamah and her husband, Edwin, commission the locally famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, to design a house for them. Mamah and Edwin become friends with Frank and his wife, Catherine.<br /><br />During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction develops between Frank and Mamah, a force so powerful they leave their spouses and children to live clandestine lives. They travel to Europe and Japan, following Frank's quest for international architectural supremacy. Along the way, highly educated Mamah finds her intellectual fulfillment when she meets the Swedish feminist, Ellen Key and is commissioned to translate Key's books and essays. When the truth about Frank and Mamah is exposed, their affair shocks Chicago society and brings shame and grief to their families.<br /><br />Loving Frank is much more than a love story. It reaches into the possibility of freedom for woman and the cost and consequences of realizing those freedoms. Horan provides insights into the ambitions and quirks of Wright, an eccentric genius.<br /><br />Loving Frank is a well-researched story of great passion, compassion, and timeless truth, an unforgettable historical novel.

0743298039|4.0|A woman is chosen, seemingly at random, to write the biography for England's most cherished and most mysterious author. Margaret comes to live with the secretive Vida Winter to chronicle the series of unlikely and hard-to-believe situations that shaped her into the woman and the prolific storyteller that she became. She hears tales of twins, ghosts, love affairs, missing parents and more. The journey on which Ms. Winter takes Margaret is heart-breaking and wondrous. They are secrets that the world is waiting with bated breath to hear, but secrets that might need to be kept.  This is a bizarre little book, but one I really enjoyed. I found the plot to be very creative and unlike anything I've read before. I am always glad to read something so different. Some of the events described were surprisingly aggressive, which I'm not used to, but I was able to adapt. The one thing that I cannot deny was the power in Diane Setterfield's writing; it was awesome. She wrote poetically and emotionally and that is how I adapted to the stories told; good writing can transform just about anything into something worth reading about.  Admittedly, it took me a very long time to get around to reading this book. I tell myself that I do that to distance myself from the recommendations I receive so my expectations aren't too high, but sometimes the plot just sounds so droll. I do not want to raise your expectations to a level where they cannot be met by this book, but I enjoyed it and I hope you do too.
B005QF0GIK|5.0|This CD reminds me of her Bitter record, although this is more stripped down without the orchestration. The new production suits Meshell's somber mood on love and politics. I like it. She continues to move forward progressively as a soul artist. I suspect she may recieve another grammy nod for this one.

B000LC4TJ0|4.0|If you like your Figaros in the tradition of sunny and funny--a kind of age of enlightenment sitcom--run don't walk away from this DVD. You will not like the way they messed with your beloved opera and will be inspired to write a review of outrage right here in this very spot. But if you don't mind being challenged, Harnoncourt's Figaro is definitely worth your while. My first reaction was: \\"What the?!\\" There's silent character not written by Da Ponte, Cherubim (Cupid perhaps?), who invisibly yet literally pulls, pushes and manipulates the characters through a feverish, hellacious day in thrall of love. I disliked him at the outset, but he proved to create an apt kind of symbolism for this opera. (It's a delightful moment when he encounters Don Basilio and literally bounces off of him. The man is love-proof.) After a while I entered into the spirit of this production and came to respect and admire it. I mean, when you think about it, Figaro has darkness at its heart. Sexual abuse. Betrayal. Duplicity. Class warfare. Child abduction. Absolutely nobody is happy, except momentarily. Even at the end of the opera, do you really believe the Count will stay true to the Countess? Pull the other one. (He's an oligarch, and oligarchs--as we know well these days--leave destruction in their wakes.) One aspect of this production that I can remember encountering only once before--in Otto Klemperer's unique EMI recording of the late 60s--is its powerful subtext of revolution. When Beaumarchais's play premiered, it was a thunder stroke. The servants smarter than the masters? No great European piece of art had ever dared say such a thing. Harnoncourt's rendition has that quality in spades, and I deeply admire it for that reason. The slow tempos are one of the things that give it that kind of social and human gravity. There are plenty of laugh lines, of course, but this is serious stuff. I certainly wouldn't want to be without lighter, more traditional Figaros. But--as with Shakespeare--there's plenty of room for contrary approaches. And no other Figaros that I'm aware of have been as contrary as this one. P.S. from 4-13-13: A friend very kindly gave me a copy of the DVD and I just want to note that if you're watching on a nice LCD or plasma screen (as I am), you may want to hold out for the Blu Ray. The DVD is not very well mastered, especially considering that the opera is spread over 2 disks. A well mastered DVD will look awfully close to the sharpness of a Blu Ray, upscaled on a Blu Ray machine; but this doesn't--there are jaggies, artifacts, and lack of sharpness.re--there's plenty of room for contrary approaches.

B001GQSY5K|4.0|I bought this because my kids are really into Star Wars (8 and 6 years old) and hungry for more. They are watching pieces of the animated series episodes, but I thought this move can be a good starter. I didn't watch this movie myself and therefore can't review the content, but my kids said it's good (but not showing the crazy enthusiasm).  But they ended up watching 3 times in one week and I'm sure will watch more. The bottom line is the movie is \\"re-watchable\\" and therefore justifies my purchase at $10 price tag.

Yes, she had issues and I can see why she acted the way she did but jeeze come on! This book also reminded me of another book, yet I cant quite pinpoint it.  Maybe it's just like all other love stories, but regardless this is a great book.  Makes me want a guy to treat me like that! I'm missing out. Def worth the 4.99.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|I loved it! Very dark, unique and original. Metallica always had a way of being unpredictable, Lou Reed has always been the same as well, and this is no different.

B005AUWXZ0|5.0|It seems that I never get tired of watching great computer-generated animation - Pixar style, that is. And I would venture to say that most everybody feels the same way. The colors and attention to detail are just amazing. It is more amazing, though, if the story is about cars, with no human-like characters involved. Yet, Disney does it again with the precious and delicious \\"Cars 2.\\"  In this marvelous follow-up of the original, we again meet some of the main fellows (cars, trucks, etc) that we learned to love on the first installment of the franchise. This time, the story begins with Finn McMissile, a British secret agent on a mission on an oil platform at the high seas. He is trying to uncover a sinister plot by the bad guys. We are then taken to colorful Radiator Springs, home of our hero, Lighting McQueen and friends. He is taking a break from the racing circuit. Unfortunately for him, he is forced - thanks to an indiscretion of his buddy Mater -- to accept a challenge from Francesco, an Italian competitor. This adventure takes him to Japan, to the World Grand Prix. Lighting McQueen takes his pals to the trip, including Mater, his best friend. However, Mater involuntarily and mistakenly gets involved in the plot being investigated by Finn McMissile, ultimately affecting McQueen's opportunities at the race. This mishap will test their friendship, and in doing so, they also travel to France, Italy and England. Of course, like in any James Bond - type of espionage movies, there is plenty of action and a love interest, this time provided by secret agent Holley Shiftwell.  \\"Cars 2\\" is fun from beginning to end, and the attention to detail, as I mentioned before, is just astonishing. All the European cities look just like postcards and it seems that the location coordinator did a fantastic job. Of course, being Japan and France important markets for Disney, it never hurts to do some free publicity for all parts involved. As always, can't wait for the next one! The Blu-ray + DVD includes director's commentary, \\"Cars Toon: Air Mater,\\" and more. Released November 4. 2011. (USA, 2011, color, 106 mins plus additional materials). Reviewed on November 7, 2011, exclusively by Eric Gonzalez for Disney Pixar Blu-ray.

0345495004|2.0|This seems to me a plain justification for a woman who left her family for a lover. So little is known about her persona that the author presents a character full of qualities so we could at some point respect her decision. We are introduced to smart and liberal, feminist down to earth woman who married late by choice. All these attributes seldom seen in those times, the the early 1900's.  She appears as a career woman and in reality she didn't achieve much. Frank Lloyd Wright is also presented as very loving, when geniuses of his kind are self centered, unorganized and distant, though he indeed appear to have more faults than she. Probably because much more is known about him so it must be said. His biography proves it that way.  It is hard to enjoy a book based on actual facts  where the very essence feels so far from the real  scenario. A more complex and faulted personality would  fit more into the Frank Lloyd Wright world. Someone who will put up on being the forbidden, with the scandal and with him. An obsessive person. A groupie of these days...And that would have been more interesting!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I expected much and more from this book, but I was disappointed at every chapter. Was seriously mad that the stories do not lead to anything or anywhere, I expected something majestic to happen, yet it never did. Major sink, and disappointment.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|i really injoy this movie...i think this movie was much better then tim burtens verion.i give this movie 5 stars
B005IZLPMY|5.0|well the action sequences are great. the sci-fi is awesome. the acting is is just imposing. i love this movie, thanks amazon.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|I was pleasently surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.  It was entertaining and this may be the best acting I've seen Chris Evans do.  Stanley Tucci gave his customary high standard performance.  Dominic Cooper was enaging as he Howard Hughes'est Howard Stark.  Hayley Atwell was forgettable.
0875428940|4.0|Having just finished a review of a Tarot book, I got suggestions for other things I might review. Now this is really rather behind the times, since (I just went and looked!) I purchased my deck & book from Robin herself and a SF & F con in the Twin Cities in 1998! So I might also have titled the review Better Late than Never too. It's a great deck, (though I never use it, but more on that in a moment) in fact I think of it as possibly the best crossover RWS deck out there. I mean crossover Pagan/Christian. In its own way it is even better than the overtly Pagan Sacred Circle deck. At least for me personally, I find a comfort in working with decks that remain in the basic construct of RWS, it just helps me keep visual associations accessible, and feel that my intuition is not being strained trying to find meaning for a querant from a deck with a hugely different symbol structure.   O.K. so while I've been typing I have also been questioning just why I don't use this deck more!  I can only conclude that it has to do with me encountering another RWS derived deck, the Hanson-Roberts, first. HR is not Pagan per se, but is I do believe touched with a sort of fey magic all it's own. Anyway now that I'm thinking about the Robin Woods deck again, it may just have to make it's way out to be easy to reach for the next reading!

0451450523|5.0|You can read this review at [...]<br /><br />I picked up this book because I had been seeing it on fantasy book lists in some very high company. People were grouping it with The Lord of the Rings and Narnia as a great fantasy classic (since Unicorn was published in the 60s). I had previously avoided this book because of the cover (and title), truthfully. \\"The Last Unicorn\\" just sounded like fluffy, PBS, G-rated garbage. But the old adage is right: don't evaluate a book by its art and/or title.<br /><br />The story is about--surprise!--the last unicorn in the world who goes on a search for the rest of her kind. Along with Schmendrick the Magician, she makes her way through the strange, fairy tale world, all the way to the mysterious lands of the King Haggard, who has risen to command behind the power of the evil Red Bull.<br /><br />While it sounds composed of generic clich&eacute;s, there is not a single clich&eacute; element in the story. If there is a familiar concept in this book, the author has either turned it on its head (often hilariously (Beagle has a great sense of humor)), or he's poking at it in subtle satire. He doesn't reinvent, but he subverts or improves. He writes about unicorns, wizards, heroic princes, and castles, yet in a way that is fresh, fun, and interesting--a remarkable feat.<br /><br />The Last Unicorn gave me my first experience of reading a simile and saying, \\"Holy s***.\\" And it happened over and over again. Beagle's prose is unlike anything I've come across before. His language alone is truly magical, lyrical, beautiful. Each sentence was a true pleasure to read, and that's more than I can say for the vast majority of young adult literature. It's the prose more than anything that drives the book. It's the phrasing as much as the description that makes Beagle's world come to life as wonderfully as it does.<br /><br />The beauty and wonder emanating from every page seem to me to be the real point of the book. At the end of the day, it is a classical fairy tale, and like fairy tales it is interested in the beauty and wonder of the world around us. It doesn't spend much time--like most contemporary YA--fleshing out character, or puzzling complex, suspenseful plots. That said, there is still exciting action, and humor fit for young and old readers. The story is still engrossing, and the characters are lovable (if somewhat flat). Most importantly, it evokes emotion. The ending has that strange, bittersweet sadness that, in my opinion, separates good and great fantasy.<br /><br />This book lives up to every bit of its hype. Not only is it great, but it's great in ways that don't exist in books being written today, and this makes it a real treat. It's a perfect read for all ages, containing enough true fairy tale for children and enough satire for even a cynical adult. It's funny, exciting, and moving, and what more can you want from a book?

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Probably the best animated film this decade. Up is one of those films that makes you look at yourself, at all the promises you made to yourself that one day, that magical day, when you have enough money, when you win the lottery, when you get a break in your schedule, you're going to take that trip, treat yourself out to that nice dinner you deserve, do that thing you've always planned from the time you were bold enough to dream. Once upon a time you were a cub scout, the world was a magical place awaiting exploration. Then one day you woke up, looked in the mirror, opened your front door, and realized that you were old and all you have left are memories and old pictures of the way you used to look when you were young.<br /><br />This is the perfect family movie. I say this because usually when you hear the words \\"family film\\" it's usually a film that is very basic, basic and safe enough to take your kid to see. Rarely do you see a film that is basic enough for a kid to get into yet sophisticated enough for an adult to relate with on a level that a child who hasn't been through life's changes cannot possibly understand. Up is that type of film, about an old man holding on to the past, to an old dream, resisting the changes occurring around him. Ed Asner of Mary Tyler Moore fame plays the gruff irascible Mr. Henrick who, along with a stowaway scout named Russel set out for South America's Paradise Falls by way of a cloud of colorful balloons anchored to an old house full of old dreams.<br /><br />The animation in this movie is very colorful, vibrant, realistic, and reminds me a lot of Hayao Miyazaki's films in this respect. In fact, the characterizations in this film, particularly the part played by Asner, the main character, is downright scary at times, seems like a live action movie, not because the animation's all that, but because the emotions and humanity are so damn real and don't seem forced. This, along with another one of my favorites, Wall-E, shows why America stands heads and shoulders above everybody in this medium. Sorry went on so long but there aren't enough superlatives to say how fantastic and beautiful this film is. A true work of art, art that you can feel as well as see.d shoulders above everybody in this medium.

1423140591|5.0|My son started with this series and can't put it down.  He almost has my daughter (my non-reader) convinced she wants to read it.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|As a life-long Beatles fan who had the privilege of growing up in the 70's, my dad played his original mono/ stereo lp's, so I remember hearing them vividly!  Was a resigned (but placated) fan who did like the stereo re-issues, but always craved the mono versions I remembered from childhood...the annoying right/ left speaker mix which muddled leads & voices, having to constantly tweak the balance w/ every song- the lousy over-dubbed multi-tracked voices(and harmonies that sounded a bit off), etc.  So when I had the bread to spend, and the choice to make, what was my knee-jerk reaction? you got it!! while I have no expertise in the engineering field, I can honestly say I really love how the continuity flows so prrfectly in the tracks, & how solos, harmonies don't sound separate, or off by fractions of a nano-second...and I LOVE the version of \\"paperback writer\\" with its phaser-type effect! The MMT & Rubber Soul versions have the most incredible continuity & sound that I believe these are the only versions that should be available! This was by far the best CD investment I've ever made...and I HIGHLY recommend to anyone who wants that crisp LP sound but who just aren't used to it...and the ethereal sound of the GREATEST BAND E V E R :) Will complete the collection with Abbey Road, Yellow Submarine & Let it be *sigh*, which are only available in stereo...
B0055SWM08|5.0|Just as I said,  addicting yet calming.  It feels like a comfy chairs on a rainy day.  Could play for hours.
B003XJDT1W|4.0|The cd was fine. I was a little disappointed that it wasn't in a plastic case. But it was fine.
0385535139|4.0|See story lines above.<br />I have never been on the John Grisham band wagon as far as him being one of the best legal thriller writers. He's good at best. I have read almost all his thrillers because they were always satisfying and a good way to spend some free time. This time around I think he's come out with something just a little different and more light-hearted. And I really liked it. The characters and the plotting all brought it together well.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|It took Season 5 just a little while to really get going, but the second half was great.  It was really cool to get a closer look into the lives of the Dharma Initiative, and the I loved how they wrapped this season up.  When I saw the finale I was so amped for the final season.  If you made it through seasons 1-4, then you are going to thoroughly enjoy Season 5.  Behind 1 and 2, this may be my favorite season.
B006470HZ6|5.0|Episode 204, Cherokee Rose shed a lot of light on the characters. This episode took the time to reveal humanity in a world that so desperately lacks it. We see little action here in this episode as it focuses on the relationships between them. A few are surprisingly emotional and viewers will be able to easily relate.<br /><br />I wont add spoilers, but this episode is one that reveals many things that will last throughout the series. Good job to the writers!
B0018CWEYY|4.0|This is the only season of Lost that I am giving four stars instead of five.  It is another awesome season overall, and you can't watch the other seasons without watching this one, but I just wasn't as impressed with Season 4 as I was with the rest of the series.  There are many great moments, however, and the finale is really good.  Season 4 is a different experience compared to the older seasons, but that doesn't make it bad at all.  As with the other seasons, I strongly recommend.
0307279189|5.0|A great review providing many details and personal facts about a groupe of weirdos who are livingn for the run like few of us can. Their quest is to find the ulitmate a challenge or the ancient techique for running their ultramarathons that would remove the risk of indjury. They reach out to every remote and isolated people in tracherous cannions in Mexico for the sake of re-discorvering an ancestral way to run. Why homo sapies are built this way and what hunting race had to do with that? THe book reads so nicely and quicly, the rhtym is very energic, it talks about situations, facts, theories, near death experiences and above all about love, social interactions and community. You will literally love it. I read it with continous passion from first to last page, at any moment day and night and can still fill le learning and the ambiance floating around me since i finished it. What a fantastic book! You must read that if you are even just a little interested in running, like me! Just read it! You will see!
B000FIMG68|5.0|Season 1 is the best, in my opinion, but Season 2 comes really close.  Almost every episode has some kind of awesome twist, and it keeps your attention all the way through.  If you watched Season 1 and for some reason didn't like it (not likely), give Season 2 a chance before you decide to quit the series all together.
0062101897|5.0|This book is so detailed and provides such great information you would never have knew about the films. I really enjoyed this book so much and I would recommend it to all avid Potter fans!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I will be honest, I was not crazy about the first few episodes in this season, and I didn't really know how to feel about the finale, but after it had some time to sink in I realized that the series had been wrapped up perfectly.  There really was no other way that they could have done it better, and when I watched this season through for the second time I enjoyed it so much more.  A fitting end to the greatest series of all time.  I teared up at the end.  I loved seeing how it all ended, but I hated seeing it end.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|turned my whole family on to adele!!! this is the first CD i have bought in years and i love every song!!1 i have prob listened to it over 100 times!! its in constant repeat in my car!!!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This Season of Lost is very different than the other seasons, in my opinion.  We finally get a look into the lives of the Others, and things really begin to take a different turn.  By the end of this season everything is set up perfectly for the second half of the series, and the season ends with one of my all-time favorite Lost moments.  You just have to watch it in order to appreciate its awesomeness.  The greatest series ever delivers again with Season 3.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I used to watch this movie as a kid, it was my absolute favorite. I had to stop watching the vhs several years ago because it just wore out. Now I am pleased that Disney put it onto dvd/bluray to enjoy even more and watch my kids get to love this movie just as much
B005WQ4GHA|5.0|Refreshing to have a current Hollywood movie that is NOT action, horror or super cute.  I am really tired of folks being overly sensitive.  Sometimes, and especially in this current economy directors just need to cut loose, not worry about offending anyone & get obnoxious!  That's what this movie is all about,  we used have lots of these types of movies in the 70's and 80's.  What about Animal House, Porkys, Revenge of the Nerds, Vacation.  This movie is in that same category, socially unacceptable & wrong in all the right ways ;-).
B003G4W49C|5.0|I think this book has been recommended to me 2 or 3 times in my life time. It's not that I didn't want to read it, I just never got around to it.<br /><br />Wow. I'm glad I finally read it! Totally worth the time and money.<br /><br />I heard they're gonna make a movie of this book. Ha! I'd like to see them try. It's too good for the movie theaters.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I played both of these titles years ago on PS2 and enjoyed them immensely.  Both have a sort of austere beauty and convey a sense of loneliness that feels more like an excellent film than a video game.  I still have the original PS2 discs and compared the new  PS3 games to them on my console with PS2 upsampling turned on and set to \\"full\\".  There's absolutely no comparison - both games, PS3 native of upsampled PS2 show as 1080p on my Samsung LED tv, but the graphics are worlds apart.  The old versions look good in the higher resolution, but it's immediately obvious that they took quite a bit of time remaking large parts of the games with current graphic technology and they clearly did some clever programming to make both titles look like standard PS3 games running at 60fps. If the case didn't mention that they're remade ps2 titles and you haven't played them in their original format you'd never know that they aren't new games made for the PS3.   They've also gone to great lengths to preserve the original flow of gameplay and controls, while fixing the little issues with the old controls and smoothing out the few rough edges the original titles had.   To put things simply, if you've played these and loved them on PS2 and own a PS3, they're 100% worth the purchase.  If you've never played them before and own a PS3, they're an even better value.  They could have released these at $30-$40 each as single titles, but made them an amazing bargain at $40 for the pair.  They're worth every penny - if reviews matter to you, you can check out the old PS2 reviews on your gaming site of choice and learn what the games are about and how they play, then read the PS3 version reviews to see the graphical updates and read about the feature changes and extras.  If you enjoy adventure games at all, these are a no-brainer purchase.
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|I loved this movie and couldn't wait for it to come out on blue.  This is even better than the original US version because it has the original soundtrack which is awesome.  Great movie, great soundtrack, who could want more?
B0055SWM08|5.0|Not since the Angry Birds game has there been such a glorious way to waste hours of your day or week.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|In my first online musical review, I wish to express my extreme gratitude to Lou Reed and Metallica for reminding me that counting my chickens before they hatch is always a bad idea. I blindly pre-ordered this album because it was listed as a Metallica release. I honestly had never followed Lou Reed, but have been a serious fan of Metallica for 20+ years. I like nearly everything Metallica has produced... until now. Even St. Anger was able to grow on me, which is to say I was able to listen to it enough to understand the flow of the music. This however... sorry, I couldn't even make it through the album one time. I should have known when I received a rebate from Amazon for the price of the album dropping on release... to late by that time. It will forever more sit on my shelf, as selling it to someone else would be a crime against humanity.
B005SV9X22|5.0|This concert is incredible. It only proves that the Lady is a real artist, and one who is not going anywhere for a long time. You could liken her to being as big as Elvis, if not bigger already. And if not, then she will be.   Her theatrics are brilliant and she sounds utterly amazing live. The best artist around today, and the most talented artist to have come out of the music industry in the past 20 years.   This DVD is well worth every penny, and will serve as a memory for one of the biggest and greatest tours in music history: The Monster Ball.
B0064IZ32C|5.0|The moving wall is hilarious. It's definitely one of most interesting moments of the shows. I enjoyed it more than the DNA tests of Taubs'.
B005TQAI6G|1.0|I honestly don't know how this artist is still around. She lip-syncs the whole thing and if it isn't what you hear on the CD, then it was pre-recorded.   I wonder what she really sounds like live. Probably why she can't cause her voice is terrible.  A complete waste of your money. Unless you want to watch an artist pretend to sing while dancing half-assed. Absolutely no talent. It should be 0 stars.
B005KDWUFA|3.0|I have seen the guys perform on Fox & Friends on Monday and on The Talk today.  On Fox & Friends it was \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina and on The Talk it was \\"Time to Say Good-bye.\\"  Don't think I'm going to be as crazy about this album as their other issues but will give it a go.  What I take exception to is the review given by Hassan Brockovich, Sr.  Il Volo is made up of 3 teens from Italy who have been singing together for several years.  They are not trying to imitate the guys in Il Divo.  No one can do that.  Get the names right of Il Divo:  Urs Buehler, Sebastian Izambard and Carlos Marin.  Don't know if you were trying to be funny but it sucked and you're not a comedian.  Reference made to Sarah Brightman and her \\"blind singing boyfriend\\" making \\"funny blind guy faces while singing\\"  Brightman has been around for years and \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" is one of her signature songs.  She is good and not an amateur.  As far as the \\"blind\\" guy making funny blind guy faces while singing, well his name is Andrea Bocelli and one of the best opera singers on the face of the earth. Making fun of him is moronic on your part.  Grow up.  I hope this album will be half way decent but the songs chosen are not as well known as on their other albums, would like for translations on the songs as Il Volo and Canadian Tenors have done on their albums.  I love the \\"hunks\\" and have seen them in person and have all their concert DVD's.  They are great.  Will continue to support them.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|A truly phenomenal performer. Oh what a voice she has!  Finally another artist who writes her own stuff and actually performs live. Apart from Lady GaGa, she is one of few who actually does both.  Well worth it if you enjoy a real performer with real talent.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I fell in love with Toy Story when I saw the first movie as a kid.  When I heard that Toy Story 3 was coming out, I was ecstatic.  I didn't quite know how they were going to do the movie so long after the first two, but wow, this movie is so good.  I love it.  You can't beat the original, in my opinion, but this comes close.  I will admit that the ending of Toy Story 3 makes me cry every time I see it.  This movie takes me back to my childhood.
B005B0QYMM|4.0|GRAVE ENCOUNTERS is the first \\"video oriented let's pretend  it's a real paranormal experience movie\\" that is truly frightening.  Directed by the Vicious Brothers, the film slowly builds reaching a chaotic crescendo.  The story follows the typical \\"dedicated\\" (to high ratings) film crew of a new hit GHOST HUNTERS-clone TV show called GRAVE ENCOUNTERS who are filming their sixth episode set in a creepy abandoned mental institution.  They are locked in until six a.m. The following morning expecting typical paranormal cliches like strange noises or occasional cold spots.  Fortunately for the viewer, we get much much more.<br />What sets GRAVE ENCOUNTERS apart is that the usually annoying jerky camera shots aren't overused and actually heighten the suspense.  AND things actually HAPPEN instead of being covertly implied.  This movie outshines the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchises or any of television's \\"reality\\" paranormal series.<br />Sean Rogerson (TV's HARPERS ISLAND) is quite effective as Lance Preston, the show's egocentric host.<br />Stylish and disturbing, GRAVE ENCOUNTERS sets a new standard in this genre's milieu.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This, in my opinion, is the ultimate horror film.  I have watched it so many times, but it is still just as effective as it ever was.  One of, if not the greatest horror villian of all time, Michael Myers, is born.  A classic, and a must see.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I have to say. I'm a huge fan of Mr. Baldacci's books, I've read more than 10 of his books and yet I just can't predict what is going to happen next until the very final pages. Hell's Corner is no exeption to this. Amazing Plot, unpredictable turnovers, a true thriller.
031261246X|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. I actually bought copies to give as holiday gifts to my geek friends. I'm a software developer and I got a lot from the book. Inspiration, motivation and food for thought. It's written in a simple way with an intriguing plot. I was impressed that the book is recommended by my favorite novel writer Nelson DeMille. After actually reading the book I can see why- Mark Russinovich writes the same way. I would like to see more humor (the one Nelson DeMille has) but even without it I love it. I heard about the book at the Microsoft conference, Mark Russinovich is a legend between IT professionals. He is a superstar at these events.  I cannot wait to read his next book and I treasure his work!!!!
B0054N73EY|5.0|This CD is well worth the money.  I cannot say that I was a big Chili Peppers fan prior to this disc, but I am in love with all of the songs on this CD with the execption of \\"Even You Brutus?\\".  I don't think you will be disappointed if you purchase this disc after all it is only in the $10 range.
081297381X|1.0|I love an \\"idea\\" book.  I enjoy reading something that makes me look at the world from a slightly different angle or consider effects and trends that I've never noticed before.  However, I think we all know that \\"idea\\" books can suffer from a tendency to repeat themselves and are at risk for stretching the author's perspective from something that could be coveyed in 2 or 3 chapters into 11 or 12 chapters (simply to justify an entire book).  However, The Black Swan is by far the most extreme example of that tendency (appropriate, I suppose, given the topic).  Basically, once you've read the title and the subtitle, you've got at least 95% of the author's idea.  If you actually read the book, you'll be stuck hearing about how rich the author is (when he describes a \\"game\\" he played of giving $100 tips to cab drivers) and how stupid and worthless people in many other professions are (stock traders, economists, researchers, etc.).  While many idea books are designed to turn conventional wisdom on its head, I've never read one that has been so pompous in its efforts.  Rather than letting the material and the ideas speak for themselves, the author just continually insists that HE IS RIGHT.  It's almost painful to read.  The title is basically the best part of this book, which is frustrating, because I feel like there's potentially a very good book that could have the same title; one that truly examines the concept of the impactful, improbable event (dubbed a Black Swan by the author - a moniker he hammers on over and over again in an overt attempt to create a pop-culture phrase along the lines of Gladwell's \\"tipping point\\").  The same idea in the hands of a competent author could have been a really compelling read.  Unfortunately, there are very few ideas to be found in this \\"idea\\" book.  Instead, you're left with a cool concept buried in thousands of words that are nothing but the author's way of filling out the book.  If you're looking to spend hours hearing about how much smarter the author is than everyone around him, definitely read it.  If, however, you're looking for a well-written, concise, thought-provoking book, look elsewhere.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|The Wall will always be that quintessential concept album for me. Every time I watch the movie or listen to the album, I get something else out of it. It's like religion, man! Whoa!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I can not tell you how many times my wife and I have watched this concert.  It is awesome!  I can see why it got the over all five star rating, but I am surprised that there are not more comments on this blu-ray.  Maybe it is a sleeper and not widely known, but if you like the music that has been popular from the seventies up till now you will love this.  The audio is great and all of the songs will bring back great memories.  I own over 30 blu-ray concerts and this is the best one by far.  You can not go wrong with so many great artist performing some of the biggest hits in our life time. I never knew David Foster had such a big influence on the music we grew up with.  Read the other reviews to get more detail of this concert, but just go ahead and put it in your cart now because you will be glad you did...
B000063UR2|5.0|I don't know what it is about this movie that has always captured my imagination. The Darkness character's makeup was so well done for it's time. The story is timeless, but not totally original (but what plot line really is these days, right?). However, I do think all the characters do play their parts well and the movie does capture a particular moment in movie history just before the emergence of big, fanciful effects and really shows you what a creative team of film makers can do without all they have with today's technology. It really is amazing.
0307474275|5.0|Dan is an amazing author! If you haven't read this book, you gotta read. It will satisfy some of your curiosity about the history of religion.
B0062IQNG4|4.0|While listening to this, I have the strangest feeling that the bridge/intro (instrumental)of \\"Turning Page\\" sounds identical to an Imogen Heap/Frou Frou song.  I just wish I could remember which one.   Overall, it is a great album, I just wish there was a Muse or a Deathcab for Cutie song since those two bands reign true to the series.  Perhaps even a nod to Stephanie Meyer's playlists that she used while writing the series could have been incorporated in one way or another into the soundtrack like previous ones.  The instrumental score tracks are great thought. \\"Love Death Birth\\" had a great infusion and a sense of maturing from Bella's lullaby, Edward's theme, and even a hint of connection to the songs that Robert Patterson sang for the 1st movie.  The overall theme of the songs matches the overall theme of the books, Maturity, Change, and Closure. Removing all of the Fantasy stuff, the characters grew up and now have to make adult decisions about relationships so in that aspect the soundtrack also complements the books.

B004HV54TU|2.0|When I first began using this mouse, it helped my carpal tunnel problems tremendously. It seems like such an obvious solution to keep your wrist in a more natural position. I also appreciated that it came in a size that would work with my small hands. I'm a graphic designer and rely on my mouse for 90% of my work each and every day. This is a good product and is compatible with my Mac....however...I've used it a little over 6 months and the optical unit on the bottom (the one that is used to control your arrow on the screen) has died. This was not a cheap product and I expected that it would last at least a year. Now I'm in a bind, do I buy another one that may crap out again within a year or try to find another solution?
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|I took my son, that is 12, to see the movie while my wife and daughters saw Paranormal Activity 3. We both had a blast watching the story unfold about the bonding of a father and son with their boxing robot Atom. The boxing robots looked really cool and the fighting scenes were a enjoy to watch. We will buy this movie for sure to add to our DVD library.
B00004YW6I|5.0|Adoro PJ Harvey! Este album ouvi-o diáriamente durante mais de 1 mês. Para mim é o melhor da PJ Harvey. Muito rock'n'roll!!! :)
B005N0C0I2|5.0|This version actually has two bonus tracks.  \\"Let The Lord Shine A Light On Me\\" and \\"The Good Rebel\\"  I don't know why this isn't listed here, but it's a nice addition for this Deluxe Edition only.
B005N0C0I2|5.0|So let's say that Noel has made his Sgt. Pepper or his Pet Sounds.  Let's say it because it's true.  Start to finish this is a great album.  Noel shows off not only his songwriting range, but his vocal range as well.  He stretches his voice to the limit and unabashedly so.  I love how this is not trying to be Oasis.  It is Noel Gallagher doing his own thing and venturing into a more textured landscape.  And texture is everything here.  Each song has a distinctive personality, and great melody - but also those punches that only Noel can bring with that powerful voice.  I loved every minute of it, and when I played it a second time, as usual, the details began popping out.  Familiarity is always best with this artist, as is repetition.  I can't wait to dive in deeper with this marvelous piece.  It is a great, great album - and full of brilliant warmth.  Worth the wait, worth the hype.  If you like Noel's singing tracks on Oasis albums, and love those B-Sides...well, this is a whole album of those deeper cuts.  It's a classic that you flip right over to listen to again. 5 STARS.  A+
0143034901|4.0|A compelling story that takes over you, and forces you to live it with all the passion and respect it deserves. Made me cry three times. It is not the masterpiece everyone raves about, rather it is a beautiful story we can all relate to, especially people who have a profound love over books. Made my month, brilliant! P.S. If you are a NATIVE SPANISH SPEAKER or you can handle Spanish as a second language without any trouble, BY ALL MEANS, READ IT IN SPANISH!!!!!!!!
B004J4WQ46|5.0|I am surprise how much I like this album. This Is It has always been my favorite cd out of all The Stroke work. But this cd has become my recent favorite.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is hands down the best alarm app that I have used. The ascending tone is much less abrasive than having it begin at full volume.<br /><br />Great alarm.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very fun game. Smooth, challenging gameplay with great graphics, music and ambience. Worth the $.99 for sure.
B0053YGYO4|2.0|I'm a fan of Coldplay. Even if their work isn't revolutionary, it sounds good, and each album has been different from the last. I really, really fell in love with them after hearing their astonishingly good album Viva La Vida. With it's really interesting world-inspired music, moving string sections, crisp instruments piano parts, just beautifully played guitar parts, and unique rhythms, it's an all around great album that's different from most anything I've heard in the past. Needless to say I was eagerly awaiting this new album, expecting it to follow from the greatness that inspired Viva.  To some extent, they hit the mark musically. Their songs are catchy, fit the general musical feel of 2011, but still differentiate themselves with Chris's vocals and Buckland's signature guitar riffs. It's good music.  However, words cannot express the disappointment I have with the mastering on this CD. It is absolutely horrible. Every single track is at 11 with the volume for the duration of the song unless it fades in or fades out. There is no dynamic contrast at all. Sections that are supposed to sound loud and impressive and acoustically huge do not... which is really a crying shame because so many of the songs would benefit from such dynamics. What should be the huge crescendos in the songs instead end up sounding boring and flat, sitting right in with the rest of the song. The mixes are terribly crowded and everything is smashed together and muddy.   The vocals and drums especially suffer from this. Instead of the vocals being out front during the chorus and at times when they are clearly singing the lead in the song, they end up pushed together with the rest of the \\"accompanying\\" parts and sound like they are competing for acoustic clarity. Vocals literally sound like they are clipping at times (\\"Paradise\\"'s chorus, \\"Princess of China\\" during Rihanna's vocal lead in the latter half of the song, what would be \\"Charlie Brown\\"'s huge energy building bridge at 2:30). Chrisand co don't have any room to budge volume-wise, and because they're very dynamic, it doesn't surprise me that they were clipping considering the job done on rest of the instruments.  Cymbals sound harsh, overwhelming and literally make me cringe. The bass drum is far too loud, even with the intention being that this album have songs that sound somewhat like dance music. What sounds like a timpani drum in \\"Major Minus\\" ends up being far too loud and flattens out at what is supposed to be its dynamic peak. Synthesizer parts sound terribly distorted, and not just for effect in the song. Strings, synthesizer pads, and piano parts, which in past Coldplay songs have been beautifully crisp and sounded excellent sound like they've lost a significant amount of fidelity because they've had all the emotion compressed out of them (listen to the strings and accompanying pads on \\"Paradise\\", especially at the drop; the pads in \\"Charlie Brown\\"). After this process, they are cranked up to their proper levels with the terrible artifacts of squashing sound present and loud and clear.  The ending to \\"Charlie Brown,\\" in particular, sounds like it was played on the piano from \\"The Scientist,\\" and should have been played like the small piano motif at the end of \\"Cemeteries of London.\\" It just sounds so terrible in \\"Charlie Brown.\\" Where as the piano in both of these other songs has a wonderfully rounded out and clear sound, breathes beautifully, sounds like a real instrument, and actually varies properly in volume with the rest of the song, the piano at the end of \\"Charlie Brown\\" sound overdriven, fuzzy, fake, and hurts to listen to as a piano player.  It is beyond me how this album got out of the door with Coldplay's approval. The sound engineers ruined all the small things that make instruments sound good. Instead of having clear, distinct sounds for each one of the instruments, it become hard and requires significant effort on my part to pick out one sound from the next. Everything blends together in an aural mess that just does not sound good. Emotion from dynamics is for the most part lost.  I can only hope that they will get a real, professional recording engineer who knows how to mix rock music correctly to remaster this. If so, they should distribute a digital version of that remaster to everyone who purchased the album.  I'm incredibly disappointed. This is the only Coldplay album I regret buying. I only give it two stars because I do like the music.
B00006AW2L|5.0|I can't speak for \\"most Stones fans,\\" but this has been one of my favorites ever since I first got the vinyl hot off the press in '67. Why? \\"Paint It Black\\" is great! The UK version of this album didn't have it, and the song was never released in the UK until the 1971 compilation \\"Hot Rocks 1964-1971.\\" Some of the other songs on the UK version of \\"Aftermath\\" came out on the US album \\"Flowers,\\" another excellent record, generally also considered \\"compilation.\\" I have to admit, I didn't mind shelling out the extra $3.99 at the time for another Stones album! Both the Stones and Beatles UK albums generally had more songs per record, but I suspect sound quality suffered (you can put 20 songs on one side of a vinyl LP if you don't mind crappy sound). As it was, the US version of \\"Aftermath\\" filled each side of the record, indicating more well-defined grooves, which is one of the reasons most of the albums before CDs generally had 10 to 12 songs. Now that they are on CDs, it matters little, but for nostalgic reasons, I still prefer this US version of \\"Aftermath\\"--both for \\"Paint It Black\\" and for the cool cover image.<br /><br />Another reason I love this album is that it marks the only Stones concert I ever attended, part of what was generally referred to as \\"The Aftermath Tour\\" at the time. It was July 26, 1966, at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. A fantastic show that also featured The Jefferson Airplane.

1451629184|3.0|I wrote about this book on my blog at [...].  The text from that review follows:<br /><br />I read a stolen life, a memoir by jaycee dugard.  Jaycee was the 11-year old girl who was kidnapped while walking to school one day in 1991.  For 18 years, she was held captive, as a sexual slave, by a man and his wife.  She was forced to live in a shack and tent in the backyard, had a bucket to use as a toilet and another bucket of water in which to wash herself.  She was brutally raped and sodomized throughout her captivity.<br /><br />She gave birth to her first daughter at age 14 and her second daughter three years later.  She and her daughters had no medical care or schooling during the entire time they spent living with this pedophile, rapist, and sexual pervert.  The man's wife was a willing participant in the abuse.<br /><br />She was not discovered until her captor took her and her daughters with him to the parole office.  Years of visits by parole officers and the police to his home did not result in her or her daughters being discovered living in squalor in the backyard.  The system failed Jaycee.  Her book, the memoir of her life, not only tells the shocking facts of her physical and mental abuse, but also of her survival and recovery.<br /><br />Jaycee has done a limited number of interviews since her recovery, and the most recent ones coincided with her book release.  What I found disturbing about some of the blog posts were the number of people who felt she was a willing participant in what occurred to her and that she did not do enough to save herself.  There were similar comments posted about Elizabeth Smart when she was recovered alive after 9 months of captivity by a similar type of sexual deviant and his wife.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is partly why abuse of women and children (and, yes, I know that men are abused, too, but my focus is on women and children since they have historically been more powerless victims in society) continues.  People want to blame the victim rather than the perpetrator.  The rape victim asked for it.  The battered wife deserved it.  The abused child had it coming to him / her.<br /><br />I recommend reading this book, although written in simplistic language (Jaycee only had a 5th grade education after all), for a number of reasons.  Writing a journal during her captivity helped her to survive it.  In my next book review, the young girl also kept a journal which helped her to survive it.  Writing is powerful.  This point cannot be emphasized enough.<br /><br />Taking care of her daughters and various stray animals (including a spider) helped Jaycee to survive.  While her captor was abusive to animals (a significant red flag), she was a caretaker to them.  In my next book review, the abuse and care of animals and other children was also significant.<br /><br />Jaycee does not consider herself a victim and is looking for ways to turn her experience into something positive.  Part of the proceeds from her book (and her current lawsuit) will go to help other families recover and heal from the experiences related to abductions.rpetrator.  The rape victim asked for it.

B004EPZ07U|5.0|I seem to gravitate to Marvel comic movies. I gotta say I love Green Lantern, its a fantastic movie. Hoping they make a second Green Lantern movie. Ryan Reynolds fantastic for the role of Hal Jordan, I thought the casting was right on for the role of a super hero. In short the movie is great and the story line is one for any fan of the super hero genre.
0439023513|5.0|This novel (well, the entire series) is addicting and amazing. Mockingjay is definitely much darker than the 2 previous books, so brace yourself.
B001HN6922|1.0|John Lassiter violates his own mantra of \\"story first\\" in this \\"politically-correct\\" pandering to the anti-oil lobby (mostly California-based, I presume).  I didn't mind (well, too much, anyway) the subtle anti-corporation message in Wall-E, but in Cars2 it was blatant.  This is particularly ironic (and hypocritical) since Lassiter came up with the story line for Cars1 while taking an extended vacation with his family in an RV!  Beyond the PC pandering, this movie was a flop since it had no \\"tears-in-the-eyes\\" moment (as did all of the other Pixar films - e.g., the scene in Cars1 when Lightning McQueen is leaving Radiator Springs after being outed by Doc Hudson - a real tear-jerker).  Further, the movie was a flop because: (1) things moved by too quickly for one to appreciate all of the subtle background art and automotive-related references; and (2) there was too much potty humor (e.g., Mater leaking oil during an episode of excitement).  This will be the first Pixar movie I do not buy on DVD.  I hope Lassiter and George Clooney enjoyed the picture, because (based on the reviews) most of the rest of us did not!

B004DLPXAO|5.0|To start off I would like to state that I do not own a Kindle, Nook, Sony E-reader, etc.  However, I do have an Android phone and tablet.  This app works great on both!  There is nothing quite like being able to buy a digital copy of the book and take it anywhere on the go.  Amazon Kindle has a large selection of books available to buy and more importantly many of them will let you have a sneak peak so you get a taste before you buy!  Along with the paid books Amazon also provides many free titles that you can pick up and read if you ever run out of books!<br /><br />Be it in the car, doctors office, or the lunch break at work, kindle is there for you!

B005NJ2K6U|4.0|We have all tried the games where you match three in a row and try to win before time runs out; many times these games offer a few hours of pleasure then instantly are cast aside for something with much more depth.<br /><br />Gem Spinner follows the traditional style of puzzle games in that it too requires a match of three gems in a row.  However, this game gives the player much more in to think about.  Instead of just moving the gems now you can move parts of the entire game board.  What once was a simple matter or going up, down, left, or right now requires you to think about the entire game board as you rotate pieces of the board 90 degrees.<br /><br />With a new idea on the classic gem puzzler Gem Spinner will leave you happy and wanting more.

B001DRF84W|3.0|The blu ray looks fine here. The picture and audio qualities are fine. The story was ok at best though. The real power of the Hulk is lost here mainly and even worse the excellent acting can't save the movie.  It's like a nonhulk fan made this one in a way. The whole father monster which is barely seen doesn't help at all. we rarely see the Hulk and the idea of what the Hulk is in the comics is missing. The next movie is alot closer to what the Hulk is really about.  Still this tepid origin story does work for non fans to be sure. But the whole idea of the Incredible hulk running amuck is lost.

Science mixed with history and suspense, this is the kind of book I like. Once again, James Rollins didn't dissapoint me. Book is a little long, so it took a while for me to find the time and read it.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|Easy setup and if you use the digital input you will have one of the best wireless headsets when it comes to the sounds it makes, there is only two things i wish were better. First of all the microphone is not wireless, it requires a cable from the headset itself to the xbox controller or soundcard on your pc. It also uses two AAA batteries instead of a rechargeable lithium battery, you can solve this with a set of rechargable AAA's, wich you should as this thing eats battery when used hard. All in all a great headset for xbox and pc gaming.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|With the 3027 beta bios for the Crosshair iv formula. I got this sucker to go 4.7ghz at 1.404 volts.   Using Corsair H50 with 800d Case my idle temp are 30 to 35 at load 55 to 59.  I guess it depends on the computer case you use that determines the temp. TBH i think the 8120 is a better buy then the 8150. They are bascally the same chip only difference is that the 8150 stock multiplier to higher. But max oc capability is about the same. I rather invest that 40 dollar difference on a high end cpu cooler/closed loops water cooler.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|I have to admit, I may be a bit biased as I have a strong love for Darren Arnofsky's films Pi and Requiem for a Dream.<br /><br />Needless to say, I absolutely LOVED this movie.<br /><br />I thought Natalie Portman did an especially spectacular job playing Nina; she captured the essence of a sexually-repressed twenty-something that is essentially going schizophrenic. Arnofsky's direction and cinematography in this movie were second only to some of the greats like Tarintino and Scorcese.<br /><br />Mila Kunis played a typical role for her - the carefree spirit that doesn't play by the rules. With that being said, her acting during Natalie's hallucinations was fantastic.<br /><br />With that being said, I think he's truly developing his own style: part pscyhological thriller; part horror; part drama.<br /><br />I look forward to his next movie and will recommend this one to anybody interested...just be prepared to be shocked and awed by the end.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|I have the 2 vinyl set. It is packaged like the original with the addition of liner notes from Brian and an overlay for the back cover due to the track order additions and changes. The mixes are all mono on disk 1 even thought the cover says \\"Full Dimensional Stereo\\". I for one hate Mono mixes but this was created by a one eared genius so Brian gets a pass. The bottom end is full like a current release and you can't beat the classic vocals. Right of the top the biggest thing I see is in the mono mixes there is a LOT lost as far as instrumentation/horn parts. I would love to hear this mixed fully in Stereo.  All in all..you know you have to own this. So buy it and put it next to your copy of Pepper, Pet Sounds, and Tommy.
B001PPF130|5.0|Let's just start out by saying that for around 30$ You're getting your moneys worth. The CD itself OK Computer is one of Radioheads best albums and is also considered the greatest album of all time by critics and by the population, closely fallowed by Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. The songs are all masterfully crafted pieces of art that should not be missed by anyone who has a passion for music! My favorite song from this album is Paranoid Android. At first you may not like this song or even the whole album. But I can almost guarantee that it'll grow on you!   5/5 Stars and 10/10 The greatest album I've ever bought
B004EPZ07K|3.0|Most people buy a movie with the digital copy so they don't have to spend the time downloading it from the internet.  Pretty much UltraViolet FAILED to see this concept.

0385334206|5.0|BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS was written on the occasion of Vonnegut's fiftieth birthday. He chose this auspicious occasion to revisit the life of one of his characters who appeared in earlier novels--Kilgore Trout, an obscure science fiction writer, whom Vonnegut now allows to become rich and famous, despite Trout's total lack of interest in fame and fortune. Vonnegut's beautiful phrases are few and far between. His ironic truths are delivered in short, straightforward sentences--a sometimes gentle, sometimes not so gentle confrontation. Vonnegut is in a class by himself. Unlike other satirists, he shows a genuine affection for his characters, reflecting what must be a great love for the human race--despite its foibles that he so expertly identifies. His black comedy is rendered with a sensitivity that elicits tender feelings and fondness for his characters, who are neither heroes nor villains, but people like ourselves who have stubbed their toes tripping through life. His comic irreverence always serves to let us know ourselves better, and he leaves no sacred cow unsullied. About the discovery of America in 1492, he says, \\"Actually, millions of human beings were already living full and imaginative lives on the continent in 1492. That was simply the year in which sea pirates began to cheat and rob and kill them.\\" BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS is among Vonnegut's finest writings, something of a summary of his first fifty years of experience as a human being.

0385534639|5.0|I was skeptical when I first began reading this book but then I quickly became attached to the plot and the characters even before I understood what was happening. I can't really say anything other than if you like mystery, romance, and magic, this book is a perfect fit for you.  This book is probably in my top ten of favorite books now and it's almost impossible to describe why or how other than the fact it just is so undeniably magical.   Well done Erin Morgernstern, I can't wait to read your next book.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|For me, the first couple of episodes were actually hard to stomach, given how abysmally the women characters are treated by the men in their lives, both at home and at work.  However, as the show progresses, the characters, both men and women, reveal themselves to be more complex, and therefore more interesting, than the cartoon characters of the first episode.  Mad Men is addictive, the acting is superb across the board, and every episode is riveting.
B00005B36H|5.0|I freaking love this album, I love Tool, but, when I came to Amazon and bought it, I did it with the intention of getting the original 2001 Volcano release, as it shows under the description of the item, I was goddamn excited about it, and guess what? was not the  2001 Volcano Release, I just noticed it when  I saw \\"Lateralus\\" instead of Lateralis as it was supposed to be in that release edition that has that typo, anyways, if you are thinking of buying this album from Amazon just because it is supposed to be the release with the typo on it (I don't know if you get it or not, I mean, I really love Tool and I thought: well, this is a very good piece for a collection), you most likely will get the \\"normal\\" edition.   Other than that, Tool rulz. So the review is not against the record it self, but the information on the website ;)

But this band is incredible, in large part because of the lead singer. You know those times when you discover an amazing band, with addicting music, and then you see them live and you fall head over heels? It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it is magical, and this is one of those bands. Not to mention Aaron is the coolest guy. He has the most energizing and exciting stage presence, and awesome vocals. This music truly makes me happy. Thanks, Awolnation, for being you! Keep up the good work! Signed, a truly dedicated fan.

0307593312|5.0|Honestly, I started reading this and couldn't get into it. Aomame is a mankiller, Tengo is a math teacher and a writer on the side and then there was the little people...I couldn't see how the stories could relate or how they would somehow come together to make this novel any good. Although book 1 was slow however, I must say it definitely picked up in book two. As the characters developed and their stories intertwined, I felt like once again, I was reading the typical Murakami I know and love. The book is beautiful and draws from real life, pop culture, dreams, magic, and everything else that Murakami is known for.
1933633867|5.0|As most of the other reviewers have noted, this is a brilliant and revolutionary book. The author has synthesized a great deal of information from anthropology, history and economics over 5,000 years to come up with a compelling and original account of debt. The accomplishment is even greater, because he makes clear that debt is intimately related to money, capitalism, war and slavery; so understanding debt will change your view of all these things.<br /><br />The bad news is the author made some inexplicable choices that may cause many readers to discount or misunderstand the book. The first is to continually emphasize abusive practices associated with debt: predatory or fraudulent lending, debt for consumption, debtors' prison and enslavement for debt. Only on the edges of the story, usually under the term \\"commercial debt,\\" will you see what a debt defender would emphasize: informed and non-desperate parties agreeing voluntarily to a contract in which the lender supplies funds to buy assets expected to return more than the interest rate on the debt, and agrees that if the venture fails she will own the remaining assets but have no personal recourse against the borrower. If the venture succeeds, the lender gets repaid with interest and the borrower gets any additional profit as compensation for his efforts. If the venture fails, the lender takes a loss (or at least gets a lower rate of return than would compensate for the risk) and the borrower has nothing to show for his work. No courts, no violence.<br /><br />Someone might argue that the violent practices are inherent to debt and abusive loans are far more common than loans of mutual advantage. But the author doesn't argue this. Anyway, the points would be irrelevant to his thesis. The book discusses the fundamental idea of debt and the conclusions apply equally to the best and worst loans. There is a lurid focus on the most egregious actions related to debt, in most cases of which debt merely provides some euphemistic terms for violence and robbery (like a carjacker \\"borrowing\\" your car or a bully \\"paying back\\" your imagined insult with a punch). I found the material exaggerated and unconvincing. Terrible things have been done in the name of debt, but the book presented little evidence that the terrible things wouldn't have been done anyway, nor was there any attempt to weigh the amount of debt abuse against the amount of mutual benefit from legitimate debt. The material is likely to mislead casual readers into thinking this is a hysterical anti-debt screed when it is in fact a brilliant and subtle examination of the nature of society.<br /><br />Even more important is a key omission. Nowhere does the author mention the most important point about money and credit--that they stimulate extraordinary technological and cultural change. No nonspecialist would care about Neolithic exchange practices if they hadn't revolutionized humanity with the adoption of agriculture, permanent settlements, technological change and long-distance trade networks. The Athenian owl coin would be a minor curiosity except that it ended thousands of years of civilizations rising and falling leaving little behind but crumbling ruins and dead language texts. Every society that joined the money web since has had its language and technology preserved for other societies to build upon. This did not lead to steady progress but it did lead, for the first time in human history, to progress. Paper money in Reformation Europe led to technologies that conquered the world, and not just militarily.<br /><br />Whether you like that progress is another matter. Or you may feel we could have had the progress without all the evils associated with money and debt--even that money and debt were effects not causes of the changes. Regardless, leaving technological progress out of the story makes an unbalanced account.<br /><br />Finally, one of the author's key points is that debt can have the effect of ripping a personout of social context to be treated as a source of repayment rather than a friend, neighbor, son and so on. This is a brilliant point, well-argued and important. But it has an obverse side the author misrepresents. Some people run away from traditional societies and small towns for the anonymity of a city. They shed what they consider the burdens of social ties to create and join less personal organizations. Debt in its quantified and impersonal form was undoubtedly created by these types of people.<br /><br />The author treats social refugees as either evil or deluded. If unsuccessful, they are caught in a debt trap that destroyed everything of meaning in their lives. If successful, they are addicted to the pursuit of money, which cannot buy them happiness. In fact, many people have at least some tendencies in these directions at some points in their lives. Some are mainly escaping intolerable or suffocating situations. Others are looking for excitement and adventure. Or they may want to pursue ideas that require wider contacts (and therefore relatively impersonal and rational human relations) than their traditional social ties can provide. Not everyone who flees the family farm is after world domination or mindless stockpiling of gold. You'd think someone who didn't understand this would spend his time arguing with his friends and teaching his children, not writing a book.<br /><br />This is a great book, but it could reach a wider audience if the author spent less time bashing creditors (and Europeans, if anything bad happens in the book and a European male is within a hundred years and a thousand miles of it, you know who will get the blame) and more serious time on the people who like debt and the changes they cause in the world. Perhaps he disputes the conventional views of these things, in fact I think that's a near certainty, but ignoring them makes his insights hard to connect with anything else.f repayment rather than a friend, neighbor, son and so on.

B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie was better than the first in a lot of ways.  In particular, the action was a lot more fast paced, and it didn't seem to lag as much.  It was still too long, though - I have such a hard time sitting through these, even though I enjoy them.  I am always so ready for them to be over, and I hate feeling that way about a movie.<br /><br />I can't really speak to accuracy with regard to the book as I haven't read the books in years (It's on my list, trust me!), but as near as I can tell the movie followed the book fairly closely.  It certainly captures the essence of the story.  These movies were very well done; good actors, great special effects (especially for being several years old now).  Can't ask for much more than that.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie was great and a great way to finish the series but the digital copy through Flixster is a complete rip-off. No one sould buy any Flixster digital copies because it's NOT worth it. Save your money.
B006470HZ6|5.0|All I have to say is that if you enjoyed the comics, then you'll enjoy this show too. Seems there are a lot of low-votes going to this episode, though I enjoyed it. It follows well with the original story with just enough changes to keep things unpredictable. If you've liked it up to this point, you'll probably enjoy this episode too. Happy watching.
0439023513|2.0|**SPOILER!!**  I finished this book about a couple of hours ago (and a year or so late, I know) not really knowing entirely how I felt; a certain satisfaction that the book was done, but also emptier than I was after reading the first two. I've read some reviews and I'm happy to see that very many people feel the same way I do. Everyone has pretty much been laying into the many problems in the book--bad editing, unfinished plot development, a terrible epilogue, undeveloped characters, an unfulfilled ending--but something else has really been on my mind that I don't think very many reviewers have fully touched. Suzanne Collins has truly failed to explain what really happened between Gale and Katniss.  Okay, so maybe not every reader is like me, but I WANTED the two of them to end up together. So that does drive a lot of my emotions at the moment. But putting that to the side, if I take an objective view, I feel like even if a reader did want Katniss to end up with Peeta, the direction Collins had been taking during the previous two books called for a long life with Gale, not Peeta. Firstly, Gale was the main man she loved from the beginning--period. Not to say that a person can't be in love with two people, but Collins made it clear that Gale was the number-one man in her life. For example, during the first Games when Katniss had to play the romance angle in order to get sustenance, all that kissing made her a little confused at times but her thoughts always went back to Gale and how he would feel about seeing it. And then in Catching Fire, the burning kiss Gale gave her in the woods...all the guilt she felt whenever she was around Peeta, having to play kiss-up and plan for a wedding she preferred to have with Gale?? And what about when she was crying over his mutilated body, feeling that intense hate and jealously towards the phantom girl that never existed? Didn't she resolve then to stay in District 12 and fight with Gale? All of this is unaccounted for in Mockingjay, and a clear slap in the face to the readers.  Gale, Gale, Gale, has been in our faces from the beginning. I always thought that Katniss loved Peeta in her own way because they shared the Games between them; he was irreplaceable in her life. But to turn around and love him in that way? After mulling over marrying Gale, you settle for Peeta? I know that the supposed reason is the possibility of his bombs having contributed to Prim's death. I don't know, maybe I'm overestimating Katniss or the bonds of a true friendship, but she knew that Gale had no control over what happened with things he may or may not have made. Maybe I could understand if it was some random person she was just beginning to trust but this is Gale...GALE! He loved Prim like his own family! You're really telling me she couldn't try to eventually look past that mistake, for the man she loved?  Reading Mockingjay makes me feel like Collins wasted my time spelling out and cultivating the relationship that Katniss and Gale had throughout all of those years. Talking about those days upon days in the woods. Their striking similarities in their families and ways of life. The fact that they had the \\"Seam look\\" about them, so unlike Peeta. How many times did Katniss think to herself that Peeta wouldn't understand some particular thing, only Gale could? This is one of the things about MJ that really makes no sense to me, because it's like why bother saying all of that, if Katniss was just going to turn around and go with the guy who was so unlike her? To attribute her choosing Peeta to the fact that Gale is an angry rebel is just bad writing, because Gale was always that way and yet Katniss still loved him. Yes, Peeta is full of sunshine and happiness and charisma a lot of the time but, uhhh, right now (and apparently forever) he's not! Collins wrote him off as an empty void of a man, and so he's not looking much better than Gale at this point.  Now I have nothing against Peeta, honestly. I may have really been rooting for Gale (just as I rooted for Jacob of Twilight; I just love the underdog) but I understand that Collins didn't see him in Katniss's future in that way...which is fine. But at least do the job BETTER. You can't expect me to fall so deeply into Gale and Katniss's relationship for two books, just to write it off in a couple of sentences. Give me a fallout, a real reason that their friendship is irreparable. Explain to me why, exactly, Gale has a \\"fancy\\" job ten districts away when that never seemed to be very much like him? After all those years and all of that fighting alongside each other, they really have nothing to say? And do a better job on Peeta, who I feel lacks terribly in this book. I personally think what he went through in the story was brave and touching and it would have been wonderful to see he and Katniss take those steps forward together...I mean, really EARNING their marriage.  Instead Collins just throws all of this in at the end as though this is supposed to pass for all that we've read between the three of these extraordinary young people. I guess she was just lazy or pressed for time. And that was at our expense.

B0033PSH4U|5.0|This movie is a classic coming of age story for a young Italian American growing up in the Bronx in the midst of the Civil Rights era. A touching melo drama of this youngster who witnesses a murder in front of his tenament building decides not to rat out the local Mafia Hood responsible and scores cool points with this criminal. He turns to his much loved father and ask if he did a good thing who swiftly replies, \\"you did a good thing for a bad man.\\" The then 7 year old can't comprehend this and his father explains \\"you'll understand when you get older.\\" How many times have fathers tried to delicately explain such adult issues of life but this movie does a wonderful job with a bit of lite humor. Complicating matters is the boys constant need to understand the curves of life by seeking advice from his father as well as the Mafia neighborhood Don. On top of the main theme, the same youngster now a teenager, falls in love with a young African American teen around the time of Dr. Martin Luther King's assasination. His neighborhood friends that he has grown up with begin to ridicule him with peer pressure but \\"C's\\" wisdom seeks adult adivice from both his father and the Mafia hood who happens to tell him to forget what his friends suggest. I don't want to give the whole movie away but will say this movie is a classic time piece well worth adding to the movie archives. Nevertheless, don't take it from me, experience and enjoy it for yourself..!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|The Book is very organized and written in a very informative way as the writer had access to many good sources including Mr Jobs himself. I particularly liked the fairness and going into details to explore the extent that others contributed to the ideas and products. One weak point to me throughout the book is that it has mainly missing many discussions on technologies that apple nurtured in years and fruited into famous  products. I got the impression that Jobs was merely the guy that cared for the look of the product that is all to it. But looking at their product esp  being pioneering to every single technology in the computer industry I should say it needed more to focus on the involvement of Job on the technological issues. I do not expect to see him inventing technologies but as a CEO of a big company one if curious to see how Job was involved in the different technologies in OSX and then how they miniaturized OSX into iOS etc etc in some more detail than is in the book.  Other than this enjoyed the reading the book and would recommend it to anybody interested on the subject as \\"The\\" book to read.

1856697525|3.0|A timely release about one of the great and influential designers of the last century and clearly Pat Kirkham has made this a scholarly work considering the amount of research involved.  The title will most likely become the standard biography of Bass.  Having said that I was disappointed to find the book had some editorial flaws in its presentation.<br /><br />Millions of movie-goers are familiar with the stunning credits Bass created (sixty stills are included in a fold-out dateline in the back pages) from Carmen Jones in 1954 to Casino in 1995 and the book rightly devotes a large number of pages to credits and the marketing of these movies.  My first disappointment is that a DVD was not included with the book.  OK, I'll accept that this would involve a lot of extra work (and probably copyright fees to make the book even costlier) and it wasn't in the author's remit so the fall back position would be to show the credits in as much detail as possible: frame by frame to give the reader a feel of how Bass created these powerful opening movie statements.  Unfortunately many of these credit stills throughout the book are treated more as individual images, in various sizes, rather than shown as a sequence of large thumbnails.  Solana and Boneu's [[ASIN:8496309525 Uncredited: Graphic Design & Opening Titles in Movies [With DVD]]] book has a whole chapter on Bass credits and the pages work well.  'Anatomy of a murder' has thirty-two thumbnails, 'North by northwest' has twenty-four.  In this book they get six and five.<br /><br />Chapter six looks at the corporate work of Saul Bass and he worked for a lot of companies.  The book's coverage is hardly comprehensive when this kind of design commission looks into every visual corner of a company.  Mostly what is shown are a few samples: Fuller Paints gets five photos and a logo; Rockwell International three and a logo; Minolta two photos, two logos and five still thumbnails.  These corporate pages throw up another disappointment I had with the book: presentation.  Flick through the pages and it all looks clean and tidy but then start to read a chapter and I was aware of the large amounts of empty page space (working white as designers call it) where, as this is a book about a visual subject, images should be working much harder.  These are pretty pages rather than practical pages that reveal the full potential of the images to the reader.  A good example are two fold-outs showing sixteen logos to a page, actually they would have fitted easily on two pages but on four pages they should have been much larger without destroying the book's design integrity. A spread on AT&T (pages 330/331) has ten images and text that would easily fit on one page.<br /><br />What I found absolutely fascinating were the fifteen pages of notes in the back pages.  Predictably set in tiny type yet full of detail about Saul Bass, design and the design community he worked in.<br /><br />The book's printing is excellent, a nice matt art for the 1484 images using an impressively fine screen (three hundred+) an embossed cover with the 'Bonjour tristesse' logo.  'Saul Bass' is certainly an interesting book but I thought the presentation didn't really display this wonderful designer's work to its full potential, especially his stunning movie credits.nt I had with the book: presentation.

0142410705|5.0|I had read Looking For Alaska before, and this book wasn't anywhere below my high expectations for it. I love it.
B003H9MSPG|2.0|So, \\"longstrike\\" being the name I was expecting some good feats of nerf technology. Sadly I purchased one, and it turned out to be a dud. Would shoot 15ft, 20ft tops, and that was already a problem. Luckily I was still able to ship it back for a replacement, and I just received the new one. The toy is still great fun, but I feel perhaps I had too high of expectations for just a simple piece of plastic and foam. This one out of 10 darts (with and without the barrel extension) would still only shoot at the 20-25 foot range. I had 1 dart that somehow made it about 33ft, but 1 out of 20 leaves a lot to be desired. So unfortunately, I will be returning this one as well.  As for the toy in general, loads of fun attempting to shoot stuff with a gun that's almost as tall as I am. The design was cool to begin with, it just couldn't live up to my own expectations of it unfortunately.

B004HO6I4W|3.0|The movie is absolutely awesome however the only issue is that through out the beginning of the movie up until the 35 minute mark, the movie would freeze for a couple of seconds and cut out a scene. I would miss a few seconds of the movie but it will continue from the freeze point as if nothing happened. I have watched the movie a few times and it never freezes at the same points in that time frame however it is always in between the beginning and the 35 minute mark.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Exceptional.   Unusually for Hollywood, it seems to be historically accurate, too.   There's outstanding performances from Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet in a lovely love story. The main villain of this piece is the class system, but the minor ones are believable and accordingly, hateful.  Stunning photography. Never would you believe that harrowing scene in the icy water was filmed in a swimming pool... Well, it's all been said before.   Almost unbearably sad...I was so glad that the ending shows an other worldly (or dream, depending on how you interpret it) reunion.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It's the Sony branded navigation controller so it is probably more costly than third party controllers. Very reliable, depending on your objective you may want to shop around before pulling the trigger on this one.
B0051O8Z66|5.0|First off, let me say that this album grew on me. While I've followed the boys through \\"Beautiful World\\" and \\"The Circus\\" (and loved both of them thoroughly), I really wasn't sure what to expect when Robbie suddenly returned. Don't get me wrong -- I love Robbie Williams -- his last effort, \\"Reality Killed The Video Star\\" still ranks as one of my all-time favourite albums. However, his musical style has, for the most part, taken a drastically different turn than that of TT; so when his inclusion was announced, I wasn't sure if the result would prove to be brilliant, disastrous, or just mediocre.  I purchased the original \\"Progress\\" when it was released, having heard none of the tracks. On first listen it was...interesting. Different. Definitely not what I was expecting. It didn't sound like any previous TT album, nor did it sound like any of Robbie's solo works. So I listened to it sporadically over the course of about a year, and certain tracks definitely grew on me. 'The Flood', 'Wait' and 'Pretty Things' wound up in more frequent rotation. Then one day I was on the subway and 'What Do You Want From Me' came on and I actually LISTENED to the lyrics. Clearly the boys who crooned 'Once You've Tasted Love' had matured -- and it shows in EVERY song on the album. Clever wit, sarcasm, and emotional depth combine into what I eventually realised is one AMAZING album.  Then, as is the way of most releases today, it got -- re-released. Two CD's, 8 new tracks. I had to have it. I knew why. I needed to see if these \\"extra tracks\\" actually measured up to the tracks that made it onto \\"Progress\\". All I can say is -- best $20 ever spent. All 8 tracks equal, if not surpass, their counterparts. Keep in mind, they are musically not what you might be expecting; many are odd, even quirky...but great nonetheless.  So, after nearly a year in almost constant rotation, here is my rating of each individual song:   1. The Flood (10)   2. SOS (8)   3. Wait (10)   4. Kidz (8)   5. Pretty Things (10)   6. Happy Now (9)   7. Underground Machine (6)   8. What Do You Want From Me (10)   9. Affirmation (9)  10. Eight Letters (7)  11. Flowerbed (10)(Please Note -- this song is ONLY on \\"Progress\\")  12. When We Were Young (10)  13. Man (10)  14. Love Love (10)  15. The Day The Work Is Done (10)  16. Beautiful (10)  17. Aliens (10)  18. Don't Say Goodbye (10)  19. Wonderful World (10)  So now, after listening to \\"Progressed\\" for many months, I have come to thoroughly enjoy the album's amazing diversity of sound and style. I believe it is their best work to date.   And \\"When We Were Young\\" may end up being my favourite song...ever.
B0062W3GRY|5.0|Like some of the previous reviews have said, this show leaves you wanting more. Just when you think the story line cannot get any more complex it does. I personally find all the characters very unique, mysterious, individuals, yet they all share one common interest, the \\"murder\\" house. This adds a lot of depth and curiosity to the story. Whether it is the mysterious man in black or a hand reaching out from under the bed, this show keeps you on the edge of your seat. I think anyone will find American Horror Story very intriguing. Give is a try, you won't regret it.
B000000WFZ|5.0|I originally bought this because one of the tracks is on the Pure Moods album that I love so much.  But I am enjoying the album as background music while I sew, do household chores and when I am reading.  Nice music and very soothing at the end of a crazy day.

Get this, but it's so deeply penetratingly interesting, do not watch it right before you go to sleep - since it may keep you up, but an all-nighter with BB3 is a win anyway. get season 2 first: [[ASIN:B001RTSPVY Breaking Bad: The Complete Second Season]]

B001C08RHA|5.0|Usually, I'm rather sceptic when it comes to screen adaptions of Marvel comic characters/superheroes, because there have been quite a few disappointing examples. This one, however, makes an amazing picture that has everything a superb movie should have: a good storyline, suspense, action, brilliant actors, advanced technology, great movie scores, etc.<br /><br />Moreover, there is a sense of excellence to be felt throughout the entire movie that is recognizable in the way super-human qualities are depicted. The idea of man and technology merging to form the perfect enhanced being is a core issue. The underlying theme of continuously confronting one's limits to eventually overcome them combined with the archetype of the superhero is of equal value. In fact, the protagonist presents a perfect embodiment of Iron Man which makes this movie a splendid screen adaption of the comic-book series.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I like the way you made a new kind of puzzle game and how you made it relaxing but hard at the same time.
B0019UGYK0|4.0|We enjoyed seeing the movie again very much, but I found it to be very dated contrasted with another purchase we made: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which is quite an old movie and didn't seem dated to me at all. Still, enjoyable.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I hadn't even seen the movie but bought it on review.  This was a great comic adaptation and was easy to comprehend for those that were not familiar.  I like Thor more than the HULK movies and that's an accomplishment.  Good balance of action, good and evil characters, super powers, brothers pitted against each other and a bit of Romance (was ok, even though I'm not a fan of Nat. Portman - not to mushy but enough depth to feel interested).  I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a entertaining flick with a \\"magical\\" touch of action and great character development.
B004RC8NUQ|3.0|Classic romantic comedy except this time the guy falls in love with a girl who doesn't want to have a relationship... In the end, just like with all romantic comedies, they wind up together after she realizes she doesn't want to be without him. Aw[...] Predictable (obviously) but still entertaining. Nothing to write home about, but Natalie Portman does a great job at being lovable.

I would have enjoyed at least a one-page insert, but alas there was nothing. Not even a B&W insert...<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this vinyl for any fan of records or Christmas music in general.<br /><br />See other reviews for the music, this was strictly for the record aspect of the release. However, how can you go wrong with a She & Him Christmas!?!
B00507ZQSO|3.0|Grat singing. Singers never reflected at theirs faces and acting movements what was going on.

With the CD provided, my laptop recognized the device immediately and emulated a serial port for me to set in SeaClear. I'm off and running (well, sailing actually). Previous attempts to configure Garmin GPS units were frustrating and ultimately unsuccessful.
B00336G7HI|5.0|The battery was exactly what I wanted.  It was identical to the original battery and is a great back-up to extend my recording time.
B000KKPN5C|2.0|I loved this flash while it lasted! I shoot a D90 indoors a few times a year for parties and such and my pictures looked much better when bouncing this flash. After using it maybe 10-15 times, it up and died, so I sent it in to Nikon for repair (I was just out of warranty). I got the repair estimate back today and my jaw dropped. Total cost was $103!!!! Seeing how I could (but won't) buy a brand new one for $17 more, I was in total shock and called up customer service. They didn't care and a supervisor declined my request to speak with them.  A+ product when it works.  F- for product support and customer service.  I won't buy another one.
B0057ZEMF2|4.0|The Roma of Spain have origins in Rajasthan and the Punjab of northwestern India, and vesitages of their South Asian home exist in traditional flamenco, heard in the improvisations and oscillations of cantaors and in the various 12-beat rhythm patterns of guitar and dance. The polka dots of flamenco dresses are also related to the round mirrors of skirts in India. Thus, it would not be incongruous for sitarist Aoushka Shankar to play with flamenco artists and find spiritual harmony. This album is not entirely fusion. Shankar plays pieces separately and also as accompaniment to flamenco musicians, and they in turn clap and sing in accompaniment to her. Flamenco, of course, is not precisely Indian music, so mixed with European, Arabic, and Judaic elements of Spanish music, and the music here chiefly is Indian in timbre and melody. Percussion is also chiefly Indian. It is Shankar's album, after all. Remarkably, the sound and interplay work very well. Indeed, flamenco and Hindustani musical spirit are the same. Among the Spanish musicians supporting her are Pepe Habichuela, Pedro Ricardo Mi&ntilde;o, Juan Ruiz, Sandra Carrasco, and Javier Lim&oacute;n. These some 60 minutes of musical exploration will bring enjoyment to the world music fan. [Please see my Comment below.]
B005NPBTQ6|5.0|Big Ryan Adams fan here, but admit I don't love *all* his stuff (almost all, but not 100% all). This, I definitely like. I haven't had it long (downloaded from Amazon) but I liked it from the very first listen. The more I listen, the more I like it. It's going to get some significant playtime with me.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'<br />and 'Breaking Bad'.<br /><br />Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,<br />not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like a<br />great novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.<br /><br />Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the cop<br />show to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'Battlestar<br />Galactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robot<br />wars the same way.<br /><br />This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,<br />or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to be<br />a human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,<br />fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recent<br />politics and real world situations.<br /><br />My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we tore<br />through 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.<br /><br />The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members are<br />remarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity and<br />contradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters to<br />change and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seemingly<br />inexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -<br />but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they've<br />taken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,<br />even if they're not really why you watch this show.<br /><br />It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've ever<br />seen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out and<br />blown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad to<br />finish a great book.<br /><br />Speaking of ending, the one serious let down for me was the very last<br />episode. Certainly no disaster, but for perhaps the only time in the<br />series, some of the answers felt disappointingly flat and simplistic.<br /><br />But that wasn't enough to take away from the tremendous esteem with<br />which I hold the show. One that is surely worth your time.<br /><br />I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generally<br />this blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.<br />However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problem<br />and I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there was<br />a slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhaps<br />it was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefully<br />it seemed more a reproduction problem.<br /><br />This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but accept<br />as an artistic decision.<br /><br />Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy<br />(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might want<br />to make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the best<br />you can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the later<br />discs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too late<br />to ask for an exchange.<br /><br />None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode the<br />occasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wife<br />never noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).<br /><br />Also, right now a region free blu-ray box set is selling on Amazon<br />UK for about $140 with shipping. It seems to have all the same<br />extras. A better deal (for as long as the price lasts...)isode.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|This turned out to be exactly what I was looking for: durable and well-priced, and the consistency of the plastic is soft enough to absorb shock when dropped (and I've dropped it!) but not too soft like the pure silicone one I had on my previous phone. (Which felt slimy to me and stretched out over time) The cover is easy to remove if needed. There is a circles pattern on the back which highlights the Apple logo, looks fine imo. I was not expecting the clear screen protector to be any good, (I actually ordered a separate set from another vendor) but it turned out to be great and was (imo) very easy to apply.  Yes, there is a slight rainbow effect noticeable when you're not using the screen, this doesn't bother be at all.  Overall this has been one of the best value purchases I've made.
B004UQPM4E|1.0|I ordered this and unfortunately didn't read the reviews on here.  I too have received the other region box set.  I've now received it twice.  It would be nice to be able to read the names of the movies on the actual disks without having to know another language.  The packaging is all written in English and you don't notice anything is wrong until you look at the discs and they are in what I assume is in Spanish.  I don't speak it so I'm not sure.  I guess I should have known something was amiss from the \\"Cannot be sold to any person under 12\\" message written on the box.  Not a standard rating that I am aware of in the United States.  I will now be sending back the 2nd package I received with the same incorrect discs.  They didn't even offer to have someone manually make sure that they pulled the correct item.  They are just telling me all they can do is return my money and they will be removing the advertisement for the product from the website.  I have a feeling after reading how long this issue has been ongoing that they probably won't be removing the item from Amazon until they can get it fixed.  I certainly want the movies.  I love Superman.  But, it's not what I ordered and paid for.  I hope that like another reviewer wrote they allow those of us who purchased this in good faith to be able to get the item again at whatever price we paid when they can correct the situation and start shipping the correct items.  I realize mistakes happen but with as many people who had this situation come up in the past year you think someone would have stepped in to rectify it.  Time will tell I suppose.  We'll see how long it takes to get my refund.  Hopefully, not 4 weeks like another reviewer wrote.
0385344325|5.0|Just finished reading The Affair and it was exciting from start to finish.  This was Jack Reacher at his best.  Therefore, Lee Child at his best.  I find Lee Child's books are always interesting because he covers the details.  I like details covered.  Exciting, interesting, and a little love thrown into the mix.  Must say...LOVED IT.

1423140591|4.0|Ever since the Prophecy of Seven was introduced in THE LOST HERO, the gods and their children, the demigods, have been in disarray. Mother earth, or the goddess Gaea, has been holding a grudge apparently for a very long time and would like to reclaim Earth for herself. This means wiping out an entire civilization, but sacrifices must be made, right? While Jason, Piper and Leo, with the help of Camp Half-Blood, were able to hold off Gaea for a little while, now the focus switches to the long-lost hero Percy Jackson and the last place he expected to find himself: Camp Jupiter, the Roman demigod camp.<br /><br />Percy has been wandering around for the last eight months with amnesia. He remembers little of his former life, other than there was some girl named Annabeth. The one thing he hasn't forgotten is how to fight and kill the monsters that have been following him. The strange thing, though, is that they keep reappearing every few days. It's almost as if they just won't die.<br /><br />Hazel is technically not supposed to be alive. She also has a strong connection to Gaea, one she is ashamed to talk about. This connection led to her untimely death and the underworld. However, being the daughter of Pluto, the god of the underworld, has some advantages. Regardless of the fact that she got a second chance at life, Hazel feels responsible for the impending end of the world. If only there was a way to make up for her past mistakes.<br /><br />Frank has been inhibited by family pressure and expectations since birth. He belongs to a long line of kings and heroes, and even though his overbearing grandmother tells him he can be anything he wants to be, he just doesn't believe it. Frank also literally holds his life in his hands, and while he wants to do great things, he's too afraid of what could happen.<br /><br />With Percy in the lead, these three heroes plan a quest to confront Mother Earth to try to stop the end of the world. First, though, Percy is going to have to get used to the Roman side of things. The gods are different, the people and structure are different, and he still has a nagging feeling that he belongs somewhere else. Roman life is quite different, and although that means new and exciting surprises, it also means new and dangerous monsters.<br /><br />THE SON OF NEPTUNE picks up right where the first book left off. Readers finally get to see how the \\"other half\\" lives, and Riordan does a great job of introducing Roman mythology without it being confusing or overwhelming. The best part about this series is that there are the fun, familiar elements readers enjoyed from the original Percy Jackson books, and yet Riordan introduces so many new mysteries and twists that really elevate this follow-up series to an entirely different level. The stakes are just has high as ever, and the build-up for reuniting both sides should make for a compelling read in the next installment.<br /><br />Reviewed by Benjamin Bocheods are different, the people and structure are different, and he still has a nagging feeling that he belongs somewhere else.

B001VLXNLU|3.0|The three is for Marked as its own book. As a whole series.. HA! It doesn't deserve numbers.<br /><br />At first I was like \\"Yeah! Go Zoey!\\", then that kind of just turned into a big, fat \\"What?!\\". My friend lent this book to me and then every book after it until I just told her to stop because I couldn't handle the stupidity anymore. I admit to the \\"okay\\" premise.. but that's it. Everything else sucked.<br /><br />Marked was okay.. Betrayed was tolerable.. the rest were nauseating. I stopped right before reading Burned and someday I may come back and finish the series... just as soon as I forget everything that's happened so far.<br /><br />DON'T BOTHER!
0525423281|5.0|Lola and the Boy Next Door, was so much fun to read I enjoyed every minute. It made me so homesick though I grew up in the Bay Area, and visited San Francisco often. After reading all of Stephanie's amazing descriptions of City life I am ready to go back NOW. I really felt like I was really wondering the streets, and peaking into the shops with Lola and Cricket, so much fun! I often pose the question to friends, if you could live in any big City in the US which would you choose? My response is San Fransisco, it is gorgeous, not as scary as most, friendly, old, fun, amazing food and people, ocean, great weather, and a million and one things to do. I LOVED it their....okay I will now quit being a commercial for them and get off my soap box.:)   Lola lives in a non traditional home with two dads who were really funny and really great parents to Lola. I was somewhat worried how Perkins would portray or come off preachy with this but she doesn't, it is very tastefully done and I really appreciated her approach. Lola has this want to be Rock Star boyfriend who I have to give a little credit to he really put up with her dads, those Sunday brunches, yikes. Max her boyfriend was just something else I had moments I liked him and then moments I hated him. I found him to be a little manipulative to Lola, and she just couldn't seem to see his flaws. I was glad when Cricket moves in next door. He is smart, cute, sweet, awesome with Lola, funny,and endearing. I really like his name, very different and wouldn't work on just any guy. I like that their relationship grew from previously having known each other to some warming up. They didn't just instantly fall into love. I really liked Lolo she was smart, fun, goofy, good friend, flawed and charming. There is a lot of things in her life for her to deal with and she does a pretty amazing job at it. I loved her corky style of dress, she was so true to herself and it showed in her everyday attire, so fun. I liked that she felt sorrow for things lost that can never be gained back. Lola and Crickets coming together was a lot of fun to watch, all the tension and expectation of the first touch and then kiss which was an amazing scene. They both really cared for each other and really showed us this in the simple things they did for each other. I thought they were perfect for eachother.   Anne and Etienne make several appearances in this story which was wonderful. It was great to see what was happening in their world. Great story lots of fun! Greatly anticipating her next. Maybe we will get to see all of these great characters again...one can hope.

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus Abstract  Where a boy bears lovers' dreams  with a seer of stars  and night goes on forever.
B005ER6SNM|1.0|Simply titled A Serbian Film, the movie explores themes of violence and sexual depravity in ways you may never have seen before on film. The story follows a struggling male porn star named Milos who takes on one last gig, a supposed pornographic \\"art film,\\" for a fat paycheck and the chance to break away from the industry completely. Once filming begins, however, Milos gradually realizes it's not quite what he thought, and his life devolves into a hellish and sadistic nightmare for him and his family. A Serbian Film generated much controversy, due to its disturbingly graphic depiction of rape, pedophilia, and necrophilia, earning nationwide bans in countries like Spain, Germany, and Australia, and I was hard-pressed to disagree. I'm reviewing it as a curiosity, primarily because of the media attention it received, but in all honesty, I don't quite know how I'd feel if I recommended it to anyone outright. Take your chances, but beware; this is most certainly not for the faint of heart.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I am a resident of Cincinnati, OH, and this works for me! First of all I was simply looking for a device that I could hook my android or iPod touch up to, to stream Pandora, MOG and any other mp3 files/apps I have loaded on my phone or iPod touch, to hear the music through my factory car stereo system and this device does the job nicely! The USB and SD components are extras that I have yet to use. Simple to use, just plug and play, I plugged it in the 12V slot, tuned my radio to the station that was on the FM transmitter at the time and attached my android to the transmitter with the included input wire and the sound came through my car speakers beautifully! Plus this was a more budget friendly and frustration free alternative verses having to pay for installation of either an aux input adapter or a totally new stereo system to be added to my 2007 vehicle, and take the chance of loosing the radio control functions connected to my steering wheel. I have tried other FM transmitter devices and have returned or discontinued use because of the frustration and disappointment in there quality. This FM transmitter does exactly what I want it to, all static & frustration free! I can control the volume via my android, iPod touch, car stereo, and the FM transmitter itself, so I can get the volume that I desire. I am convinced this FM transmitter really works! And it does the job flawlessly!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The Harry Potter franchise boasts a rare and elite distinction: all of its films are great -- a pretty incredible accomplishment made all the more impressive when you consider the series is eight films strong. And boy, did it go out with a bang! After Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 left some audiences a tad unsatisfied, Deathly Hallows, Part 2 drew the popular saga to a close in style. Deathly Hallows, Part 2 picks up where the last film left off, with Harry and Co. in pursuit of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and culminates in the epic good-vs.-evil battle we've all been waiting for. I found few things to dislike about the final film, it's a thrilling, powerfully acted, and visually dazzling piece of entertainment, a worthy conclusion to one of this generation's most popular and globally beloved epics.

You can have all my money - please don't stop releasing records and performing concerts!
B004HO6I2E|1.0|Ah, the classic body-switch movie, a staple of screwball comedy. That well never quite runs dry, but every once in a while it does pump out some rancid sewage and try to pass itself on as San Pellegrino. Unfortunately for all those involved, The Change-Up ended up resembling the former rather than the latter. The premise is all too familiar: longtime buddies Mitch, a swinging bachelor, and Dave, a married lawyer with kids, have grown to become polar opposites of each other, and each of them envies the other's lot in life. When a freak accident causes them to switch bodies, they learn that the grass isn't necessarily always greener on the other side. Sound predictable and formulaic? That's what I thought, too. Though there's some fun to be had in watching both Reynolds and Bateman play against type, the conceit wears thin quickly, and there just isn't enough left in the script to make the film memorable. At 1 star, The Change-Up is a missed opportunity to do something fun with a familiar premise, and the talented cast is all it has going for it.
0865478570|5.0|I learned Spanish at a very early age, and still remember some of it, thought the adage \\"use it or lose it\\" definitely applied. I can still read it, but falter at speaking it. The section in this book about \\"mother\\" vs. \\"native\\" vs. \\"educational\\" tongue hit me upside the head like a baseball bat.  I have been studying Russian, and it has been difficult - I am in my 40's and my neural circuits are pretty much hard wired at this point. This book reinforces what I have been suspecting: that direct translation is what is tripping me up. I was not thinking of concepts, I was thinking about \\"what the hell does that mean in English again?\\".  A very, VERY good book to read for people that are embarking on a learning course, especially involving a language so foreign to English.
B005DR64OQ|1.0|Those who are intent on scrutinizing Nicolas Cage's career as he takes role after role in films of ALL sorts may want to give this one a look, if only for a few more of his trademark freakout moments. Helmed by Joel Schumacher and co-starring Nicole Kidman, Trespass follows a wealthy young family who are taken hostage in their mansion by extortionists looking to score on a home invasion run. Unfortunately, the film simply relies on too many familiar elements from other similar films like Panic Room, rendering the tension ineffective, and is far too nasty and aggressive to be entertaining. It's not much of a surprise that the film opened almost exactly two weeks ago and is now already finding its way to home video.
B005J0VPNC|1.0|I have to say I LOVED LOVED THIS APP the first few days ... then the strangest thing started happening, if I was taking pictures with the app, and then switched to the regular camera the images were being distorted and washed out ... half  the image would look fine and then it looked like other images were superimposed over the top, the colors smeared. A good comparison is the effect of taking a picture with objects in motion. This RUINED so many pictures that I took of a friends wedding (using a HTC Incredible btw). So I uninstalled the app. Since then, every now and again, as it did this past weekend with pictures I took of my son being supercute ... the same washed out effect happens ... had my incredible over 19 months and this NEVER EVER happened until I added this app ... i wish there was a way to stop this from happening. PLEASE HELP
B001HN6922|1.0|Though I gave it 3 stars, 2006's Cars is widely regarded as Pixar's least impressive film, especially when considering the fact that every other entry in the animation studio's canon has earned 5 stars from me. What, then, prompted this sequel, when there would appear to be so many other worthy entries to expand into franchises? Some argue that it was a money grab, seeing as how Cars merchandise has been disgustingly popular with the kiddies. Others argue that... Well, okay, I haven't heard much in the way of a counterargument, considering Cars 2 went on to become the first 1 star movie for Pixar. This time around, Lightning McQueen and his buddy Mater do a bit of globetrotting for a World Grand Prix, during which Mater becomes unwittingly involved in an international espionage operation. Despite the film's fantastic visual flourishes, Cars 2 lacks compelling storytelling, making it possibly the first Pixar film not to appeal successfully to adults as much as children. The cast, which includes Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, John Turturro, and more, is great, though, and kids will undoubtedly love it, so there you go.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Let's see, this application makes weather forecasts from two different sources, shows barometric pressure trends, sunrise/sunset, has 10-day forecast, gives numeric precipitation prediction, has a plethora of widgets, gives moon phase, wind speed, UV, and has a cool hour-by-hour forecast clock the likes of which I've never seen.  This is a really great application!  You can have a whole host of forecast locations preset, or simply have the app use your GPS to determine the weather where you are.  There's nothing about this application I don't like; I only gave it four stars because I'm a really tough grader, the application isn't free, it doesn't come with a tidal prediction function (which may be a bit much to ask), and it doesn't cause my Samsung Charge to excrete gold dust from the speaker hole.  All said, if you use weather forecast information, this application is well worth the price.
B003Y5H574|3.0|Steve Carell's big screen career thus far has been quite fruitful for him, but though the talented actor has already notched a few starring roles, Crazy, Stupid, Love. marks the first one since The 40 Year Old Virgin to be good. Carell plays Cal Weaver, a family man suffering from marital problems who befriends smooth-talking womanizer Jacob in order to get back into the dating game. Soon, however, Jacob himself begins to earnestly fall for Hannah, and both he and Cal must lean on each other for support through their tumultuous love lives. With a supporting cast that also includes Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, and Kevin Bacon, Crazy, Stupid, Love. charmed me, it's unabashedly sweet even if it doesn't quite live up to the \\"crazy\\" part of its title. While it may not necessarily elicit the biggest laughs of the year, it should make for a pleasant rom-com elevated by a terrific cast.

B005IZLPKQ|3.0|Captain America put the finishing touches on a triumphant summer for Marvel that included hits Thor and X-Men: First Class and successfully bridged the gap to next summer's much anticipated Avengers movie. Directed by Joe Johnston and starring a surprisingly heroic Chris Evans in the title role, Captain America plays out the origin story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny but determined military recruit who signs up for a secret super-soldier program, only to be faced by the threat of the evil HYDRA organization and its leader Red Skull, another recipient of the super-soldier treatment. Though I was initially a bit unsure what exactly to expect from the film, I enjoyed it. It's solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment with pulpy action, a retro vibe, and some fine acting performances. Even if Captain America wasn't your favorite comic hero, chances are you'll have a pretty good time with this movie.

B005J4TLN4|4.0|One of the films that made a lot of noise at this year's South by Southwest festival was an indie sci-fi gem from the UK called Attack the Block. Produced by some of the same folks who brought audiences Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Attack the Block centers on a gang of street kids living on a council estate who take it upon themselves to face off against an invading alien species that has crash landed in their hood. Impeccably stylish and full of wit, I enjoyed the hell out of it and marked first-time director Joe Cornish as one to watch. If Attack the Block's themes and pedigree pique your interest, you'll more than likely find this a worthy pickup or rental.

I gave it 2 stars because there were certain parts that were good such as *SPOILERS*:  -The wedding  -We got to read about Jacob's point of view  -Jacob gets his happy ending (a twisted ending but still)  -Bella kind of saves the day in the end, which is good because she's been so 'helpless' in all the earlier books  -Charlie finds happiness in the end, and he can stay in Bella's life after she has become a vampire  -The wolves and Cullen's become friends  -Their 'defeat' of the Royal vampire family  But then there were a lot of bad stuff such as *SPOILERS*:  -The incredibly isolated and depressing honeymoon  -No description whatsoever of Bella's and Edward's wedding night  -Unrealistic that Edward and Bella can have intercourse when Stephenie keeps referring to his body as 'cold marble' (imagine what his 'thing' feels like. Ouch!)  -Bella becoming pregnant (unrealistic and stupid)  -The nasty birth scene  -Name of their child  -Jacob imprinting on their child  -Edward's lack of personality (Stephenie has completely turned his character into someone with no personality)  -Edward being so serious all the time  -Stephenie completely took the excitement out of the Cullen's, making their lives appear very isolated and boring  -The incredibly boring way Bella first sees the world as a vampire  -Too many pages in the book, and it was mostly just blah-blah-blah  No, I wouldn't recommend this book. I've only bought the first 3 ones because I'm just going to pretend that this one doesn't exist.
B004KKX80A|5.0|This was a great purchase. My son had been wanting this beyblade for a while and he will be so excited when he gets it.  The product was shipped on time and in good condition.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I loved this book. *SPOILERS* It was a lot of fun when Bella kept trying to 'sneak away' to see Jacob, and Edward kept trying to hinder her from going. It was exciting that Victoria had amassed an entire army of newborns to fight the Cullens. I thought the fight scene was really good. I laughed so hard when Bella almost begged Edward to have sex with her. That really cracked me up. I also liked that we got to know the Cullens a bit better in this book. I liked the scene in the mountains when Jacob and Edward talked. There was a lot of drama and excitement in this book. It was fun when Bella kissed Jacob and Edward found out about it. It was fun when Jacob and Edward nearly got into a fight and Charlie got between them (what was he thinking?? hehe). Yeah, it was a great read. I loved all the books in this series except the last one which was a HUGE disappointment. Highly recommend this one though! :)
1439192812|5.0|This is a great review of the various concepts that have mystified people for centuries. It's obviously aimed at a younger audience which I am not, but it is still an enlightening and entertaining book. If you have a science background, don't expect to learn anything ground breaking but it will help tighten up whatever scientific knowledge you do have. I think this is a good book to read to your children, who may need some explanation of some of the ideas. I would compare reading this book to watching a really good science documentary on nova or the science channel: not too technical, but scientific enough to be intriguing and educational.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This is much more than a movie - it is an artistic masterpiece with beautiful cinematography, sequenced music, and an incredible story and message.  Each time I watch this movie I peel through another layer.  It is stimulating, beautiful and thought provoking.  Some of the messages and themes are up to interpretation; however that is its strength - you are not simply \\"spoon-fed\\" a story like most of Hollywood movies.  Overall, this tops one of my all time favorite movies, however I would argue it is more than just a movie - it's art.  I have enjoyed all of Terrance Malik's movies and I commend him on his latest work.
0316069884|5.0|This book was fantastic, if you have even considered what it takes to put meat on your plate.  I was beginning to think about this and other issues when I stumbled upon this book (it was the Duke Class of 2015 Summer Reading), and it totally changed my thinking and opened my eyes to a whole world of ethics I had never considered.    A great read, and a great way to begin thinking about food, an area where we will need to think about in the upcoming years.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Ok this is too weird and I was wondering if this happenend to anyone else. A Study In Scarlet part 1 is fine. Part 2 is The Book of Morman. Really...The Book Of Mormon. Could this be a Kindle collector's item?:)
B004EPZ070|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and was excited to see it was being made into a movie. It follows the book pretty closely. The addition of John Krasinski as Ethan (he lives in London for the entire book) was a real treat. I loved Gennifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson was a fabulous Darcy and played out her self-centeredness perfectly.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Don't be swayed by the elitists. This film is just as worthy as the swedish version (which is also great), and the musical score is superior.  Kodi Smit-Mcphee and Chloe Moretz give outstanding performances.  My only quibble is that a few of the CGI effects were poorly done.  It is rare that I watch a movie more than once, but I found this one so captivating that I ended up viewing it three times within a month.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Have to long press for options other than smiley, but long press also inserts a carriage return. Please fix because SwiftKey is the best otherwise!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|The true test of an action film is if the viewer can stop thinking and just believe it while watching.  This film definitely did that for me:  it is fast, scary, and for the most part just realistic enough.  A few scenes are over the top, but not many.  Spy action films can also be very fun in that they keep you guessing as to what is really going on, with clues, sudden choices, and shocking revelations.  This filkeeps you guessing more or less to the very end, changing the viewer's mind not once, but twice or even three times in what may be a record.  Good guys become bad guys and vice versa, but multiple times!  Even some (admittedly crude) politics come into it.  Of course, there is also a question of style, that is, how cool the characters are, how sexy.  Here again, Jolie proves herself a gifted, charismatic screen presence, one of the greatest woman character actors at the moment as well as a star.  She is sleek, strong, and sinuous, exuding both sensuality and hard concentration.  These elements work in this film eminently well.<br /><br />However, at the deeper level, that of emotional identification with the character, the film is weaker.  Sure, Salt has connections with her past and present that make themselves felt, but I did not empathize much with her mission and plight.  To be sure, that isn't required in an action film, but it is in the very best of the genre.  The supreme masterpiece that does this is the Bourne Trilogy, which reached a new level of realistic action with an emotional overlay.  Bourne sets a new standard that the new James Bond series accomplishes with some success for an old character, but Salt doesn't quite reach it - yet.<br /><br />Recommended.  I hope it becomes a series, because its potential is high and with a better script, we can expect much more.
0571283578|4.0|Jane Austen wrote only six novels; far too few for readers who love her work. An Austen story ends with a wedding (or two), and readers can't help but speculate about how the couples' married life might have played out. No surprise, then, that so many authors have written, and are still writing, sequels to and reworkings of Austen's novels. We even have \\"mash-ups\\" like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters. Now, famed mystery writer P. D. James has joined in with a sequel that is also a murder mystery.<br /><br />Death Comes to Pemberley begins six years after the close of Pride and Prejudice. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet are happily married and living at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy's Derbyshire estate, with their two young sons and Mr. Darcy's sister, Georgiana. The new book begins with a short prologue reviewing the action of Pride and Prejudice and the six years before this novel's story begins.  We then enter the great house at Pemberley on the night before the Darcys are to host their annual autumn ball. Elizabeth's sister, Jane, and Jane's husband, Charles Bingley, are already in residence, along with Darcy's cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. A new character, Mr. Alveston, is also a guest.<br /><br />The hosts and guests are ready to retire for the night when a carriage comes careening up the drive, the door bursts open and out hurdles Lydia, Jane and Elizabeth's drama queen of a younger sister, screaming like a banshee that her husband, Wickham, has been shot and killed in Pemberley's woodland. (When you heard there was a Pride and Prejudice sequel with a murder, didn't you just *know* that Lydia would take center stage in the hubbub?)  Because a murder has taken place on Darcy's estate and affects his family-no matter how distant the Darcys have always tried to keep from Wickham and Lydia-Darcy is necessarily involved in the resolution of the case.  And, of course, the personal connections make the case an emotional trial for Darcy, Elizabeth and their extended families.<br /><br />Author James hasn't merely dressed up a mystery in Austen style. Her book is very much an exploration of Elizabeth and Darcy's characters, emotional lives and their marriage. James presents a nuanced portrait of the two that is different from the pert Elizabeth and imperious Darcy of the screen. Elizabeth's new position as chatelaine of the vast estate of Pemberley and her duty to her husband, his family, their staff and the property have matured her and made her more conciliatory to troublesome characters, even the likes of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Darcy is presented as a sometimes brooding and self-doubting man, but one who is determined to learn from his past errors and make a happy life for his family.<br /><br />Unlike many authors of Austen sequels, James hasn't populated her story with a horde of new characters. Of course, there are some new characters, but James shows, through the course of the book, that she is well-acquainted with Pride and Prejudice and the other Austen novels, and she skillfully works events and characters from those books into this one. The way she does this is true to the characters and even throws new light on their behavior and circumstances in Pride and Prejudice. She does this so well that from now on I will always think of some of the Pride and Prejudice characters as having the back story that James gives them.<br /><br />James's writing style captures the cadences of Austen and there are several passages that recall Austen's tart and ironic observations. Here is just one, about Charles Bingley's sister Caroline: \\"Miss Bingley was particularly anxious at this time not to leave the capital. Her pursuit of a widowed peer of great wealth was entering a most hopeful phase. Admittedly, without his peerage and his money he would have been regarded as the most boring man in London, but one cannot expect to be called 'your grace' without some inconvenience.\\"<br /><br />As a sequel toPride and Prejudice, Death Comes to Pemberley is a satisfying effort. As a mystery, it is not conventional and probably not what most of us expected when we first heard about the book. Mr. Darcy doesn't suddenly turn detective; in fact, nobody does. But the way the story plays out is more true to the time and place, and to Austen's style, than it would have been if James had tried to bolt a detective story onto an Austen sequel. I should note, though, that this Austenworld authenticity and the lack of a detective story may mean that the book disappoints some mystery readers, including some P. D. James fans.<br /><br />As a lover of Jane Austen, if not a complete Austen fanatic, I was happy to spend this time at Pemberley, revisiting the characters from Pride and Prejudice and seeing their later lives depicted in a way that is faithful to the depth and complexity that Austen gave them. I was disappointed that there wasn't more time spent with Darcy and Elizabeth, but that's more of a quibble than a serious criticism.g effort.

B0055EAJ7A|4.0|This movie definitely makes it onto my favorites list! Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, does a great job with making the role his. While I would not rate this movie better than Iron Man or even Captain America, it does meet standards. As for the actual product - who couldn't love it. With the blu ray 3D, blu ray, DVD, and digital copy I can watch this movie anywhere! And with the money I saved on Amazon, I can get more of my favorite movies. Bottom line, if you love superhero movies or have a desire to be Thor than buy this movie!

B004EPZ08E|1.0|I thought this movie would be hilarious, but it was a total dud.  Jennifer Aniston was hotter than hell and was the only reason to watch the movie.  Her coworker in the movie played by Charlie Day was absolutely horrible.  The guy does not talk, he yells constantly.  Don't expect to see him in any movies in the future.  Just not a good movie at all!
B000YMQI6E|5.0|This movie is well worth your time.. I would probably give it 4/5 stars but since the overall review for this is only like 3.3, I gave it a 5 for the boost.  I really enjoyed it.  Great acting, well-filmed, and interesting plot development.
B003QNXPUK|3.0|It comes down to which you value more:  protection or aesthetics.  I've used an iPhone 3gs with a Zagg screen (not the wrap around) for two years, and I've just installed another on my new Motorola Atrix.  It is tough and highly scratch resistant, just as advertised.  It has a mildly gummy feel, and you can dent it with your fingernail, but it bounces back.  It doesn't interfere with screen operations at all.  And, it stays put.  No problems with it peeling or anything of that nature. If I'd stop here, I'd give it a five, but . . .  It's really, really tricky to install in a bubble-free manner.  I've lived with some permanent bubbles on my iPhone screen for two years.  This is only a cosmetic problem, and it has no effect on operations.  But, if looks are important to you, beware.    When I peeled the two year old Zagg off my iPhone, I noticed that it had yellowed slightly.  Almost a tobacco color, but it's been in a smoke-free environment all this time.  I never noticed this while it was on the screen, but it's something to know.  The good news is that the installation on my new phone went a lot better. Just one or two small, inconspicuous bubbles.  In short, I bought another one despite the tricky installation process, and I'd recommend it if you put screen protection above looks.
B004ZWKWQQ|4.0|I bought this for my husband as one of his birthday gifts since he loved Legos as a child.  It is such fun and takes time to build but its still enjoyable even for an adult.  It does have a lot of pieces and the manual is 2 books so it is time consuming but perfect now for the approaching winter months.

B005I64U5C|1.0|If your a real fan of Green Lantern the movie will be a letdown. Hal Jordan is just totally miscast. He was not some irresponsible dolt, but instead was a serious and tense character.<br /><br />The Character of Hector, secondary villain was total unnecessary. His point in the movie was what? So he can read your mind, and throw stuff around like some second class Jedi, no match for anyone. He was just killed off anyway, lame.<br /><br />The whole movie was just too campy. Should have taken a page from the \\"Dark Knight\\" and made a franchise like character out of Green Lantern. Really blew it.<br /><br />On the plus side, the movie does look great.

B005AUWXZ0|2.0|When I see a good idea come along, I support it. A digital copy of a movie (mp4, avi, wma, etc) is a wonderful idea. I watch all my movies on my computer or one of three iOS devises. I don't even own a dvd player outside my desktop. I saw this pack at Costco and had to have it. I could have saved money buy I like the fact that it came with a digital copy (I also don't want to have to re-buy the movie if I ever buy a Blu Ray player). I get home and pop it in and then got a headache. It was confusing with passwords and signing up for a rewords points account and... Aw Hades. I found it easier to just back up the DVD player disc to the desktop where I want them. I will never buy another combo pack from Disney for the Digital Copy again, ever! I bought the movie, and I should be able to play it on any devise that can play movies. Advertising a Digital Copy disc for use as stated on the back of the packaging: \\"Watch it Anytime, Anywhere on your Computer and Portable Device\\" is wrong. I still haven't been able to make that disc work on my computer except in itunes, LOCKED down into itunes. To watch the movie in my media player of choice I had to switch discs back to the regular DVD.  As for the movie. I LOVE it, just as much or more than my 2 1/2 year old. Buy it, Watch it, Love it. I'd give the movie 5 stars but the combo pack that it comes in a -1 star, so I just averaged it to 2 stars.  Also, if I read it right the Digital Copy disc will be locked down to your computer. Yes singular computer, not computers. If you want to be able to play it in your laptop then activate it on your laptop. If you activate it through you desktop you will not be able to play it on your laptop (or vis versa).  That is if I read it right but I can't really test it out because I haven't even been able to play it on my desktop. yet.  A few words to Disney:   Make it easy to put movies that people pay for onto their computers, because if people start looking around to find out how to do it theywill find out how to just download the movie for free. Not everyone is going to be as honest as I am trying to be. Dishonest people will be dishonest you can't keep them from doing it, they're smarter than you.  Just make the 10 cent piece of plastic with a wma, mp4, avi, mov and whatever other format will fit on it, if people want to share it, they will anyway.
B005QN3ANK|5.0|Aqua has always been a favourite of mine and this album proves to be a spectacular comeback album for Aqua! At first,when I heard of a third studio album to happen,I expected something simular to \\"Back To The 80s\\",but while they did resemble the tracks of \\"Greatest Hits\\",these 11 new songs prove that Aqua is ready to take on the music world,using the same electro pop sound that many other artists use today while keeping some of the original charm that always made Aqua so unique in the pop market.  Whether a longtime fan of Aqua or a newcommer,you will definatly love this new album. Aqua is definatly back for good!
B004EPYZP8|4.0|Sometimes, a pretty boy actor doesn't get interesting until he's developed a few more wrinkles on his face, gravitas on his mug, suggesting a life having lived. Of late, Matthew McConaughey has been dismissed by naysayers as a good-looking huckster, grinning that toothy grin, flexing those ripped abs. And he hasn't done himself any favors with his recent cinematic outings (GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST, really?). THE LINCOLN LAWYER, adapted from Michael Connelly's novel, should get his critics off his back some. It's a corker of a legal thriller, and McConaughey hasn't been this watchable in years.<br /><br />McConaughey plays Mick Haller, Los Angeles's slickest criminal defense attorney, the sort of sleazy legal practitioner that Atticus Finch longs to take behind the woodshed. Mick, who works out of the back seat of his classic Lincoln Town Car, has sold out a long time ago. He doesn't give an ef if a guy is guilty or not as long as the money's good. He lists on his rolodex some of L.A.'s shadiest lowlifes. Although, this time out, he's landed a posh client (Ryan Phillippe) accused of assault and attempted murder, except that this uppercrust young gent claims his innocence. But they all say they're innocent, ain't that so? Mick Haller regards this as a slam-dunk case. The rest of us know better. Strap in for a rollercoaster ride of ruses, runarounds, and reversals.<br /><br />It's a solid supporting cast. I am so glad Marisa Tomei got cast instead of some vapid model-type. Tomei is a real-looking woman and beautiful. She plays Mick Haller's fierce rival in court, a tough prosecutor as well as his ex-wife and the mother of his daughter. When the chips are down, she becomes Mick's most steadfast anchor. William H. Macy again makes lemonade out of lemon with his otherwise-would've-been-blah part of Mick's investigator. John Leguizamo does his usual squirrelly thing as a bail bondsman who tips off Mick to this plum case (but even that's a lie). In just a few short scenes Michael Pe&ntilde;a provides one of the film's most sobering moments as he transitions from Mick's weepy panic-struck client to a hardened, dead-eyed convict. Josh Lucas, whom I always regarded as something of a McConaughey look-alike, goes up against McConaughey in court and he's pretty workmanlike, but not bad.<br /><br />There's enough twisty material here to make you lean into the screen. As Mick unearths deception after deception, he begins to suspect that his rich client may well be guilty (but is he?). One knock against the plot is that it does seem a bit too contrived that one of Mick's old cases happens to tie into this new one. There's a nasty, low-down feel to this story, a scruffy edginess, and it grips you. McConaughey invests a measure of grit and slime into his performance, and I really enjoyed it. Check out his Mick Haller, sly as a serpent, fast-talking, deal-making, working all the angles, scruples gathering dust on the shelf. Except that there may be a twinge of righteousness still left in Mick Haller which might make him turn a corner. Or is that another red herring? THE LINCOLN LAWYER doesn't achieve the heights of THE VERDICT or A FEW GOOD MEN, but it does what it sets out to do. It is a ripping legal thriller and comes at you with attitude. It is hopefully the first in a film franchise. After all, Michael Connelly's written four novels starring our morally grey counselor. And McConaughey's got them wrinkles now. Take advantage of that, yo.Michael Pe&ntilde;a provides one of the film's most sobering moments as he transitions from Mick's weepy panic-struck client to a hardened, dead-eyed convict.

0393325172|4.0|I was a bit apprehensive about starting this book, because all of the people I'd known who had loved it had been men. I wasn't sure whether or not it would hold much appeal for me as a woman. But once I got into it, I found it difficult to put down. The storyline is engaging, the characters are richly drawn and interesting, and the historical detail is convincing.<br /><br />Certainly, I found a lack of strong female characters, but that was made up for by the depth and variety of the male characters I met with. The daring but socially clueless captain, the dry and witty doctor who enjoys chopping things up,  the impassioned and high minded lieutenant - each character shows unique strengths and foibles. Even the minor characters are memorable: I particularly love the young seaman who composes poems about different aspects of the ship.<br /><br />I admit to skimming some of the abundance of technical information about ships and early 19th century naval practices. While there was nowhere near the amount of technicality as in, say, [[ASIN:B003GCTQ7M Moby-Dick]], it could still be overwhelming at times. I could see enjoying looking everything up on a second or third reading, but on the first reading I found it to be helpful to keep going with the story. The battle scenes were quite exciting and suspenseful - even without looking up the unfamiliar terminology.<br /><br />One of the things I most appreciated about this book was that the author didn't feel the need to \\"baby\\" the reader. Historical references and sailing terminology are left for the reader look up. At times the story jumps from scene to scene without obvious transition, and the reader has to figure out what's happened. It makes for an engaging reading experience and a tighter novel - I appreciated the author cutting down on unneeded explanation and imposition into the story.<br /><br />Overall, I was very impressed. For women with an interest in history and a willingness to overlook the messy lives of sailors when they happen to be on shore, it's quite an engaging read.it's quite an engaging read.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|I've seen reviews saying that the region free blu-rays do not always work.

0446547654|3.0|I loved the early Nicholas Sparks, and a few of the recent ones.  But this was just too predictable.  Why does he always have to kill someone off?  It's as if he's trying to see just how many kleenex you can go through.  Is it going to be a 1 kleenex box book or 2? As I was finishing this I kept thinking to myself surely he's not going to have it end this way , but yep he did. I guess I liked the characters, or I would have given it only 2 stars, just not the ending.
0393064476|5.0|Wonderful book for those interested in history, literature, theology, and philosophy. The great amount of historical knowledge required to cover this small obscure (but monumental) event in history is incredible. Great story and great reading. Covers one of the little understood milestones of Western civilization that is the basis of modern thinking.

B005OCFHHK|3.0|Obviously I have not viewed these movies yet, but I wanted to comment on what one person said about the UK versions.  It does look like the basic collection is a better deal than this US collection.  But be careful and read the entire description to make sure you are getting what you think you are!  I was ready to buy the larger, 19 disc collection which included DVD copies also, but decided to read the description one more time before placing my order.  That's when I found out the DVDs in the numbered collection would have been useless to me, because they are coded region 2 (which I assume is not usable here - I don't know the region numbering scheme but I do know we aren't in the same region as the UK).  Only the blue rays are usable in the U.S.  If ordering for use here, order the basic set since it appears to be the same as the blu ray discs included in the numbered set.

B005MYEQ9U|3.0|I hope the Met puts out this opera on DVD as I liked the production a bit better than this one from Vienna.  I love Garanca and she had to bow out of the Met's run due to pregnancy so I bought this for her performance as much as for Anna's.  The singer in the role of Henry wasn't as impressive as the Russian in the Met's version but the Russian singer of J. Seymore wasn't as good as Garanca.  The sets for the Met production were far superior as were the costumes.  I do love this opera and recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to hear great singing and I'm glad I have it in the collection.  It will do unless the Met issues theirs on DVD, then this one may sit on the shelf more often.  It was Anna's debut in the role and I though it excellent - but in the Met's - she was just stunning!!
0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus, is Erin Morgenstern's debut Novel. It is hard to believe.<br /><br />The novel is a complex work, often, especially at the beginning, composed of what seem to be vignettes instead of chapters. As one progresses through the book the the vignettes become more cohesive. I was out on a friend's sail boat when I understood the real magnificence of the book and thought of an analogy: When I was a teen I spent the summer in Spain and many of the older women in the town we stayed in, passed the afternoon making lace. To me, it seemed like magic--pins on a pillow attached to wooden sticks the women tossed around the way a dealer in Las Vegas handles playing cards. What seems to be merely a potential tangled mess and all but incomprehensible is, through the lace maker's skill, turned into fabric by what, to the untrained eye looks like nothing less than magic.<br /><br />This novel is like making lace. Morgenstern takes these many, seemingly disparate threads and with what must be a magical skill itself, turns it into a book filled with wonder.<br /><br />The Night Circus is actually about a circus. And, the circus is nothing that could exist in our world. Indeed, to me it is impossible that the entirety lived in Morgenstern's mind. As I read, Morgenstern reminded me of Jorge Luis Borges.<br /><br />The actual circus, the Cirque des Rêves, (The Circus of Dreams) is managed through the energy of several people. There is no spoiler here. From the first page magic is intrinsic to the story. As fantasy it is not meant to be substituted for reality but is allegorical.  Magic, love, anger, selflessness and selfishness are acted upon and all result in serious unforeseeable outcomes. But, whenever we play with fate it's likely to have unforeseen consequences. In a world governed by scientific thought every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In a magical world every action has an infinite number and type of reactions.<br /><br />There are two characters we come to know best: Celia and Marco. Their fates have been manipulated, cruelly for what could be called entertainment or a trial. We come to know corollary characters as well, The Allen Twins, Poppet ad Widget, the young boy from Massachusetts, Bailey Clarke whose first taste for the circus brought him astonishing choices, the two masters whose feud has resulted in the manipulation of Celia's and Marco's lives and endangering of the entire circus family.<br /><br />The circus itself will enchant and delight you almost as much as it does the people in the story who attend it. It transcends the laws of physics.<br /><br />There are slow parts and some of the more atmospheric vignettes could go. I was not sure I really understood the climax of the story; or maybe it was more that it didn't turn out as I hoped it would. Actions have consequences.<br /><br />The prose itself is beautiful as well. This may be Morgenstern's first novel but it is not her first story--it cannot be. As I read, the voice reminded me of Jorge Luis Borges, in particular the Circular Ruins. Morgenstern's story is perhaps not as dark as, and is certainly more accessible than Borges' work.<br /><br />The Night Circus is different from the more traditionally structured books I normally read, so I actually had to pay a bit more attention and not depend on the devices and character types used in genre writing. The Night Circus straddles the \\"fissure\\" between literature and genre fiction. It is literary fiction but, because of the use of magic and psychic powers it is also fantasy.<br /><br />I Highly Recommend the book to lovers of fantasy fiction who want something a little different, meaning it is not Young Adult, Paranormal Romance or Urban Fantasy. I also Highly Recommend it to those who normally only read literary fiction, or who think that fantasy is all about whether vampires sparkle.ome to know best: Celia and Marco.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|I received this as a gift a few days ago, so I've only put a few hours into it, but I'm seriously digging it.  I never would have purchased this for myself, as I thought it would be pointless.  I never considered the ergonomics, apparently.    I had Mass Effect installed and it auto-detected and set up the profile for me.  I only had to customize ONE button before I was off and running.  The G13 is far more natural feeling than the typical keyboard (I have a Saitek Eclipse) and gives very high quality feedback.  The first night I gamed for 2 hours and never noticed any discomfort.    I have a MASSIVE mouse-pad (12x16) that is usually overlapped by my keyboard, which knocks out about 1/2 of the mousing surface since they both sit on the same keyboard tray.  Now I just put the keyboard on the top surface of the desk, put the G13 on the keyboard tray next to the mouse-pad (instead of overlapping it), and problem solved.  I don't remember the last time I was able to use my whole mouse-pad.  This is an excellent investment for any gamer.  I would imagine it would be even better for MMORPGs due to the 3 or 4 completely customizable profiles of macro keys.  The only negative point for me is the d-pad.  Not really of use for me, and doesn't feel natural or comfortable to keep my thumb on it, but it's there if I need it.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|Love it, absolutely love it !  I really enjoy the DVD's and hearing this album in Quad sound.  Looking forward to the other 2 Immersion Box Sets.
B003N9ASEI|3.0|Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was pretty good, not great.  I noticed some grain in a scene or two, which was okay.  The picture just wasn't real sharp and clear like a Blu-Ray should be.  But, I am satisfied, and don't feal \\"ripped off\\".  I give it an 8.0 out of 10.  The aspect ratio is 1.85:1, which filled my widescreen LCD.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was just okay, nothing special.  I didn't notice any surround sound or sub-woofer bass.  Everytime I paid attention to the sound, it was coming from the front center speaker.  I didn't even notice any sound coming from the front left and right speakers.<br /><br />The movie lasted one hour and 45 minutes.  I don't think it is as good as \\"The Blues Brothers\\".
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This has been my favorite movie since I was a kid and I could never find the original version until the diamond edition came out. I do not have a Blu-Ray player yet but I know I am getting one soon. The different versions made me choose this one, and the price couldn't be beaten. I love having the ability to watch on my iPod, computer, and television any time and will definitely enjoy this movie for years to come! Thanks Amazon!
B004LWZW24|5.0|Love this movie.  I suggest this one to friends and someone always comes back angry at me that I made them jump.  One friend had a nightmare about one of the characters.  Insidious goes back to those movies that made you think something is watching you but you cannot see it.  No need for a lot of blood & gore.  The suspenseful and out of this world weird scenes keeps you on the edge of your chair.  Great story too.
B005JSM5YW|4.0|Crushed upon learning that his wife of many years has cheated on him, 44 year old Cal (Steve Carell) immediately moves out of their house.  At this point, Cal isn't really interested in why Emily (Julianne Moore) cheated.  After all, they've been together since middle school and have never been with anyone else.  Cal decides to get back out there (there being where he's never been) and bumps into Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a playa' of the first magnitude.  Jacob agrees to coach Cal and eventually he has some success.  But Cal is never comfortable in the role of seducer-in-chief.  He's still in love with his wife.<br /><br />This is only one relationship interwoven in this nice romantic dramedy.  Jacob, not looking for anything other than nooky, finds a girl (Emma Stone) who 'can' resist him.  Naturally, he's more interested.  Then we have Cal and Emily's 13 year old son who has a major crush on his 17 year old babysitter, who in turn has a crush on Cal.  And of course there's Emily trying to figure out if there's anything of value between her and her work romance with David (Kevin Bacon) other than \\"banging\\" (Cal's favorite word).<br /><br />What appears to be complicated, in reality comes across very clear as the film unwinds. The directors (Glenn Ficarra, John Requa) do a good job walking the fine line between raunchy comedy, heartfelt romance and eventually a true love story.  It is also a rare movie that has a twist at the end that caught me by surprise.<br /><br />1-11-12 - Blu ray update:  The transfer is 2.40:1 and excellent detail, solid blacks and good skin color.  The DTS-HD MA mix is concentrated up front in this dialog heavy film, but has some nice musical surprises in the surrounds.  The extras are forgetable but the film is not.  Get it.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|By far the best keyboard on Android, last update killed my voice controls for texting on evo 4G, but overall a great app.
B005D0RDIE|1.0|Short & Sweet: The video quality is terrible. I know there may be a lot of smoke in Cleveland, but not as much as this video shows. During the dark passages from afar in the arena you can see some king of \\"Matrix\\" like effect in the background of the picture. It looks like it was already ripped to Xvid and posted to the web then upconverted to DVD. I can't wait to see the Blu-ray version. The video will probably still suck horribly, but maybe the audio will be even better.<br /><br />This was a major major disappointment on the same day as the Pink Floyd Wish You Were Here Immersion boxed set.<br /><br />Today's Rush releases are the worst thing ever released in their catalog even worse than the Vapor Trails mastering.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Then this is not it.  As others have pointed out ad nauseum this doesn't include a tried and true digital copy.  It's a copy with \\"conditions\\".  It's a new secondary market that has been created out of thin air for those that are foolish enough to play their game.  Do yourself a favor and pass this version/release up and wait for one that isn't a slap in the face to the consumers.  Also, I must wonder why 3D isn't out as well.  They have truly made this a great release to: A, stop the 3D crowd from an automatic purchase to B, looking into the reasons surrounding this release.  Why is it not available now, day one, and who exactly is this Ultra-Violet gimmick been setup by?  How ridiculous this all is.

B00000I5Y6|5.0|If you just heard Kansas's most popular hits, Carry on Wayword Son, Point of Know Return, and Dust in the Wind, and are curious of what their others songs are, this is a good place to start. Every song on this album I have given a 4 star or 5 star rank. In my opinion, The Pinnacle is the best song on this album.   Kansas has a lot of great songs. I don't know why they left out all the songs from their debut album \\"Kansas\\". This is a great cd to get if you are new with Kansas. If you do like the majority of the songs in this album, then I would consider buying some of their other albums starting with Masque, Leftoverature, and Point of Know Return.
0553805371|4.0|In The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking and Leondard Mlodinow point the way toward a world of pure theory based on abstract mathematics -- a mental universe that mainly physicists inhabit. At least, that's my impression. I'm just glad there are physicists who let us know what's going on in their world -- or model-dependent mindset -- every once in a while with books like this one.     Overall, this book is effective at bringing casual readers up to speed with current physics. I have to agree with others who found it a bit lacking regarding M-theory, however. Like a quantum fluctuation, it comes and goes only to pop back up on the last page of the book. As a theme, though, it ties the book together, just as it's supposed to do with the forces of the universe.  One thing I noticed is that the authors rely quite heavily on Richard Feynman. His theory of the \\"sum over histories\\" of the quantum universe is needed, it seems, to disprove the idea of a single moment of creation and thus dispense with a creator. The only difference is I'm not so sure they're joking ...  Even if we are nothing more than \\"biological machines, \\" as the authors phrase it, I think it's nice that they are gracious enough to grant us the \\"effective theory\\" of free will. They seem to do this grudgingly, though, only because the actions of human beings are too complicated to quantify. According to the authors, just to predict what the trillions of atoms in my body are going to make me do next would require billions of years' worth of math. My wife would disagree, however. She thinks I'm completely predictable. (I know ... my jokes aren't any better than the ones in the book :-)  There are other effective theories that the authors left out that make being a biological machine worthwhile. These include effective theories of love, happiness, appreciation of beautiful sunsets, thrill of watching your team win the World Series, etc. But you don't really turn to science books for hope or comfort or peace of mind - -unless it's Carl Sagan.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This film boasts fine acting, fine directing, and a very human story line about GREED. The setting is deep in Mexico where three down-on-their luck Americans meet and participate in the search for gold. High in the mountains, they stumble upon some gold nuggets and follow the trail to an old mining site. Here they make camp, digging the gold out every day, and as they work, they get to know each other as well as their paranoia.<br /><br />Directed by John Huston and starring his father Walter Houston in an Oscar winning supporting role, the film propels Humphrey Bogart into stardom.<br /><br />The second disc is about John Huston and the films he made in his lifetime. This is most interesting. Commentary feature many actors and personalities close to the source and is hosted by Robert Mitchum.<br /><br />All in all, this set is definitely worth having.

Throw your old version away and get this - it's a different film.
1423140591|4.0|Son of Neptune by Rick Riordan<br /><br />In the son of Neptune, Percy has been brainwashed and sent to a Roman camp, based off of the Roman Gods. In his first week there he is picked to go on a quest by Mars, the Roman god of war, to free Thanatos.<br /><br />Thanatos is the god that controls the boundary between the real world and the underworld.  The giants who are servants of Gaia have imprisoned Thanatos, thus no monster can die permanently. Along with two friends, Hazel and Frank, Percy goes on a quest to free Thanatos, thus inspiring all of the dead monsters.<br /><br />However, Thanatos lies in Alaska, the only place on Earth that is unreachable by the gods. This means the three kids, along with their demigod powers, must rescue Thanatos alone. But it is not that easy. Alconeus, the Giant to kill Pluto, is guarding Thanatos. Gaia put him there, knowing full well someone would try to free him.<br /><br />There is a need for Frank, Hazel and Percy to complete this task quickly. A legion of monsters led by the giant Polybotes, is headed to destroy the camp. Since Polybotes was the giant made to battle Poseidon Percy has to free Thanatos, then return back to the comp in a matter of four days. This is when Polybotes was scheduled to attack.<br /><br />Percy, Frank, and Hazel, all have their unique attributes. Percy a son of Poseidon is the most powerful. He has control over everything to do with water, and has the most years of experience in combat. Something that differs him the most from the other two is his Greek origin. He was part of a Greek camp until he was brainwashed. Percy is the wittiest, and the most humorous character throughout the book. However, Gaia thinks she can control Percy and is invading his thoughts at every chance she gets.<br /><br />Hazel the youngest of the group, is a daughter of Pluto. She constantly has flashbacks to her previous life. She has the weakest power of the group. Normal children of Pluto are able to control the dead but some of them can create and manipulate precious metals. Hazel's power rarely comes into play throughout the story.<br /><br />Frank is the son of the war god, Mars. He is skilled with an arrow and spear. His only power is his ability to shapeshift. This comes in use when fighting Alconeus, and the Basalisks, serpentine creatures that spit poison. However Frank is resentful of his dad and hates the fact that the vicious war god is his dad. He comforts Hazel whenever she goes through traumatic flashbacks, and has a slight romantic interest with Hazel.<br /><br />This compelling, action-adventure story is very well written. The author, Rick Riordan, weaves humor into a suspenseful and action-filled plot. This essence of humor mixed with action and excitement is shown when they are nearly killed by the Hyperborean giant. Riordan fills the scene of narrowly escaping being crushed with excitement by exaggerating the tension with hyperboles and strong action verbs. This is happening along side the pure third grade humor of being flattened and stuck to a giant blue icy butt.<br /><br />This story has some violence in the form of demigods battling monsters. This book should be just fine, seeing as what a 6 year olds watch on TV these days. All in all, this is a great book, with action, suspense, and humor that suits all ages.l's power rarely comes into play throughout the story.   Frank is the son of the war god, Mars.

B0001611DI|5.0|George A Romero's Dawn of The Dead is without a doubt the definitive zombie film it is my favorite of the series.It has believable Characters with good personalities. The Zombkies are the most believable I have seen. The Gore Effects by Tom SAVINI are the  best he is the master of gore. Unlike the last one Night of the Living dead where it takes place in a house this movie takes place in a Shopping mall whats not to love about that? I like the fact that Romero didnt kill off all the cast like in the last film. I understand that people need too die in horror films but there has too be at least one surviver.This film gos one step further then the last film in terms of gore its pretty Believable. I was so impressed by it this film is so creepy and scary at times but I can relate too the cast with them trying too survive it all cause its basically Survival of the fitest in this film. if you dont watch  your back the zombies will get you!!!!!!!!This movie is such a rollercoaster ride I was intrigued by this film its one of my altime favorite horror films and one not too be missed.    This film is so unflinching in its realism its insane I love it.The perfect film too see with your buddies that like this genre.There are some Laughs too be had but for the most part George A Romero is pretty seriuos when it comes down too the Horror Genre. My favorite Part of this film was when the Zombies ate some of the biker Gang.The biker gang had it coming cause all they cared about in the mall was the things they didnt care about the people one bit.        Zombies come in all shapes and sizes in this film. I can imagine the amount of Controversy this movie must have had when it came out cause it just doesnt let up in terms of the Gore!!!!!! If you have a weak stomach this isnt the film for you but if you can  handle it this film is definately a must buy not a rental.At a little over 2 hours this film is the longest of Romero's Zombie films. This is a movie that I will watch untill theday I die its that good.Gearge Romero has definetely come a long way since he first started making movies and this film is definetly withoubt a doubt his best work yet.I found this movie too be Spectacular a must own.             The actors in this film were really good and did an exellent job portraying there characters I felt like this is something that was real because of how effective the gore effects of Tom Savini are that just shows that he knows how too make you question what you see. What more can i say other then this film is one for the masses of horror buffs every horror buff with the stomach for this movie and the patients to sit for at least 2 hours should go out right know and add this movie too there horror collection.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I first saw Avatar at the Movie theater in 3d and boy how I was impressed the visuals of this action/Scifi movie are incredible and its no surprise with the technology they used to make this movie and the huge budget this movie has. The  story is actually quit simple these blue smurff like people live in this jungle lets say they are afraid of people cause they have let them down before. This guys wants to be a test subject and see what its like too get meet these indigeniouse people of the forest. jack Sully is very interested in learning as much as he can about these creatures but unfurtunally the generall not only wants too learn about these people he wants to destroy them and there home planet.James Cameron is such  a great directer. I was so disapionted that this movie wasnt in 3d but its still a great movie non the less. My favorite part of this epic film is when the humans battle the smurff like people its just such an epi fight that you wont want too miss. I think that for the money put into this movie they coudn't have done a better job making it. I think that the actors ast to play the parts of each charactor are inccredibly gifted in what there doing. I have watched this movie over over 20 times its that fantastic!!!!!!!!!!! I find this movie too be incredibly long and I really like that about this film for being over 2 hours and 30 minutes its one of the longest movies yet to date    When I first saw it as I mentioned before I watched it with my mom and she normally doesnt like SciFi films but with all the hype out about this film she thought she would give it a try and boy my mom loved it.My older brother didn't like it but like with every movie no matter how great it is there is always gonna be some hatter hattin on it.For everybody that gave this film less  then 4 stars I think dont like scifi films but too each his or her own ause this is the most own movie of all time along with ountless others this movie stands on its own with everything it throwsat you yes there is some blood and some swearing but thats only too further the story and make the people look like true warriors this film is one of my altime favorites a must buy.My least favorite part which is hard too pick out of this incredible film is when the humans destroy the home tree too the smurff people but I love how in the end they wind up getting there reenge on them for what pain and destruction they hae caused to them. Dont you just like Scifi films?        This film in my mind should win 10 plus academy awards for being so great and incredible. This film I have heard is supposed to get a sequal. I hope james Cameron can outdo this film. With how great and spectacular he made it that wont be an easy task. What make the next movie over 3 hours and add more story to it and get more of a background on the blue people. This movie in my opionion will be remembered for ages and ages too come much like star wars a classic in every way imaginable.Avatar makes me wonder what it would be like if we had smurff like people on earth would they get along with us? Would they fear us? would they run from us? or would they be our friends?  This movie is one every movie buff should add too  his or her collection. At the movie theatre i saw this film out almost the whole theatre was jam packed with people that just gos too show you how magnificient and inredible this film truly is.I find Jacks new girlfriend to be quit the heroic one in this film        cause she doesnt run from trouble she knows how too take down the bad guys and is quit the catch this movie. I love the action in this movie and I find it too be so fast paced and stupendous.  The pacing in this film is great and well balanced I would like there too be 2 more sequels too this film cause it has such a great story that you could expand on    movie after movie until the audience watching it gets sick and tired of seeing blue people in movies. You will know this movie is even better when other directors make knockoffs of it that means its an idea that is guarenteed to do well. I find this film to be one of the best films of the 20th century incredible in every imaginable. A true sci fi buffs dream movie!!!!!!     The sets in this film are so cool and beutifull. The animals are both intrigingand scary at the same time Jack Sully soon realizes in this film what it means too be one with the blue people. He lets them down at first but they get over it and he soon enough later on in the film becomes part of the team because of won very wise and brave some would say stupid thing he did to win back there trust and fight bak against his own kind who lied too him about what they were all about. There will be revenge and the blue people reign supreme too the bitter end But at first they face a big loss too there home alas.

B00021HBGS|4.0|Our boys, 5 and 3, have enjoyed playing with these vehicles and roads for about a year.  They have a good time sticking them on the walls of the tub, the shower door and shower walls, and they do stick well.  There are many vehicles in the pack, and plenty roads.  I will say that over time, there has been less use of the roads, but the taxis, airplanes, police cars and buses are always a hit.  A good buy!

Standouts to me where Millenium for the Blind,  Deadly Nightshade,  and Never Dead.  Really there isn't a track to skip on the whole album.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is set in futuristic Panem, where 12 districts that formerly were the United States are ruled by a central capital city.  To keep the districts in line, the capital holds an annual hunger games tournament, where 2 tributes from each district must fight to the death in a highly controlled wilderness arena.  Our hero, Catniss Everdine, volunteers to be a tribute after her younger sister is selected for the games.  Catniss must use her street smarts and hunting skills to try to stay alive in the games.<br /><br />The Hunger Games was a fantastic read!  In fact, I believe it was one of the few \\"super\\" hype novels that I have read in recent memory that actually lived up to the buzz!  The novel is fast paced and well written, and it's first person narration allows the reader to feel like they are really in the arena with Catniss.  Fans of thrillers or dystopian novels should definitely check this out--it's certainly not a book just for young adult readers.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|As a fan of both Lou Reed and Metallica, I was really looking forward to this album.  After listening to \\"The View\\", I couldn't wrap my head around how bad it was.  Anyway, I still bought the album to give it a try.  There is nothing about this entire album that I like aside from the occasional riff.  I really, really wanted to like this album, but I just can't enjoy it.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|Usually I go on & on with an in depth opinion on things I take the time to review. There are plenty of other people on here doing that. Everyone will have their own opinion on the book based on their personal upbringing and morals.   What I take away from reading this book is that Steve Jobs was essentially an ass with almost zero empathy. He belittled others and treated almost everyone he ever met as if they were too stupid to know anything, even what they personally want. The guy drove around with no license plates on his vehicle, purposely parked regularly in handicapped parking spaces and publicly thought of himself as \\"special.\\" If he didn't have a ton of money & wind up making a shinny wiz-bang device people would treat a regular person with this qualities a completely different way. I don't care what devices he came up with. Someone else would have eventually made a touchscreen phone & tablet. These things were thought of by many many other people. No idea is original - ever. When you think you've come up with some great idea, count on the fact that in our world of 6 billion people, someone else has had that same exact thought already.   Yes, I hate Steve Jobs - Read the book - I don't see how you won't either.

B004EPZ084|2.0|I looked forward to seeing HORRIBLE BOSSES when I first saw the coming attraction trailer. What a great cast and everyone can relate to having a horrible boss or two in his or her career. The reviews were not so positive and I decided to wait for the DVD release. I know some reviewers loved the movie but I thought it was exceptionally vulgar and a total disappointment. It didn't fit the recent run of similar movies where the crass humor is funny and silly in a harmless way. I thought it would be fun to see good girl Jennifer Aniston in a bad girl role, but nothing seemed to work in this film.<br /><br />Three best friends set out to rid themselves of their horrible bosses. Along the way, they come in contact a \\"killer\\" played by Jamie Foxx. His character's name is so wildly vulgar and in bad taste that the name cannot even be mentioned in the review. The name becomes an ongoing joke. Kevin Spacey is the boss from hell..much like his character in SWIMMING WITH SHARKS. Jason Bateman, Colin Farrell and Donald Sutherland are also great actors whose talents are wasted in the film. Farrell plays completely against his sexy image and is almost unrecognizeable as another horrible boss.<br /><br />Charlie Day is the dental assistant being sexually harassed by the overly sexual dentist played by Jennifer Aniston. I had never seen Charlie Day before and I enjoyed his character at first until he started sounding more and more like Bobcat Goldthwait in his mutterings. Another actor wasted in this film.<br /><br />In the beginning as we are introduced to characters, there is a freeze-frame and words describing the character appear on screen. It's a silly trick that maybe have been novel in the 1970's. It only seemed to lower the seriousness of the film.<br /><br />I had hoped for a silly and funny movie but it turned out to be a silly and stupid film.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|First, Chris Eccelston had a glorious season getting Dr. Who back off to at great start in the reboot. He brought both a darkness and a joy to the role that no other actor has achieved, before or since, in my opinion. He's a guy with a look that would convince anyone or anything they didn't really want to mess with him.<br /><br />Billie Piper made instant fans with her portrayal of Rose ... innocent, loyal, and brave as the Dr's ubiquitious boon companion.<br /><br />The plots in season one were fresh and inventive while at the same time embracing elements of the cheesiness of earlier special effects and props from the previous, low budget series. The Darloks were shined up a bit, but remained true to their earlier steam machine incarnations. The first season hooked us in and we haven't stopped watching yet, despite the fact that I think the next two actors were small steps down each time.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000VZIOCK|5.0|I purchased this album on CD when it first came out in 02' and I listened to it non-stop for a over a year.  Nine years later, I still love this album.  Queens of the Stone Age's sound is very unique, and this album contains some of their best work.    When I give guitar lessons to younger teenagers, I always give them this album to ingest.  And they all come back thanking me and telling me how much they love this album.    This album was QOTSA at it's all-time best because of their line-up.  The legendary Dave Grohl was on drums, and Mark Lanegan sang on a few great songs.  Also, this album had Nick Oliveri on bass, who in my opinion, was just as important of a contributor to this band as Josh Homme.  Post-Oliveri QOTSA albums just didn't have the same spark or quality.    If you are a fan of good music, get this album - It's timeless.

Guess I'll put my Kindle away and head to the library.
B004GGM444|5.0|Are you like me, just starting to listen to dubstep and not sure who to get?  I would highly recommend Skrillex as a starting off point.  The awesome album cover graphics caught my eye and the music samples hooked me.  He seems to have an original fresh style, yet all the tracks have their own unique differences.  My only complaint would be the lack of overall songs on the album, but for the 5 dollar price tag, it was well worth it.  Favorite tracks were \\"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\\" & \\"Scatta\\"

0307593312|2.0|Aomame escapes from a traffic jam in order to go to an appointment by leaving the highway through an emergency exit door meant for drivers who have been in accidents and need to leave on foot. After going through this door she starts to notice subtle differences, policemen wear different uniforms and carry bigger guns, people refer to huge news stories that she doesn't remember having heard about, and there appears to be two moons in the sky. Aomame starts to call this new world 1Q84, and she tries to search for a way back to her normal 1984. Meanwhile Tengo, a classmate of Aomame's from elementary school, helps a mysterious teenager, Fukaeri, write a book, Air Chrysalis, about the cult that she used to belong to and the \\"little people\\" who come out of the mouth of dead goats (and sleeping girls). Air Chrysalis becomes a best seller and causes the cult and the \\"little people\\" to come after Tengo and Fukaeri. Aomame and Tengo's actions bring them into 1Q84 which becomes an increasingly violent and dangerous world, in order to leave they need to find each other and the way out.  1Q84 is similarily dreamy to Murakami's other books but much longer, and as many other reviewers have pointed out- very editable. I have seen several other people suggest that if you like Murakami you shouldn't read this book. I have to agree, this book wasn't nearly as enjoyable as his other books. I would much rather have reread The Wind-up Bird Chronicles or Kafka on the Shore. Besides the length, and the excessively long sections in which various characters are looking for each other by sitting in their apartments and waiting for the other character to just show up.   Violence against women and children is a large theme throughout the book. The character who perpetrates the most vicious, awful attacks is reprieved from guilt by a convoluted explanation that is incredibly frustrating and insulting.  I really wanted to like this book- I preordered it at the beginning of May! I am very sad todislike it because Murakami is one of my favorite authors. He has many fantastic books that are worth your time to read. Please read one of his earlier books rather than this one, I don't want someone to get the wrong impression of Murakami from this book.

0307454541|4.0|Very interesting and odd book but good. It is a different kind of thriller than I am used to. It is a tad slow but it continued to keep my interest through the end and very intersted in continuing with the series in the near future. I picked this up for a vacation read, getting through the 600+ pages in just 4 days. It is definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of thrillers. It does have some parts which are a bit tough to read so if you are of the faint of heart or squirmish with some issues, might want to pass it up.
0805079831|5.0|Drougas Books is a small very customer friendly family owned book store where customers can deal direct with the owners to resolve issues unlike the larger superstores out there. Give Drougas a chance and you won't be disappointed.   Regarding the bood \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" it is a great read with incredible insight and detail. It paints a picture of societal elite that makes you want to turn away in disbelief, but because it is real life...you can't. I'm only read the first couple of chapters so far, but I am eagerly anticipating the next. It is an honest, historical look at how whole countries are used as pawns on a chess board and the citizens are treated worse than cattle in a slaughter house.    Sincerely,  Michael  A very satisfied customer

This book will teach you the proper way to kill a zombie, how to prepare for an attack, the proper mode of transportation, how to hunt them, and many more subjects. I don`t know why this book is considered a humor book: it can save your life. Although I didn`t purchase this book on Amazon, I love typing reviews. In fact, I typed this whole review on my Kindle Keyboard. A must read. Get it now before the apocalypse destroys Internet shopping.
1932100660|5.0|I love the information this book gives. It is frightening to know our gov purposely allows us to be poisoned and gives us false information that concerns our health. This is a must read for every American adult.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Considering the access given - the book is naturally a good collection of facts. The synthesis of these facts into a meaningful narrative on the creativity and business skills is not that great (although - it is also not a disaster as some have implied). It is worth asking as to why the second coming was so much better. There are hints - but not a cogent theory. It seems that at Pixar jobs learned to give up control on the details ... and at NeXT he learned that people will pay a premium - but only upto a point. Both of which he brought back to Apple - in addition to his natural and longstanding design aesthetics and integrity and a strong belief in vertical integration and a control of user experience and ecosystem.<br /><br />The personal side is presented much better and clearly shows the many rough edges he had - but also shows him to be surprisingly human and humane in other ways. The last years are poignantly presented - and that part alone is worth the price.<br /><br />Overall - worth reading. Better than the Einstein book.

B0015AARJI|2.0|It always kills me how much Sony charges for their accessories.  It's got to be triple the amount they are actually worth, but the good news is that you can by the same product for a lot less from 3rd party manufacturers.  Sony will try to scare you into not buying accessories that don't have \\"Sony\\" branded on them with threats of cancelling the warranty, but the reality is that the 3rd products not only work just as well 90% of the time, they often work BETTER and are more reliable!  If I could buy a clone PS3 I would buy it in a minute.  I've had such deplorable customer support from Sony that I shutter to even think of buying another overpriced Sony product.  Unfortunately, I can only get a PS3 from Sony but I can buy better accessories at less painful prices from other manufacturers.  There is virtually no difference between this controller for the PS3 and the controller for the PS2 other than firmware limitations keeping the PS2 controller from working on the PS3, yet the price is substantially higher.  Try Logitech.  Very reliable, better feel and a lower price.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I just finished watching this product. It's amazing, the crew, the effects, the drama......everything! I highly recommend this product to everyone that looks to have a good time!!
1451648537|4.0|This was a fascinating read about a true visionary of our times.  I would highly recommend it, however, in the end it was woefully incomplete.  You read of all his accomplishments but never get to the man himself.  There is almost nothing in there from Lauren (his wife of 20 + years) who could shed the most light on what Steve was truly made of.  I feel this was a well written documentary but leaves the reader not knowing Steve Jobs any better than when the reading began.  I truly hope his sister Mona writes her own book; the two would balance each other out to perfection.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I first saw this on Netflix and then became rather obsessed with it and had to order the DVD. I also read the book after seeing the movie for the first time so I can actually tell how good the adaptation is. This is just a perfect movie about love, Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were made for this part. Jamie Bell is not really a good fit, considering how in the book he was described as being much taller and more attractive...but I digress. The cinematography is incredible, along with the set and costumes. I wish it was longer, even watching the deleted scenes makes you feel unsatisfied - but it's based on a 500 page novel so I suppose that was bound to happen. Chick lit and love movies are not my typical genre but I really enjoyed this one - highly recommend.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I've never posted a review of anything, but because I love this app so much I decided I should. I used to love weatherbug because of its great alerts feature and radar, but when I saw this for the APP of the DAY, I considered getting it. I read the reviews and came very close to not downloading because of complaints of crashing and freezing, but it was free so I knew I could uninstall if it didnt work, and not lose any money. I had one minor problem after install that I was able to fix after reading another review, thanks BTW.<br />I LOVE THIS APP!!! It does everything weatherbug and accuweather did and then some! Plus it does all the regular stuff so much better! Some weather apps have problems locating my zip code because I live in a small town; however, Elecont found it with no problem. I hope somebody who is interested in getting the app will read my review; disregard the negative ones, and get it. I'm glad I got this when it was App of the Day, since I'm cheap, but knowing what I know now this app is worth the charge.
061891868X|5.0|Lee Smolin has tackled a formidable foe: the scientific establishment. But his analysis offers considerable weight, coming from within the establishment itself. The book begins with a look at the history of science and unification. A longer and more technical section on string theory follows, which is harder to follow, but still expertly explained. To me the last part of the book is the most valuable, with chapters such as \\"How Do You Fight Sociology?\\" establishing the current crisis in physics as a decidedly human problem. String theory has become a self-sustaining phenomenon, sucking up academic resources as it becomes increasingly \\"mainstream,\\" at the expense of more risky but potentially revolutionary research into ideas by the so-called \\"seers.\\" As Smolin writes in the chapter \\"What Is Science?\\": \\"To think deeply and independently and try to formulate one's own ideas is a poor strategy for success. Physics thus finds itself unable to solve its key problems.\\" Luckily we have physicists such as Smolin to tell his colleagues -- and the world on the whole -- the truth.
1451648537|3.0|I have to admit that I was never a huge fan of Steve Jobs.  In fact, he never really registered on my radar and I guess part of the reason for this is that technology is something that simply seems to be `there' for me.  I never really thought much about how it got there, why or who created it.<br /><br />However, you kind of have to be living under a rock NOT to have heard about Jobs in the last year or so.  It seems as though his name was everywhere, despite the fact that he was physically removing himself more and more.<br /><br />All of this, of course, brings me to his biography.  I found myself curious about certain aspects of his life and thought it would be a great idea to find out more about this man.<br /><br />My first reaction when I got the book was wow! This is more than I wanted to know about him.  So, my first comment is that this book is too long.<br /><br />Having said that, however, I will also say that the book, once it gets moving (the pace is slow at the beginning) turns into a fascinating look at what kind of man (and brain) is needed to create what Steve Jobs has created.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was blown away with the way his mind worked and the biographer did a wonderful job of showing us just how quirky this man could be.  Yet, at the same time, he was a control freak who needed a survey before deciding on his bride (kind of creepy actually).<br /><br />Of course, this biography was incredibly honest which went a long way for me - I have always said that if you want the story of your life to be made public, it better be true and non-censored and Jobs did not seem to have a problem with this.<br /><br />The pictures were okay and I especially enjoyed the ones with his family.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great read.  I walked away with a far better idea of who this man was.
0385738773|4.0|I did enjoy this book, if only because it held my interest enough to not want to put  it down. I felt like the second book in the series was my favorite but this one was somewhat lacking. I am not sure if I can put my finger on what is bothering me. One thing is that the plot revolves around the existence of a certain organization that i don't remember having been mentioned before. It seems to wrap up most of the major plot lines, butnot all. In the end i would recommend the series, just don't think to much about some of the finer details of the plot because some of it makes no sense!
B005O64VH8|5.0|I've enjoyed past cds by Secret Garden and this is along the same. But I must say that I bought this one when I heard that Moya Brennan was on one of the songs. I buy all of her cds and the song she sings, DREAM, is fantastic!! Its a work of beautiful singing with inspiring lyrics and music. Another great song is POWERED BY NATURE and FIONNUALA'S COOKIE JAR will get you dancing or at least, foot tapping. The rest of the songs are those that will enable the listener to just sit back and relax and let the music take you away.
B004HO6I2E|2.0|Yep, they did a change up--replacing a potentially funny, thoughtful comedy with this inept idiocy. Honestly, this tripe must have been written by relatives of someone within the Hollywood system (hey, I guess they have to do something to pay for their Mercedes). You can encase a turd in 24 carrot gold but it's still, at it's core, a turd.<br /><br />If you want a comedy with funny scenes with a script that makes sense you need to look somewhere else because this one has the consistency of thin, poor tasting gruel. It's like the writers (and even the director) took a look at \\"Freaky Friday\\" and tapped each scene for \\"inspiration\\" while drug or stoned. The director likewise must have been on some mind altering substance since the story has little to no continuity and strains credability (even for a fantasy comedy like this).<br /><br />To be fair, there are a couple of scenes that are very funny including a scene where Jason Bateman tries to feed the twins and one of then throws knives at him. I gave the film an extra star for this funny scene but the rest...well let's just say that I hope if the world ends tomorrow THIS isn't the only example of film comedy that survives. The bulk of the film though seems like it was written by a monkey at a typewriter and then the scenes were thrown into the air and randomly stapled together.<br /><br />If these things matter to you the Blu-ray looks positively stunning at times.<br /><br />Bateman and Reynolds are, as always, appealing even when they play repulsive characters. The cast, sadly, beyond the stars isn't really given a lot to do except look pretty, flash their breasts (in the case of the women)and smack their hand into their head as the main characters do something else stupid. The feel good tone of the ending is poorly handled and, well, seems tacked on from a totally different (better) movie even if it is cliched and overly sentimental.<br /><br />I've given this two stars because there are a couple of funny scenes but if a couple of funny scenes passes for quality filmmaking today, we've witnessed the nadir of American film comedy.ty filmmaking today, we've witnessed the nadir of American film comedy.

0393064476|2.0|I rate this book 2 stars, because Amazon forces you to give one, and i found The Swerve perversely enjoyable, like the proverbial car wreck, or the example that recurs in the book, a ship wreck.  It is a work of hagiography of Epicurus, Lucretius, Poggio Bracciolini.  All you need to know to correctly interpret this book is that the The Swerve concludes with a 2 page paean to Thomas Jefferson--the founder of the Democrat party.  You will enjoy this book if you like your 'scholarship' with good guys in white hats, the progressives, ancient, medieval, and moderns, bravely shooting it out in the academic OK Corral with the dreaded, dreadful conservative traditionalists in black hats, ancient, medievel and modern, almost always Christian, usually Catholic.  In fact, I offer a simpler test.  Think of the word \\"medieval\\" for a nano-second.  If to you the word instantly neutrally means 'the centuries between 450 and 1500', then you probably will find this book to have too many faults to be taken seriously.  If, however, the word 'medieval' conjures in you images of ecclesiatiscally-robed inquisitorial torturers trying to exterminate The Truth which just Must be passed down from the Ancients to the Moderns, then you will luv this work of adversarial, ideologically-driven drivel.  (Do i have an ideology?  Sure; but then again, i don't claim to be an impartial, objective employee of Veritas university.)  An example of Professor Greenblatt's toying with the truth can be found on pp. 16 and 118, where he casually asserts that his intellectual opponents thought that curiosity was a sin, even a mortal one.  [booo, hisss]  To the extent that was ever proposed, it is not true now, but let's not let the facts get in the way of our bias.  I think it is fair to say, whether contemporary Christians know it or not, that Sts. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas are representative of the vast majority of Western Christian thought.  Did they teach that *all* curiosity was evil?  No, of course not, if for no other reason than they were both very curious men.  But they were against 'bad' curiosity.  (I know, it is intellectually neanderthal to dare to call anything 'bad.')  What is bad curiosity?  Curiosity undertaken just to take pride in knowledge.  When it takes an intellectually qualified person away from constructive study, to popular minutiae.  When the curiosity thinks it has rationalized all mysteries, that the scholar is the god, instead of God.  When the curiosity is only a bunch of Jeopardy-worthy factoids, so that they don't connect with the Fact of Creation.  The whole book employs the word 'swerve' with no more rational foundation than a faithful Christian would the word 'miracle.'  In general, in the big-print text, Mr. Greenblatt often smashes the Foe, the Church, but then admirably concedes the Church some credit, in the small print footnotes.  The Swerve is more like a medieval whodunnit, such as The Name of the Rose or The Da Vinci Code, than a straight-forward work of scholarship, but then again, the former sell so much better than the latter.  On pp. 11-12, Greenblatt predictably lauds the modern change to \\"...question authorities and challenge received doctrines...\\";  but do you ever notice how furious the moderns get, e.g. Greenblatt, if you question them and their received doctrines?  Incredibly, when summarizing Epicurius' thought on p. 75, Greenblatt writes \\". . .atoms and void and nothing else, atoms and void and nothing else, atoms and void and nothing else...\\"  Sounds like a cheerleader's chant to me.  In conclusion, we know that a book's author does not create its title, but the subtitle \\"how the world became Modern\\" acts as if the word 'Modern' was a non-controversial synonym for the word 'good.'  That is an accurate synopsis for the content of The Swerve.
